Why, I've not done anything to deserve this kind of treatment?\" Bayley yells as she stands, demanding an explanation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber shrugs her shoulders \"You're right you haven't done anything to piss me off like some of the other girls, but of the people here tonight, only you have the potential to give me trouble\" she explains, Bayley trying to figure out how to take what now feels like a very messed up, backhanded compliment as to her own skills<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explain the shrinking\" she states, basically repeating the previous questions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I shrunk you for fun as well as so I don't have to fight you and I can win this tournament easy. How does my sandal feel at your size, it's rather comfortable to me but I'm the big powerful giantess so I might be missing something\" she teases, watching the tiny woman loose her mind when she realises  she really is standing on the right sandal of her fellow Diva<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-w-what do you have planned for me? Crush me like a bug?\" she asks, cursing the slight stutter caused by fear before swallowing it down, for once Ember's thunderous laughs makes her feel slightly better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no fun in that, if that was all I wanted to do I wouldn't have waited for you to wake up, instead you're going to stick with me for the evening, getting a front row seat to my victory, Well front row may be the wrong words for it\" she stands up fully and Bayley watches her slip her left foot into the other sandal then raise her right<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh shit' she thinks before running as fast as her tiny legs could carry, but Ember easily grabs her with her toes, scrunching them around her form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I feel a little bad for taking you out of the tournament so easily Bay, so it's only fair you fight for the right to avoid being crushed under my feet, or not\" she teases, rubbing her toes together as well as on Bayley, then moving her to the back of her sandal and sliding the front of her foot into the shoe, her heel hovering over the now spread eagled woman like a mountain about to fall \"This fight was over before it begun, time to be eclipsed by my feet\" Ember says,[<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fansrule.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ember-moon.png?w=1200&amp;h=627&amp;crop=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://fansrule.files.wordpress.com/201...</a>] clearly enjoying herself way too much before Bayley's vision is blacked out by her dark sole<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Diva giggles then walks from one side of the room to the other and back, as she thought Bayley was large enough to be felt but still small enough to not be a distraction, at least so far, when it came to he fights anything could happen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Bayley finds herself stuck to Ember's foot as the Diva moves from simple sandals to her actual fighting boots, to the shrunken woman's horror and apprehension<br>\r\n2) The woman's struggles start to get distracting, so Ember moves her from her feet to her ass, worried moving her to her breasts was just asking for the woman to be found, get lost or escape none of which she wanted for her little pet<br>\r\n3) The feel of tiny on skin is too much, leading Ember to tape Bayley to the underside of her shoe, the brunette getting crushed between the larger woman and the ground, but without an insole to cushion some of the blow</span></div></div>",

Brie was about to protest a little more when she saw the small smirk on the corner of Nikki\u2019s lips. Rolling her eyes, she groaned, \u201cNikki! You\u2019re such a pain in the ass sometimes.\u201d Brie grimaced and turned around to rummage through her bag for her cell phone while her sister just giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was only teasing Brie, chill,\u201d Nikki said, kicking her sister in the butt playfully. <br>\r\nBrie swatted at her sister\u2019s shoe, pushing the tip of her toe away without looking while she continued, \u201cYou know that today\u2019s already a pain for me. I just wanted you not to mess with me for a few hours! Is that really so much\u2026to\u2026Nikki?\u201d Brie couldn\u2019t hear her sister\u2019s giggling anymore and braced herself, waiting for another kick to her butt or some kind of annoyance\u2026but nothing came. \u201cNikki?\u201d Brie asked, turning around. Nothing. A low, frustrated groan left Brie\u2019s lips as the brunette rubbed her temples with the hams of her hands and whined, \u201cNikki! Come on, I\u2019m not in the mood for these games!\u201d No response. \u201cFine! But I\u2019m not going to play along,\u201d Brie called out, expecting her sister to jump out from behind one of the rows of lockers at any moment. When no answer came, Brie stamped her foot in frustration and grumbled under her breath, \u201cStupid\u2026I fucking ask for one day without messing with me and she pulls this shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Brie! H-Hey! Brie, stop it! I\u2019m here!\u201d Nikki screamed at the top of her lungs, waving like a madwoman, \u201cI\u2019m heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrie! For Fuck\u2019s sake look down!\u201d the Bella shouted at her sister with no response\u2026not that anyone would really blame Brie. After all\u2026who in their right mind would be paying attention to the tiny squeak of a bug before their feet? No matter how much Nikki waved, screamed, or jumped it didn\u2019t matter\u2026without Brie even noticing\u2026.Nikki had become a gnat on the floor in front of her sister\u2019s now colossal sneakered feet (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/zol3ygi-1483271535-800.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-conten...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMMNIT NIKKI, I DON\u2019T HAVE TIME FOR THIS,\u201d Brie\u2019s voice thundered from high above as Nikki cowered below, hands pressed tight against her ears to keep them from bursting. Nikki had gone from being the big sister to the \u201clittle\u201d sister in a split-second\u2026actually, it was more like the \u201cbug sister\u201d as she found herself standing in the shadow of Brie\u2019s sneaker. Despite her reputation as \u201cfearless\u201d in the ring, Nikki was clearly a few seconds away from pissing herself in freight. Her hair was a frazzled mess, her skin was pale, sweat was dripping down her forehead and for all her years of performing in front of crowds of thousands, she couldn\u2019t help but feel like she had a series case of stage fright as her whole body vibrated with anxious energy. The tiny wrestling star felt every cell in her body begging her to turn and run while her head kept screaming at her to call for Brie one more time, like any second now her skyscraper of a sister would look down and recognize her on the floor. Despite Nikki\u2019s wishes, Brie still seemed to be as pissed off as she was a second ago; pulling her gym-shirt on over her head, the Bella sister looked at herself in the mirror and posed a little as she grumbled to herself\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was thrown to the ground thanks to Brie swiveling on her heel to face the mirror. Her sister\u2019s house-sized heel slammed down right in front of her, missing her by a fraction of an inch. Nikki\u2019s face flushed bright red as she sat, shivering on the floor\u2026in a growing, warm puddle. For the first time since she\u2019d been a little kid\u2026Nikki had just wet herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of her sister\u2019s plight, Brie struck another pose in front of the full-length mirror and muttered to herself, \u201cNOT TOO BAD I GUESS,\u201d she said, switching which foot she had her weight on (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3a/e3/02/3ae302a351006c5b83310ca6e4b0545c--divas-wwe-brie-bella.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3a/e3/02/3ae30...</a>). \u201cSHIT, WHY\u2019S NIKKI HAVE TO CHOOSE TODAY TO DISAPPEAR ON ME?\u201d Brie whined, unaware of the little droplet of liquid by her right heel\u2026and the very familiar bug in the center of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her gargantuan sister\u2019s heel came down a fraction of an inch in front of her, Nikki finally gave in to her instincts; running on pure adrenaline, the Diva flipped onto her stomach and began sprinting in the opposite direction. It didn\u2019t matter that it was her sister, there was no way in hell Nikki was going to die screaming for her sister\u2019s attention at her feet. She just needed some distance! If she could put some space between herself and Brie then she\u2019d be able to think of\u2026a\u2026counter\u2026. A small thought flicked through Nikki\u2019s mind, \u2018Why did it just get darker?\u2019 Breaking every rule of fleeing from danger, Nikki looked over her shoulder\u2026and came face-to-foot with Brie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie had taken just a half-step back to try and see herself a little better in the mirror. Examining herself from the side, she slowly lifted her right leg onto her toes and admired her leg\u2026clueless that her \u201cbig\u201d sister was trapped under the heel of her planted left foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/photos/file/198297/brie-bella-baby-bump-gym.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://images-production.global.ssl.fas...</a>). Swiveling on her heel, Brie looked at herself in the mirror one more time before deciding that the outfit she\u2019d chosen for today wasn\u2019t really the one she\u2019d been looking for. Seeing Nikki\u2019s bag on the other bench, Brie smirked and softly said under her breath, \u201cShe owes me for vanishing anyway~\u201d Moving with a little skip toward it, the Bella had no clue what she\u2019d just put her little bug-sized sister through\u2026<br>\r\nTHOOOOOM!....THOOOOOM!....THOOOOM!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ears ringing, Nikki was honestly shocked when light filled her vision again. Her stomach was twisted up in painful knots as Nikki\u2019s body reacted to the intense anxiety the only way it knew how\u2026the Bella sister leaned over and hurled from fright after nearly ending up as goo in her sister\u2019s treads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fuck\u2026\u201d Nikki managed to exhale, coughing on the dust and dirt that had gotten into her mouth when Brie\u2019s heel had crashed down\u2026knocking loose whatever dried mud had been stuck in the rubber ridges of the sneaker sole. The last few seconds had felt like they\u2019d lasted an eternity\u2026the wall of rubber had smashed into her face, throwing her to the floor harder than any tackle in the ring had ever managed. What had really shaken her though was the snugness of the rubber walls that flanked her; had she fallen a few inches to the left or right, Nikki knew that her sister\u2019s foot would have torn one of her arms off. In a fraction of a second, Nikki had gone from one of the most recognizable faces in television, to a piece of dirt stuck in her sister\u2019s sneaker sole\u2026and just as easily, she\u2019d fallen back onto the tile floor with other bits of filth\u2026. Brie hadn\u2019t heard her scream for her attention at the start, hadn\u2019t noticed her running, and now had actually stepped on her without noticing anything. It was official\u2026Nikki was a bug\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOLY SHIT, SHE TOTALLY STOLE THIS FROM ME!\u201d Brie said, rummaging through Nikki\u2019s bag while her \u201cbig\u201d sister had a small existential crisis a few tiles away from her. She reclaimed her shirt and tossed it back onto the other bench, determined to find anything else that might have emigrated from her closet. After a few more moments picking through the bag, Brie figured she\u2019d found all she was going to\u2026though she was definitely going to talk to Nikki about taking her things when she found her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For Brie, it was the world\u2019s worst alarm clock. The Bella sister had looked almost like she was dead as she laid out on the worn, leather surface of her current perch\u2026 and the throbbing pain in her head didn\u2019t make her feel any better as consciousness returned (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nTxj4iBaM8s/maxresdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nTxj4iBaM8s/maxre...</a>). She refused to open her eyes, sure that any light would only make the throbbing worse\u2026instead, she began sifting through her hazy memories to try and figure out what had happened to her. The leather under her body felt smooth and worn down\u2026but it definitely wasn\u2019t the material for the main or practice rings. So, injury while in practice was out. She didn\u2019t think it felt like a couch or car-seat. So post-drinking hangover was out. With the throbbing growing worse, Brie reached up to massage her temples\u2026or she would have\u2026if she could move her arms\u2026. \u201cWhat the fu-\u201d Brie said, leaning up until she felt a familiar pressure on her chest that kept her from rising more than a fraction of an inch. Her head slammed back into the leather surface and Brie could have sworn she saw light before her eyes\u2026actually\u2026it was a light before her eyes. One that was high up in the air\u2026it looked like the kind of light you\u2019d see in the entrance to a house\u2026but the scale was off. The thing looked hu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of pain surged through Brie\u2019s head that she swore would have knocked her out again. As the pain faded, the memories began flooding back\u2026 Brie remembered now. This insanity all started a few hours ago in the gym locker room\u2026when she suddenly found herself the size of a bug\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOM! BABOOOM! BABOOOOOOM! BABOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie squeaked and pressed her body against the cold metal pole that supported the bench she\u2019d been typing her shoelaces on a mere moment ago. The beautiful Bella sister didn\u2019t know what had happened to her or why\u2026all she knew was that one second she\u2019d been thinking about what she was going to do for dinner tonight\u2026and a second later she was staring at one of the screws bolting the bench to the floor\u2026only the metal bit was wider than she was tall! She tried her best to get her bearings, but the sudden tremors that shook Brie to her bones were the thing on her mind right now. With her arms and legs wrapped around the cold steel, she waited for King-Kong or Godzilla to suddenly appear given the strength of the quakes\u2026what she got made her jaw drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNN\u2026.. BABOOM! BABOOOM! BABOOOOOM! BABOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK, I\u2019M GONNA KILL WHOEVER WRACKED THE WEIGHTS THAT WAY,\u201d a very familiar voice thundered in Brie\u2019s ears. For Brie it seemed like this was a nightmare that she wanted desperately to wake up from\u2026but as the tremors grew stronger, the Bella sister had her worst fear confirmed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me\u2026\u201d Brie said, feeling like she was going to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toe of a massive, white shoe slammed down just a few inches in front of Brie, knocking the tiny woman off her perch and onto the grimy tile floor. She was about to sit up when her eyes caught sight of a massive shadow coming down very quickly. Terrified, Brie balled up and braced herself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie had been tossed up in the air and slammed back down on the tile floor in a heap. She thought it was a miracle she hadn\u2019t broken a bone in the process, but as she slowly got up and looked in the direction of the meteor, her stomach dropped. Stretched out in front of her was a wall of grey and brown\u2026Brie arched her head up and felt sick to her stomach\u2026she was staring at the crotch of an exhausted, sweating Sasha (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2016/10/30e2c95d0c39a5cf-600x400.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2016...</a>). The bossy Diva looked like a true goddess to Brie\u2026her smooth skin seemed to shimmer as the lights in the locker-room made the beads of sweat running down her body shimmer. Sasha grabbed the towel around her neck and pulled it down to dab at her face and neck; as she did, the curtain of fabric kicked up a gust of wind that sent Brie tumbling head-over-heels again (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJT3VYHXwI8/maxresdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJT3VYHXwI8/maxre...</a>). Brie slid to a stop, the skin on her stomach burning from the friction\u2026her heart was hammering like crazy as she pushed herself back onto her back, exhausted (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cb/1c/c2/cb1cc2d33e4a1c3d3a7d2f9fd76df9b8--brie-bella-nikki-bella.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cb/1c/c2/cb1cc...</a>). If even a towel falling could send Brie flying onto her ass like this, how the hell was she supposed to get Sasha\u2019s attention?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPAIN IN THE ASS,\u201d Sasha said, dabbing at her forehead again as she swung the towel back around her neck. She hadn\u2019t intended to go so hard today for her workout, but given how annoyed she was because of the shitty night\u2019s sleep she\u2019d had, Sasha felt like the little extra might help burn off some tension. All it really did was make her too hot and tired to move. She could have sworn she felt her shorts sticking to the tile floor, but Sasha brushed the thought aside\u2026she\u2019d cool down here for a few minutes before getting changed to go home. Without rising from the ground, she reached behind her for her gym back and lazily began digging through it for her street clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sasha was busy digging in her bag, one of her rivals was facing a huge trial at the toe of her right foot. Scared shitless, Brie had nervously approached the front of Sasha\u2019s foot. She\u2019s tried thinking of any other possible way to get found, but nothing else honestly seemed as likely to get her found than if Brie managed to get onto the vast expanse of white that was Sasha\u2019s sneaker. If the Boss looked down just once while untying her shoes, then Brie was sure she could get her attention. The toe of Sasha\u2019s sneaker was thankfully scuffed up enough that Brie had several handholds to choose from...but not a lot of time to get this job done. Thankfully, Sasha seemed to be staying still for now as she lazily fished through her bag for the set of street clothes she\u2019d brought with her, but Brie didn\u2019t know how long this peace would last. If Sasha moved this foot forward right now, Brie knew she\u2019d end up getting crushed between the toe of Sasha\u2019s sneaker and the metal pole. Without wasting a second, Brie began pulling herself from groove to groove, scaling the tip of Sasha\u2019s sneaker in a solid 20 seconds; the black rubber gave way to white leather that Brie willingly threw herself against. She kissed the sneaker\u2019s tip, thankful to be done with the first hurdle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie\u2019s break was interrupted though as Sasha groaned, \u201cFUUUUUCK, I KNOW I PUT IT IN HERE SOMEWHERE\u2026 SHIT, FINE, I\u2019LL FIND IT LATER.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie\u2019s eyes went wide as she looked up and immediately felt incredible empathy for any ant she\u2019d ever found in her kitchen. She\u2019d always wondered why the little things froze whenever she found them\u2026now she knew why. Under the weight of Sasha\u2019s gaze, Brie felt like she\u2019d been frozen solid (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/8d/5f/14/8d5f14d2a715ab591c9b8db08881fc19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/236x/8d/5f/14/8d5f1...</a>). At least\u2026until Sasha\u2019s fingers passed by her and reached for the laces of the other shoe. Fear was replaced by humiliation as Brie realized she wasn\u2019t even big enough to warrant Sasha\u2019s attention at a glance. She\u2019d need to fight if she wanted the giant woman to take notice of the bug-sized Bella.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Sasha was busy dealing with the laces on the neighboring shoe, Brie realized she\u2019d need to get closer to the laces on this shoe\u2026she was terrified by the idea that Sasha would miss her while untying this shoe\u2026that she\u2019d fall to the floor and be left here alone till someone else came by. Although she was exhausted from scaling the tip of Sasha\u2019s sneaker, Brie knew she couldn\u2019t afford to sit and rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the other shoe, a very tired Sasha was having more trouble than she thought getting the laces of her sneaker undone. Growling a little, she finally managed to undo the stupidly tight knot, but at the cost of ruining her manicure. She let out an exasperated moan and shook her head\u2026she\u2019d deal with that later. Pulling at the laces, she finally had them loosened and turned to her other foot. The Boss brushed her hair back once again and leaned forward to start untying her right sneaker when she thought she saw something moving across the toe of her sneaker. Cocking her head, Sasha rubbed her eyes and flexed her toes in their sneakers, hearing the groan of rubber\u2026and what sounded like a very soft scream\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brie slammed face-first into the white leather surface of Sasha\u2019s sneaker after the sudden undulation of the ground beneath her, she heard her co-worker-turned-titan boom from above, \u201cWHAT THE HELL IS THAT?\u201d Despite being in pain, Brie looked up and saw that Sasha had finally taken notice of her\u2026with one\u2026tiny\u2026problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive Diva\u2019s face contorted slightly in disgust as Brie realized that although Sasha now saw her, the giantess thought that the Bella sister was nothing more than a common bug clinging to her foot! Sasha sneered and brushed her hair aside while muttering under her breath; Brie\u2019s heart stopped when she saw Sasha move her right hand to wipe out the insect with the pad of her thumb (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pa1.narvii.com/5878/9e823639e6457aed44528aabaa10d1921d53df57_hq.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://pa1.narvii.com/5878/9e823639e6457...</a>). Brie pissed herself and immediately began waving up at Sasha, screaming at the top of her lungs! \u201cS-Sasha! Wait! Stop, please I\u2019m not a bug! It\u2019s Brie! P-Please hang on, it\u2019s me! I\u2019m not a bug! I\u2019m Brie! Sasha please, don\u2019t do this!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie dove out of the way just in time as Sasha\u2019s thumb came down right where she\u2019d been a second prior. The giantess began grinding her finger back and forth, thinking she\u2019d caught the bug\u2026and while she wasn\u2019t killing Brie, she\u2019d definitely scared the Bella sister shitless. Brie flipped onto her stomach and began crawling back toward the tip of Sasha\u2019s sneaker when the giantess withdrew her thumb and saw that she\u2019d missed the mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOOOH NO, YOU\u2019RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM ME LITTLE BUG,\u201d Sasha said, giggling as she reached forward with her index finger and thumb, ready to pinch the little bug to bits between her digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie was crying as she almost slipped on the rough leather, \u201cSasha! Please just let me go! I won\u2019t bother you or anything, I\u2019ll wait for someone else! J-Just let me go! Please don\u2019t hurt me! Don\u2019t hurt me, don\u2019t hurt me, don\u2019t hurt me! N-No! Noooooo! Sasha sto-\u201d The air was squeezed out of Brie\u2019s lungs as Sasha\u2019s fingers came together, nearly crushing the tiny Bella\u2019s ribcage in the process (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/70/b2/b9/70b2b9ecde19e9b530dffd3efd641e4c--brie-bella-nikki-bella.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/70/b2/b9/70b2b...</a>). Brie began wriggling like crazy as the two walls of flesh threatened to squish her at any moment. For a moment, Brie thought that this was it\u2026Sasha was going to press her fingers together and Brie would burst like a tiny grape\u2026no one would know what happened to her\u2026 The pressure began to build\u2026it would be any second now, Brie thought as the pain grew more intense! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to pass out, Brie heard Sasha\u2019s voice boom, \u201cNOW LET\u2019S SEE WHAT THE HELL KINDA FREAKY BUG YOU ARE,\u201d as her body began to rise rapidly into the air. Before Brie knew it, she was hovering before the large brown eyes of Sasha Banks\u2026the woman who\u2019d nearly killed her several times now without knowing it. Brie began to cry\u2026she\u2019d have shouted but Sasha was still crushing her ribs; hoping beyond all hope, Brie prayed Sasha recognized the bruised Bella as something more than a bug\u2026 and her wish came true\u2026 \u201cBRIE?!?! IS THAT REALLY YOU?! OH MY FUCKING GOD WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!\u201d Sasha exclaimed (nearly deafening Brie in the process) before dropping the Bella into the palm of her free hand. Splayed out on the endless expanse of skin, Brie looked up at the\u2026excited\u2026face of Sasha\u2026she was found, but the look in Sasha\u2019s eyes wasn\u2019t making her feel any more comfortable (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nrWwCEKihTg/maxresdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nrWwCEKihTg/maxre...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie tried to call up, but felt a sharp pain in her sides; Sasha might not have crushed her ribcage, but she definitely cracked or bruised a majority of her ribs. Still, she fought back the pain and screamed up at the top of her lungs, \u201cI don\u2019t know! Please! Sasha, you have to help me! I don\u2019t think anyone knows this happened to me, please!\u201d She almost immediately regretted saying that\u2026but hoped Sasha was so absorbed in having a tiny person sitting in the palm of her hand that she hadn\u2019t noticed the slip. If she had, Brie couldn\u2019t see a trace of recognition on the billboard-sized face looming over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP BRIE. SORRY, YOU\u2019RE JUST SO LITTLE! IT\u2019S HARD TO HEAR YOU,\u201d Sasha boomed, suddenly shifting her head to the side so her ear was facing Brie. The wave of hair whipped up a gust that knocked Brie flat on her ass again and Sasha had not even noticed. Instead, she was still digging through her bag with a free hand while she waited for Brie to answer.<br>\r\nBrie slowly got to her feet and stared into the dark hole of Sasha\u2019s ear canal\u2026she took a deep breath and hollered, \u201cSasha, please, I don\u2019t know what happened to me but I need you to help me! You have to take me to a doctor or someone who\u2019ll know what to do!\u201d There was a brief moment of silence that hung heavily in the air. For a second, Brie thought Sasha didn\u2019t hear her\u2026the Bella took another deep breath and shouted, \u201cSasha! Please! You\u2019re my only hope right now! You have to help m-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK! THWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie covered her ears and curled up into a ball as the sonic assault on her hearing made her sick to her stomach. Wincing, Brie looked in the direction of the shockwaves and saw that Sasha had found her brown sandals and had dropped them on the tile floor. Each one was the size of half a football field to Brie\u2026and that fact alone made her position that much more desperate. If Sasha said no then she\u2019d be fucked\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

WE CAN\u2019T HAVE THAT HAPPEN,\u201d she said as she slowly began to lower Brie down. The Bella sister was so thrilled that Sasha said she\u2019d help that she didn\u2019t even think to question it when Sasha tilted her hand and let Brie off on the well-worn sandals\u2026in fact, she\u2019d thought Sasha just did it so that she could easily lift Brie up next time. Sasha smiled down at Brie and then dug in her bag for something excitedly, giggling in spite of her efforts to keep cool. Finally, her eyes landed on what she wanted. From down below, Brie could hear the sound of something ripping as Sasha\u2019s voice boomed, \u201cIF ANYONE IS GONNA STEP ON YOUR TINY ASS, IT\u2019LL BE ME\u2026\u201d With a speed that Brie\u2019s mind didn\u2019t have a second to react to, Sasha crouched low to the ground\u2026blew Brie down with a puff of air\u2026and slapped a small bit of medical tape down on the tiny thing. \u201cOH YEAH\u2026THAT\u2019S A MUCH BETTER LOOK FOR YOU BRIE!\u201d Sasha giggled as she watched the stunned Bella sister begin to struggle in vain against the sticky strip of tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sasha! Hang on! You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! You can\u2019t do this to me! Stop it! L-Let me go! Let me go now, you crazy fucking bitch!\u201d Brie screamed at the top of her lungs, thrashing impotently against the tape. She was cast in the shadow of the thong of Sasha\u2019s sandal\u2026judging by the slight slope on her right side, Sasha had taped Brie down right next to where the ball of her foot came down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOM!....BOOOM!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie looked back and whimpered as she saw Sasha\u2019s sneakers crash to the ground\u2026only for her sweat-laden gym socks to be thrown over a second later. The air was now heavy with the earthy aroma of Sasha\u2019s sweat as the giantess\u2019 laughter thundered overhead. A shadow fell over Brie as she turned and looked to see Sasha smirking at her from on high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH\u2026I\u2019M GONNA ENJOY THIS\u2026\u201d Sasha said as her soft, smooth, bare sole suddenly eclipsed Brie\u2019s view of her face. Brie screamed at the top of her lungs, but it did nothing to slow the descent until finally\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Sasha slipped on her other sandal and flexed her toes, smirking as she felt a very tiny form squirm just to the side of the ball of her foot. Focusing on that figure, Sasha eased her weight down a little more, seeing how much she could put on Brie before she broke\u2026and to her delight she found that the bug seemed more durable than she\u2019d hoped\u2026that or just to the left of the ball of her foot was enough to keep her captive from getting crushed. Flexing her toes, Sasha rose to her full height and giggled, \u201cOh shit, this is gonna be fun\u2026\u201d (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Mercedes-Kaestner-Varnado-Feet-2719895.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Mercedes-Kaest...</a>). Packing her things quickly, Sasha slung her bag over her shoulder and headed for her car, excited to start learning what her toy was good for when she got it home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile Sasha was walking toward her car, the little Diva stuck to her sandal was in a living hell. Brie couldn\u2019t breathe\u2026between the crushing weight that came down on her with each footfall, the thick and humid air that swirled around her, and the terror that was constricting her chest, Brie was already feeling light-headed by the time Sasha was 10 steps away from the locker room. If the weight of Sasha\u2019s foot bearing down on her wasn\u2019t enough to make Brie feel sick, the added weight from Sasha\u2019s sweat soaking into Brie\u2019s clothing was making things even worse for the little Bella bug. Each step followed the same cycle\u2026Brie would be nearly crushed under the weight of Sasha\u2019s body as it rolled over her\u2026just as the weight seemed like it would become unbearable, it would lift off and she\u2019d be given a change to catch her breath. It never lasted long though as Sasha\u2019s foot would rise into the air and let Brie experience several G\u2019s before finally coming to a stop that threw her against the restraint of tape as though she were clothes-lined by a seatbelt in a speeding car that came to a sudden halt. There was an unnerving moment of stillness that would let Brie examine the bottom of Sasha\u2019s foot\u2026the delicate ridges, the deep wrinkles that were soft and smothering, the bit of dirt that even Sasha herself would probably never notice\u2026. Brie would be snapped out of her trance when she began to fall; her stomach jumped into her throat and she braced herself for what she knew was coming n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA bone would crunch sometimes\u2026or a muscle would be pulled or tighten in an unnatural way that would send a jolt of pain through Brie\u2019s body. Each step Sasha took repeated this horrific cycle. Each step broke Brie in one more way. Each step marinated Brie in a mixture of Sasha\u2019s foot sweat and fear. Each step made Brie less of a person and more of a bug\u2026 Brie began to cry and puckered her lips, planting kiss after kiss to the bottom of Sasha\u2019s sole as she prayed the Diva would feel her offer and relent. Instead, Brie just heard the heavy metal clunk of Sasha\u2019s car door opening. She felt the world tip sideways as Sasha swung her legs into the car\u2026and then the heavy impact as the giantess planted her left foot on the floor and began flexing her toes. Brie might have been spared the gas pedal, but Sasha certainly hadn\u2019t forgotten about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cP-Please\u2026Please let me go Sasha,\u201d Brie cried, giving the giantess\u2019 sweaty sole another kiss. \u201cI-I\u2019ll do anything you tell me! I\u2019ll be fun, just please don\u2019t hurt me anymore!\u201d Brie began to whimper, finding it hard to come up with words in her state\u2026instead she just began kissing and dragging her tongue across the length of Sasha\u2019s sole. The taste of salt and the tinge of dirt stayed on her tongue\u2026a flavor she was terrified would become familiar to her. Little did Brie know though\u2026all of her worship meant nothing. Sasha couldn\u2019t feel a thing the tiny woman did to her sole\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tremor brought Brie back to reality as she looked around to try and figure out what her situation was. Brie didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been underfoot before she\u2019d passed out\u2026but here she was\u2026taped to the insole of Sasha\u2019s sandal and dumped in the entrance to said Diva\u2019s home. Struggling against the restraint, Brie didn\u2019t know that it was all for naught till a deep shadow fell over her\u2026Sasha was back. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

COME ON, IT WASN\u2019T THAT BAD\u2026UNDER THERE, WUSS\u2026\u201d Sasha\u2019s voice thundered as Brie suddenly found her world shifting again; Sasha had apparently knocked the sandal back upright with a simple tap of her big toe. Brie looked up to see Sasha\u2019s imposing form loom above; the Diva was a living skyscraper and seemed to be reveling in the power it gave it her the Bella sister...at least, that\u2019s what Brie gathered from the goosebumps she could see breaking out across Sasha\u2019s body. Brie closed her eyes and braced herself, waiting for the suffocating, warm, weighty force of Sasha\u2019s sole to bear down on her again\u2026but it didn\u2019t happen. She peeked one eye open and felt all the air in her lungs get sucked out\u2026Sasha had crouched low\u2026and brought her smirking face as close to Brie as possible (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/04/01/sashabanks0401151280jpg-d12bf3_1280w.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/04/01/sa...</a>). \u201cHEH\u2026LOOK AT THAT, YOU WERE AWAKE! THEN WHY DIDN\u2019T YOU SAY ANYTHING BRIE? I WAS GETTING WORRIED I MIGHT HAVE BROKEN YA~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie tried to speak, but couldn\u2019t find her voice\u2026not with Sasha leaning in so close. Any time she opened her mouth, all she managed to do was let out a small cry. Obviously, not a single one of these small sounds reached Sasha\u2019s ears, but her massive brown eyes were drinking in the look on Brie\u2019s face. The air vibrated around the little Diva as Sasha purred a little and nibbled on her bottom lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha giggled and tapped next to Brie on the sandal\u2019s insole, making sure her nail came down dangerously close to the Bella\u2019s head. \u201cWHAT\u2019S WRONG? CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE? YOU KNOW\u2026WHEN YOUR BOSS TALKS TO YOU, YOU\u2019RE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND, BRIE. DON\u2019T TELL ME I\u2019M GONNA HAVE TO PUNISH YOU FOR INSUBORDINATION, AM I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie whined and shook her head, trying desperately to find her voice to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha sighed and rolled her eyes before saying, \u201cLOOK BRIE, I TRIED TO BE NICE AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE, BUT IF YOU\u2019RE NOT GOING TO WORK WITH ME, THEN I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH MY TIME THAN TALK TO A GROSS LITTLE BUG LIKE YOU\u2026 BYE-BYE BRIE, SORRY THIS DIDN\u2019T WORK OUT FOR YOU\u2026\u201d Sasha said as she raised her hand and began to bring it down on the little woman taped to her insole (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/sasha-banks-looking-up.png?w=650&amp;h=369\" target=\"_blank\">https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Noooooooooooooooooo! Sasha, don\u2019t!\u201d Brie screamed, closing her eyes and bracing for the end\u2026there was a huge gust of wind, but not pain\u2026no pressure. Slowly, Brie opened her eyes and squeaked as she found her face just an inch away from the palm of Sasha\u2019s palm. The ceiling began to pull away, revealing Sasha\u2019s smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSEE?\u201d Sasha teased, \u201cFROM NOW ON, DON\u2019T MAKE ME HAVE TO DO THIS. IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION, THEN YOU ANSWER IT. NEXT TIME I\u2019M GONNA CRUSH YOU FOR REAL.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie nodded, tears streaming down her face as she fought against the tape a little more frantically. Sasha was fucking crazy and if she couldn\u2019t get away, Brie knew she was going to be killed. Of course, Sasha noticed the struggling and giggled at Brie\u2019s pathetic attempt to get away. She grabbed the sandal in her hand and stood up to her full height as Brie screamed for her attention, \u201cW-Wait! Sasha! Please, if you just let me go I won\u2019t tell anyone about this! Y-You won\u2019t get in trouble!\u201d Sasha just burst out laughing and turned the insole so Brie was staring down at the ground and Sasha\u2019s wiggling bare toes. Brie whimpered\u2026the fall from this height was nothing to joke about. It would be like falling from the top of the Empire State Building, and in that moment, Brie was happy for the tape\u2026till Sasha\u2019s nails began to pick at it. \u201cNo! Sasha, please hang on! Stop it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY GOD! WHAT IS IT WITH YOU? ONE SECOND YOU WANT ME TO LET YOU GO AND THE NEXT YOU WANT ME TO KEEP YOU TIED DOWN? FINE\u2026I\u2019LL LET YOU STAY ON MY SANDAL THEN, BUT NO MORE FAVORS,\u201d Sasha said, smirking as she saw the color drain from Brie\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bella sister was at her wit\u2019s end. Sasha had nearly broken her before even noticing her\u2026it was a miracle she hadn\u2019t died on the sandal\u2026and now Brie had unwittingly given up her one chance at getting freed\u2026or at least that was how Sasha was phrasing it. <br>\r\n\u201cSO\u2026I\u2019VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW THIS HAPPENED TO YOU. I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH FUN IT WOULD BE TO HAVE TONS OF YOU LITTLE BITCHES BUG SIZED WHERE YOU BELONG? THAT WOULD BE PERFECT! ESPECIALLY YOUR SIS\u2026HEHE, HAVING THAT LITTLE BITCH BETWEEN MY TOES FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE\u2026MMMMMMMM, I MEAN, YOU CAN\u2019T GET BETTER THAN THAT,\u201d Sasha purred, waving the sandal back and forth gently. \u201cACTUALLY\u2026I GUESS HAVING YOU DO THAT COULD BE JUST AS GOOD\u2026YEAH, WHY NOT? SOUND FUN BRIE? YOU\u2019RE A LUCKY LITTLE BUG, I\u2019M GONNA LET YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEDGE OF KISSING MY FOOT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I already did that!\u201d Brie screamed, horrified at the prospect of ending up underfoot again. Her outburst drew Sasha\u2019s attention though as the titaness raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDID YOU JUST YELL AT ME?\u201d she asked, the humor draining from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever had been left in Brie\u2019s bladder was now trickling down her leg as she squirmed and squeaked, \u201cN-No, Sasha! I-I wasn\u2019t trying to do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cREALLY? BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU DIDN\u2019T WANT TO KISS MY FOOT\u2026IS THAT THE PROBLEM? YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO KISS MY FEET?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I do!\u201d Brie called, feeling her cheeks burn bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha smiled softly and giggled, \u201cGOOD. BECAUSE THAT\u2019S ALL YOU\u2019RE GOOD FOR, BUG BITCH.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLICK\u201d was the last word Brie heard before the wall of flesh that was Sasha\u2019s foot came down on top of her. The weight nearly crushed her ribs, but just like before Brie managed to hold on. Gritting through the pain, Brie opened her mouth and began kissing and licking Sasha\u2019s sole, whimpering from the sting of her ribs and the humiliation her new \u201cBoss\u201d was heaping on top of her. Opening her mouth wider, Brie began taking long, sloppy licks at the section of flesh that was put before her face\u2026after a few moments, she was openly lapping at Brie\u2019s foot like a kicked dog that wanted to be complimented. The tears began to flow and Brie quickly didn\u2019t know if the salty flavor in her mouth was from her crying or Sasha\u2019s sweat\u2026it didn\u2019t matter any more. She was barely worth more than the dirt she was licking off of Sasha\u2019s foot\u2026and that lesson was slowly being driven into her as the giantess giggled above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha smirked and looked down at her left foot where her former rival was now licking her sole\u2026or so she assumed (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Mercedes-Kaestner-Varnado-Feet-1883307.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Mercedes-Kaest...</a>). Whatever had shrank Brie had made her too small to really feel small things like that, but the knowledge alone that her competitor was now just a flea underfoot was enough to curl Sasha\u2019s toes. The giantess slipped on her other sandal and examined herself in her bikini\u2026she was planning to go out to the pool and sunbathe, possibly have some people over\u2026the real question for her was about what she should do with Brie. While she pondered this question, she slowly lifted her left foot off the ground\u2026and slammed it back down as hard as she could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo getting lazy bug! I should feel you fucking my foot if you\u2019re serious about being my pet,\u201d Sasha announced, smirking as she noticed a slight tickle under her sole\u2026the threat was working. Hell, a few more stomps and Brie might actually make a halfway decent pet. Walking to the sliding glass door, Sasha felt the sun hit her body and flexed her toes as she made her choice. Brie was going to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Last thing she remembered she was in the women\u2019s locker room getting ready for that nights live event and then it all went blank for her. Now she was awake and she was beginning to gather her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? Did I pass out? I don\u2019t really remember...wait where am I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken Brie a few seconds to realize that she had no idea where she was right now. The terrain was a weird mixture of soft yet rough. Then there was the landscape, she couldn\u2019t see much from any direction, in fact she could just about make out some kind of hills or buildings in the distance but they were grey and blurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it...was I drugged or something? And where the hell am I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie once again wondered aloud where she was one with no answer once more, however it wouldn\u2019t be too long until she realised where she was...and she was not gonna like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere the ground around her began to shake, she could barely keep her footing as the earthquake got worst, then in the distance she saw the horizon suddenly begin to move.,.what was happening? Before she could find out a huge gust of wind flew at her and knocked Brie off of her feet finally. Regaining her senses Brie rubbed her back as she looked towards the direction of the wind. Her heart then dropped...there were gigantic feet heading right for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out the place she was in was the women\u2019s locker room! And the terrain she was on was the carpet of the locker room floor! It had finally dawned on Brie that she had either shrunk or she was in the land of giants. But the people that walked on would confirm her theories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Monday night Raws brightest talents had just entered the room. On one hand you had the former multi time women\u2019s champion and the legit boss herself, Sasha Banks. Coming in right behind her was one of NXTs standouts in the last couple of years and one of rows newest stars the war goddess, Ember Moon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women walked into the room with the door slamming shut behind them whilst they causally talked to one another. Meanwhile on the locker room floor poor Brie Bella could feel each tremor get harder, louder and closer! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nboom...Boom...BOOM...BOOM!..<b>BOOM!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie was knocked off her feet again as two pairs of gigantic feet approached her with their owners being unseeable from her diminutive size. It was easy to say that Brie was the size of the smallest of ants...maybe actually closer to flea size. Brie wanted to run but the force of the tremors made her unable to move as she tried to scrambled on the unsteady terrain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile above her<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cMan I\u2019m so excited to be teaming with you and Bayley tonight Sasha it\u2019s gonna be a blast!\u201d </b>Ember said excitedly. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cYeah I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on those no talent Bellas and their lapdog Alicia!\u201d</b> Sasha responded confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women were so engrossed in their conversation that neither noticed the bug sized Bella in their path. Within seconds the two would be within inches of Bug Bella. Brie screamed as a gigantic shadow of Sasha\u2019s boot looked over her and started to come crashing down to the earth. Sasha\u2019s boot...</span></div></div>",

However Becky saw this as an opportunity to her some help and instead of trying to escape the catering tray stayed there so she could attract one of the giantesses attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god! One of them has got to see me, I mean I might be the size of a peanut but even those idiots aren\u2019t blind!\u201d Becky said optimistically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women however hadn\u2019t noticed anything yet as they picked up a plate each and began to choose from the buffet selection. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cMan am I glad they\u2019ve put out a decent spread. I. Am. Star-Ving!\u201d</b> Carmella said exasperated. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cYeah after that rehearsal I could use something good to eat.\u201d</b> Ember replied. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI am so glad it\u2019s my cheat day, I am gonna gorge today ladies haha\u201d </b>Sasha giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three then began to pick various food items from the different trays. Carmella helped herself to some fried chicken, Ember grabbed some fresh vegetables and Sasha started with some carbs. Meanwhile Becky was becoming incredibly impatient as she stood waiting for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan will those morons hurry up and get here, I need help so I don\u2019t end up someone\u2019s snack...oh Crap if I stay on this tray I will end uo someone\u2019s snack!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky realised her errror and began to move off the tray she was in. However just as she climbed out she tripped over the side of the tray and stumbled until she fell face first into a soft gooey substance. Coughing and spluttering Becky wiped away the goo from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww what the hell did I land in?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out she had landed in the tray of potato salad. Attempting to get to her feet Becky found it more difficult that she first imagined as she kept on slipping and falling deeper into the salad, with each time causing her to become covered in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on! This is disgusting!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky wouldn\u2019t have much time to complain as a shadow enveloped her and she looked up startled to see the gigantic face of Carmella staring down hungrily at the tray of salad. Without saying a word and complete unaware of who was in it, Carmella took the label and scooped up a generous amount of potato salad and with it the tiny drenched from of Becky whose muffled screams couldn\u2019t be heard through the thickness of the salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her selection Carmella joins the other two at a nearby table as the three prepare to tuck into their meals. As bad luck would have it Carmella just so happened to scoop up Becky in her first fork full of salad and began to bring her up to the dark abyss of her mouth. Becky tried to yell as Carmella opened her mouth wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmella...</span></div></div>",

Your heart jumped into your throat as you realized that you weren\u2019t 2 inches tall\u2026the stupid metric had been messed up. At the very most, you were only 2cm tall\u2026and now you were less than a bug\u2019s height while at the truly massive feet of an unaware giantess. Like the scared animal you were, you skittered away from the giantess\u2019s foot and tried your best to get your bearings. You\u2019d been 2 inches before\u2026but 2cm was a whole new ballgame. The world around you now was completely alien to you at this size\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most unnerving things you noticed was the level of detail you could see on the set of toes in front of you. Paige was a living monument from your perspective. You could see the blood drain from the front of her toes and her skin turn a pure white as she leaned forward on them\u2026then you could see the pink and red flush back to life as she rolled back onto her heels. The sound of leather stretching and groaning against the twitches of her foot rang in your ears and you were having trouble keeping your balance as every little motion Paige made sent tremors through the ground. Every cell in your body was telling you that you needed to get away from the giantess before it was too la-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK, DON\u2019T TELL ME I FORGOT MY PHONE IN THE FUCKIN\u2019 CAR\u2026\u201d Paige\u2019s voice thundered as the giantess squatted down in front of the bench, giving you quite the view. Paige was still in her street clothes, dressed in a black tank-top, black leggings, and a pair of leather sandals with black straps that crisscrossed over her pale foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Saraya-Jade-Bevis-Feet-2533213.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Saraya-Jade-Be...</a>). Your eyes were drawn up toward her face (though you definitely took a moment to stare at her crotch as it hovered over you, threateningly)\u2026once again you could feel just how tiny you were as you realized just how far away Paige\u2019s head was even when squatting. The giantess continued to grumble, unaware of the peeping bug down between her feet, \u201cI SWEAR TO GOD, IF IT\u2019S NOT IN HERE\u2026SHIT, REALLY? THAT\u2019S WHERE IT IS? FUCK ME, TWO MISSED CALLS?\u201d For Paige, it was just another day as she got past the security screen and hit the icon for her voicemail to see who she\u2019d unintentionally blown off. She leaned forward, her knees hitting the tile floor\u2026and nearly crushing you in the process\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were laid out on your ass in a growing, warm pool as you stared at the wall of black directly in front of you. Paige\u2019s left knee had come within an inch of crushing you and the giantess high above was none the wiser. Your ears were ringing from the explosive crack of her kneecap striking the tile floor and the constant groaning sound of the same knee stressing the fabric of her building-sized leggings. You heard a scuffling sound high above that you figured was Paige messing with her phone\u2026but you were more focused on the knee that had nearly crushed you. Scuttling back from it, all you could think of was how to get away from the giantess you\u2019d put so much time planning to peep on. This wasn\u2019t a fun game or adventure anymore! It was deadly serious and already you\u2019d nearly been killed by her without the wrestler even knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige groaned overhead\u2026apparently the first voicemail was either bad news or a telemarketer or something. As she listened to the second message though, even the tough Paige began to feel uncomfortable having her knees on the cool tile. While the voicemail played, she slowly began to get to her feet\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BABOOOM! BABOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No!\u201d you screamed, throwing yourself to the side in a bid to avoid one of Paige\u2019s massive, sandal-clad feet which shot forward as the giantess stood back to her full height (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Saraya-Jade-Bevis-Feet-2365073.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Saraya-Jade-Be...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the heat coming off of the massive foot that had nearly landed on you. The leather straps and base continued to groan as Paige absentmindedly flexed her toes while her mind was preoccupied. Again, instinct kicked in as you rolled away from the intimidating digit and got to your feet to run for it once more\u2026only to fall flat on your face as you tripped over your own shoes. Skidding on the ground, the wind got knocked out of you just as Paige rolled back onto her heels and her foot began to rise. For a moment it seemed like it was going to swivel in your direction and come down on you, ending your struggle before it could really begin. Instead, her foot just moved back\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige swiveled\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly began to walk away, giving you a view up her backside and a glance at her tight butt shaking slightly with each step her skyscraper legs took (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/4jAHD8L.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/4jAHD8L.gif</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further away Paige walked, the slower your heart raced\u2026the threat was leaving and the primal part of your brain was beginning to calm down again. Unfortunately, as the tension ratcheted down, so did the level of adrenaline in your blood. A wave of exhaustion crashed over you, threatening to knock you out cold\u2026and even if Paige was walking away, passing out on the floor of a locker room at less than an inch tall was basically a death sentence; if a Diva didn\u2019t crush you, you were just as likely to be killed by an ant or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to keep awake! A meaty slap across your own face shook off some of the exhaustion, at least giving you enough focus to pick a destination: if you could get to the base of one of the bench\u2019s legs, that could give you enough protection as long as you kept close to the bolts\u2026.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBABOOOOM!<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUGH! YOU\u2019VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! THAT\u2019S COMPLETE CRAP!\u201d Paige\u2019s voice thundered, waking you up the rest of the way! The giant Diva stamped her foot in frustration, sending another tremor through the ground that threatened to send you rolling head-over-heels\u2026instead, you only managed one roll before flopping on your back. Paige was basically a force of nature to you now. Her every move made an impact on your life and a shift of her feet alone could spell your doom\u2026she made Godzilla look like a puppy-dog\u2026and yet\u2026 You could feel your cheeks flush bright red and your heart leap into your throat as you stared up at the living mountain that was Paige. Or\u2026at least halfway up the mountain. Although she seemed yards away to you, Paige had barely walked a step away from the bench, and because of that she dominated your sky. Staring up her seemingly endless legs, your view of Paige was obscured by something\u2026two somethings\u2026Paige\u2019s tight, toned cheeks loomed overhead threateningly (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6XYQ7YCcAABlQQ.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6XYQ7YCcAAB...</a>). All you could think about was how big they must be if you were up close\u2026you were sure you could probably get lost in that valley if you weren\u2019t careful\u2026or if Paige was planning to sit on the floor at any point\u2026<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking over your shoulder, you could see the bench leg wasn\u2019t too far away\u2026a short sprint and you\u2019d be there! You\u2019d quickly learn it was a mistake to take your eyes off of Paige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCHRIST, WHAT WAS THE NUMBER AGAIN?\u201d You heard Paige\u2019s voice thunder from above as you picked yourself up off the grimy tile floor once more. The air had been knocked out of your lungs as you rolled onto your back and gasped for a breath. Still, your lungs froze up as you saw the awesome sight of Paige\u2019s body (and booty) looming overhead at an impossible height. The situation turned quickly from breath-taking to terrifying though as you noticed the giantess shifting to look over her shoulder (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/26/94/41/2694414c275f27b7cbfe2b070d928d7a--wwe-divas-paige-paige-wwe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/26/94/41/26944...</a>). \u201cDAMMIT, THIS ISN\u2019T WHAT WE AGREED ON,\u201d Paige griped as she stuck her butt out and slowly began to lower those toned cheeks back down onto the bench. A familiar rush of adrenaline surged through your veins as you flipped back over and struggled to get on your feet for the final rush. Not daring to turn around, you began stumbling toward the steel wall that was just in front of you! Battered and bruised as you were, you managed to reach your destination and started climbing the imperfections left in the paintjob like your life depended on it\u2026because it did. You\u2019d just thrown yourself over the edge and rolled to \u201csafety\u201d when you turned back to look at Paige. All you saw was a wall of w-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige could feel the cool steel of the bench leg against the heel of her left foot while she fished out a pen and a scrap of paper to write on from her bag to copy down the number she\u2019d been given. It was something about a stalker seen around the facility in recent days, the number was to get in touch with the cop in charge of catching the guy in case any of the Divas had a tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCRACK!\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou\u2019d have screamed, but you couldn\u2019t open your mouth any wider now that your face was mashed into Paige\u2019s heel. Having climbed onto the leg of the bench, you had thought you were safe from Paige\u2019s sandal-clad foot\u2026you couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Almost as soon as you\u2019d flung yourself over the side, the heel of Paige\u2019s foot slammed into you and smashed your body into the cold metal pipe. The impact alone almost ended you\u2026but the slight give of Paige\u2019s skin kept you from getting crushed instantly. By no means did that mean you had survived the worst of the abuse; on the contrary, your hell was just starting. For a moment, you thought Paige was going to press her heel closer to the pole\u2026you could hear your own ribs groaning under the pressure as you waited for them to rupture and your sides to unzip and release a red spray\u2026. Instead, her foot swung forward again, taking you for the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCopying down the number, Paige rolled her eyes as the message repeated the warning for the third time. She hung up, grumbling under her breath, \u201clittle shit wouldn\u2019t be able to lay a hand on me anyway\u2026\u201d Paige had no idea how right she was. Flexing her toes, the giant Diva checked her email one last time and was about to stand up and get dressed when something caught her attention. It was slight\u2026but, she could have sworn she felt something stuck\u2026to her foot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHE HELL?\u201d Paige\u2019s voice boomed around you as the world began to shift once again. Slowly, the wall of flesh you\u2019d been slammed by began to move forward. You screamed into her warm skin as your body slowly peeled off the cool metal pole before you stayed tight to her skin. You\u2019d been hopeful Paige was just going to stand and walk out, but that hope flew out the window as you felt the incline of Paige\u2019s foot growing steeper with each passing second! The incline began to increase further and all you could do was claw at Paige\u2019s skin to keep your grip before\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her legs up and leaning forward, Paige flexed her toes and examined the back of her sandals, thinking she felt something back there (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Saraya-Jade-Bevis-Feet-2737313.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Saraya-Jade-Be...</a>). \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Paige asked as\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was sure to find you if she kept moving her fingers about the way she was doing. Your heart almost stopped as you felt the lightest brush of Paige\u2019s warm pale skin moving over your body second shivers all throughout it. This was it she had felt you, she was gonna find you and if she did you were so dead...if she saw you she\u2019d turn you in, if she saw you but couldn\u2019t figure out you\u2019re human...you were even more screwed. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHmmm guess I was just imagining it.\u201d</b> Paige mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved as you saw her humongous fingers retract and vanish into the distance. Thank the heavens you weren\u2019t caught. But now you were in kind of a predicament. Sure you weren\u2019t found at all but you were still stuck to Paige\u2019s foot and were hundreds of feet in the air (in reality less than a foot high), you didn\u2019t fancy falling to your death especially at the size of a bug. There seemed to be only one option.l,you\u2019d have to climb up and attempt to maneuver through Paige\u2019s collossal toes and feet until you found your way down the ground again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath you climbed up the sander until you were right by Paige\u2019s huge toes. Each one easily dwarfed you several times. You did however find the sight of her black nail polish cool but you\u2019d have no time to enjoy it as you began your trek down the foot of Paige. Meanwhile...Paige had taken out her phone again and had made a call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHey baby girl! How are you?...yeah I\u2019m good just a little annoyed thst there\u2019s some little pervert out there stalking us...yeah if I catch him I\u2019ll beat him so bad he\u2019ll wish he was never born...nah I\u2019m just sat down chilling...yeahs come by if you want...yeah that sounds good babe...I\u2019m see yes soon...(smooch sound effect)\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige finshed her call as you heard her sigh as stretched her legs and flexed her toes, a normal minor action for her but for you it was much much more. The slightest movement from her toes caused you to lose your footing, you screamed as you fell and barely managed to grab onto her toenail, this was truly terrifying. Panicking you tried to pull yourself up but it was to no avail as you were to exhausted from cloning her toes in the first place. You could feel the heat radiating off of Paige\u2019s toes as your grip continued to loosen, this was it for real this time, you were about to fall and there was nothing you could do. A single tear dropped down your cheek as you finally lost your grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Lady Luck would be on your side as just at that moment Paige moved her other foot so thst it was positioned just under her other as you fell meaning you fell onto this deus ex machina. As luck would have it you landed Inbetween Paige\u2019s big and second toes, the good news was that you were alive. The bad news was that she then scrunched her toes together trapping you Inbetween these fleshy pillars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige then lowered her feet down to the floor as the landed with a thud. She then walked over to her locker causing you to be smacked and thrown about between her toes, you could taste the sweat between the, as well with each movement, this is what you get for trying to get close to those women. You\u2019re on the verge of being squished like an ant, goddamn those shrinking settings! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paige made her way over to her locker she tuned her head and smiled as her friend and former protege Mandy Rose walked in and <b>approached her before embracing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello darling good to see you!\u201d </b>Paige announced cheerfully. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHey babe!

Just as she took it though you managed to squeeze your way out from between Paige\u2019s toes and tasted the sweet fresh air, however you were then blinded by a bright flash as Mandy took the picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied Mandy checks out the picture with a smile before it vanishes. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that...Paige I think you have something in between your toes...\u201d</b><b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm my toes?

No sooner had you made it here had the sound of tremors began. <b>BOOM. BOOM. BOOM!</b> surprised you spun  around instantly and found thst you were being stared at by a gigantic pair of red eyes...uh oh. You dared not to make a move as you didn\u2019t know how a giant diva would react to a 2 inch tall man hiding in the women\u2019s locker room. Playing it cool you attempted to stay still hoping she would think you were a toy or something else entirely.<br>\r\n <b><br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the hell?\u201d</b> Ember muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap crap crap!\u201d Was all you could think to yourself as the eye lit up at the sight of you. What happened next took you completely by surprise. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHey there little guy!\u201d </b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the worst possible time your natural instincts kicked in and you answered her back with a friendly wave. \u201cFuck why did I do that!\u201d You thought as you gave away your status as a real person. Ember meanwhile audibly gasped as she released thst you were indeed a real person. What she was thinking was unknow, hell what were you thinking? You should\u2019ve made a run for it then and there but you didn\u2019t and now had to face whatever consequences this giantess had in store for you. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOh my god you\u2019re real! Holy shit I can\u2019t belive it! Wow why are you so small? I mean how do you do anything at thst size?\u201d </b> Ember asked in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t answer this time and instead stood silent as a single bead of sweat dripped down your cheek, slowly you turned the other direction and tried to walk away, not even bothering to run. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cNo wait little guy! I won\u2019t hurt you!\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped frozen in your tracks. What were you doing? Get out of there. Go find somewhere to hide until your shrink ray recharges so you can grow back to normal. But the sound of embers sweet concerned voice has an affect on you. You almost swoon as the concern this titanic beauty has for you is so pure and loving. You never expected to be this close to a wwe diva in your life and now here you were mere inches from a billboard sized face looking at you with such care. Throwing caution to the wind you turn around and walk slowly out from under the bench and towards Embers towering form. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!  One out from under there it\u2019s not safe for a little guy like you!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as she said and walked closer to the humongous Ember Moon who had lifted her face up from the ground but was still on her knees. She was in her ring gear minus her boots and was instead in a pair of flip flops. It certainly was a sight to see, the huge body of Ember was gorgeous, this was the reason you had shrunk yourself in the first place so you could get up close and personal with these women. But you had never expected this. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWow I can\u2019t believe its a real tiny guy! Man this is like something from a video game! Are you a fairy or a sprite? Are you gonna help me find some cool unlockabes hihi!\u201d</b> Ember giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice she had taken your discovery in good spirits, you shuddered to think what would happen if she knew your true intentions...she\u2019d probably crush you like a bug...snapping out of it you didn\u2019t notice that ember had lowered her hand down in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cC\u2019mon little guy it\u2019s nit safe for you down there...why don\u2019t you climb on and I can get a better look at you hihi!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccepting her invitation you meekly climb aboard her huge palm, you relies how lucky you are that you didn\u2019t shrink yourself smaller than 2 inches as you\u2019d most likely end up lost in the creases if her palm. Seeing you safely aboard her hand Ember lifted you up slowly although the jolt of movement didn\u2019t stop you from losing you footing and clinging to one of fingers for dear life. After a few seconds you were uo high and staring back into the beautiful red eyes of Ember Moon. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHey little guy! This is such surreal experience, I mean it must be even crazier for you right? Giant people everywhere, giant feet that could step on you at any moment. Someone could\u2019ve crushed you...had I not already...but anyway this is really cool, I mean you can be like my little sidekick.,,would you like that huh?\u201d</b> Ember asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis latest development took you by surprise, should you accept Embers offer of being her \u201clittle sidekick\u201d for a while? It might be fun until you choos to unshrink yourself...assuming this technology actually does that...shit should\u2019ve tested it out before shrinking yourself. Anyway in the end...</span></div></div>",

The searing light sent thousands of tiny spots dancing across her field of vision while she was faintly aware of Jessamyn cursing from a surprising distance away. That was the first hint to Nicole that something was wrong aside from her lack of vision\u2026Jessamyn had just been next to her a fraction of a second ago, why was she so far away now?! She wasn\u2019t given long to think about it though before the second hint that something was wrong showed itself\u2026the crackling of thunder in the distance that sounded almost like\u2026laughter? But that made no se-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOM! THOOOOOOM! THOOOOOOOOOM!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLike Pharaoh counting plagues, Nicole found her third sign something was going terrible awry as the ground began to shudder and shake underfoot, knocking her to her ass while the distant thunderhead seemed to be growing louder and closer with each tremor that shook the ground! The swirling lights in front of Nicole\u2019s eyes began to dissipate as she looked around and saw that there actually WAS some distance between her and Jessamyn\u2026distance that was filled a split-second later a black, rubber wall with pink canvas stretched over it dropped out of the sky like Dorthy\u2019s fucking house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOH. MY. GOD! IT ACTUALLY WORKED?! THAT\u2019S SOOOO FUCKING HILARIOUS!\u201d Dakota\u2019s voice thundered as the newly risen giantess smirked at the pair of bug-sized women stranded alone on either side of her sneaker. \u201cHEHE\u2026SORRY, I WAS ONLY GOING FOR JESSAMYN\u2026BUT I GUESS IT GETS EVERYONE IN ITS LINE OF SIGHT\u2026GOOD TO KNOW!\u201d Dakota chuckled, rising up to her full height as she realized there were now two toys she could enjoy breaking in today (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Djov3otUUAA4t_o.jpg:large\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Djov3otUUAA4...</a>). Looking back and forth, Dakota tried looking intimidating for just a moment before she burst out laughing\u2026it was almost impossible for her to see the little bugs when she stood to her full height. Slowly squatting back over them again, the giantess grabbed Jessamyn between her fingers; the little one looked like she was going to shit herself as Dakota rose to her full height (giving Jessamyn plenty to feel sick about as her ears, no doubt, popped several times from the 5\u20196\u201d wrestler suddenly skyrocketing to her full height once more) (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/647a8da9f5a9d07bc7fb4a432a6f8b2f/tumblr_pjamu4tsde1qeiy6vo1_640.gif\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/647a8da9f5a9...</a>). The New Zealander smirked at the buff blonde struggling between her fingers as she broke out into a giggle that sent chills down both Jessamyn\u2019s and Nicole\u2019s spines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJessamyn tried her best to put on a brave front as she shouts, \u201cD-Dakota! Ok, t-this isn\u2019t funny anymore! Put me down and turn us back!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSORRY~ NOT HOW IT WORKS\u2026I CAN MAKE YOU SMALLER AND SMALLER, BUT THAT\u2019S IT\u2026AND EVEN IF I COULD GROW YOU BACK, DON\u2019T THINK I WANNA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?!\u201d Jessamny shouted, her face going red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDakota just smirked as she giggled, \u201cYEAH\u2026I MEAN, REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT OUR NEXT MATCH?\u201d Jessamny\u2019s face suddenly went white as Dakota placed a finger against her chin and \u2018thought\u2019 about it for a moment before gasping, \u201cTHAT\u2019S RIGHT! I THINK YOU SAID YOU\u2019D UH\u2026SQUISH ME? CALLED ME A MIDGET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, RIGHT?\u201d Jessamyn couldn\u2019t say a word as Dakota leaned in closer and whispered, \u201cLET\u2019S SEE WHO SQUISHES WHO NOW~ SOUND FUN?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven Dakota\u2019s whisper overhead still rang like thunder in Nicole\u2019s ears as the unfortunate fan actually did end up pissing herself after realizing what the NXT wrestler had done to her! Before even thinking of what she could do to get out of this situation, Nicole\u2019s brain was over-ridden by her body as she turned on the ball of her foot and began bolting away from the massive wrestler\u2019s sneaker before she ended up getting Dakota\u2019s attention in the wrong way. All she had to do was run, she thought. If Nicole could make it to another room, maybe someone would be in there and she could get help! With her arms and legs pumping, the college freshman put every ounce of energy she had into fleeing\u2026not yet noticing that even with her desperate drive, she\u2019d barely gone a few inches away from Dakota\u2019s sneakers in the time that the two wrestlers had exchanged their first few verbal jabs with one another\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWHAT\u2019S WRONG? YOU\u2019RE SO QUIET NOW~ WE COULD THUMB-WRESTLE IF YOU WANT AS A WARM-UP! MAYBE YOU\u2019LL BE ABLE TO BEAT A FINGER\u2026SHOULD WE ASK YOUR CUTE LITTLE FAN?\u201d Dakota asked, smirking as Jessamyn went even paler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLeave her out of this! S-She\u2019s nice!\u201d the tiny wrestler shouted, only to feel her skull rattle as Dakota giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIF SHE\u2019S SO NICE, THEN I THINK SHE\u2019D LOVE TO JUDGE FOR US! ISN\u2019T THAT RIGHT, PIP\u2026SQUEAK? WHERE\u2019D SHE GO?\u201d Dakota asked, looking down to see that the little bug wasn\u2019t between her sneakers where it belonged. Dakota\u2019s eyes flashed back to Jessamyn who quickly tore her gaze away from the floor. \u201cHOLY SHIT! YOU\u2019RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO LET HER GET AWAY? HAHAHA! THAT\u2019S HILARIOUS! DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE SOME KINDA LITTLE HEROINE OR SOMETHING? SAVING THE POOW WITTLE FAN FWOM THE BIG, BAD MONSTER? HMMMMMMMM~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJessamyn swallowed the baseball-sized lump in her throat as she choked, \u201cD-Dakota! Come on, s-she\u2019s got nothing to do with this! Just let her go and\u2026a-and I\u2019ll do whatever you want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cANYTHING?\u201d Dakota asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes!\u201d Jessamyn shouted, feeling like she might be able to do something to at least get one person away from Dakota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat wish was dismantled quickly as the giantess giggled and smirked wickedly, squeezing Jessamyn between her fingers a little while cooing, \u201cYOU\u2019RE THE SIZE OF A FUCKING ANT, BITCH. I ALREADY OWN YOUR TINY ASS~ NOW\u2026WHERE\u2019D YOUR LITTLE BUGGY FRIEND GO? OR SHOULD I JUST WALK TILL I SQUISH HER?\u201d Dakota giggled and stuck out her tongue before running the fingers with Jessamyn between them through her hair\u2026and letting go! The tiny woman was forced to grab onto the silky, brunette strands as Dakota giggles and bounced on the balls of her feet (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.makeagif.com/media/4-06-2019/qs5QyR.gif\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.makeagif.com/media/4-06-2019/q...</a>). \u201cFEE, FI, FO, FUM~ LOOK OUT, BUGGY\u2026HERE I COME~\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
