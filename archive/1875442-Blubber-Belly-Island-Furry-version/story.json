            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hi, my name is Damien Silvermane, I\u2019m a 14-year-old wolf anthro. Let me tell you a bit about myself, I\u2019m a thin-as-a-rail slacker who is surprisingly creative regardless of slothful attitude. My favorite artworks involve paintings, &amp; modeling for paintings. Granted I never had a buff body, but my classmates loved my portraits of buff bodybuilders, &amp; that\u2019s what mattered most. I used to make paintings for other guys at my school, before I felt myself fall into a creative rut of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI plateaued and desperately needed some inspiration, so I figured why not build up my body image like the bodybuilders I used to work for. So that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been hitting the gym to build body strength over the past year, right after middle school. The progress would have been slow, so I went to a company called AgriGrwoth, and tested out a new product of mass gaining, which was experimental. The process worked wonderfully at first giving me energy, but then it started to fade away within a few days leaving me more exhausted after workouts than ever before. To top it off, due the defective mass gainer product also worked in tandem with my genetics, &amp; caused me to gain an enormous amount of weight. I\u2019m now obese with little musculature underneath to support it, &amp; there is no chance of losing the weight anytime soon. The mass gainer\u2019s products side-effects would take years to lose even with correct dieting &amp; liposuction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was originally 120 lb., then I set myself a limit of 200 lb. regardless of whether it was all muscle or not. However, the mass gainer I bought was so fast-acting, that even after I stopped taking the daily medications (of which I bought in bulk for a whole year) I was still growing at an alarming 10 lb. a week at least even with a limited amount of calories &amp; greasy/sugary/fatty foods. Now I\u2019m up to 420 lb. &amp; it is almost exclusively fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Once I reached 18, they disowned me for going behind their back to test out a life altering medicine, one that was now eating them out of house &amp; home &amp; finance. My parents heard of this place called Blubber Belly Island, where obese furs &amp; scalies like myself could live out the rest of their lives peacefully gaining, without worrying about finance, if they stay there on the island without causing any trouble. Being sent to Blubber Belly Island was a small compensation to say the least, but at least my parents had enough dignity to send me somewhere where I could make a fresh start. Where does that leave me now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well here I am; my new home, Blubber Belly Island. It looks so much bigger up close than I thought it would be. I was just getting off the boat when I noticed that the entry port to immigration-and-customs was packed, while the exit port was all but empty. That exit port seemed suspicious, but what did I know; I was the one being forced to move here by my parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line was short, but most of the other passengers who had been onboard with me were way bigger than even I could have imagined with the smallest furries and scalies being between 380 lbs. to 420 lbs. However, the bigger furries and scalies were between 800 lbs. to 1000 lbs. Boy were these people huge. The passengers I met were of many species, ethnicities, and sizes, but one thing remained the same: they were colossal. Most of the passengers had on too tight shirts and vests that left little to my imagination, while others decided to forgo clothing and let their fat cleavage hang out all loose like the fluffy top of a cupcake with frosting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy was I turned on. Even though I had no idea who these people were or even what gender or sexuality they were, I didn't care. I had learned a lot about myself within the past year of hiding my gains and medications, including being more accepting of different types of sexualities considering how gender meant little to nothing with bodies this bulky and amorphous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little room on the deck to stand and pace around. This was mostly because the ship was cheap, small, and we were given very few commodities, except the essentials. The other reason for the lack of standing room was much more obvious: we were huge and it was difficult to stand around on such a small ship. But I digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had finally arrived on Blubber Belly Island, and the scenery, for what it's worth, was beautiful and exotic. The island was made up of a vast  jungle environment with a barren mountain (hopefully not a volcano, but who knows) in the center of the island, and the main areas of commerce and residence were built with sleek and efficient highways and sidewalks that were just the right size for fatties like us. When I looked toward the base of the mountain, I noticed a beautiful looking town that, despite the lack of tourism, seemed to overflowing with its own niche culture and fast paced transit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could continue to take in the scenery, the boat had officially finished with the docking procedure and allowed us to get off. I grabbed my suitcase of essentials, my passport, ID, smaller versions of my art equipment, some money, and my cell phone. I also had a few other amenities such as toiletries, my game system, a couple of different porn magazines, condoms, and a jumbo-sized bottle of lube. What? I figured if I'm gonna spend the rest of my life here, I might as well try to get laid with the right guy, or girl if you catch my drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the matter at hand. I was getting off of the ship and into customs when I noticed my first obstacle in transferring here: the bureaucracy, specifically the lines for government identification and whatnot. The lines were short getting in, at least at first glance, since there weren't a lot of passengers arriving today at this port. The real problem, however, was that every single passenger's process took a lot longer than I thought as each passenger was huge and probably brought a lot more luggage than I had, or had never traveled farther than their hometown before. We were ushered into cramped rooms to take photos for identification, answer a few basic questions, X-rays, metal detectors, pat-downs, the whole shebang. It took nearly 45 minutes of waiting in line and trudging along at a snail's pace before I started my process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy was I hot, tired, sweaty, horny, and hungry, especially hungry. I was horny because there was little to no personal space for me in this line as my belly, butt, legs, feet and hips kept getting frayed and jiggled by every other passenger's body I made contact with. I was hot enough as is; even though I took my vest off and my shirt was breathable, the weather was tropical, yet sublimely dry - or at least not as moist as I though it would be - despite being on an island. The contact was making my FUPA tight as it engorged itself on hormones and blood flow to give me a hard-on, coupled with the heat which exacerbated my fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost didn't realize it was my turn as my stomach was grumbling. I felt like my brain was on autopilot as I took my picture. My snapped out of my trance when I felt hooves at my hips; I almost yelped in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about this Mr. Silvermane. We are just following protocol for this pat-down. Now please refrain from moving your body as we finalize this inspection,\" a hefty horse anthro explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, just get on with it.\" I don't know what came over me, but while the pat-down was happening, I realized that the hefty horse  and bulky bull were taking a little too much pleasure in their pat-down as I was fondled and groped in other newly-formed erogenous zones on my torso and hips, and what I swore must've been my ass cheeks. When that embarrassing experience was over, I was officially done, though part of me felt a little bit unsatisfied as I was directed to my new house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe island was flattened to a steady incline once you get past the jungles and head towards the beach. And there smack-dab in the middle of town was where my new home was located. I settled in to my spacious new home, when something strange occurred...</span></div></div>",

Sure, he would miss them dearly, but the boat had already departed, so it was too late to turn back. After his tears had been fully dried, he opened the door and got a good look at his cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The room's size was clearly made with large passengers in mind as it was at least 15 ft. long and 15 ft. wide. There was a pair of bunk beds on either side of the room, both of which were big enough to hold at least 5 people of Vincent's size and and still have room to spare. The bunk beds also appeared to be made out of metal that Vincent could only assume was titanium. All in all, the room was clearly designed to hold 4 incredibly obese passengers and still have room to spare. <i>Given where this boat is going, it doesn't surprise me that the rooms are designed to hold fatties,</i> he thought. <i>I can't wait until I fat enough to fit in a bed that big.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You just gonna stand in the door and stare at the room all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That voice startled Vincent, who promptly looked for the source of the voice.

She had beautiful, soft-looking brown fur that complimented her flowing brown hair, and bright green eyes. She also had a decently sized ass and bust that, when displayed alongside her otherwise slender figure, looked bigger than they actually were. Her cute, smiling face was probably Vincent's favorite thing about her. It seemed that she had started putting her luggage away when Vincent opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S-sorry about that,\" Vincent said, embarrassed. \"I guess I was just awestruck by the size of the room. I was so distracted by it that I didn't even notice you were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't say I blame you; the room is pretty big.\" The woman giggled a bit at Vincent's embarrassment. \"I'm Shannon. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm Vincent,\" Vincent replied. \"I guess you and I are cabin mates for this voyage, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess so,\" Shannon nodded. \"I wonder if it'll be just the two of us, or if some other passengers will be joining us. Anyway, let's put our luggage away so we can relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alight, I think our luggage is secure,\" Vincent said, wiping some sweat from his brow. \"I didn't really pack much; just a few clothes, my computer, and my games and gaming systems. How about you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pretty much the same thing as you: clothes, games, game systems, and my computer,\" Shannon replied. \"If what the brochure said about clothes being optional on Blubber Belly Island is true, then I might not need the clothes I've packed, but better safe than sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think it probably is true.\" Vincent pulled his brochure out of his pocket. \"People supposedly get too fat to find clothes that fit, so they just made clothing optional.\" Vincent then laid down on the bed his chosen bed. \"I think I'm gonna take another look at the brochure, then we can get to know each other.\" Shannon nodded, pulled her own brochure out of her pocket and laid down on her chosen bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0According to the brochure, Blubber Belly Island, also known as \"Obesia,\" was a place magical island; quite literally, as many things about the island could only be explained supernaturally. Among its magical properties were what the brochure called \"food plants.\" Many of the plants native to the island grew fully prepared meals; from cheeseburgers to pizzas to bowls of pasta, just about any food in existence not only grew on plants, but instantly regrew after being picked. And if that wasn't bizarre enough, all it took to grow one of these plants was to bury some food in the dirt and a new plant would almost instantly grow. For example, if someone were to bury a cake in the dirt, a plant would almost instantly sprout up, grow to full size, and have a cake exactly like the one planted ready for picking. This essentially meant that there was no need for money on the island, as food was always readily available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The \"food plants\" weren't the only magical plants on the island. There were also the \"blue fruits,\" so named because they were all blue. Not only that, but they caused varying alterations - some temporary and some permanent - to the bodies of anyone who ate them. These alterations included: making the consumer 40 lbs. fatter; giving the consumer a pear-shaped figure and causing future weight gain to focus on the consumers hips, thighs and ass; increasing the endowment size of males and bust size of females; doubling future weight gained; turning humans into an anthropomorphic animal of their choosing; making the consumer incredibly horny; and various other things. There was also a special silver fruit that not only reversed the effects of the blue fruits, but also returned the consumer to the average weight for their species; perfect for island visitors who wish to return to normal size before going home, or for permanent residents wishing to gain tremendous amounts of weight from a normal size all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The plants weren't the only magical thing about the Blubber Belly Island. According to the brochure, space was distorted in ways that caused buildings which appeared small on the outside to have unbelievable amounts of space within. For example, a building that appeared to be as big as tool shed could have an entire stadium's worth of space withing. This essentially meant that the island would virtually always have room for more residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clothing was indeed optional on the island; the brochure said that residents and visitors alike gain so much weight that they very rapidly outgrow their clothes. Materials to make fabric need to make clothes that would fit them grew at the same speed as all the other plants on the island (i.e. instantly), so they could easily get clothes that fit, but most people didn't bother with clothes at all. Nudity was very common on the island, and almost all the beaches were nude beaches. Because of the near constant nudity, those under the age of 18 were not allowed to visit or move to the island unless accompanied by a legal guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The very last thing the brochure mentioned was that there was a tribe of natives that lived in a village in the center of the island. The native tribe was a very friendly and peaceful one. Meeting them was a popular activity for visitors and residents alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And with that, the brochure was done. Vincent and Shannon both put their brochures away and looked at each other...</span></div></div>",

After winning the title he decided to move to Jumploosa so his fans wouldn't try breaking into his house at night and also to prep up for the next tournament. He heard that many of the residents were very obese and that their cities are huge. There's also rumors that every year the entire island expands to keep up with the increase in population, but despite that he's heard that the population is in top physical condition despite their size. Ironically Zan had always wanted to move up a weight class or two so none of his opponents could one-up him. Thoughts of yesterday's match proved that his opponent almost managed to win if it wasn't for Zan's tail. Yet Zan knew that in order to stay king of the ring he would have to kiss his 8-pack abs good-bye and welcome a muscle-gut. Zan then goes to bed for the night thinking about how he'll fit in to his new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning the boat had reached Jumploosa better known as Blubber Belly Island. When Zan stepped outside the boat he noticed that the obesity rate on the island was 100% or 99.9% since he just arrived. Zan pulled out a map to locate the mansion that he just bought, unfortunately he was confused just due to the fact that ordinary houses looked like mansions. A 300 lb. tigress approaches him and who next to him was one of the slimmest residents of the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Zan Shimmers. You're a lot thinner than expected.\" said the tigress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually looking for the mansion I purchased and hopefully I can start bulking up for the next wrestling tournament that I got.\" said Zan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful! I'll show you to your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan then carries his luggage and follows the tigress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrives he sees that his new home is...</span></div></div>",

I can't wait to get unpacked!\" said Zan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry every house has robotic butlers and maids. All you need to do is enjoy yourself.\" said the tigress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.

The gym Zan was planning on joining was called Maximum Weights Fitness Center. This gym was the closest to Zan's home and the biggest gym in Bulkia City, the second largest city in Jumploosa. When Zan entered through the double doors Zan was amazed at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole place was filled with fat furs exercising on various machines specifically designed for extremely obese people. If he thought the regular towns folks were strong, then these guys and gals were fat fitness gods and goddesses. Zan watched in awe as a humongous wolf bench pressed an impressive 4,000 lbs. and the guy looked to be at least a thousand pounds or more. He then noticed a fat cheetah woman gracefully jumping over hurdles on the track and she was roughly 700 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...

The bear emerges from the double doors that lead to the front desk. Up close the bear easily dwarfed Zan by a few feet and that the bear was wearing gym clothes that clung to his thick body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Maximilian Ursanate. How could I help you little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Zan. I was hoping to get a gym membership. I recently moved here and I hope I can move up into the heavyweight weight class. I'm a wrestler who wrestles for FWE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximilian looks at Zan and scratches his chin before answering. \"So you're an FWE wrestler and you want to be a heavyweight. To be a heavyweight you need to put on a hundred pounds, assuming that you're 250 lbs. which is middleweight for your species. Every species has different weight requirements, yet yours shouldn't be hard to meet. A month or so from now you'll start looking like a Blubber Belly Island local. Alright, I can help ya out. Just enter your name on this tablet and I'll see that we get you started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan signs the tablet.

I thought I spotted someone new while I was bench pressing. How much do you weigh?\" Bruno asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I weigh 325 lbs.\" Zan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds about right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're heavier than I thought.

What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Zan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zan, eh. I think I saw one of your matches on TV the other day. You may be a superstar on the main land, but on Blubber Belly Island you're just some rich and skinny tiger who just moved here. It's my job that you pack on the weight effectively. Sure you could be like everyone else and be a butterball that only has enough muscle to avoid being immobile, yet it's pretty impossible to get immobile nowadays though. After living on this island for three months the muscles of the body begin adapting to the environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure there's places around the world where there are immobile fat furs, but here the average person is strong enough to carry their own weight. The only difference is how lazy they are. Even the fattest inhabitant on Jumploosa has enough strength to walk around the island without getting winded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait a moment. People here get stronger if they get fat here?\" Zan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I got done telling ya. I don't know the main cause, but I have been living here long enough to know that the body adapts to being heavier. Jumploosans have been reported as the healthiest in the world, and yet fat shamers from the mainland try to insult us. Now let's get you started. We have to make your body work before we can reward it with the most succulent dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruno takes Zan by the arm and has him work out like no tomorrow. The exercises weren't that too different than what Zan was used to, but the weights were slightly heavier to lift. After two hours Zan was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Zan. Now let's reward that stomach of yours. I know I'm going to treat myself to a larger lunch than usual for breaking my record on how much I could lift. After lifting 4500 lbs. a handsome, plush, and good looking wolf like myself needs to maintain and grow his figure.\" Bruno said as he flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bruno flexed his body jiggled. It was clear that Bruno had a high percentage of body fat when compared to his muscle mass, but it's clear that his fat generously coats his muscles. If Bruno was his size and somewhere else he would already be immobile. Yet here he was admiring himself. Zan wasn't sure if Bruno was prideful or was gay for himself, in other words, he's interested in being married to himself, but was clear that Bruno loved his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zan, wanna grab a bite to eat? They say eating with friends is a good way to gain weight, especially if those friends are fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds rad.\" Zan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome little man. I'll go get a few of the guys and gals. If you hang with us you'll be a big tiger in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter texting his buddies, Bruno puts on a large black shirt and a pair of shoes that imitated actual bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends are going to meet us at Mandarin BBQ.

Well then, you better eat and workout a lot; there are little kids who are bigger and stronger then you, but with Bruno teaching you will be a force to reckon with in the ring,\" said Tory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t be a stranger; call us if you helping eat or working out,\" said Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, enough with the talk about Zan; all of your girths are making the poor kid nervous,\" said Bruno with a cheeky grin. His friends rolled their eyes and saw their order came.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBruno whisper to Zan that Gus knew the owner and are good friends. The owners would give Gus and his friends free food on the house after teaching the owner\u2019s niece how to bake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral waitresses came with huge dishes with fried rice and noodles, boatloads of chicken, beef ribs and pork dumplings. Altogether, Zan guessed that the total weight of the food was around half of his own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan saw Bruno and his friends and chow down and he was amazed at how they started to demolish the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t just sit there, dig in! If you want to achieve your dream, then start eating. You need to grow just to make the lightest weight class,\" said Bruno as he passed Zan a huge plate filled with a large portion from each dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan nodded and ate with a motivation. He found the food incredibly tasty as his stomach growled with hunger and greed for the food.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have to have more!\" Zan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruno and his friends were too busy eating to notice Zan's eagerness, however a waitress heard exactly what Zan had said.

With dedication like that he'll be one big and cute tiger if he's this hungry.\" The waitress replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan than noticed the waitress's species. She was apparently a tigress like the other tigress he met yesterday. In fact she looks like she may be related to the other tigress, except a lot fatter. Just one hundred pounds thinner than Bruno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alyssa, if you think that someone as thin as Zan is still hungry than bring out the second course!\" Gus yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Alyssa whistled. Within moments several waitresses brought out twice as much food as before. As soon as the food reaches the table the men eagerly pile their plates with food. Zan fills his plate with twice as much as before. After a good hour Zan finished his plate. He would have eaten more, but he was stuffed. The meal alone added another five pounds to his muscular frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great. I don't think I could eat another bite. At this rate I'll meet my goal in no time. Within a month I should qualify for the heavyweight division in the FWE. And I should have a better time defending my title. Yet I should compete in the BBI and test my prowess. If I can compete in the BBI that would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll make it Zan. If you stick to my regimen you'll be unstoppable in the ring.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cobwebs choked the passage before her, a sign that no one had been down here in ages. Skye proved undaunted by this, in fact, this spurred her on even more. She had pieced together fragments of tales and stories, following in the steps of those that walked this forlorn path before her. None of her predecessors had succeeded, but she hoped with all her heart that she would be the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness stumbled every few steps as the rough stone floor beneath her caught her feet, or a loose piece shifted beneath her weight. She pressed on anyways, buoyed by what she hoped to find. She scowled a bit as her stomach growled in anger. Despite the second breakfast she had gulped down that morning, her weighty body was already demanding the first lunch. She dug a bag of chips from her bag and scarfed it down, followed soon after by a second and a third. Not quite enough, but they would have to do for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by her still protesting stomach, the doughy dragoness almost ran nose first into an old wooden door. The hinges creaked, but wouldn\u2019t budge. Shoving her shoulder against the door, it started to open, but not all the way. Putting her considerable weight to task, the wood groaned before a sharp snap proved the only sign as the door gave way. She hacked and coughed at the clouds of dust kicked up by the impact. She bared her teeth as she felt an ache start in her belly from how she landed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWobbling to her feet, she found her flashlight nearby and cast its glow around as she swiped at the cloying dust that clung to her. Several tables lay scattered about, their tops littered with tools and moldering books. She even saw a couple spots where tables once stood, but they had rotted away over the years, leaving behind only scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flashlight flickered, and she scowled as she shook it. It lit up again, before flaring bright and going dark. She growled and hit the tube against her other hand several times, but it remained unlit. She froze when she saw that there was still a pale glow in the room. Feeling her way through the gloom \u2013 tripping over some of the decayed leftovers along the way \u2013 she came to a curtain covering an opening in the wall. She could see the glow leaking around the edges. Throwing the curtain back, she found a staircase cut into the stone, spiraling down out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the stairs down, she came to another large chamber. She shivered, and rubbed her arms, and now realized that she could see her breath puffing in little clouds. Looking up, she gasped and froze. A huge crystal floated in the middle of the chamber, one point almost touching the floor, while the other was almost at the ceiling. The glow she had been following came from within, but down here it was somewhat painful to look it. She couldn\u2019t resist though. She continued to stare through eyes screwed almost shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jolt, she realized that she had wandered close to the stone. Her hand was up and almost touching. She drew it back. Some of the fragments she had encountered warned of grave danger should the crystal be touched without proper protection. Setting her bag on the floor, she pulled out the ingredients she had collected. Before long, a collection of small bags and glass bottles surrounded her. She still felt amazement at how almost everything she needed was present here on the island; it was as if some force tied the island and the crystal together. The only thing that wasn\u2019t native to the island was the roses brought by some of the later occupants of the island. From those, she had several handfuls of petals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything set out, the dragoness plopped down on her considerable rump and set to work. She mixed some of the powders together before spreading them in circle around her. Next came the liquids, these she poured into set spots in the powder circle, watching as the reactions happened each time. Then she pressed candles against the stone outside those spots, lighting them each in turn. She spread the rose petals throughout the interior of the circle as the second to last step. At last, she unstoppered the bottle containing water from a specific spring and doused her hands with the water before dribbling the rest down over her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air seemed to grow even more still, as if anticipating what was to come. Skye couldn\u2019t stop the shiver that passed down her spine and along her tail. Others had tried similar combinations of these ingredients, and met with failure at best. She hoped beyond all belief that she was the one to get it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting her bulk to her feet, she reached out for the glowing crystal. A tingle spread from the tips of her fingers up her arms as she paused with her fingers a hairsbreadth away. Then with a final gulp, she pressed her hands forward that final gap. An electric shock launched up her arms and into her body as an icy chill settled in her gut. She felt torn between excitement and fear, not sure whether it was working or not. A smile started to form on her face as she felt\u2026<i>something</i> happening.</span></div></div>",

The waves rolled along the shore, leaving a wet trail as it retracted back into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet away was a lush, tropical forest, and the sounds of chattering monkeys, squawking parrots, and other exotic animals came from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the prow of a large ship, Mina, a catgirl with a long, black hair and brown fur, gazed upon this island through a pair of binoculars with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that this is the right one?\" asked Sam, a chubby, short, arctic fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is!\" she exclaimed, taking her eyes off the binoculars, \"All of the information we've gathered pointed directly to these sets of islands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey've been on this case for months now. Blubberbelly Island, a small piece of land surrounded by miles of Pacific Ocean, was rumored to be a society created by the government, a place that they would use to dump off extremely obese and overweight people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to them was a mystery, a mystery that Mina, a journalist, and Sam, a cameraman, would uncover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd payed a captain of this boat to take them to these sets of islands, spent at least a few days sailing these seas, searching for this fabled island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Sam, sounding nervous, shrinking away a little, \"But I'm still saying that this is a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina rolled her eyes. It wasn't the first time her companion said this. Ever since they began this search Sam had whined endlessly, telling the catgirl how she felt a ominous presence nagging on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't turn back now,\" said Mina, turning her attention back to the island, \"It would be a gigantic waste of time and money if we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" said the fox, folding her arms, \"But do we really have to go off alone; it could be dangerous doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. The plan was to row the two of them to shore, climb off, and begin their search. The ship would stay on the waters for at least a week, enough time to do their research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was still the possibility that the they could run into trouble: they could sustain an injury, or be bitten by a poisonous animal, or the natives they were on a hunt for might prove very dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ten spite the endless amount of horrible scenarios, Mina was still determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the catgirl said, \"I'm positive that this is a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" was only thing Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs planned, they were taken ashore by a skiff. Running aground, Sam and Mina, dressed in green safari clothing, jumped off the small boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl waved goodbye as the skiff returned back to the ship, but Sam was struggling, for she was burdened carrying their heavy backpack full of supplies and the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" said Mina, gesturing with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right behind you,\" said Sam, grunting as she began to walk, following the catgirl into the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened while they were exploring the jungle?</span></div></div>",

But ten spite the lack of sunshine, the undergrowth grew extremely thick, and the two explorers had to fight endlessly to get past it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm and damp air was making Sam feel hot and uncomfortable, and, due to not being in the best physical condition and carrying a heavy weight, she was panting and sweating, falling behind Mina at least ten feet every ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she finally cried, when she saw how far the catgirl was from her, \"Wait for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not get the last word out, for Sam 's foot caught in a root of some random tree, and the fox went toppling over, falling face down in the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned when she finally roused to her feet, rubbing her brushed head, her beautiful white fur caked with dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally regained her composure, Sam saw that her companion was no where in sight, and she cursed to herself. She was just about to run off and catch up to her companion when she heard the bushes nearby rustle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blood ran cold. She waited for it to happen again, but after a few moments passed that made it evident that it would not, Sam nervously continued her journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was loud howling all around her, and tall, wide black figures jumped in her way with heavy thuds, surrounding her at all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame gave a small yelp when sharp javelins thrust towards her, stopping inches away from penetrating her soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly she raised her eyes away from the deadly points and to the looming black figures, saying nervously: \"H-hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mina was walking down a pathway she just now discovered, oblivious to Sam's distress. It was only when the catgirl turned around to ask the fox if she had the camera on and ready that she saw that her companion was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam!\" she called, \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe received no answer, and Mina was growing worried. She backtracked, but due to the jungle's size and the fact that everything looked the same, Mina took a few wrong turns and ended up completely lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, calm down, girl,\" she told herself, \"You can get yourself out of this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried retracing her steps, but she took a wrong turn again, walking straight into a trap. On the ground, covered by green leaves, was a net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mina stepped on it, the trap activated, and the next thing the catgirl knew was that she was surrounded by rope, suspended three feet high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked and thrust around, but all her effort only left her out of breath and no less trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bushes rustled nearby. Emerging from them were two tigers. Mina gasped when she saw them: they were both seriously fat, supporting huge, overhanging bellies and large moobs, dressed in nothing but a pair of beautifully decorated loincloth, their flaps to long that it almost dragged across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could guessed, from this uncomfortable angle, that the two felines must be at least six to seven feet tall. Aside from their natural black stripes, colorful patterns, red, blue, green, yellow, most of them in a spiral shape, covered their well-fed bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they laid eyes on Mina, their eyes grew wide with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that we caught something that's anything but edible, Tom,\" said the first tiger, studying Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed the second tiger, \"It's a female. Do you think it comes from the Northern part of the island, Tim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first tiger known as Tim shook his head. \"No,\" he said, \"She's far too thin and strangely dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she comes from the dreaded Main Land?\" asked Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely,\" said Tim, \"Which means that we should probably take her to the chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded, and Tom grabbed the net, cut it loose with his sharp claw, and carried her so easily that Mina guessed she weighed as much as a ragged doll to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl begged and pleaded for them to let her go, but they ignored her. Soon she gave up, allowing herself to be taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut should we stay with Mina? Or should we switch to Sam?</span></div></div>",

They were a more athletic, but shorter, doberman with short black hair and sweats named Trisha and a lightly tubby, artsy sabertooth tiger with dyed blue bangs and loose clothing named Rita. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls unpacked clothes while keeping small bags and money just in case they saw souvenirs to buy. They also planned to split up and scout for interesting places and things to do. Jessie jumped on the idea of heading to the coast, already changing into a red bikini. Trisha decided to check more close to the jungles and hiking trails to save Rita from doing a lot of hiking herself, leaving her with the commercial shopping and dining areas.</span></div></div>",

He got on a boat and headed out while doing any research he could on his phone. This place is pretty obscure with stuff mentioning obesity and some sort of resort. He shrugged it off and was soon on his way to BB Island. He saw the single large tower near the center of the island as it came up, but the rest were smaller buildings that were most likely 50% residential and 50% tourist stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat docks with a decent greeting from...</span></div></div>",

Pokemon anthros are also allowed. Digimon are also allowed. Sex is not only allowed, but it's also highly encouraged (as long as the characters are at least 18).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly 4 rules:<br>\r\n1: No sex involving characters under the age of 18; chapters that violate this will either be edited or deleted.<br>\r\n2: No scat or watersports. Let's keep that stuff out of this story. Any chapters involving scat or watersports WILL BE DELETED.<br>\r\n3: No death, or obesity-related illnesses. We shall imagine that the inhabitants are immortal and that being fat is healthy for you.<br>\r\n4: Please use Spell Check. I will try to fix grammatical and spelling errors, but please be as grammatically correct as possible; don't make things hard for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT 2/13/13: If you're offended by any of the material in this story, turn away... Or, better yet, don't complain and go along with it &gt;:3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE 4/12/20: I am making three changes to this story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: I have recently learned that the original Blubber Belly Island story has either been deleted or made private. In light of this, I am now allowing humans characters in this story. However, please remember to include furries alongside any humans; \"Furry version\" is in the title for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: This is somewhat related to the previous change, but with <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i> being released last month (at the time of writing, at least), I am allowing you to include your favorite <i>Animal Crossing</i> characters if you so wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: I am now allowing other fetishes to be included in this story. Feel free to add inflation, vore (with reformation; remember that death is not allowed), transformation, macro/micro, etc., but remember that weight gain is the focus of this story.</td>",
