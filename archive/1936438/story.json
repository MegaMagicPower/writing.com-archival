After 7 more minutes her drink was finished, so she took out a glass and poured herself a full one. She took sip meeting a heavenly taste. She quickly guzzled down her glass, which was emptied within seconds and she poured herself another. Maka drank the 1,75 liters of soda under 3 minutes. After finishing th last glass she burped. \"Man, that was good kinda wish for more. Well time to make dinner\" So she cleaned the table for cooking without noticing her slowly growing chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 6:30pm Blair came home smelling already the dinner, which Maka made. So Blair quickly went to the kitchen only to see Maka spotting a double D chest, which shocked Blair.<br>\r\n\"Maka, how much of the pumpkin did you use?\" Blair said.<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Blair. I drank the whole thing as soda. Why do you ask?\" was Makas return.<br>\r\n\"Look down.\"Blair answered.<br>\r\nMaka smiled greatly as she saw her new chest. \"Wow this thing really works fast. Thanks Blair.\"<br>\r\n\"It only works so fast, because you used the whole thing. I ate only a half of one over a period of time and grown to this size.\" Blair nervously said.<br>\r\n\"Ups. So how big I'm gonna be.\" Maka asked slightly afraid.<br>\r\n\"I don't, how big you'll get, but I know there is a side effect by eating too much of it.\" Blair answered.<br>\r\nMaka poked her still expanding breast and heard a sloshing from them. \"I thinkg, I fond the side effect. They are sloshing.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I remember now, what it was. Your boobs are producing the same juice as you drank. Normaly it would be just milk with pumpkin flavour, but if you consume it as a drink, it copies this drink.\" Blair explained.<br>\r\nSuddenly Maka burped, which caused her breast to grow to a E-cup within seconds.<br>\r\nMaka freaked out and asked: \"What's going on Blair?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" was Blairs answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy those words Maka completly freaked out, which caused her to freak mor out. Because of this she burped repeatly, which pumped her chest even more up. After 12 burps she stopped growing with her chest being now a I-cup filled with juice. Her shirt pushed against her boobs, the reason for this was to small for her now. Because of this two wet spots showed up located at her nipples. Blair went  to Maka and ripped Maka shirt off.<br>\r\n\"Blair, I'm leaking.\" Maka said in terror.<br>\r\nThis let to Blair grin. \"Well Maka, for missbeheaving you must be punished.\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't missbeheave.\" Maka replied, but Blair didn't listen and took a glass out of the shelf. She then forcely groped Makas right breast, while holding the glass against the nipple. A orange stream of soda squirted out of the nipple. After a minute the glass was full and Blair drank it.<br>\r\n\"Wow, this taste great....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ah, yes, Tsubaki. The nice, quiet, attractive girl who ate her brother's soul, and lives with Black Star. I came to my attention that the creator of Soul Eater wasted a perfectly good character with her, and could had more character development too. It's like only a couple of chapters she flashes out her personality, and then goes back to be Black Star's weapon, and reacting whatever is happening to him. Though, in the magna the \"Lust Chapter\" in the book of Eibon could put her in a new light, and might even suggest her reason to attack Black Star when he's peeping is because he isn't hiding well, and on some level is okay and enjoys him doing it. But that is pure speculation, and speculation is not valid enough to go on most of the time. And recently I found out on Tvtropes on the YMMV page of Soul Eater Not!, that her new design is the biggest base breaker on the show about the original cast. Some people find it a minor and unneeded change to make her bust size bigger. Watch this video to see it, and skip to 2:13 to see what I mean. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6hTzy4f-c18\" target=\"_blank\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6hTzy4f-c1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is strange really. I don't want to just make this devolve into a rant, there's not enough space for one. So, just for the sake of why not, Tsuabki's new design is what she looks like in this story. Minus the blush spots. I did read one fanfic that said the writer feels like Tsubaki is just keep around for fanservice these days, which is sad. Though it could be worse. Stephen Meyer could own Soul Eater, and decided it needs a change, and we all know about how female characters are in a well known work of hers. Don't think about it too much, you'll <span class=\"cred\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">RAGE</font></span> from disgust. Or for Warhammer 40k fans, it could be written by our spiritual liege, Matt Ward (note this one of the good things he did. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1d4chan.org/images/0/07/Trazyn.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://1d4chan.org/images/0/07/Trazyn.jp...</a> Trollzan is awesome), or done be done by C.S. Goto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhew! Sorry if that became a rant for you. I don't know why the creator of Soul Eater did it, and the fandom can rage about things, like all fandoms can, but let's just deal with it and march on. People and fandoms can make as much sense as these pictures: <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1d4chan.org/images/3/3e/AwesomeWTF.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://1d4chan.org/images/3/3e/AwesomeWT...</a> <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1d4chan.org/images/e/ef/Lolwutt.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://1d4chan.org/images/e/ef/Lolwutt.p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with all of that mess out of the way, let's begin! And here's the choices:<br>\r\n1: Expansion. Though with her new design, that might not make much sense.<br>\r\n2: Here's an actual story for ya here, and OCs are allowed, just no Mary Sues. Got it? Chapters with Mary Sues will be destroyed. Anyway on to the story: Let's say Tsubaki finally cracks. She's had enough of Black Star and his ego, and quits being his partner, and wants a new one. If you chose to do an OC, though since there's mainly focus on the main students of the DWMA or other characters with minor plot relevance and given names, you could add dozens of OCs easily with the slightest contradiction of canon, you can have your OC become her new partner.<br>\r\nJust here's the guidelines: No Mary Sues, and make your OC make sense. And there will be an option for her to forgive Black Star, and become his weapon again. She can not instantly like your OC right off the bat. I know she's real accepting and could work with anybody, but she will have to be a judge and do a screening on them. Yes, you can have her date your OC, but don't put it right out there in the beginning, work to it. Sex chapters? I'll allow, but at least provide a head's up on the chapter before it. And do some sort of plot leading to it. And most chapters will be mainly focusing on Tsuabki. Unless it's a chapter that focusing on your OC. I think that's good enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, I'll just put a romance option for it.<br>\r\n3: Your choice.</span></div></div>",

She cared for her meister with all of her heart, but for some reason it was harder to stand his usual antics. Her first day as Black Star's Demon Weapon gave her an idea of what she was getting into, but she didn't give up on him then. For all of his faults, Black Star can be a competent meister when he puts his ego aside. Lately, something was driving them apart, and she was the only one that saw it. It was breaking her down, and it was only a matter of time before she cracked completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki, wake up.\" Someone said to the sleeping weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl woke up startled and saw the local mad scientist beside her. She saw that everyone else had left the room, leaving her behind. \"Hello, Professor Stein,\" Tsubaki yawned. \"I guess I should go now,\" she says trying to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki, just stay here. I need to talk to you about something.\" Stein said while giving his screw a twist. \"You're grades are slipping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get every question right, Professor.\" Tsuabki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you understand how far you've fallen,\" the grey haired man said. \"Let me show you your average.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein walked over to his desk, and pulled out a folder from a cabinet. Stein handed Tsubaki the folder and pointed to her current average. Tsubaki's eyes widen in horror when she saw it. \"A 50 average?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all,\" Stein said, \"You and Black Star's soul collection hasn't been too great either. If this trend continues, I'll have to fail you. Should I mentioned you'll be expelled if you continue to fail at soul collection?\" Stein asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir,\" she groaned. A thought made its way into her head. \"How did I do on today's test?\" She asked hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein motioned her to look down on the desk. Tsubaki found her test covered in drool. \"I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did Black Star do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He made an eighty on it,\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Star made an eighty, while I have a fifty average?\" Tsuabki asked as if the world stopped making sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard he made a bet with a couple of students and Lord Death a couple of weeks ago. If memory serves me correct, if he won he got their weekly allowance, if he lost, he would get a Reaper Chop for every question he got wrong.\" Stein says. Money and Reaper Chops can be great motivators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Stein, do you think it's possible Black Star has some sort of wavelength that's draining my intellect, and making him more intelligent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. That's pure science-fiction,\" Stein says. \"But then again everyone's soul is unique, but I'm sure that's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" Tsubaki sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki, is everything well at home?\" Stein asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Professor. Everything is fine,\" she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsuabki, your words say yes, but your soul says otherwise.\" Stein says. He saw Tsubaki's soul with what looked like stress marks on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your soul, and it's not looking the way I first saw it.\" Stein explained giving a twist to the left to his screw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you'd be best for this kind of talk, Professor.\" She said, \"But what do I have to lose?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is Black Star? Is he still the same at home as he is here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir, he is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm having problems sleeping lately, and it's harder for me and Black Star to use Soul Resonance,\" Tsubaki says. \"Sometimes in my weapon form, I'll be dozing off.\" She said thinking about a recent training activity involving Soul and Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki, Smoke Bomb mode!\" Black Star says. \"Tsubaki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Black Star! I doze off there for a minute,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of problems are you having with your Soul Resonance?\" Stein asked bring Tsubaki back to the present, and awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're having problems entering Enchanted Sword mode,\" Tsubaki said. \"I don't know why this is happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't uncommon for some partners to have this problem.\" Stein said. \"Even the best of partners can lose their ability to synchronize their soul properly after a bitter argument. Maka's mother started to have trouble wielding Spirit when she found he was cheating, even after he begged her for forgiveness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Black Star and I haven't had an argument in a while.\" Tsubak said, \"And he hasn't done anything too bothersome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki, isn't always the meister's fault. Some of the problems Maka's mother had using Spirit was because of his guilt and paranoia that she was going to divorce him and take Maka away from him for good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's my fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying that,\" Stein said. \"Have you ever thought about taking a break from Black Star?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You mean find a new meister?!\" It was impossible for her to think of being someone else's Demon Weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that. I meant just take some time off from each other. It's up to you to chose to be Black Star's weapon, and if you don't want to be anymore, I won't stop you.\" Stein said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki considered the man's words, but shook her head. She was just in a hole, she could pull herself out, and everything would go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you want me to help you with your sleeping problems, I can help you there. Just come by at my lab, and if you don't have anything against lobotomies, you'll be great. But I can't say you'll be missing your appendix.\" The mad scientist says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass, Professor Stein.\" She says. Tsubaki picked up her test paper, and handed it to Stein, who said he'll let this one slide. Tsuabki thanked him, and headed back to her apartment.</span></div></div>",

You're my weapon, that should be the least stressful job in the world.\" He replied. \"But then again, you are the weapon of a big star like me, so I guess it can be hard keeping up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be stressful at times.\" She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, nobody ever asks you for your autograph, so maybe that's why you're stressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's not it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Has someone been bothering you?\" Black Star says. \"Did he try to touch your boobs? Tell me his name, and I'll kick his butt! Nobody touches your boobs but me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say that now,\" Tsubaki replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if it's not a guy though,\" Black Star said ignoring Tsubaki. \"What if it's a girl instead? That's either going to be hot, or.... Tsubaki, is the girl trying to touch your boobs hot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

Am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that, Black Star?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star took a minute to think about another idea. \"Stein's insane if thinks we need time apart. You're obliviously stressed because you haven't been eating enough Kishin souls. Wait, do Demon Weapons get stressed from not eating evil souls?\" He asked Tsubaki, expecting an answer from her. If anybody would know that, it would be her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been away since I've got a nice Kishin egg in my hands.\" Tsubaki says trying to remember the last soul she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Tsubaki. By time we're done, you'll be throwing up souls!\" Black Star declared while striking some sort of pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Professor Stein was wrong.\" Tsubaki thought with a small smile forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being Black Star's weapon isn't the easiest job in the world. Naturally there's going to be a few headache worthy moments down the line, but Tsubaki just powers through them. He can be very headstrong and stubborn at times, but when the situation requires Tsuabki to put her foot down, she will. His ego has gotten him in trouble in the past, but when he does put it aside and focuses on the objective at hand, he can be a very competent meister. When he caused trouble for other people, she would apologize for him when she couldn't get him to. He isn't the most mature member of the DWMA, but it does her heart good when he shows he can be mature. Black Star has a big appetite and can cause huge messes, but Tsubaki doesn't mind cooking for him and likes cleaning, since she's very domestic like that. For what it's worth, being Black Star's weapon can be a huge pain, but Tsubaki is a masochist like that. And some people think she might even be an actual one having to deal with the headaches her meister can cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n For all of his faults, Black Star is her meister, and she's his weapon. It was going to take a lot to break their bond. Most people would of quit and searched for a new partner, but it was going to take a lot to make Tsubaki want to change partners. But the cracks were starting to form, and when they become too noticeable, it may be too late to seal them. How many cracks or how wide the cracks will it take to brake the base of the foundation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass had recently started at the DWMA, and Stein had passed out a couple of worksheets out. Tsubaki figured this is what she needed to get her average up. It wasn't a test, but if it could help she was going to try it. She noticed some students, at least fifteen of them were eyeing Black Star. She figured it was the students he made the bet with. They were going to be in a foul mood when they found out that they lost the bet. Everyone was going to be surprised that Black Star of all people made an eighty. Tsubaki was still surprised, and proud of his achievement, but knew this was going to send him on an ego trip. She had to prepare herself for that. What she hoped she didn't need to prepare for was people asking her about her average if that was released. That might get some rumors that Black Star was actually the smart one, and she didn't need that stress. Black Star on his following ego trip could believe that. And she definitely didn't need that. Then again, she can be paranoid at times, and she's just letting her imagination run wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later lunch, Black Star had his arms behind his head, his feet propped on the desk, and a smug grin on his face. He had a feeling he was going to win the bet, that he just knew he won. When Stein tells him he did pass, that smug meister was going to have him at least nine thousand dollars. \"Hey, Professor Stein,\" Black Star said, \"can we see those test grades?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein saw that grin on his face. \"You want that money don't you, Black Star?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must want those Reaper Chops,\" said one student siting two rows back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star turned around and looked back at the student. \"You better have money ready, or we're going to have a problem.\" He said. \"And that goes for the rest of you too,\" he says to the other students he made the bet with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Star, there's no need for violence,\" Tsubaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how hard I studied? I almost tried to steal the answers from Stein, but I remembered the last time I did that,\" Black Star says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it would get everything back on track, I can just tell you who won,\" Stein said getting their attention. \"Black Star, you made an 80. Congratulations, you won. Now get your money, and focus on your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah, I knew I won! Pay up!\" The blue haired meister proudly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Star made an 80?\" A confused Maka Albarn asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, Black Star,\" said Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the students that made the bet with Black Star was in disbelief. He had a problem with Black Star, losing, and anger issues that his parents and partner made him go to anger management classes to learn how to control his temper. He was doing well so far, but Black Star had a way to make his blood boil. But losing a bet to Black Star, two of his major pet peeves together? A bet that he was sure that he was going to win at that? That was enough to make him lose his cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, just pay him and be done with it,\" his partner said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way that moron made an 80. He can't focus on anything but himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently I can, so hand me my money,\" Black Star said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me, come check the grade book,\" Stein told the student. The sooner everything got back to order, the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student left his seat and walked up to Stein's desk. He found Black Star's name in the grade book. His anger rose more when he saw the test grade and the day before matched up to Black Star's name. \"I... I don't believe it,\" he stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it!\" Black Star said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student's eyes wandered down to Tsubaki's name and saw her grades. Math was one of his best subjects, so he could figure out her average. \"What kind of world is this where that idiot can make an 80, but his partner has a 50 average?\" He said out loud much to Tsubaki's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She groaned while putting her head down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bad, right?\" Black Star asked his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki, what's going on?\" Maka asked her best friend. Black Star passing a test while Tsubaki had a failing average? That made no sense whatsoever <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm under a lot of stress lately, and it's taking a toll on me,\" she replied. The other students were so confused about what was going on. All that they did know was this had something to do with a bet, and that Black Star had a test score higher than Tsubaki's average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students that made the bet with Black Star got up and gave him the money they owed him. All but the one that ratted Tsubaki out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to hand over that money you owe me, or am I going to make you cough it up?\" Black Star asked the ill-tempered student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never! You must of cheated! That's only way you could of passed!\" He shouted. His partner told him to calm down, and remember what he learned at his anger management classes, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't accept that a guy like me best a sore loser like you,\" Black Star said edging the student on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call me?!\" He hated being called that, a loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sore loser,\" Black Star replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to settle this, I'll watch the fight.\" Stein chimed in. He made a note to himself to ask Lord Death to make it against the rules to make bets on test grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I can beat this guy again,\" replied Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Star, just let it go,\" Tsubaki said. She really didn't want to be in a fight now. She didn't have enough Kishin egg souls eaten to give her that little boost of power they give Demon Weapons. She turned to the student that Black Star made the bet with, and apologized for Black Star. Unfortunately for her he wasn't in the mood for apologies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you stupid bimbo!\" He shouted, shocking Tsubaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't talk to my partner like that!\" An enraged Black Star said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be one! She's your partner isn't she? And she must be really stupid to be doing worse than you! And she doesn't seem to mind showing off her goods either, and if those things were bigger, they'd be udders!\" He said pointing at Tsubaki's chest. <b>Note: This kind of goes well with Tsubaki's new design. I work with what I got.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, just calm down,\" his partner replied. \"I'm really sorry about my meister here. He's a really great guy, he just has anger issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're definitely fighting now!\" Black Star says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth demon weapons groaned, and shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought it might be one of those bikinis that were just two straps covering her breasts, or just a really skimpy two piece.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Medusa's 18 years old, and she messed up, big time. Her father, for all intents and purpose will be called Papa Gorgon until I figure a good name for him, had enough of her, disowned her, decided that since she had a hard time as child being able to use magic and her most recent screw up means she's a failure to the Gorgon name. For all he cares, she can be somebody else's problem and property. So he decided to sell her as a slave, not caring who buys her, or what they plan to do with her afterwards. Her fate now rests with whoever buys her. Since she's 18, she never had Crona, but Crona still exists in this alternate universe. Crona's gender and if Ragnarock is fused him/her is up to you, but s/he'll still be loyal to the DWMA. Demon Weapons do exist, and Asura still became the first Kishin. Demon Weapons still were created by Arachne, and still hid herself within the Golem after she ran from both Witches and Lord Death. The only thing different here is she tricked some Witches that weren't the brightest and had time powers to go back in time and the rest pretty much went the same way in the original universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything and everyone is pretty much the same, expect Medusa. Black Star still has his ego, well, I guess it depends on if you do his more developed manga personality. Stein still has a screw in his head, and still dissects things. Lord Death still is the goofball in charge of the DWMA, unless he needs to go back to his old voice, and still Reaper Chops when he's needs to chop an idiot. Spirit still cheated on Kami, and got divorced. Kid still has symmetry on the brain. Blair is still Blair. The sun and the moon still have their faces. Asura's still pants on head crazy, but still locked up in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this universe Medusa's personality is way different from the one we know. Does she still have her snake theme? Yes. Is she still as despicable? Not really. She has some of her original personality, but not all of it. Well, maybe a toned version of it if you want to do that. Does she have a problem with killing people? No, but she would rather people not to be stupid enough get her to do that. Like a snake, don't tread on her or she'll strike. Still a smug snake? Yes. In this universe, she probably would never treat Crona the way she did in canon. In this universe, she's a lot like Maka. This Medusa would of liked her parents paying more attention to her, and not always comparing her to Arachne. If it makes it easier, just imagine a marginally nicer Medusa mixed with Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Medusa sort of looks down on regular humans, due to her father always saying people with magical powers are better. So, she'll say something patronizing every once in a while. Other than that, she's okay with normal people. She has no knowledge of modern human culture. Things like TV, movies, slang words, and pop-culture would make her have face like Stein if you asked him if he could stop dissecting things. She would have no idea what fu*k would mean, or what a blowjob, or titjob is. The only form of sex she knows about is just regular. This would be mainly because of her father. The man had a sneering disgust for anything related to normal humans. Just think about those wizards from Harry Potter that looked down on muggles, and non pure bloods. Good? Now let's move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she's being sold, there is going to be changes. She's been conditioned to obey her master, and will obey with fanatical devotion when she's been order. If you told her to take her clothes off and do a cartwheel naked, it would be like a switch flipped in her head. At first she'd try to resist, but would give up and do it. Eventually her conditioning will get to the point she'd beg to serve her owner(s) or maybe even develop romantic feelings for them/her/him, and even before then she can't harm whoever buys her. She can still use her magic, but only if her master and or mistress tells her she can. She may or may not had her assets expanded to make her more desirable. That's up to you, if she does she'll look like herself, but younger and with a bigger chest and butt. If not, she still looks younger but just no expansion. She might still have her usual outfit, or a skimpy snake themed bikini that's basically two straps that only cover her nipples that are still nearly visible, barely covers her pussy and her butt. Or both if you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll also come with a kit that includes a collar and a leash and potions. The potions can change her, like one of them can do expansions, and one can make her lactate. Here are a couple more besides those you can use. One that will turn her into a cowgirl: horns, bigger breasts that leak milk, and make it where she can only moo. One that will turn her into a bimbo, or one that will have her completely mind controlled. One that'll destroy her mind and leave her as a complete automaton that'll obey. One that can turn her into a catgirl, she'll get cat features, or one that will give her dog features. One that'll increase her libido, her fertility. You can make your own up if you want. And now to the story. She can be anyone's slave. Soul's, Maka's, even Tsubaki's. And make up your reason that got her into this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa just watched as her father signed away her freedom. She was surprised that he would even allow normal humans to buy his daughter. She was hurt that he was doing this, but she was sort of glad that she wouldn't have to see him or her mother again or try to do anything to please them. She thought her mother would do something, but apparently that wasn't going to happen. Come to think of it, Medusa never really liked her parents much. Her mother was more likable than her father, but since her name wasn't Arachne, they wouldn't care. She guessed she knew what was going to happen to Shaula when she messes up to badly. Maybe she'll be bought by the same person that buys her. Next thing she knew was her new owner( s) coming over to her, to pick up the new property. Who was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He let his eyes wonder down to her butt, and took a good look at it. \"I still can't believe I bought the witch that has that.\" He thought to myself. He shut the door behind him, and carried in the box that contained the kit he got with Medusa on the kitchen table. He had a great apartment he thought. It was a bit expensive, and some the weekly allowance the DWMA gives its students wouldn't cut it. He just saved his money up, and had side jobs like most other students had. Buying Medusa did take a lot out of his budget, but he figured he could just work overtime or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can get her to find a job.\" He thought. Where is she anyway? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" She said behind him. Malal turned his head and saw Medusa wearing a sinister grin on her face. She laughed when it made Malal fall to the floor in surprised. The look in his eyes gave her the impression that she nearly gave him a heart attack. \"How are supposed to be my master if you let your slave get the drop on you?\" She asked with smug satisfaction in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that,\" he groaned as he got up. Malal thought he could get her to do that if tricker or treaters came by his apartment during Halloween, but he would probably get calls from mothers about their children being scared for life or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to if I keep doing it? Spank me like a disobedient child?\" Medusa asked. \"Let me get one thing clear. You might of bought me but don't think you're going to do what you want to me as you please. You're never going to break me,\" the snake witch said with a glare that spooked Malal again. \"Just in case you've forgotten, I'm a Witch. You'll probably be a long distant memory in my mind the next two hundred years,\" Medusa said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Malal said trying to regain his nerves. He was never good with women, but he had a feeling this one was going to give him trouble. \"I think it's time to see what's in the box.\" He said opening the kit. He found a note, a collar with a leash, and a medallion attached to a string with some rune on it. Malal looked at the note, and saw it was from Medusa's father. The note explained that the medallion would strengthen Medusa's conditioning to where it needs to be, given it was at it lowest, and could allow Malal to put his personal preferences on it. Under the collar and leash were some bottles. The note said he could use the potions in the bottles to change Medusa if he felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not wearing that.\" Medusa said eyeing the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalal thought that he needed to show a little dominance to her. \"Medusa, look at this.\" He said picking up the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to work.\" She said as she was proven wrong. Her eyes grew heavy and dull, and was ready for orders.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had her in completely enthralled, her compliance wasn't a question.  He knew what he was going to do when she stepped out of line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medusa?\" He said to the witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa replied in a dull voice,  \"Yes, Master? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was surprising. \"I'm going to strengthen your conditioning now, \" he said. He looked at the note for the code words to do so. \"Repeat after me. I am your master. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my master,\" Medusa repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my slave, my property. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your slave, your property. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will obey me with fanatical devotion, and will learn to love the lash when you disobey. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will obey with fanatical devotion, and will learn to love the lash when I disobey. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love to serve me, and will beg for a chance to serve me. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love to serve you, and will beg for a chance to serve you,\" she replied. It was done, but she'll slowly like it. It was the only way to keep her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalal was about to put his personal touch on her conditioning, but then he thought about something. How should he treat her? If he treated her badly, he had an idea about what would happen if she broke free. \"Maybe I should just use her as a maid,\" he thought. \"Yes, that's good. She will be able to help me get back the money I used to buy her.\" He did think about if he was going to have sex with her. Malal was bad enough with women when he tried to flirt, but sex? Who knows how badly he was going to mess up there. He made a note to work on that. Another thing was if he could touch her chest and butt. He couldn't just walk behind her and grope her breasts. Could he? He made a note to work on that as well. \"Just treat her with respect, and don't treat her like an animal, \" he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was time for his own touch. \"Medusa, you're going to be okay with me touching your body. If I want to touch your breasts, at the very least you'd prefer me to ask. \" Malal said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your favorite drink will be my semen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My favorite drink will be your semen, \" she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to allow me to spank you when I want to, and you will like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master, \" she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe sometimes you'll wear that bikini, \" Malal said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Medusa said. Malal though that was enough for the moment. If he had more ideas, he'll do them later. He put the collar on her and snapped his fingers, and broke her out of her trance. \"I hate you, \" she hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I worse than your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa crossed her arms and glared at him. \"I suppose not, \" she replied, \"at least you're not going on about how I'm not my sister. \" she grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Just let me tell you one detail about me. I hate spiders. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel about scorpions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not against them, but I'm not going to squeal like a little girl if I get a stuffed one.

The bottle a picture of a person holding their head with their hands, and no description on it whatsoever. Malal took a glance at Medusa who was sitting on the couch with her arms crossed. He took a quarter out of his pocket, and flipped it. Heads he was going to get Medusa to test this potion, tails he wasn't. The coin landed on heads, and Malal worked towards Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" She asked with her eyes rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could drink this.\" He said offering her the bottle. Much to his surprise, the conditioning was already making her slightly more compliant, and it wasn't even at full effect yet. Medusa took the cork out, and saw the liquid was of a much dark hue of teal than the bottle was. It had sweet, yet mind numbing scent to it. Medusa opened her mouth and found that the potion also had a sweet taste to it too. The taste compelled her to shallow it all, and a minute later all that was left was on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you want? Thanks for the drink, Mast...Master.\" She was still not fully accepting Malal as her master and having trouble to call him that. The mind numbing scent was still lingering inside of her nostrils, and it was getting stronger. Head started to ache, and she was having trouble focusing. \"What was in....that...\" She asked before darkness overtook her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medusa?\" Malal asked the unconscious witch. Malal picked Medusa up and carried her into his room, placing her on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" Asked Medusa as she became conscious again, \"Who are you? Who am I?\" She asked Malal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That potion must have erased her memory,\" Malal thought to himself. \"I wonder if the conditioning is still in effect now that her memory is a blank state.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Master, my head feels so hazy,\" Medusa said in a monotone voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Malal asked wondering what did he just gave her. He took a look at the bottle's picture and saw a woman with a stupid look on her face, but had huge curves. Malal had a pretty good idea on what was going to happen, but his suspicions became true when he read the bottle's description. \"What kind of man would do this to his own daughter?\" Malal thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's chest started to expand, followed by her butt becoming fatter. The expanding flesh left Malal speechless, some blood starting to stain his wrappings around his face near his nose. He let his focus shift to her breasts, and dropped the medallion from Medusa's sight. Her eyes were no longer dull, and became filled with life again. Medusa shook her head, trying to regain focus. It was starting to get hard for her to focus for some reason. She look down at her still expanding chest and could feel the same sensation happening on her backside. She glared at Malal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is going to be fun,\" he thought with a gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to turn me into my mother?!\" Medusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... Never mind,\" the witch said. Medusa felt another sensation from the already present expanding ones. It was lust. Red hot lust. She felt her cheeks becoming bright red, and her clit was becoming wet. She needed something to satisfy her new hunger, and something was in here wrapped up. \"Hey, Mast - I mean Mal,\" she said awkwardly trying to resist the conditioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" He stuttered. He was too busy trying to focus less on her body, an more on how she was going to kill him before the potion took full effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa let one of her hands go down to in between her legs, but pull it up at the last minute. \"How would you like to, like, have sex with me?\" She regrettably said. \"Just take off those pants, and let's head to your room. I don't care if I get pregnant, I can worry about that later. I don't care even if you want me to become pregnant, just put as many kids as you want in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalal rubbed the back of his head. \"I- I mean if you're willing,\" he says nervously. \"Come on, Malal, think of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're in agreement?\" Medusa asked eyeing Malal's crotch. She felt another surge of lust hit her, making her desperate now. \"Please! I'll do anything! I'll wear that collar, and that trashy swimsuit! I'll accept my place as your slave if I need to!\" She begged. Malal couldn't believe that apparently strong willed woman that entered his apartment is now reduced to this. And that she was still growing! She was growing at a very slow rate, but he figured she was probably a DD now. He didn't to admit it, but he was getting turned on by Medusa's begging. \"We don't even have to have sex. Just grab my breasts, or, like, spank me if you want to. Just play with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I, well, Medusa, I would like to, but..\" He said trying to hide the bulge appearing in his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa was trying to regain some focus, and some dignity. She wasn't going to act like her mother that one time she walked in in her parents. There was a pink haze in her mind, making it hard for her to think. \"What did you do to me?!\" The more she tried to focus, the thicker the haze became, and the more she expanded. \"What did you do to me?!\" She demanded again, but with a greater emphasis. She walked up to Malal and tried to wrap her hands around his throat. She still had enough focus to try her hardest to resist the conditioning, but her rage did override it. Malal should of strengthen the conditioning, and he wouldn't have to deal Medusa overcoming the most basic level of her conditioning. She released her Soul Protect, and had some Vector Arrows aimed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Malal frantically said trying say something. He grabbed Medusa's hands attempting to pull her hands off his throat, but felt her arrows press closer to his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?! Sorry, like, doesn't cut it!\" Medusa replied tightening her grip. \"Why do I keeping doing that?\" She thought. As her grip became tighter, she could feel her intellect shrink away faster than before. \"I don't know what you did to me, but I do know,\" she said right before the potion took full effect. Her expression changed from one of murderous rage, to a stupid smile. Her outfit became torn as her expansion hit its final phase. It was way beyond a DD and her butt followed suit. All Malal could tell was that she had a figure that could put a porn star's to shame. \"Like, I don't know!\" Medusa giggled stupidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalal gave a mental sigh as the arrows retracted, and took deep breathes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master!\" Medusa said in excitement as she tackled Malal, grinding her body against his. She rubbed her wet pussy against his cock that was denied freedom only by his pants. He wished she would stop moterboating him so he could breathe more. His wrappings covering his face was completely blood red now. \"I was soooo naughty! I'm such a bad girl! Please punish naughty Bimbo!\" She became confused on that last part. \"Like, what's a bimbo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalal pushed the airhead off of him. \"Just let me breathe!\" He saw Medusa looking at his budge in his pants, drooling at it. \"Oh, you want this?\" He teasingly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totes,\" Medusa says. She dropped to all fours and shook her butt at him. \"Can Bimbo please get it? Like, what's a bimbo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, Medusa.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medusa doesn't understand.\" She said apparently remembering her name. \"Medusa never heard that word before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalal rubbed his head. \"Well, a bimbo usually has blonde hair, a big chest and butt, but isn't really smart.\" He was really explaining what a bimbo was to a bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa gasped. \"That's like me!\" She then gave a high pitch squeal that made Malal cover his ears. \"Medu-sult is going to be the bestest bimbo ever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ears.\" Malal groaned. \"What was that last part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I didn't like my old name, so Bimbo wants to be Medu-sult now,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then?\" He said. </span></div></div>",

However Stein didn't react to it, as he was to exhausted and try to keep his mental stauts in check. Without any words Stein walked around the car and took place on co-drivers seat. Meanwhile Marie sat down on the drivers set and checked, if everything was correct adjusted for her. After this she gave one more look to Stein to see, that he fall asleep.

We can probably put money on that her character will never be expand on later. And we can put that money in her skirt and her chest. *rimshot*  And so I guess we have to make our own guesses. So, let me begin. I had a friend suggested she could be a seductress by belly dancing in front of random people, guys and girls. This could also be a way she tricks Kishin eggs/evil humans that a lick of sense left in them. She's also bisexual, able to produce a special soul wave length that can mesmerize and attract anyone, boy or girl, even prudes. This would match up with her getup. My friend also suggested that maybe she can turn other girls into belly dancers. I think she's probably athletic given that her partner fights as an independent entity in his genie form, and since how can you defend yourself from psychotic demons and witches with a lamp?  You don't. Given the implications that her partner's abilities are very draining, she probably has high endurance. She probably has a lot of confidence in herself if she's okay showing off her body in a belly dancer outfit, and is flirty.<br>\r\nIf you have any great ideas, just put on a chapter, and I'll add it here.</span></div></div>",

There was so much that could have been done with her, as the third Gorgon sister, but she is barely developed at all, her motivations aren't explored, and her relationship with her sisters (or anything about their shared background) isn't shown at all.\" Yeah. It's a shame that she gets beat rather easy in the last episode of the anime, but hopefully we might get something in the Manga as it goes on. But that part about her motivations is slightly wrong. It has been noted that she wants to prove that she's the superior Gorgon sister, and her grudge against the DWMA is rather personal from the information we have now. It's not that solid, but she has mentioned she is \"lonely\", most likely due her being a witch and the percussion that comes along with it. And there's not that much fanfiction of her anyway, so let's make this great. </span></div></div>",

She's Japaneses She must be skilled as a meister to turn Spirit into a Deathscyhte, and it has been noted that she's very clever since she always got top marks in class when she was a student. It has been mentioned in the anime that she's like a grizzly bear. Strong, and short tempered, not a sight to see when she's angry, but also kind, warm, and loyal. So here's my guess here. She looks like an older Maka, and has a more serious personality than Maka. She would probably rip on Spirit when she could, and mentally face palms when he enters the room. She's probably well respect for her skills as a meister and creating a Deathscythe. And for some reason, I like to think she prefers to call Lord Death Shinigami-sama, and the DWMA Shibusen.

And here's a new tidbit I decided to add: slightly masochistic and somewhat submissive. <br>\r\nPsychical appearance: About as tall as Tsubaki yet almost as tall as Stein. <br>\r\nThin figure but not too skinny. No stitches, or screw. <br>\r\nA nice complection, light blue eyes, a cute smile.<br>\r\nNice round breasts, not to big, not too small. About a large bcup almost a C but not quite.<br>\r\nClothes:A long dark brown dress that doubles as a skirt, the upper part has crimson trim around the neckline and end of the sleeves.<br>\r\nBlack sneakers with a small crimson tint,a small obsidian necklace that she got from her mother,and some gloves. Her favorite color is green. <br>\r\nNext: Violet, the second SE OC I made. Also a weapon. I really got to think of a last name for her. <br>\r\nAge: 18. <br>\r\nHeight: As tall as Tsubaki. <br>\r\nPsychical appearance: Black hair, and dark green eyes.<br>\r\nHas a chest that's bigger than Blair's and almost as big as Arachne's. Almost being a key word there. Has slightly pale skin, but still has a nice complexion. Has a bubble butt, but does not have an impossibly thin waistline. Has black lips, but that's from her lipstick. <br>\r\nClothes: Her usual attire consists of a purple shirt that's sort of similar to Liz's, but covers her stomach completely. She wears a black button up coat over that. She has a necklace with a black spade on it, has a braclet with a red diamond on her left hand, a black club on a braclet on her right, black hair, and her shoes have buttons that look like red hearts. She wears black jeans with a silver belt. <br>\r\nPersonality: Violet is a serious, dominant girl. She likes things nice and neat. So, she's a neat freak, but she's not OCD about things. Violet is also a control freak. She is aggressive, and is very straight forward. If she wants something, she will go for it. She can get frustrated easily from idiotic things, or people. She does have problems with expressing her feelings, so she can't just spit somethings out. If she got a crush, she'd probably act shyly. She does not enjoy attention to her body. She's okay with it if it's an accident, but not on purpose. She wants to be noticed for her mind, not her looks. So, she studies hard. When she does get angry, she doesn't express her displeasure through swearing, but rather verbally tearing into the offender, or with her fists. She does actually enjoy being spoiled and pampered a little bit. When it comes to her friends, she'll look out for them. For all her faults she really wants a meister that will treat her right, and turn her into a Deathscythe.<br>\r\nWeapon form: Tommy Gun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I believe that's it.<br>\r\nEdit: 6/2/14: Now this is an interactive about all of the Soul Eater female characters, and the ones from Soul Eater Not!. Yeah, that's it for now. Female Crona is welcomed. </td>",
