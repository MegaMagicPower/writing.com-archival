            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The date is 2144. Location: the Mizar sector in the Gytor system. You are Captain Jack Gunn, the youngest field Captain in the 110th expeditionary division of the 9th star fleet serving under Admiral Zane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 9th fleet has been fighting the Miras-Guhl non-stop for the past three weeks, and your defences are starting to give in. Commanders from the Helios and Regade sectors have reported that their lines have been breached. Within the next few hours the 9th fleet will fall \u2013 the outcome is inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Gunn, report to the bridge immediately, Captain Gunn\u201d, you hear the female voice over the intercom system. Jumping up from the semi-circle of control consoles and electronic displays, you turn your command and control station over to your second in command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep an eye on quadrants E9 and E10, Ace. They love slipping in through there \u2013 I dispatched two drones to those sectors a few minutes ago and your readings should be clear.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning through the corridors of the star destroyer \u201cAmerica\u201d, you cannot help but wonder why the commanders in the bridge would want to see you now. What could be more important than the recognisance and field intelligence work you have been doing for the past 72 hours. Rubbing your red eyes, you are suddenly reminded of how long it has been since you slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scanner beeps as the door to the bridge opens, having read the identification chip in your chest. \u201cCaptain Gunn,\u201d the electronic voice announces as you step onto the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA semi-circle of large portholes line the front and sides of the bridge. Approximately forty personnel members are frantically busy with their consoles. Turning around in his command chair in the centre of the room, the penetrating green eyes of Admiral Zane looks straight at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his early sixties, his age is betrayed by his grey temples and the crows-feet on the sides of his eyes. A respected commander who is decorated with the highest honours of the Old-Earth Alliance, Zane has your respect, and that of the five thousand men serving on the \u201cAmerica\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Zane indicates you to follow him and leads you to his private office on the portside of the bridge. With the door closing behind you he gets straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Gunn, what I am about to tell you could be the salvation for the Old-Earth Alliance. Never before have we come so close to victory, and never before have we come so close to defeat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLighting a cigar, Zane continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you know the 9th fleet is on the verge of destruction. However, our mission has not been in vain. Two days ago a stealth-drone has reported on an extraordinary reading from the Xelesor system. We believe that the signal was emitted from a material on a planet in this system.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlowing a plume of smoke in the air, he continues. \u201cTracking this signal and recovering the material that emits it, has been our goal from the onset of this mission \u2013 being discovered and attacked by the Miras-Guhl has not.<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Gunn, our scientists tell us that this material has the potential to nullify the need for the mineral Pylene since it can generate limitless amounts of energy. It can thereby end the decade long war with the Miras-Guhl, the war that has raged for what we thought was the last remaining energy source.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZane sits down, giving you time to digest the information he had just shared. \u201cFurthermore, an energy source of this nature, will give us the power to dominate over the Miras-Guhl and end their realm of slavery, greed and their blood lust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I suppose you wonder what your role is in all of this,\u201d Zane says easily whilst putting out his cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have four vessels on this ship that can potentially make this journey to the source of the signal. Under the circumstances we will launch all four within the hour with the sole mission to recover the material, and to return it to New-Earth. I say within the hour, because we might not be around much longer after that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, I tell you this because you will be tasked with commanding one of these vessels - your callsign will be Pathfinder seven-zero. Three other commanders are en route to receive the same orders. However, since you are here now, you get to choose which of the three vessels you would like to take on this mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Zane pauses. Taking the gap, you blurt out, \u201cWhy me, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you are one of few commanders with the necessary training and experience to complete this mission,\u201d Zane responds. \u201cAnd besides, most of the best commanders of the 9th fleet have been killed in the past week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to mince words, Zane\u2019s response leaves you feeling slightly insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo here are your choices Captain,\u201d Zane continues flicking a switch on his personal computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChoice one: The HR-122 Black Panther stealth ship. This baby is rigged with the latest and greatest technology. It is almost invisible and your flight should be quick and easy. Three problems though \u2013 firstly, you won\u2019t be able to make it all the way there and back to New-Earth without stopping for Pylene. Secondly, you won\u2019t be able to carry a full assault crew. You will get an Orion Commando, a science and medical officer and yourself. And finally, if you need to mine this mineral from the planet\u2019s surface, you will have to improvise because the ship carries limited surface exploration equipment. This bird can get you there and back in one piece, but getting fuel, tracking the mineral and mining the mineral might be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pilot will be Lieutenant Phil \u201cBuck\u201d Rodgers. He finished top of his class in the Space Force Academy. As you know, the Orion Commando is elite Special Forces, and he will add valuable abilities to your unit. His name is Commander Spengler. He is typical Special Forces \u2013 quiet and reserved. His record is blank. All classified...you decide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChoice two: The F-204 Scythe long range interceptor. Also a good choice. This bird is rigged to fight, but has limited stealth and cloaking abilities. With it, you will however get a full assault crew including six space marines, two Tiger-Cat mechanised units and two heavy-assault Rhino\u2019s. Together with this you will have a science officer, a medical officer, an engineer and off course yourself. This choice will possibly involve contact with the enemy and you might have to search around before tracking the mineral. Also once you find it, mining might be somewhat difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will be able to pilot this ship yourself, but your co-pilot will be an ex-marine named Sergeant Sam Rico. A tough old bastard with hard earned experience. Turned to piloting when he received a mechanized leg after losing his in a fire fight. Good crew \u2013 solid choice. But be sure your balls are strapped on tight if you take this option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChoice three: The CLK-800 Juggernaut  prospector. Not actually a military vehicle. The advantage is that the Miras-Guhl might take it as one of their own and ignore you all together. It has no stealth or cloaking abilities, but it has a fully staffed laboratory with mineral detection add-ons and off course a full spectrum of mining equipment and operators. If you use the Juggernaut, you will find the mineral and mine it quickly and easily. You will also have three construction units. Also, you will be working under a disguise. However, being discovered is not an option since you won\u2019t even be able to destroy a light scout...well maybe a scout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will need a pilot for this one. He is an ex-convict named Betty. You will have to decide for yourself if you can trust him. He might however prove resourceful in avoiding the Miras-Guhl since he has been avoiding the authorities for most of his life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChoice four: The Freelancer 2200. It has numerous empty bays and pylons, a large cargo hold and a two Cyclone Interstellar engines, giving it long range abilities. Again, you will be posing as non-military. Its cargo hold is filled with 100 metric tons of Pylene, which you can either trade or use. As your crew you will have a master tradesman, a language expert, an engineer and an expert navigator. You will be able to pilot the ship yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master tradesman is known as Lord Freemen and he is very good at what he does. He is said to be slightly...well, let\u2019s say mischievous.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sliding in the behind the co-pilot\u2019s controls, you look back over your shoulder to look at your crew. First in line you see Commander Spengler \u2013 the Orion Commando. His face is stern and serious. He is of average dimensions, with blonde hair and intense green eyes with steely determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext in line, the science officer is busy buckling himself up. Officer Malcolm Spencer \u2013 having the IQ of a genius, you can imagine Spencer had already calculated that his chances of surviving this mission was slim to none. His thick, black framed glasses seemed to be a relic of the previous millennium.<br>\r\nYou are surprised to see that your fifth and last crew member, the medical officer, is female. You estimate her to be in her early thirties, and she has an air of confidence about her. She is quite beautiful, but it seems that she has an edge about her \u2013 probably because of too many over-eager soldiers hitting on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrap yourselves in,\u201d pilot Rodgers announces over his microphone. Retuning your eyes to the front, you see the large hangar doors sliding open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPathfinder seven-zero; launch in five seconds,\u201d the mechanical voice of the air-traffic control robot announces. \u201cFour, three, two, one...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine of your ship wines louder and then roares before launching you through the open hatch. The force of the acceleration forces you back into your chair as you speed into empty space. In a distance you see the flashes of a intense fire-fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActivating stealth mode,\u201d Rodgers says. The lights in the cockpit blinks off, followed by a red glow. \u201cStealth mode activated,\u201d the onboard computer announces.<br>\r\nYour invisible stealth-ship slips through empty space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur heading is set Captain,\u201d Rodgers says over your ear-piece. \u201cIt takes us past three possible refuelling points. The first is Hector-Prime...a dirty little planet with not much more than some low-end vagabonds, gamblers and drug-dealers. The odds of finding Pylene on that shit-bucket is low, but not impossible. We shouldn\u2019t find much resistance there however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second is Echo-Centauri. Here we have a high concentration of Miras-Guhl, but also numerous Pylene refineries. With our stealth abilities we should get in easy enough, but securing the Pylene could be cumbersome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast option is Procol-Kilia. It was originally built as a deep space refeuling facility but has since developed into a subsurface city. It usually crawls with both OEA and Guhl spies and therefore we need to be exrtra careful. Because it is subsurface we will have to time our landing taking its day cycle into account. The surface temperature reaches in access of 1000 degrees Celsius in day time, so we might have to hang around in orbit for a couple of hours before we can land. Since it was a refuelling station, Pylene will be easy to get. However to get there we will have to pass through an anomaly known as a Houston-Knox high energy field. Maybe Officer Spencer could tell us more about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...yes...aaah\u201d, officer Spencer starts taken aback by the sudden attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Houston-Knox field is not fully understood yet. It is basically like a cloud of energy with various types and strengths of energy. Experimentations on the fields have provided a huge mass of data, but in many cases the data is contradictory. There is even evidence that the field might influence the time-space continuum. So in short, we have no idea what that field might do to us...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We want to keep a low profile , so let\u2019s head for Hector-Prime,\u201d you say. \u201cBesides, these types of places usually have the low-down on the most important things happening...maybe we could get some valuable Intel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing your orders, Rodgers quickly punches in the coordinates and fires up the engines. \u201cHold on everyone...here we go...\u201d with that the ship smoothly transitions to warp speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApproaching Hector-Prime,\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cInitiating warp drive shut down,\u201d he continues, focussing on the controls in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, the galaxy containing Hector-Prime flashes into view. The ship zooms in on a green planet, the gravity regulator of the ship making the approach and stop effortless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer,\u201d you say, \u201cplanet statistics please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlanet: Hector-Prime,\u201d the computer complies.<br>\r\n\u201cAtmosphere composition:  78.91% nitrogen, 21.85% oxygen, 0.83% argon, 0.38% carbon dioxide, remainder \u2013 trace elements. Atmosphere, breathable.<br>\r\nTemperature: 25 to 35 degrees Celsius. <br>\r\nClimate: high rainfall, humidity 80%<br>\r\nGeology: Sand consisting of Silica, Quartz and  limestone with high levels of organic deposits<br>\r\nVegetation: Tropical \u2013 Triple canopy jungle<br>\r\nLife: Various life forms detected<br>\r\nStructures: Five clusters of structures detected ranging from very small to small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRodgers, take us to the largest cluster of structures\u201d, you instruct. \u201cWe\u2019ll circle and check out the environment before we disengage the ship\u2019s cloak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodgers gently steers the ship forward and prepares to enter the atmosphere. Slipping into a planet\u2019s atmosphere with a cloaked ship is usually pointless, since entry literally causes the ship to catch fire and leaves a nice trail of smoke across the horizon. However, many times it is misinterpreted as a comet or debris from space.  In addition to this, the moment the heat of entry wears off, the ship is invisible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tearing into the atmosphere, the cockpit window turns red from flames licking up from outside. The ship shakes and rumbles\u2026and then it is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, the green landscape rolls by. Thick jungle covers the planet\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny info on this community we\u2019re approaching\u201d, you ask Rodgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called Scorpio\u201d, Rodgers starts. \u201cPopulation approximately one-thousand permanent residents. Mostly small time merchants and traders. A couple of bars\u2026a small star port. Not much more to say. Apparently it is frequented by drug dealers since there is a type of plant they cultivate here that can be processed to produce a drug commonly known as Silk. With the war raging on, nobody has the resources for law enforcement in a distant planet such as this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur chances to get Pylene\u201d, you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that good\u201d, Rodgers answers. \u201cObviously the drug dealers and locals have to refuel somewhere, but it\u2019s usually through local contacts or they fuel up before coming here\u2026so we\u2019ll have to see if we can get lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many units of Pylene do we need\u201d, you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur maximum capacity is thirty tons\u2026I\u2019d say we take as much as we can, because we don\u2019t know when we can fill up again\u201d, Rodgers replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rodgers pulls the ship in a tight left turn. \u201cLady and gentlemen, I give to you Scorpio\u201d, he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking left you see a mushroom-like structure tower out above the jungle. The mushroom, you recognise, is a man-made platform approximately a thousand yards in circumference with a variety of structures clustered on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo one side, you recognise a moderate star port. Rodgers continues the tight turn, making the platform circle below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScan for any signals of communication\u201d, you say, still scanning the structures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly picking up local entertainment stations and low-end encrypted signals\u2026probably the druggies placing another order\u2026definitely no Guhl\u201d, Rodgers responds quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right\u201d, you say. \u201cTake us out so that we can de-cloak without being spotted, and then bring us back for a landing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, the Panther circles the landing pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScorpio air traffic control, this is unregistered merchant ship, permission to land\u201d, Rodgers lies over his microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then\u201d, he says pushing the controls forward for a landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid they say something\u201d, you ask not having heard a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope\u2026I think it\u2019s safe to assume there is no air traffic control facility here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving selected an open launch pad, your ship hangs in a slowly descending hover until it touches down,<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d, you start. \u201cI\u2019m going to do a quick recon of the area. Buck, I want you to stay here and be ready if we need to do a quick lift-off or if we need a pickup. Stephanie, you also stay here. A medical officer is too valuable at this stage of the game to put in the line of fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Spengler and Spencer, you\u2019re not sure which one to take with you on your recon. You are certain that you will need a pair of eyes to watch your back, but you also want to leave a security force on the ship, and Spengler packs a mean punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will you take with you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hot humid air of Hector-Prime fills the hold. Spengler is wearing a heavy leather trench coat to hide the light assault rifle he decided to take along. You are wearing a civilian coverall, with you Gauss pistol strapped to your belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smell spices and food, their odour drifting up from the street bazaars. You also smell the distinct odour of Silk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave the ship, you see a bar at the opposite end of the strip of launch pads. A wooden carved sign reads \u2018The Jungle Room\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s check that place out\u201d, you say to Spengler and the two of you make your way over. Having an Orion Commando at you back, does put you at ease. Knowing that Spengler could single-handedly clear out the bar if he has to, is good to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking your watch, which is connected to the ship\u2019s central computer, you press the \u2018Local Time\u2019 button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen forty five a.m. and the bar is in full swing\u201d, you say with a smile. \u201cThese are party-people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpengler doesn\u2019t comment as the two of you walk in through the saloon -style swing doors. The inside is dark and a thick could of smoke hangs under the ceiling. A number of scruffy characters dot the tables. The bar is hot and the smell of many years of spilled drinks and stale alcohol fills your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far corner you see an Ar-Kwan alien sitting in one of the corners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A large and usually peaceful specimen, the Ar-Kwan originates from uncharted space beyond the outer rim. Having found the human occupied reaches of the Universe in complete disarray and saturated with war, they showed no interest in further interaction with humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies resemble the humanoid shape, but their faces look reptilian. Their hides are formed by layers of scales making them very resilient to high temperatures. As with earthly reptilians, they also don\u2019t cope with cold temperatures very well. When amongst humans, they also dress typical humanoid garbs, but it is said that they have no need for clothing when on their home planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for a small number that trade and travel in human occupied space, they are for the most part, rarely seen.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background, a lazy tune contributes to the laid-back, if somewhat ominous feeling in the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo of those\u201d, you say walking up to the counter, pointing at the house brew. The fat, bald bar tender expertly grabs two glasses and fills them with green liquid from the \u2018house\u2019 vat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about this\u201d, Spengler asks nodding at the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe gotta blend in if we want to get a feel for the place\u201d, you say easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBottoms up\u201d, you say and take a big swing. The bitter green liquid is cool and strangely refreshing. After more than three days of battle stress on the America, you don\u2019t see anything wrong with a tiny bit of R&amp;R while still doing your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, you feel the buzz of the \u2018house brew\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d you ask Spengler, seeing that he hasn\u2019t touched his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s Pylene we\u2019re after, I\u2019m thinking we should talk to the Ar-Kwan\u201d, he replies. \u201cThe only reason he can be here is for trading \u2013 he\u2019s definitely not a tourist. And seeing that he\u2019s a trader, he will have some connections for getting Pylene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the barman\u201d, you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose\u201d, Spengler says scanning the bar with his steely eyes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Ar-Kwan looks up, and says in a raspy voice,\" Ah, my great-great-great grandfather built this place. In his time, there was a great war called \"The War of The Dark Age\". My great-great-great grandfather and a couple of other survivors fled to seek safety after their town was destroyed. He was selected to lead them and he rebuilt a new town.

We were treated like, like a royal family!\" His face darkened. \"Well, that was until then my father...made a mistake, and since then, we were never treated with respect again.\" His expression clearly states that he does not want to be asked what his father had done. You look at Spengler. He obviously doesn't give a shit. \"By the way, what's your name?\" you ask. \"My name is...\" Suddenly, a deafening explosion fills your ears and you feel a sudden feeling of weightlessness, before feeling something that people in the Old Earth Alliance will always feel, pain. You then hear gunfire and Spengler shouting,\" Sir! We are under attack!\" You look around and see a shit heap of metal around you. \"Sir, need a little help here!\" Spengler shouted again. You climb out of a broken window to see bullets flying, the Ar-Kwan hiding behind a rock and Spengler behind cover, firing blindly at the hostiles. \"Miras-Guhl assholes, how the hell did they know we were here?\" Spengler shouted when he saw you. You ran into cover beside Spengler. \"10-plus foot mobiles, and I've called for air support but it won't be here before 10 minutes and it can't fit into the elevator, what do we now sir?\" \"We need to get the Pylene and get the hell outta here!\" You shouted as you fire at the enemy.

Atmosphere, breathable.<br>\r\nTemperature: 25 to 35 degrees Celsius. <br>\r\nClimate: low to high rainfall, humidity 5% to 80%<br>\r\nGeology: Sand consisting of Silica, Quartz and  limestone with high levels of organic deposits<br>\r\nVegetation: Desert to Jungle<br>\r\nLife: Various life forms detected<br>\r\nStructures: Numerous clusters of structures detected, mostly mining of military \u2013 all structures belonging to the Miras-Guhl.<br>\r\nGeneral: Planet\u2019s geology, climate and atmosphere almost identical to that of Old Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d, you say rubbing your chin. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll do is patrol one of the main transport routes on the surface. Once we have identified a Pylene transporter, we\u2019ll take it down, scavenge the Pylene supplies and stock up. Our stealth cover should enable us to do so undetected. Then we\u2019ll do a quick airborne strike on a mining facility, obviously also under stealth cover, and acquire the needed mining tools and then we\u2019ll be out of here...any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew looks at you with bland expressions, seemingly unimpressed with the simplicity of your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrew\u201d, Buck says easily, \u201cprepare for atmosphere entry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he directs the ship towards the planet below. Soon the ship shoots like a burning meteor into the planet\u2019s atmosphere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping below the light cloud cover, you see green jungle speeding past on the planet\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight Buck\u201d, you instruct your second in command. \u201cSet a course for a transport route between two of the major military and mining facilities. Let\u2019s see if we can find a Pylene transporter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe seem to be in luck sir\u201d, Buck replies. \u201cWe have a Pylene transporter up ahead with a single escort. The payload should be in the order of twenty tons. Shall we proceed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d, you reply. \u201cApproach the target from behind and engage. I want you to track the escort and dispense of him using a Viper missiles. Then we can take the transporter down with the Reaper-cannon. That way we don\u2019t blow the Pylene to dust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRodger\u201d, is all Buck says before engaging the weapons system. He starts tracking the bogey. A schematic image of the enemy escort, known as a Wasp, appears on your screen. It\u2019s sleek lines and deadly weapons combinations make it the premier fighter in the Guhl inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMissile lock\u201d, he says. \u201cFiring now...missile away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the missile hits the Wasp escort, you see it diving and dodging wildly. It must have seen the incoming missile. Fortunately it too late and the missile tear the enemy escort apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for the transporter\u201d, you say. \u201cActivate the reaper cannon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracking the transporter, the Reaper cannon starts firing accompanied by a load buzz. Energy rounds extend a trail up to the transporter and then tears into its rear. The tail fins of the boxy transport ship are ripped apart. Black smoke erupts from the ship and it starts losing altitude rapidly. Dropping down it plummets into the jungle below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey never had a chance\u201d, you say proudly tapping your armrest, your pride of the Black Panther clearly visible on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s drop down and get that Pylene\u201d, you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuck complies and swings the ship around to land at the crash site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re receiving a priority message on a secure frequency, sir\u201d, science officer Spencer says from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut it on\u201d, you reply surprised to be receiving any type of transmission at this stage.

Crashing into the ground ten feet from where you were standing, you shake your head and look up to see a Guhl search-and-destroy patrol coming down the slopes of the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetcalfe and his men jump into action, firing their Gladiator assault rifles.<br>\r\n (You\u2019ve always liked the Gladiator assault rifle. Unlike the Jackhammer used by the marines, it\u2019s not an energy weapon. It fires synthetically augmented alloy rounds that is claimed to have much more penetrative power than energy rounds. In general, it resembles a heavy machine gun, but with much more punch than the ones used on Old Earth way back when. In addition, it is fitted with a mechanised spike-teethed bayonet that extends past the barrel. When activated the blade vibrates at supersonic speed and can cut through most types of armour,)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the machine guns pouring fire on the approaching Guhl, you scramble to your feet and run back into your ship. Cling-clang noises echo through the ship as bullets bounce off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrab your shit\u201d, you scream over the gunfire. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading the way down the ramp, your crew follows in staggered trail formation, everybody hunched over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWielding your Gauss pistol, you take a few pot shots as you run. Diving for cover behind a rock formation, you see Spengler grabbing a Gladiator from a fallen soldier. He ducks in beside you and fires over the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first burst of fire hits two approaching Guhl in the chest. His second spray takes down another one. He\u2019s definitely Special Forces, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being a trench soldier yourself, you decide to follow his lead as he makes his way to the line of infantry men fighting off the Guhl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud of dust puffs up as you fall down next to him and fire three rounds with your pistol in rapid succession. You realise you\u2019ve lost the rest of your crew. No time to regroup now, you think as bullets zip over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse this\u201d, Spengler says as he throws you an assault rifle taken from another dead soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bullets fly past and it feels like time slows down. Ten feet from the open ramp, you dive head first into the open cargo door. Executing a perfect roll, you hit the floor running and slide in behind the controls, stepping over the dead pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullet holes riddle to cockpit window. Quickly you flick various power switches on and fire up the engines. Looking back over your shoulder, you see Spengler giving the Guhl hell through the open cargo door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship lifts off blowing up a thick cloud of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the controls forward, the hovering ship tilts over and speeds away. Sweat pearls on your forehead as the expectation of an anti-aircraft missile up your tailpipe flash through your head. Then you slip over the valley ridge and away from the deadly reach of the Guhl missiles. You breathe a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the navigation computer, you see the location of a tank platoon close by, with a unit name of Dragon-61.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon 61, Dragon 61, this is Dagger-five\u201d you say using Metcalfe\u2019s call sign. \u201cWe\u2019re in contact with the asshole-squad and need some assistance\u2026standby for a single tank pick-up\u201d, you finish not wanting to waste the time of picking up three tanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger Dagger-five\u201d, you hear the platoon leader comply. \u201cOne tank standing by for your pick-up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later you land in front of the tank formation. As you touch down a Centurion tank rumbles up the ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A nasty piece of armament, the Centurion tank is famous for wreaking havoc and sowing mass destruction when operated by an experienced crew. With gigantic fibre reinforced wheels allowing all-terrain mobility, its rapid-fire main gun can expel three high explosive slugs per second complemented by two powerful mini-guns.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll systems are five-by-five\u201d, the tank commander says with a heavy cowboy-drawl over the radio. \u201cPoint us in the right direction and we\u2019ll unleash hell.\u201d You smile and return your eyes to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the Mule up, you engage the afterburners and speed back to the valley. Within minutes you pass over the valley\u2019s ridge and approach the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo missiles, please, no missiles\u201d, you whisper, again sweating profusely. An alarm starts blaring. Then you see a smoke trail reach up from the ground. A shot of adrenaline flushes through your system. Banking the Mule hard, you release countermeasures. The missile streaks closer\u2026then it passes by harmlessly - confused by the countermeasures you released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing in on ground zero, you swing the ship around and land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYee-haw\u201d, you hear as the Centurion launches out the cargo hold, guns flaring. Over the radio you can hear the tank commander calmly directing his gunners and driver. Looking back you enjoy the spectacle as high explosive shells rain over the enemy. Within minutes, the battlefield is a crater riddled patch of scorched earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood job, Captain\u201d, you hear Metcalfe say over the radio, clearly relieved. \u201cYou saved our hides today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of your chair, your coveralls are drenched in nervous sweat. You walk down the ramp and breathe easily. It feels like a weight has been lifted from your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have bad news, Captain\u201d, Metcalfe says as he approaches. \u201cExcept for Commander Spengler, the rest of your crew has been eliminated\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetcalfe gives you a few seconds to digest the news before continuing.  \u201cWe\u2019ve received reports from the frontline. Apparently losses were high due to mobile anti-aircraft crews \u2013 just like the one that was part of this search-and-destroy patrol. Apparently the bomb run was not as effective as we had hoped.

Warp speed immediately to lessen our detection\u2026and continue on through quadrant E9. I dispatched drones through those sectors just a short time ago \u2013 they showed all clear. We should proceed safely and without being noticed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisibly startled, Sergeant Rico requests clarification, \"Do we need to obtain Admiral Zane's approval before I adjust the appropriate coordinates?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" you reply firmly. \u201cI am mission-commander, Sergeant. Zane informed me that our scientists had a reading from Xelesor which is what this mission is for and it's our goal to find the material, no matter what it takes! So be prepared for a fight with the Miras-Guhl if necessary.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Rico flips up the cover to expose the track of blinking lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are ready to engage, Sir. Warp-speed transition locked - ON. Hold steady, now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing their arms in place, the crew anticipates a steady increase in speed, however the jolt of power nearly makes it impossible to adjust their heads to a more comfortable position. A brief surge, and the F-204 Scythe is cruising at its' maximum speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re a couple of hours from our destination,\u201d you say looking at your crew. \u201cI expect a full report from each section before we get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere moments after sitting down in your chair, the engineer, Thomas Eldersen approaches you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, some of the emergency exit lights went out when we were thrust into warp-speed. It causes me concern because the circuits are interconnected with the limited stealth features and the science laboratory.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a glance to your science officer, you wait for confirmation that all electrical outlets are in working order. Without being asked the science officer responds, \"Sir, nothing here seems to be out of the ordinary. I will run a diagnostic check to verify the laboratory is working as it should be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, you sit back in your chair. \"What, if any, problems encountered with warp-speed do you have to report from the medical section Dr Jacobs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No injuries here, Sir!\" Jacobs replies, seemingly happy with his section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you sit in silence. What could go wrong with the stealth and cloaking appliances if Eldersen is right, you wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to the present, you address your crew. \"Listen up everyone, I need your feedback,\" you request without specifically addressing anyone in the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The signal emitted from Xelesor system is strong. Does anyone here have experience working with the material we're looking for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir, We do, Sir!\" three of the six space Marines respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I only get three then I can work with that, you think to yourself sighing with relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the three of you to enter as much as you know into that database right now. It will scan each of the planet surfaces for material already found and compile a tracking order for us to update. Other information will be forthcoming from Admiral Zane. The rest of you get to work, we don't have all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwivelling your chair around, you face Rico. \"Sergeant Rico, what's the status of the HR-122 Black Panther stealth ship, the CLK-800 Juggernaut prospector and the Freelancer 2200? We may need their assistance if they are within our sector and have the ability to offer current information about the Miras-Guhl.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Science officer, how much time do we have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy my calculations we should have approximately on hour before they start tracking us sir\u201d, the Science officer replies over the intercom system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t leave us with much time\u201d, you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead for the nearest mine\u201d, you instruct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRico sets the navigation computer and the Scythe slips though the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE.T.A. five minutes, sir\u201d, Rico replies. \u201cI\u2019m engaging the jammers so that they can\u2019t send a may-day to the military bases when they see us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll military units, stand by\u201d, you say over your mike.<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we hit the ground, I want you to disembark in combat formation. I want the Rhino\u2019s to take the lead and pop through the fence. There you stop and cover our approach. The two Tigercats will follow and lead the way to the main building. Three marines stay with the ship. The other three press through and secure the entrance to the main building at the service entrance. You open the doors from inside and the two Tigercats go in and secure the workshop. Once all is clear, we adios the equipment we need. Any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no questions you continue, \u201cRemember, these miners are Miras-Guhl. We shouldn\u2019t encounter much more than light gunfire resistance, but keep your eyes open and watch your backs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later the Scythe blows up clouds of dust as it settles onto the flat plain at the edge of a small mining facility. In a distance the sun is approaching the horizon and you realise it will set within the hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe facility is simple, with four small structures scattered around a larger main building. The main building has a massive tower stretching into the sky above it. The entire facility is surrounded by a low-tech fence. The scythe touches down just outside the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the cargo hold with a small pulse rifle and light body armour, you watch the mechanised units and marines with anticipation. As the cargo ramp touches the ground, the first Rhino steps onto the desert sand. Seconds later its cannon fires and a sentry tower close by explodes. The second Rhino unit is close behind the first. You see it paining the communications tower with its laser designator before it too fires its cannon destroying the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rhinos pan out and walk towards the fence, their footsteps accompanied by the signature sound as the mechanics in their legs work. The TigerCats step out behind them. They also start firing short sporadic bursts at security personnel. Empty shells pour out the sides of their arms as their six-barrel mini guns buzz angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rhinos easily trample the fence and hold position, still searching for targets. The TigerCats walk past them and approach the main building. Moments before they stop, three of the marines run from the Interceptor. As always, you are amazed at how fast they can move while wearing the bulky mechanized armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning up to a personnel door, one of the marines fires his Jackhammer. The heavy weapon coughs once, obliterating the door in a thousand pieces. The three marines disappear into the building. You hear the muffled sounds of a Jackhammer firing inside the building. Moments later the large service door rolls open. The TigerCats step inside and start firing, tearing the inside of the building apart. You hope they don\u2019t damage any of the mining equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gunfire stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll clear\u201d, you hear in your earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your gun up, you run over to the building with your science officer and engineer in close pursuit. As you run into the mine\u2019s workshop, you find the walls riddled with bullets. A few dead bodies are scattered on the floor. In the centre of the floor, you see a Locator, Mining and Construction Unit or LMCU \u2013 exactly what you will need if you want to prospect for shallow to mid-range minerals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt resembles a massive truck, but one that can deploy to form a drilling rig. With favourable soil conditions it can also act as a subterranean vehicle. In addition to this it has four small drones on the back, each approximately the size of a car.  The airborne drones can fly around and hover and with mechanical arms and a range of equipment they can be used to perform various construction and mining tasks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck if all systems are functional and find some spare parts to take along\u201d, you instruct your engineer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSergeant, I want your men to secure the complex for the loading of the equipment\u201d, you say over your mike to the Marine commander. \u201cWe have to be out of here in twenty minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck if there is anything else here that might be useful\u201d, you say to your science officer. All seems to be going according to plan. This might just work, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, I\u2019m detecting a signal being transmitted from the mine below you\u201d, you hear Rico on your earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems they are using a fixed line for communication, which means we can\u2019t jam it. If it is linked to one of the military bases, the Guhl is going to be on our asses double quick. I recon we have two minutes before they scramble their birds and another five for them to get here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to spare, you realize that you have three options to choose from:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The enemy marines used plasma grenades to blow their own hole in the fence. Three of them come through in triangle formation scouting ahead. You see two snipers covering them from the smashed fence. <br>\r\nYou whisper into your mouthpiece.\"Get me two Marines up here for cover and get a Rhino on the far side of the compound.

Move!\" <br>\r\nA moment later, \"were ready sir.\" <br>\r\n\"Fire!\" you yell. A screaming bullet comes rocketing out of the sky and blasts between the enemy snipers. One you see is killed instantly and the other is blasted off his feet. Your Two Marines move in and soon the triangle formation is nothing but corpses.<br>\r\n\"Sir.\" your engineer says in your ear.\"Were ready.\" Great. You can leave. But what about the fifteen Marines left. They could pursue you in their ships. You\u2019re left with three options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you run into the open, gunfire rips the ground apart around you. Blue pulses fly past your head. Suddenly you realise that you can be taken out any second by a lucky round.<br>\r\nLooking back over your shoulder, you see the TigerCat opening up on the marines that are firing on you. It\u2019s red tracer rounds kick up a dust could infront of the firing marines and they have to dive for cover. This gives you the precious seconds you need to make the ramp of the Scythe.

Quickly you place the headset on. Immediately the red cross on the heads up display follows your head movement to point in the direction you are looking. You aim the red cross directly at the line of marines and press the fire button on your controls. Immediately you can hear a loud roar as the Vulcan cannon erupts outside the ship. A powerful stream of plasma rounds cross the sky between you and the enemy. It cuts the approaching lines to shreds. With a steady hand you walk the fire of the cannon across the enemy line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eye catches another rocket streak across the sky. It obliterates the last Guhl aircraft. Returning your focus to your gunfire, you release the fire button. The area in front of you is left in a cloud of smoke and dust...no movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll fighting units keep on guard.

Bright green plasma rounds cough from guns one and two and streak across the sky towards the first fighter. They explode with a green flash against the fighter\u2019s shields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned at what had just happened, the pilot wildly jerks his craft up and down to avoid the incoming fire. From his actions you can tell he had no idea he was being fired upond. The three fighters turn in a tight arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose idiots just realised the Guhl is on our tails\u2026what a bunch of daft wankers,\u201d Betty growls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you realise that the Juggernaut\u2019s sensors detected the enemy long before the fighters did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet those assholes thought the fire came from the Guhl\u2019s ships,\u201d Betty continues with a grin, following the tight turn of the escorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll fire a couple of rounds at them, making sure I don\u2019t hit them,\u201d Betty says, firing a wild spray of rounds over the escorts as they approach the attacking Wasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds a wild fire fight breaks out. Random rounds streak across the sky and Betty fights his controls, trying to navigate the Juggernaut over, under of away from the cannon fire all around you. Being pulled back and forth in your chair, you get the idea that the wild manoeuvres of your ship must look something like an elephant trying to walk the tightrope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize Betty was right. It saddens you to see the Wasps taking out your escort one by one. As the last ship of the Old Eart Alliance is blown from the sky, the Wasps quickly turn their attention to your prospector ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll see if the id-chip your grease-monkeys installed in my ship will fool these assholes,\u201d Betty snarls, puffing a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of a mean-looking son-of-a-bitch flickers on the screen in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJuggernaut, Juggernaut, this is Miras-Guhl Wasp \u2013 identify yourself,\u201d you hear in your earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasp, this is Juggernaut, thanks for saving our tails,\u201d Betty says in a weak voice over the microphone. \u201cWe\u2019re private miners on our way to Kepler for supplies when these bastards jumped us. It seems they wanted to use us for target practise\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further warning, you see the Juggernaut\u2019s computer registering a scan on your cargo hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo much for inter-galactic space law,\u201d you say referring to the Guhl\u2019s disregard to ask for permission before scanning your ship. Betty looks at you sideways as if you are speaking an unknown language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunching buttons on an electronic box taped to the side of the communications console, Betty busies himself with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what the shit-f\u2019r-brains-squad is saying,\u201d he mumbles before hacking in to their closed communications system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your ear piece you can hear the Wasp pilots talking. \u201cI\u2019ve never see the Old Earth Alliance attack privates for no reason. I think they\u2019re lying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what,\u201d another responds. \u201cWho gives a shit why they were firing on each other, at least we know they\u2019re no O.E.A. and the scan confirmed that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the third voice says. \u201cBut what do we do with them now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to blow their asses out of the sky, but we don\u2019t have time to mess around,\u201d the first voice says. \u201cThe ninth fleet of the O.E.A. is falling and we need to report back to base\u2026I\u2019ll fire a tracking beacon and report it to Intelligence and that will be that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Betty is smiling. \u201cThe oldest trick in the book,\u201d he says puffing his cigar again. \u201cThey think they can stick a tracker on our ass and \u2018that will be that.\u2019 Stupid bastards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of this sector and report to Kepler,\u201d the Wasp pilot says again before the formation fires up their engines again, and flies off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do we disable the tracker,\u201d you ask looking at Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I happen to have a little gizmo that can do that as well,\u201d he says getting up.<br>\r\n                                       <br>\r\n                                                ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you find yourself in the ship\u2019s laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is how it\u2019s done,\u201d Betty says very pleased with himself, dropping the tracker on the table. The tracker looks like a metallic disc the size of a saucer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we need to decide what next, Cappy,\u201d Betty says looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can either attach this to a decoy and shoot it off in space while we keep on course towards the Destination, or we can keep it with us and fly to Kepler and drop it there. Just bear in mind that Kepler is crawling with the Guhl and we\u2019d better have our balls strapped on tight if we\u2019re going to stick our necks in there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Betty looks at you with a furrowed brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said get the hell out of here\u201d, you repeat yourself with urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once Betty turns to his controls and prepares the ship for warp drive. Outside you see plasma rounds passing the ship. A direct hit on one of the escorts sends it up in flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going,\u201d he yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnywhere\u201d, you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the fire drawing closer to the Prospector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d, you scream. \u201cNow!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Betty still punching in coordinates and doing calculations, you realise he\u2019s taking too long. Outside the cockpit you see a blue streak coming from one of the Wasps. A torpedo. You realise you only have seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you slam down the warp drive accelerator, hoping that the auto-navigation system will steer you clear from any obstacles in your path. The ship sputters and coughs and then with a couple of powerful leaps is transitions to warp drive. The last thing you see is the shocked look on Betty\u2019s face as you slip away into the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later the ship decelerates, and you slow to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do\u201d, Betty asks alarmed, checking the ships status. You\u2019re not sure if he\u2019s upset because you launched the ship into an uncharted course or because he\u2019s afraid of what might have happened to his \u2018baby\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, track current location\u201d, you say wiping the cold sweat from your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTracking location\u201d, the computer complies and you can see the artificial intelligence light flicker as the ship\u2019s computer tries to figure out where it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLocation Unknown\u201d, the computer finally announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith confused looks, you and Betty stare at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard any ship say that before\u201d, Betty says applying himself to the controls again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me run a quick diagnostics check\u201d, he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiagnostics check complete\u201d, the computer replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProblem identified in avionics systems\u2026 Navigation computer non responsive\u2026 Repairs needed\u2026\u201d the computer concludes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaah Shit\u201d, Betty growls. \u201cNow look what you did\u2026we\u2019re out in the middle of nowhere, with a busted nav-computer. What the hell do we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, give me a level five life scan\u201d, you command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCannot comply\u201d, the computer responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a mining ship\u201d, Betty says lighting another cigar. \u201cIt can\u2019t give you a scan any higher than level three, which means you will only be able to detect life in a three hundred light-year radius\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what it means\u201d, you say slightly irritated. \u201cComputer, give me a level three life scan\u201d, you try again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you see the artificial intelligence processor working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife detected\u201d, the computer announces, almost with a hint of victory. \u201cPlanet unknown\u2026Life specifics unknown\u2026flight time to planet, three seconds at warp speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSet course for Unknown planet\u201d, you instruct the computer while smiling at Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you smiling at, Cappy? We\u2019re still lost in space with a broken nav-computer\u2026\u201d  Biting down on his cigar, Betty fires the ship up and you set off to the Unknown planet.  A minute later, you enter a static orbit around the greenish planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, planet statics if you please\u201d, you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetecting warning beacon\u201d, the computer replies. \u201cDownloading high priority message from beacon\u2026.Message follows:  This is a recorded transmission\u201d, you hear the voice over your computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have reached planet Gefahr. This planet is highly contaminated with various toxins, microbial and radio-active materials following the hundred-year war between the Slooth and the Quasi-Kahr rogue factions of the Miras-Guhl. The planet is under quarantine and entry is strictly prohibited. Further to this, severe contamination of humans remaining on the planet has caused gross mutations. These beings are severely hostile and aggressive. Do not proceed, I repeat, do not proceed to enter the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Transmission ends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there is silence as you and Betty digest what was said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, check database for information on planet Gefahr\u201d, you say still feeling a cold shiver up your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlanet: Gefahr,\u201d the computer complies.<br>\r\n\u201cAtmosphere composition:  78.91% nitrogen, 21.85% oxygen, 0.80% argon, 0.32% carbon dioxide, 0.018% strontium-90, 0,002% caesium-137, 0,01% botulins, 0,01% fremolins,0,005%  cysozins, 0,005% unidentifiable complex molecules . Atmosphere highly toxic.<br>\r\nTemperature: 5 to 35 degrees Celsius. <br>\r\nClimate: desert landscape<br>\r\nGeology: Sand consisting of Silica, Quartz and  limestone <br>\r\nVegetation: none, all indigenous life on planet is extinct<br>\r\nLife: Small number of human life, Unidentifiable life forms also detected, <br>\r\nStructures: Numerous vacant city centres and military bases.\u201d<br>\r\n History: Planet is best known for the hundred year war that raged between the Slooth and Quasi-Kahr factions. The war raged before the emergence of anti-matter weapons and therefore more conventional weapons of mass destruction for that period was used, all but destroying the planet completely. High levels of biological and hot-particle contamination has caused the planet to be black-listed and it has remained under quarantine for eighty-four years since the end of the war. Survivors are said to live in underground bomb shelters. They come out at times to scavange the wasteland. Due to its reputation, the planet is commonly also referred to as Graveyard, Necropolis and Darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Betty, you can tell he shares your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer\u201d, you say again, \u201cList closest known planet with life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClosest planet with life is Xannon. It is within range of this ship and our current fuel supply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, with the information at your disposal, can you plot a course for Xannon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNegative, Captain. With the navigation computer out of order, we will not be able to plot a course for Xannon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA string of swear words escape Betty\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer\u201d, you try again, \u201ccan you identify the problem with the navigation computer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u201d, the computer responds. \u201cThe diagnostics procedure shows that a single component known as a synchropter-chip is unresponsive. This is a common component in many navigation computers for the past hundred years. There is a 84.32% possibility of finding such a chip in any of the derelict war craft on the surface of Gefahr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you sit in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we have in terms of protective clothing\u201d, you ask Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have four mechanised combat-armour suits in the hold with full environmental shielding capacity\u201d, Betty says. \u201cIn addition we have four Jackhammer assault rifles and a couple of high explosive grenades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about surface transport for reconnaissance\u201d, you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a Surface Carrier And Transport or SCAT vehicle that can carry four people. It resembles a golf-cart on steroids and is mostly used for short range expedition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at Betty, you see he realizes the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 let\u2019s go get us a syncropter-chip\u201d, he says as he prepared the ship to enter the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been one to shy away from a challenge\u201d, he says with smoke drifting out of his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prospector comes to life and leaves its orbit. It accelerates toward the planet until it is consumed in a ball of flame as it enters the atmosphere. Shaking through re-entry, you soon emerge on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGefahr is an ugly planet. Miles and miles of desert stretch out in front of you, with a greenish smog filling the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve detected a city close by. Alternatively there is also a military base\u201d, Betty says. \u201cWhich one shall we try first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Flying over its massive boundary walls you see it is riddled with dilapidated gun turrets. The streets are empty scattered with rusted car wrecks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead for the city centre\u201d, you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just use the scanners to see if we can locate life\u201d, Betty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Cause most if not all of the subterranean bunkers will be shielded for radiation and that means our scanners won\u2019t be able to probe inside...but you can try it for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the scanners Betty soon confirms your suspicion. \u201cYup, countless underground structures, all lined.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll drop in the middle somewhere and do some ground recognisance\u201d, you reply. \u201cMy guess is that any hardware that was left out there would have been raided by the survivors long ago. So we need to see if we can find life and bargain with them for the required equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we run into the alleged mutants first\u201d, Betty asks without a hint of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re taking the Jackhammers with and why we\u2019re not stopping unless we find what we\u2019re looking for\u201d, you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly in amongst the sky scrapers. A spooky atmosphere hangs over the abandoned city like a thick dark cloud. You wish you didn\u2019t have to get out there and run around in the streets dodging crazed mutants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLand over there\u201d, you say pointing to a landing pad surrounded by a razor-mesh fence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Juggernaut turns tightly and sinks down on the landing pad, blowing clouds of dust and sand. Betty flicks the controls off and the engines wind down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, you see the sun in the three o\u2019clock position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should have at least two to three hours of daylight left\u201d, you say. \u201cIf we can\u2019t find anything by then, we\u2019ll get back to the ship and go camp out somewhere in the middle of nowhere for the night and try again tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of you get up and head for the cargo hold. Without speaking a word, you both put on the mechanised combat armour. The colour of the armour matches the red-brown colour of the Juggernaut. You\u2019re not sure if it is intentional or pure coincidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve always been amazed at how light and snug the combat armour was, enabling fast running and easy movements, while providing the mechanised muscle to lift the equivalent weight of a small car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoading the Jackhammers, your confidence increases another notch. The weapon fires a heavy-energy round that looks like a blue bolt of light. It can rip though a wall or a car and firing on full automatic, a few well aimed rounds can even pound light-armoured vehicles into submission. Your ammo counter reads five hundred rounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Checking the SCAT-vehicle, Betty confirms that it\u2019s fully charged and should give you approximately five hundred miles before needing a recharge. It has four open-air seats and a small cargo hold in the back. On its corners it has four large, heavy tracked all-terrain wheels. You both get in and Betty seals off the rest of the ship, preparing to let the outside air into the cargo hold and lower the cargo door ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ramp lowers down. The green-grey air fills the cargo hold, and outside the ramp lowers onto the cracked landing pad. Betty starts the engine, and the SCAT vehicle roars to life. With your weapon ready you scan for a threat...but the streets are empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone tumble weed rolls by in a dry desert gush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d, you say over the helmet microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SCAT rolls down the ramp and onto the tarmac. Betty accelerates through the open gate and into the city streets. Behind you, you notice the cargo ramp lifting up and the ship\u2019s security systems activate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving through the city streets you soon realise that it is going to be harder to find something than you had anticipated. There are no signs of recent movement. Everything is covered in layers of sand and it seems that not even the cockroaches survived the planet\u2019s ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead you notice movement. You catch a brief glimpse of an object disappearing around a corner. Was it a plastic bag being blow by the wind, or maybe your imagination?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this boss\u201d, Betty says stopping in the middle of the street, pointing to a manhole cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we looking at\u201d, you ask not understanding why Betty is so excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cA couple of times I\u2019ve note a bright glint on the manhole covers as we drove by\u201d, he explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u201d, you ask not following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, a metal surface usually looses it\u2019s metallic lustre after a while, but as you can see, these are newly made scratches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer you realize Betty is correct. The manhole cover has been opened and closed recently, and by the look of it numerous times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we get down there and have a look around \u201c, Betty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill perplexed by what you saw up ahead, you have to decide...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see step irons line the one side of the manhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you, Cappy\u201d, Betty says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou adjust the shoulder strap of your Jackhammer so that it hangs from your back, and switch the spread light on your helmet on.  Then you carefully start climbing down the manhole. Halfway down, the step irons are replaced by a cat ladder, which hangs down the two meter wide pipe-tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the flickering light of the flare, you can see the tunnel extending in both directions. Turning your spread light to its maximum setting, it shines down the tunnel, but fails to penetrate the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, Betty descends and steps off next to you. \u201cThis place gives me a creepy feeling, man\u201d, he says holding his Jackhammer at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook there\u201d, you say pointing to the ground. In the light of you headlamp, you can clearly see foot prints in the dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose look like military issue boot-prints\u201d, you say. \u201cAnd they\u2019re fresh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud clang makes you and Betty look up to see the sunlight that was shining in through the manhole opening disappears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the f\u2026\u201d, you hear Betty whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here\u201d, you say taking the lead up the cat ladder. Reaching the manhole cover, you press up against it with your right hand while holding on to a step iron with your left. You can feel the step irons strain against the weight. With a loud bang, the step irons break free from the concrete they are imbedded in and you fall down to land on your back at Betty\u2019s feet. A second later the cat ladder lands on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something damn heavy on top of that cover\u201d, you say getting up. \u201cAnd with the cat ladder torn from the wall, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re getting back up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we just blow a hole through whatever is up there from below\u201d, Betty proposes. \u201cThe Jackhammer will rip through that cover like a knife through butter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but how do we get up there\u2026even if we do get it open\u201d, you ask. \u201cLet\u2019s just follow the boot prints\u2026 that\u2019s exactly why we are here\u2026to find some humans and get the chip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty nods in agreement. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you walk away, the flare starts sputtering and dies down. It feels as if the darkness that increases around you, is tangible. You walk down the tunnel into the blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s turn off our lights and switch to night vision\u201d, you propose. \u201cTry and fly below the radar, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you both switch off your lights and turn on your night vision. The inside of your helmets immediately turn light green as the visor displays an amplified image. In front of you, you can see the tunnel extending into the distance. A red dot on your visor indicates where your Jackhammer is pointing.  And so you walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, you stop. In the side of the tunnel wall, someone has broken through. It is clear the tunnel branching off through the hole was not constructed by the original builders of the underground system. Looking down, you can see the boot prints leading into the unofficial branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2026\u201d Betty starts saying before you shush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen\u201d, you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom within the new tunnel, you can hear a faint sound. You listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like growling and moaning\u2026there\u2019s no way that that is human\u201d, Betty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you explain the boot prints\u201d, you ask Betty. \u201cIt leads straight down the tunnel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say we find the closest manhole and get the hell out of here\u201d, Betty counters. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dark in half an hour anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly and quietly you edge your way forward. In spite of the temperature control of the combat armour, small droplets of sweat pearl on your forehead. The growling and moaning noises get closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead you notice the tunnel curling around a corner. From behind the corner and dim glow of yellow light falls into the tunnel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d, you whisper to Betty. \u201cLook sharp\u2026we make this work or we die on this planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you edge closer, until you\u2019re about two feet from the turn. Leaning closer, you poke your head around the corner. What you see sends a cold shiver up your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you, in the dim light, are rows of cages dangling from the ceiling by chains. Inside the cages are humans in varying conditions. Some look weak and skinny, while others are fit and muscular. Your eyes drift down when you see something even more shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, the cages are being patrolled by something. It looks humanoid in that it has two legs and two arms, but its skin is green and glistening. It\u2019s wearing army-style camouflage pants and combat boots and carries what looks like an assault rifle. It has obscure dimensions - almost apelike and its face reminds you of a typical fairy-tale troll. A quick scan reveals that the \u201ctroll\u201d is alone and that there is one metallic door in the back of the room. The humans are the ones moaning, and every now and again, the \u201ctroll\u201d growls at them and bangs on their cages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back, you relay the details to Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do now\u201d, he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet my danger pay that that is a mutant and that the humans and mutants don\u2019t see eye to eye. I think we can take him, rescue the humans and if we\u2019re lucky get a synchropter-chip as reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d, Betty says smiling. \u201cWhat a rich imagination you have Cappy.

Shooting his leg out from under him he falls face first to the ground. Betty fires his gun and takes down the second mutant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deafening growl, the third mutant comes running toward you. You both open fire and fell him as well. With smoke drifting up from your Jackhammers, you scan the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s move out\u201d, you say and start to run.

You pop the mutant while I go for the door. We don\u2019t want that door opening and more of the pouring out. Once I have secured the door, we start opening the cages. When we leave you take the front, I\u2019ll bring up the rear. The first manhole you find, we get out to the streets...got it?\u201d you ask looking at Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiece \u2018f cake\u201d, he says seemingly unbothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one the two of you step out into the door. The mutant sees you, but before he can do anything a blue bolt from Betty\u2019s gun tears through his chest. You sprint toward the door in the back. Reaching it, you see it starting to swing open. You slam into the door, trying to force it shut. You encounter fierce resistance from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining against the door, you know it is your mechanical muscle against the mutant\u2019s muscle riddled bodies. For a few seconds you think you\u2019re going to lose the battle, when you finally manage to force the door shut and secure the lock. The door rattles heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d, you scream at Betty seeing that he has the key that the mutant was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds you have the people out of the cages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, go, go\u201d, you say to Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u201d, a young man to your left says. \u201cI know a shortcut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow us\u201d, you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading the group out, you wait for the last person to leave before placing a high explosive grenade next to the door and activating its proximity detonator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the group down the dark tunnel. Seconds later you are knocked to the floor followed by a thunderous bang. They\u2019re in the tunnel, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we doin\u2019 up there\u201d, you ask Betty over your microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe dude says we\u2019re almost there\u201d, he replies and you keep following the staggered trail formation of running people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you hear growls and howls. Unclipping another grenade, again you activate the proximity detonator and drop it by your side, still running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you hear no bang. Can the mutants be that clever, you wonder. Then you spot one thirty yards behind you...no make that three, four... \u201cAah, shit\u201d, you whisper to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching to one knee, you set your Jackhammer to full automatic, and release a burst of three rounds. They cut the two front mutants down. After firing another burst, you get up and run. Then you stop and fire again. More mutants come pouring out. They\u2019re catching up. You rate of fire is not keeping up with the number of mutants that are pouring towards you. Twenty yards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow we doin\u2019?\u201d you ask sounding deceivingly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost there\u201d, you hear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiring again, you decide you will have to hang back and keep the mutants from killing the whole group. If you have to sacrifice yourself then so be it...Betty can finish the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got it\u201d, you hear him say over your earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the people climb up a ladder and into the daylight above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unclip your last grenade, this time activating the time delay detonator before flinging the grenade into the approaching horde. Then you climb up the ladder. As you fall over  the side onto the street, the explosion from below shoots a geyser of green goo and mutant body parts out the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man that lead the way replaced the manhole cover. \u201cFollow me\u201d, he says running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the screen you see the three red triangles indicating the Wasps and four yellow lines speeding straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee that\u201d, Betty asks with venom in his voice. \u201cThose are Viper missiles, and our countermeasures don\u2019t fool them. The escort is as good as lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the escorts speeding ahead of you, you see the first missile approach the front ship. It launches a spectrum of electronic countermeasures and decoys. The missile flies straight and the explosion consumes the entire ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on\u201d, Betty says as he pulls the Juggernaut in a tight turn whilst yanking down on a red leaver. She ship shakes violently accompanied by a loud metalling screech. Then he punches the controls and the ship shuts down completely. Finally he turns off the lights. From the side you can see the missile speeding closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d you ask feeling cold sweat pearl on your forehead.<br>\r\n\u201cI dumped everything in the cargo hold\u2026all the mining equipment, everything. It might fool the missiles since they were carefully calibrated to distinguish our countermeasures and disregard them. The mining equipment might ...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Betty can finish, you slam back into your seat as the force of the explosion knocks the ship forward. Straining against your seat belt, the ship tumbles bow over stern, rolling away into empty space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiiiit\u201d, you scream while holding on. Small electronic fires erupt and a hydraulic line breaks spraying oil across the cockpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on\u201d, Betty screams. \u201cWith the destroyed mining equipment, the Wasps might mistake the debris for our ship. But we can\u2019t do anything to let them know were still alive. We\u2019re gonna have to ride this out \u2013 faking a portion of debris spinning into space.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the vacuum of space, Pathfinder Seven Zero spins away uncontrollably, while you extinguish the fires from the strapped-in safety of your chair. Fifteen minutes later, you can swear you\u2019ve developed a hernia. \u201cI think we\u2019re clear\u201d, Betty says powering the ship up. He engages the stabilizers. On the wings you can see them puffing in protest, slowing the uncontrollable spin until eventually the ship stops completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Betty, his eyes are blood red from the blood rushing to his head from the spinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been drinking \u201c, he says looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself\u201d, you reply. \u201cNow what\u201d, you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now we need to get mining equipment again and for that we have two options I know about: the first is Hector-Prime...lovely little planet. I have some friends there, but the last time I was there an asshole-bounty hunter called Griffin was looking for me. We had a bit of a falling out and I severed his hand before escaping the planet\u2026he might still be there and he is probably still pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond is Procol-Kilia. It\u2019s a sub-surface hell-hole. We can only land when the port is on the dark side, cause the day-light side is pretty much a lava-firestorm due to the heat from the closest star. The subsurface facility is controlled by the Guhl, but we should be able to fly under the radar as long as we can maintain the miner fa\u00c3\u00a7ade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Good luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter port 34 Delta, you are welcomed by a man in his fifties wearing a grey trench coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you Captain. I am Lord Freeman \u2013 at your service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreeman shakes your hand with a firm grip and looks you straight in the eyes. The combination of his greying hair, his green-grey eyes and his grey trench coat almost gives him a benign quality. However, knowing the way that trade masters operate, you decide that he will have to earn your trust the hard way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your attention to the Freelancer, you are impressed. The ship is the newest range of the Freelancer series, so called due to its versatility. Weapons-, cargo- and electronic utility pod-bays are interchangeable and with a large cargo hold it can carry anything from cargo to weapons or soldiers. A common favourite of space rangers and bounty hunters, the Freelancer series had proven its track record in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, here they are\u201d, you hear Freeman say behind you. Turning around you see three men enter the port. As the first one reaches you he extends his hand and introduces himself, \u201cCaptain Gunn, I am Commandant Reginald Reddling. I will be your navigator on this mission.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome Commandant,\u201d you reply easily. \u201cI see your record says you graduated from the Academy under Admiral Miraz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026uh\u2026sir,\u201d Reddling replies, seemingly not sure how to address you since he technically outranks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can just address me as Captain, Commandant. I know it\u2019s unorthodox to have a mission commander that does not outrank you, but trust me there is a good reason I find myself in this position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly intimidated by the calibre of your crew, you wish you hadn\u2019t said that, realizing that it sounded as if you were trying to convince someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, you encounter the next person in line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster Chief Sam McGuire sir,\u201d the engineer says. His bulky frame and log-like arms do not fit his job description.  The engineers you are used to are more of the geeks-in-glasses type. With his five-o\u2019clock-shadow and jet-black hair, it looks like McGuire just strolled out of a pub. A slight belch escapes McGuire\u2019s mouth. Smelling alcohol on his breath, you realise McGuire did just step out of the ship\u2019s pub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries sir. There\u2019s also a good reason I find myself in this position\u2026\u201d McGuire responds sensing your doubt in him. \u201cI find,\u201d he starts elaborating, \u201cthat a quick drink before a mission relaxes me and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Chief,\u201d you reply cutting him off. \u201cI\u2019m sure the fleet commanders had good reason assigning you to this mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some concern, you step past him to the last person in line \u2013 the language expert. Not getting a good look when the three crew members came in, you are surprised to see it\u2019s a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith dark-brown hair and brown eyes, you are taken aback by her good looks and hesitate for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLieutenant-Commander Michelle Shields, Captain,\u201d she says, taking the opportunity.<br>\r\nOh great, you think to yourself, another person that outranks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s move out people,\u201d you say, not wanting to extend your torture any further. \u201cWe\u2019re on a tight schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree minutes later you find yourself strapped into the pilot\u2019s seat.

Shortly after that, the ship\u2019s engines whine alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPathfinder seven-zero, you are clear for takeoff,\u201d the voice of the space traffic controller-robot announces over your earpiece. Powering the engines up, you find yourself sliding though the open hatch of the America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommandant Reddling,\u201d you say over the microphone strapped to your throat, \u201cwhat is the closest destination to a trade centre so that we can get rid of the extra Pylene and stock up for the mining operation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be the Kepler sir. It is actually a mining station, but there are small numbers of traders that would buy our Pylene. They should also have the appropriate mining tools. There are however Miras-Guhl on Kepler sir, and we would have to go in quietly,\u201d Reddling says confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur second option is a planet called Rokkla. It\u2019s quite a bit further away and we would have to use 30% of our Pylene stock to get there. Prices there are also quite low for Pylene, but there are no Miras-Guhl on Rokkla.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Freeman, he nods in agreement, confirming what Reddling had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe we should consider a third option, Captain,\u201d Freeman says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a decommissioned penal-facility on a small planet nearby called La Mort. It doesn\u2019t display on our star maps, because it\u2019s not supposed to exist anymore. However smugglers use it as a relay station. They pay top dollar for Pylene, and have an impressive inventory of weapons and equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t kill us first,\u201d Lieutenant-Commander Shields chips in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Freeman, he rubs his chin. \u201cThat is a possibility,\u201d he responds, \u201cbut only if they learn we\u2019re with the law, as it were. It can also be our fastest ticket to completing our mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the crew looking at you, you have to decide:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unsure of whether to continue approaching, in fear that it was in fact a Miras Guhl settlement, you slow the buggy down to a stop. Looking at your crew, you report your worries that it may be unsafe to enter the colony ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buggy is a small craft that virtually makes no sound, due to the advanced hover technology used, convincing you that it could easily pass through the village undetected, had it been darker however in the current daylight sneaking through would prove more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving noticed the sudden stopping of the buggy, Lieutenant Commander Shields, breaks into your thoughts,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain? Has something gone wrong with the buggy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou express your concerns to the buggy's other passengers,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I\u2019m just worried about entering the settlement. We don\u2019t know for sure that it is a safe, miner\u2019s town. It could be a new Miras-Guhl town that isn\u2019t shown on this map. Obviously the buggy would be able to pass through practically undetectable but for me to be confident of this, we will have to wait for it to get much darker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had taken in this information, Michelle suggested,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't we pass ourselves off as Miras Guhl men? I know the basic dialect, just let me do all the talking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might work,\" Freeman considered, \"however we may just be able to buy our way through, we have more than enough pylene and Miras Guhl men are known for their greediness, it will be easy to persuade them to exchange the pylene for safe passage to the mining town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain unsure and pull out Reddling's chart. It indicates that to go around the village would take a good couple of hours, due to the long width of the settlement, which was going to use much more pylene than originally planned therefore leaving less to eventually bargain with at the mining station. Also, the crew back at the ship may start to worry as going round would almost double their journey time. he didn't want them risking their lives organising a search party for them, especially as the Freelancer 2000 was only equipped with the one buggy and so they would be setting off unprotected with no vehicle. It was however the safest route with no danger of meeting any enemy lines. Waiting for darkness to fall would take even longer, looking at the sky you reckon you still have at least four more hours of daylight, so sneaking through the village also added extra time onto the original journey time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively you could go along with your crewmate's idea and head through the town and hope that either they are the miner's homes or that they are persuadable Miras Guhl. Although your crew seem keen to head straight through the town, you know from previous experience that Miras-Guhl warriors don\u2019t tend to be negotiable and are more likely to kill you for the pylene than trade for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to..........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know we currently have nothing in the way of equipment for mining this new power source, what it is we will need for the expedition?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, all we know about the power comes from the information sent to us from the alternative power supply exploration team, before the source was discovered by Miras-Guhl. Examination of the new found material ceased, protection becoming the imperative action.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we still don\u2019t know the exact manner of this new material?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, no.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLieutenant? Can you see if you can get Master Chief McGuire on the two-way intercom system.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, the radio waves may be detected by the Miras-Guhl camp, they could easily be intercepted, we\u2019re closer to them now than we are our own ship.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but we have no other alternative at this moment. I didn\u2019t anticipate having to locate the equipment myself. This mining station is not listed abandoned.\u201d<br>\r\nMichelle looks at you with slight disgust in your clear disregard for the small battlefield just crossed, \u201cSomething tells me, they were a little busy fighting for their lives to call in a closed until further notice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLieutenant, I\u2019m not denying a tragedy has plainly occurred here, but it did so much later than this mining station closed, look around, this mine hasn\u2019t been used in a hell of a long time. it\u2019s practically become a junkyard. Try to get through to McGuire. Lord Freeman, I need you to check the station tower, see if you can find out why this mine was closed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou think the closing has anything to do with the Miras-Guhl, Captain?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. This place doesn\u2019t look like it has been officially shut down, more like, abandoned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around confirms this theory as the ground is littered with tools and the machinery rusted into positions unseen in disused mining stations.<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain?\u201d Michelle regains your attention.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Priority cargo was never returned. All rescue missions were aborted. Cause of disappearance unknown. Recovery of cargo of utmost importance. Any OEA ship coming into contact with the Intrepid should report its position immediately and secure the cargo for retrieval.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do sir\u201d, Reddling asks. \u201cWe\u2019re five minutes away from Rokkla...and to be honest, we\u2019re already on a priority mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of this\u201d, Lieutenant Commander Shields chips in. \u201cI did a brief stint in Intelligence and there the story was somewhat of a legend. It was referred to as the Intrepid mystery.\u201d Looking around, Shields saw that she had everybody\u2019s attention and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRumour has it that the Intrepid was rigged with a prototype inter-dimensional transporter. A device that could apparently enable the ship to explore other dimensions. However the theory behind it was somewhat questionable. For the ship to make inter dimensional jumps, it required obscene amounts of energy. Energy that could be tapped from high-energy fields in supernovas. Brooke was ordered to take the ship out to a supernova known as Thor\u2019s pillars. It was on the fringes of charted space back then. Anyway, apparently they made the journey safely there and \u2018jumped\u2019 the super nova as it was called. However, as far as anybody could tell, they never made the return journey. The project for the pursuit of inter dimensional travel called \u2018Tartarus\u2019 was stopped after the failed mission. Nobody knows what dimension they were heading for or what the details of their mission were. It was also mentioned that they have a high priority cargo, but whether this refereed to the prototype device that could enable inter dimensional travel, or if it referred to something they picked up on the other side, was never clear...One thing has always been clear though, the OEA would love to get their hands on the lost Intrepid 504.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do, Captain\u201d, Reddling asks after a moment of silence.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is clearly an older ship, but you can tell it is rigged for a special mission. It seems completely dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, let\u2019s gear up and have a look\u201d, you say. \u201c Reddling and Freeman stays here. Shields and McGuire, you come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat on earth would you want a communications expert on an abandoned ship for\u201d, Shields asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need an extra pair of eyes and someone that can think on their feet\u201d, you reply. \u201cAnyway, we need the navigator and trade master if someone has to finish the mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three of you proceed to the decompression hangar. Outfitting yourselves in self-propelled space suits, you each grab a plasma rifle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never can be too sure\u201d, you say charging the rifle. \u201cLet\u2019s head out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing your helmet visor, the compartment decompresses and the hatch opens. In front of you, you see the Intrepid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeactivate ship\u2019s gravity generator\u201d, you say and as you become weightless, you activate the suit\u2019s propulsion system. You slowly accelerate through the open hatch, followed by your engineer and communications expert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrifting closer to the Intrepid, you see there are two possible entry points; the main entry hatch towards the front and a lesser known service hatch near the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you enter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Humanity pulled together and shortly after developing warp technology, launched three missions into space to find a new home. The first, called Mission One, failed and was never heard of again. The second and third both struck gold by finding inhabitable planets. The best planet was selected and mankind prepared to leave earth for a better future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, tragedy struck when a power hungry General named Mirashid Guhlamnar turned against his own. General Guhlamnar decided to leave Earth with his pick of subordinates while sabotaging the remainder of the earth fleet, stranding them on a dying planet while claiming the new world for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA decade later, the people of Earth managed to rebuild their fleet and left Earth as it faded and died. By then, General Guhlamnar had built an empire on the new world, based on greed, deceit and manipulation. His empire is called Miras-Guhl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people from earth found the second planet and formed the Old Earth Alliance. Shortly after that, the Miras-Guhl started attacking, relentless to rule and dominate the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, contact had been made with numerous alien civilisations, some peaceful, some more aggressive, but all avoiding the war-mongering humans. Is it because they are peaceful, or because they want to see who the victor is? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust remember to check your Point of View, tense, spelling and grammar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
