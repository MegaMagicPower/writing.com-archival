After watching the movie \"Fantastic Voyage,\" Stan got the idea that he wanted to explore the inside of a living thing.  To lessen the risks, he decides to inject himself into an ordinary rabbit, but first, he must go find a rabbit first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he goes to leave the house, the phone rings...</span></div></div>",

He wonders who it could possibly be since his wife wasn't supposed to get home until much later, but he couldn't go and investigate because he is still shrinking inside his submarine and as he watches the window is getting farther and farther away until it seems like it's a million miles away.  As Stan is sitting inside the submarine waiting for it to finish shrinking he mentally goes over the list of things he was supposed to do to prepare for this experiment and as he gets to the item where he was supposed to leave a note for his wife to help him out with his experiment he gets a sinking feeling in his stomach because he forgot to do it and now he has no way of getting into the rabbit.  Even if he chose to get out and walk it would take him an hour to get across the room to where the rabbit was, plus he would have no way to get inside without his submarine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thinks about the choices he has and gets a little depressed because they are very limited.  Really about the only logical choice he can come up with is just to sit and wait for the shrinking effects to wear off and for him to return to his normal size which won't happen for another eight hours.  He sighs heavily thinking about all the wasted time and money going down the drain, all because he forgot to leave a note for his wife.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he is there contemplating all of this he hears some deep booming sounds coming towards him.   He has no idea what it is or who it is that might be coming up the stairs.  He needs to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

A nice ham salad sandwich. She sat down with her lunch and began to eat, wondering where Stan was inside her and what he was doing. Could he even be in her tummy as she ate her lunch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed he was. Stan had piloted the sub into Diane's stomach and was currently watching her eat lunch from inside her belly. He felt close to her in a new way. His sub hovered above a sea of roaring green stomach acid, as huge islands of masticated sandwich mush stewed away. The fleshy walls of this impossibly gigantic cavern, twisted and churned the stomach contents. Stan watched in amazement, completely loving every second of this experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane had finished eating and sat back, rubbing her belly in satisfaction. A thought occurred to her. If Stan was in her tummy, maybe he'd want to see more than a plain old sandwich? Maybe she should have something more filling? Or desert? Her mouth watered at the thought.</span></div></div>",

Stan stopped the engines to the submarine and tried to exit Diane's mouth.  But, Diane's mouth had closed, bathing the entire area into pitch-black.  Stan turned on the submarine's lights.  This was perfect.  Instead of going into a rabbit, Stan had gone inside his wife's mouth!  Stan sighed.  Then he remembered.  He had a two-way radio with Diane!

Diane, not wanting to seem ignorant said \"Actually, I was going to ask how your experiment was coming along sweetie. Anyways go on.\" \"Well to answer your question Diane, my experiment was going smoothly, but I've recently met a roadblock.\" \"What's preventing you from continuing your experiment?\" \"I haven't recieved the rabbit that I'm supposed to use as a test subject yet, and well, that ties into what I want to ask...\" Diane gave Stan a confused looking glqnce for a few seconds before putting two-and-two together. \"Wait, you want to use <i>me</i> as your test subject?\" \"Precisely honey. However, judging from your reaction, I'm going to assume you don't know much about it, do you?\" Diane begrudingly said yes to her husbands question, and in response to this Stan sighed brought Diane upstairs to the attic, where he had been keeping the submarine. \"Okay Diane here's the plan, here's the submarine that I will pilot while I'm inside of your body, once I get inside the submarine it will start to shrink afterwhich I will fly it into that syringe, which I want you to inject into your arm once I'm inside of it, did you understand all of that?\" \"Yes Stan, I understood what you said.\" \"Do you have sny questions before we start?\" \"I have one actually.\" \"Well, what is it?\" \"You said that the submarine can fly, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, if it can fly then why does it need to be injected into my body when it would be easier for you to either let me swallow it or pilot the thing up my nose?\" Stan wasn't prepared for a question like that,iIt might actually make him reconsider his plan for his own fantastic voyage into his wife. Does it?</span></div></div>",

But now it is the year 2005, and a man named Stan Wilson, with his loving wife Diane, has decided to bring that moment back.  Only this time, he decides to lessen the risk by being injected into a rabbit.  During the shrinking process, something goes horribly wrong when the flying submarine shrinks even before being placed into the needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add to this story, and keep it Clean! no toilet stuff, gay stuff, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRate too please.
