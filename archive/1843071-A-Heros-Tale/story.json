She looked around to see a girl that had raccoon ears, a tanuki tail, bat-wings on her back, a horn on the top of her head, brown shorts, and a green tank-top that cover her ample chest(D-Cups), faint near her. \"Whoa! Are you alright?!\", Eve asked the girl as soon as Eve got close to her. \"...\", the strange girl looked exhausted.(She was covered head to toe in dirt.) \"Don't worry, kid! I'll-I'll stay with you!\", Eve told the unconscious girl. She noticed that it was getting dark. \"I'd better make a fire.\", she told herself before she got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later(Around 7:00P.M)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve tried to catch her breath after building not only a fire but also a tent. \"I've outdone myself!\", Eve told herself She noticed that the girl was waking up. *Sigh*\"What a good nap.\", said the girl. \"Hi!\", Eve said to the girl, spooking her. *Screams until she sees Eve is not a threat*\"What'cha trying to do, give me a heart attack!?\", the girl yelled. \"I'm sorry!\", Eve apologized. \"Well, thanks for helping me.\", said the girl before she got up. Her stomach groaned. \"Ugh. I haven't had a piece of food for two days!\" \"Would you like some of mine?\", asked Eve. the girl replied....  </span></div></div>",

Eve offered her some fish(Which she is chewing through like a hungry wolf) before asking, \"Excuse me, miss?\" The woman stopped devouring her food, turned towards Eve and said, \"My apologies, madam. I haven't had any food for two days.\" Eve was surprised that this woman survived for that long with out food. \"Uh, miss?\", she asked her. \"Yeah?\" \"What's your name?\" After Eve said this, the woman scowled and looked at her with a menacing look. \"Why do ya wanna know?\", the woman asked her in a vicious tone. Eve cowered when she saw the look in her eyes, but had the guts to say, \"Be-Bec-cc-cause yo-yo-you wou-would ask th-the same thi-thing?!?\", before bawling her eyes out. The woman still had that look when she saw Eve cry. 'I guess humans never change, ever after a century. They always want to know who they're talking to, even when it's a little obvious!', the woman thought. Even after ten minutes, Eve wouldn't stop crying. The woman, annoyed at her thought, 'GODDAMN! She can REALLY hold a note!' before she noticed that Eve was losing color. This anger turned to panic. 'If she doesn't stop, she's going to die!', she thought. Eve then, lost consciousness. \"Hey! Kid! Wake up!\", said the woman as she held Eve bridal style trying to wake her up.  After 30 minutes, Eve groaned before opening her eyes to see the woman. \"Thank God! You alright, kid?\", the woman asked her in a worried tone. Eve, confused about what she just asked said, \"Yeah, I think so.\" the woman then picked herself up before offering her hand to Eve. \"I'm Kabuki Buku. What's your name?\", Kabuki asked Eve with a warm smile. \"...Eve Willows.\", she said to Kabuki after 2 minutes of thinking about if she can trust her. As she said this, Eve took her hand. \"What are you anyway?\", Eve said to Kabuki in a quizzical voice. Kabuki chuckled. \"I'm not surprised that you don't know what I am.\", she paused, then continued. \"To answer your question, I am a tanuki.\", Kabuki finished. Eve looked at her confused, then she kicked her nether regions. Kabuki, angry asked her, \"Why'd you do that?!\", to which Eve replied even more confused, \"I thought tanuki had big balls between their legs to show off?\" Kabuki gave her a glare before chuckling. She then, pointed at her chest. \"What do you call this, then?\", she told Eve in a amused tone. \"Anyway, We should go to sleep.\", Eve said before letting out a yawn. Kabuki nodded her head in agreement.<br>\r\nSoon after, the two of them were fast asleep in sleeping bags that Kabuki managed to make from leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFun Fact:(Buku is actually Bugaku, both words(Kabuki &amp; Bugaku) are masks in mythology)</span></div></div>",

New York?  \"What?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Eve was confused would have been a great understatement. When she saw the sign pointing to New York, she thought someone had carried her off in the night and dumped her at the outskirts of the city. Only, as she viewed the city skyline, she noticed something was not quite right. \"The buildings... they're in a different order than I remember.\" she whispered, unnerved. \"What's going on here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Eve considered the thought that she may be mistaken but she had a very good memory and the city she was looking at was not her New York. Panic began to set in. \"Where am I?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the sun staring to rise, Eve decided to walk into the city to find out. She had lived on the streets before, the same rules applied and she knew how to defend herself. Only, as she walked onto the streets, she found that all the street names were different as well. It was further proof that she was no longer in New York but it did not answer where she was. Eve looked about and saw a newspaper in the trash and picked it up to find it was the Daily Bugle. She had never heard of such a newspaper but she saw that the date was correct. The headline read: 'SpiderMan does it again!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SpiderMan?\" asked Eve, confused. \"Who in the world is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off, Eve looked around and saw a police officer, sitting in his squad car. She gulped, not really wanting to deal with the police as she was once forced to steal to eat, she walked over to the car and politely cleared her throat. \"Ex-Excuse me, officer.\" she said, timidly. \"Could you tell me where I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officer looked at Eve, concerned. \"You are in New York City, miss.\" he replied. \"Are you okay, did you hit your head somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is New York!?\"</i> thought Eve, feeling her heart begin to race. <i>\"How can that be possible? This is not the city I remember!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve took a step back from the squad car, her face turning pale. The police officer noticed this and slowly stepped out of the police cruiser. \"Miss, I think you had better come with us.\" he said, gently. \"You seem confused and you don't look so well to me either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve trembled in fright, not knowing what to do.

The man was fairly cute with black hair and brown eyes but he was twice her size and built like a rock. The man took a hold of her wrist, which was a mistake. Eve screamed at the top of her lungs and struggled to get herself free. The police officer meant no harm but Eve had no way of knowing that and she went into a frenzy when he grabbed her other wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, miss!\" said the officer, trying to take a hold of her other hand. he turned to the cruiser. \"Carl! Give me a hand, the kid's gone nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're spooking her Paul!\" scolded Carl, a slightly shorter man with brown hair and blue eyes. \"Ease up a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Eve felt something shift within her as something move through her long red hair. She shivered, at the thought it was Paul running his hands through her locks but how could that be? He was holding both of her wrists. Paul gasped, looking at her and eased his grip as Eve eased her struggling. She was confused and startled by the new sensations she was feeling before she winced in pain. She both felt and heard something tear out from her skin and ripped through the back of her jeans. \"What- What's happening to me!?\" she whispered, looking up the the stunned police officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, miss.\" replied Paul, slowly. \"But I recommend you see a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat terrified Eve and she could only think of running away. \"You're scaring me.\" she said, tears falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the lights of the cruiser went on as the siren blared, startling the three and Eve turned to see her reflection in the side window. Her eyes went wide, seeing that she now had yellow eyes, along with fox like ears with a fox like tail, but with spikes. She opened her mouth as if to scream but was startled again as all the cars around them started to honk their horns all at once. Paul released his grip on Eve, startled as well, and she took off running blindly down the sidewalk. \"This is insane!\" she screamed, crying. \"Where am I!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her at the time, the lights were quickly changing to allow a path for her to run, quickly switching back to block any pursuit as the only thing on her mind at the time was to find a place to hide and think things through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, as she stopped to rest, she looked up to find herself at the front gates of...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She began to wonder is she should see a doctor when a deep voice reached her from behind. \"Are you feeling alright, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve spun around to find herself facing a man, or what resembled a man, wearing a long white lab coat. He was covered from head to toe in a blueish fur with pointed ears, sharp teeth, and large hands and feet.

Eve sat up to see her surroundings, but could not find anything that stood out. (Well, besides the fog, anyway.) She then felt a presence behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly turning around, she saw a beast that easily towered over her, but due to both the fog and the beast's shadowy appearance, she could only make out a few things that stood out; The first one was obviously its size. The second one was the kitsune tail slowly wagging back and forth in a almost hypnotizing rhythmic fashion, but it also had.... 'Are those spikes on its tail?', Eve pondered as she realized that this was NOT an ordinary creature just on that one detail. Its yellow/amber eyes that shined through the thick fog like how a lighthouse aids ships and appearing to be staring into her very soul. Finally, It had shark like teeth which it showed off with a grin that would terrify even the most courageous of men. Eve, then finally noticed that it was slowly walking to her, almost feral-like by the way it was walking on all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you?\", Eve asked the beast as it stood in front of her.

Here's what I changed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that Eve did not meet the crossroads and its different worlds.<br>\r\nEve now lives under the ground. (Think of the underground villages from Gurren Lagann)<br>\r\nEve has a family in this version.<br>\r\n(Note: If you want to add a character/chapter to this story, message me and tell me about your character's personality, what he/she looks like, likes, dislikes, Etc.)<br>\r\nAlso, this story WILL borrow some things from other Super Robot shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, without any delay, here's the story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the year 2012, a race of monsters piloting giant robots that went by the name of Megid appeared from the very ground humanity walked on. They offered an ultimatum for the human race: Ether Mankind gives up their rights and become slaves for them, or that mankind will be destroyed. The UN responded that they wouldn't and on March 18(in what is now called \"The Day of Unity\"), they sent out two-million missiles in Megid encampments. Enraged, the Megid responded by sending out \"Legion\", an mechanical monster that destroyed most of the U.S.A, but was stopped and annihilated by the combined forces of the Japanese, Russian, and the remaining US military with a atomic bomb that exploded with the power that could destroy Fort Knox. Over 1,000,000,000 lives were lost, and in a desperate situation, the rest of humanity split into two sides: one that went underground to escape the Megid, and the other stayed to both accept being slaves to the monsters, and to give the first half a chance at escape(It succeeded)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n481 years later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCivilization now lives in two ways: one that lives underground and is ignorant of what's happened half a millennia ago. The other, is consistently reminded of this fact when this half split in two groups again: One half as slaves to Megid, the other hiding in the remains of buildings that are still standing.<br>\r\nOur hero, Eve is born on April 12, 2493. As we join her on her birthday before she has to work(She has to help make room by drilling and hacking holes on the walls to create room for more families.), she finds a small drill and a robot of sorts(A Cyber-Megid, if you will.) This tale begins with Eve about to activate her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>40 minutes earlier....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve was confused when she found a small device shaped like a drill. \"How does something like this get down here, anyway?\", she pondered. \"This'll at least make for a good souvenir.\", Eve said before putting it her pocket. \"HEY EVE!\", a energetic voice shouted. Startled, Eve gave out a spooked squeal before she turned to face her long-time friend Milly Erson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hard-headed, yellow-haired madwoman(due to her ideas), Milly stands a little shorter than Eve, has A-Cups, barely any curves, and is now wearing a grin that said 'I'M SO HAPPY!'. Due to the fact that Eve was used to Milly's personality(Though Eve gets spooked time and time again by the fact that Milly creeps up on her), she wasn't as angry as she was at first. \"Christ, Milly!! What'cha trying to do, kill me!?\" Milly's face changed from one of happiness to that of worry and regret. \"Yeesh, Eve. I'm sorry for scaring you. Anyway, Happy Birthday!\", Milly said before producing a gift for Eve. Eve looked at her, her surprised face slowly changing to that of kindness. \"Thanks, Milly!\", before ripping it open to reveal a necklace with a closed locket that was shaped like a heart. Eve opened the locket to see a picture of the two of them, and the two giving the peace sign. \"If you ever are feeling lonely and I'm not there, just look in there.\", Milly told her with a smile. Eve looked at her, awestruck at this gift before clutching it with a tear in her eye. *Sniff* \"This is the best gift I've had in a while.\" Eve, then hugged Milly. Milly returned the favor before leaving to go back to work. But not before saying \"See ya later, Eve!\" Eve gave her a wave before returning to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes earlier....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve continued working with her pickaxe and Eve guessed that she dug 15ft or more when she hits something metallic. \"Huh?\" Eve lifts up her pickaxe to see a patch of orange on metal. 'What the heck?! What is that?', Eve thought before determination filled her face. '<i>Only one way to find out!</i>' And with that, Eve slowly but surely she chipped away more and more of the stone covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7 minutes earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve was both tired/exhausted from the work she had to do to uncover the machine and was again looking at the thing, awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine looked both mechanical and humanoid with its body structure. Its hands and toes had claws, while its shell made it look bizarre to look at. The chain-like tail that had a spiked ball at its tip behind it had a few smears of blood on it. Its face looked human-like except for the fangs jutting out slightly.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Eve!\", Milly said, spooking you again for the second time in a row. Turning to her, Eve yelled while grabbing Milly by her collar, \"DO I HAVE TO PUT A BELL AROUND YOUR NECK!!!\", Milly was clutching her ears and checking if she could hear still. \"OW!! Hello to you, too! Anyway, what'cha find?\" Eve answered to Milly, \"I honestly don't know.\" Milly didn't hear cause she was climbing up to the cockpit of the thing. Startled, Eve quickly followed her and sat beside Milly in the cockpit, where Milly saw a hole that looked like a ignition slot. \"Hey Eve! Come look at this!\", said Milly.  Eve looked at the slot and remembering the drill, put it there. It was a perfect fit. \"Way to go, Eve!\", Milly told her while giving her a slap on the back. Eve looked at her before turning the key(Drill). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresent Time<br>\r\nWith a jolt of power the thing was slowly waking up. \"Oh shit, Eve! Hide!\", Milly told her as they got out of the thing and landed on the ground before hiding from the now awake monster. \"....\" The creature was silent as it looked around before noticing Eve &amp; Milly.</span></div></div>",

As it drew closer, Eve &amp; Milly backed up until they had a wall behind them and the thing in front of them. \"It's been nice knowing ya, Eve.\", a scared Milly told her friend. Eve responded \"Same here.\", as they both waited for the thing to kill them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited for 10 minutes for death to claim them. When they felt and heard nothing, a confused, yet scared Milly asked her friend with closed eyes \"D-Di-Did it leave?\" \"I don't know. I'll check.\", Eve told her friend. She squinted with one eye to see the thing right in her face. *SCREAM* Eve let out a terrified scream as she realized that it was still there. Milly gathered her courage and stood in front of Eve, her arms and legs spread out. \"You'll have to get through me, you piece of old scrap!\". Milly said the machine/monster, anger in her eyes. The creature looked at both of them, sadness in its eyes, before turning around, ran in said direction for about 30 feet, and let out a sniffle. Eve listened to it. It sounded both human and monstrous. Eve looked at Milly, with a look of regret, before saying to her \"If something happens, run.\", before she ran up to the creature and got in front of it. Milly looked at Eve was doing with a look that said 'Oh shit.', before yelling for Eve to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve stood in front of the beast, who was on the verge of tears. Not knowing what to do, Eve decided to talk to it. \"Hey, beast!\" The thing looked at Eve, while still sniffling. Eve continued to talk. \"I think we got off on the wrong foot. I'm Eve!\", she said as she waited for its answer. \"....Mazin Kaizo.\", it finally said with a quite woman's voice. Eve was surprised to know that it was a girl, to say the least. \"You're a woman!?\", she exclaimed. Kaizo looked at Eve with a look that said 'Not a word about that.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve decided to ask about her past. \"How'd you get down here?\" Kaizo looked upwards, as if trying to remember something, then looked at Eve with a frightened face. \"I-I don't remember!\", she told Eve before crying again. <i>'Amnesia?'</i>, Eve thought to herself. She decided to comfort her. \"Hey. It's O.K.\", Eve told Kaizo as she scratched behind her ears. Kaizo's tail was slowly wagging back and forth. \"Thank you.\", she told Eve before hugging her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaizo then lifted Eve up. \"HEY! What do you think you're doing!?\", Eve yelled at her \"Relax.\", Kaizo responded as she put her up on the top of her head were the controls were. \"What I remember is that the one who activates me is my leader. Also, I won't attack your friend that's yelling for you.\", she explained. Eve finally heard Milly yelling her name. \"Let's go, then!\", as Kaizo ran in the direction she came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVE! GET BACK HERE, YOU IDIOT!!!!\", Milly yelled. She was screaming Eve's name for 10 minutes straight before she heard thumping from something heavy. Before she realized it, Kaizo scooped her up and put her in the cockpit with Eve. \"Who, where, how-!\", a extremely confused Milly said as saw that she in the cockpit with Eve. \"How'd you-?\", Milly started to ask as Kaizo was running nearer and nearer to the village. \"Apparently, I'm her pilot or something.\" Eve explained as Kaizo had 40 ft to go before she reached the village.</span></div></div>",

Then, she ran to meet her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hooded figure with shark-like teeth was running towards a pair of large doors. As he opened them, a lone figure stood there in a throne, an old man, his eyes closed. 'I'm probably gonna die for this.', the hooded figure said as she slowly shook her Lord awake. Suddenly, his hand shot out and grabbed the woman's throat. \"What is it, Shiva?\", the man said to the woman called Shiva with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Dai, *Gack* there is *Wheeze* a robot *Cough* unaccounted for!\" As soon as these words left her lips, Lord Dai dropped her like a sack of potatoes from shock. He then spoke to the woman softly. \"Are you sure?\" \"Y-yes my Lord.\" The woman told him with fear in her voice. the man got up from his throne and walked about, thinking of what to do. He told the woman \"Send one of the Megid to the location.\" \"Yes, I'll do that once, your Majesty.\" the woman said before leaving in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she left, the man looked out the window to think about the blip on the radar. \"Could it be...Mazin Kaizo?\" Lord Dai turned away from the window as he felt a presence. \"I know you're there, Terrible Trio.\", he calmly said. Three female figures appeared in front of him, almost as if out of thin-air, and knelled in his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smallest had black wings and a katana in its sheathe while wearing a traditional samurai armor and a mask to cover her face. The tallest was very slim and wore a green kimono that had a dragon pattern. Her amber eyes looked at her master in regret. The one in the middle had wings like the samurai, but were folded to not mask the other two. Her red eyes made it clear that she, along with the other two, were not normal in the slightest. \"I apologize, my Lord.\", said the one in the middle. \"Rise.\", he told them, which they quickly did. \"State your request.\", he asked, as they only bothered them when they need something. \"If it not too much trouble, my Lord, May we join Lady Shiva on her reconnaissance?\", asked the tall one curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>If I send them, they will probably destroy whatever is causing the disturbance. However, if it is Mazin Kaizo...</i>' Lord Dai thought before reaching a decision. \"If the Megid that is being sent to the location is destroyed, I shall send the three of you to eliminate the target!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my Lord.\", spoke the shortest, before all three teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: And thus, The story begins and our villains enter the picture! Shiva is the name from Hindu mythology, like how Asura is, so to reference Baron Ashura, I named one of the villains Shiva.)</span></div></div>",

She won't harm a thing, I assure you!\" Eve begged.
