Simple. However, what we're really doing here is writing are <i>What If?</i> scenario. This is an old Marvel concept where events happen differently than they do in the main story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's say you want Spider-Man to fatten up Black Cat. Well, do to the story, he'd have to break up with MJ, right? Wrong. You can make it so that Peter and MJ just never got back together again. Or maybe they already broke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, you are free to warp the universe/story of PS4 Spider-Man to fit whatever you want to write. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, what woman are we focusing on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After MJ had finished putting her clothes on, albeit with a struggle, she had went to do her typical work time at The Daily Bugle. In her lunch break she went and got herself some food at a local cafe and buffet restaurant, having gotten in Peter\u2019s cooking a rather larger appetite, her belly bulging out more than desirable for one like her and yet one good thing was that it was not exposed at least yet.. After MJ\u2019s work day, she called Peter and they agreed for a special dinner together at her place where they were living at together. On her way out to head back to work she got some rather unusually extra large bags of snacks of typical cafe types, like cookies, cupcakes, muffins, chocolates etc. When she got back, she then got herself with a far briefer struggle into her pajama clothing and placed herself on her couch more tiredly than normal, especially after how it was that her clothes were getting a little more tighter with her jeans a little more snug. Since Peter was not yet back, she decided to have a personal appetizer feast for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with her muffins, which consisted of chocolatey kinds etc., then got to some chocolate bars which consisted of ones without and with nuts but starting with the latter of those and saving the former kinds for last, and as she ate those, she grunted in pleasure of how tasty that they were. Then she headed for her other such delicious snacks besides the described ones like cream-filled pastries among chocolatey kinds etc., brownies, from regular chocolatey brownies to ones with vanilla and chocolate icing sandwiched between them. Soon MJ\u2019s pajama attire, as stretchy as it was, even itself was becoming slightly snug from the pants part of it with her shirt as a little tighter, especially as her belly was bulging more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter MJ finished those, she then went for her chocolatey muffins and cupcakes with the latter of those consisting of all manner of styles of chocolatey flavored kinds including ones with vanilla and with chocolate icing covering all those, and eventually went for saving for last her cookies from icing covered cinnamon ones, to ones with vanilla sandwiched between them and peanut butter and chocolate chip and all other such sweet kinds of chocolatey and peanut butter type with the chocolate chip types saved for last. As MJ ended up eating those and saving them for last, considering how large the amounts of them she got were, she decided to have the remaining amounts of those mixed in with some large bowl with large scoops of all chocolatey and vanilla type flavors she had in her freezer with some chocolate syrup and some milk to wash it all down with, and she grunted in pleasure at the tastes in her mouth that she felt, ignoring how snug her PJ Pants were getting and how tight her PJ Shirt was getting on her. \u201cSo good.\u201d Mumbled MJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs MJ had those snacks she watched some educational documentary show channel to pass up all that time. Finally MJ had finished those and yet despite how much she had eaten, was only feeling partly full from how much she had eaten by having eaten all of those goods, and was looking forward to the food feast that she and Peter were planning, and yet as she was disposing of those bags into the trash can, she did so rather slowly and did the same with her bowls and then went to have the rest of her cookies that were chocolate chip kinds that were not with any ice cream for last as there were still more left. Seating MJ\u2019s own self back down on her couch, she then went and finished those off and after disposing of those somehow with some still good talent at doing such things in such styles throwing them into her trash can, she then began quite absent-mindedly rubbing her particularly round belly that had now caused her shirt to just become rather skin tight, her eyes closed with her smile rather dreamy from the pleasure of these foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Peter got back, and changed from his \u201cThe Spidey\u201d outfit into some sleeping attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ saw him come in and pulled him in to kiss his lips and both his cheeks. Then Peter went to cook up what he said he would, the types of foods he was good at cooking as always, including with additional kinds and with additional recipes to it, including of Indian food and Italian food types, and set up a lot of those, only one serving of which he had for himself and gave the rest for MJ to eat, all with MJ sitting on their couch whilst eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Peter,\u201d she giggled, \u201cyou are <i>really</i> <i>starting</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>spoiling</i> <i>me</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply Peter had shrugged. \u201cWell MJ, you are my girlfriend. What I am supposed to be expected of over that is what exactly?\u201d And MJ had giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-O-O-O-Oh My Sweet Peter.\u201d Said MJ, giggling from feeling quite giddy from how much food she would get to eat up. And MJ did eat it up, and groaned in pleasure at how delicious it all was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon MJ surprisingly did eat it all up and was now starting to feel really full from it all, but as Peter was taking the dishes to be put in their dishwasher, MJ soon had soon just noticed what had resulted from it all, as she saw her particularly round belly that she thus began to be quite rather-semi-absentmindedly-soothingly rubbing had now pushed up her PJ Shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously My Sleep Shirt?\u201d Mumbled MJ. She leaned back as she rubbed her belly.</span></div></div>",

But she'd bought up every copy she could find after that fateful showdown between Spider-man, Silver Sable, and that monster. One for her mother, one for her office, and one for her scrapbook. Plus a couple of extras, just in case. You can never be too careful when you're unofficial allies with one of the most <i>destructive</i> saviors that New York had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there a part of her that wishes that she could have done it? Absolutely. Just looking at his smug face, the camera flash catching against the steel plate on his disfigured face, made her seethe from the inside. But what he became towards the end there, thanks to Project Olympus... there was no way she could have taken him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that metal, he wasn't even human anymore. Spider-man, radioactive spider-bite and all, had to have a PMC-grade jet to fire a laser at his skull <i>multiple times</i> while dodging rockets, getting shot at, and dealing with that pint-sized ball buster Sablinova. Yuri would have never made it that far. Hell, she would have never made it even close. He probably would have just headbutted her and taken her out then and there. It was a grim fact to accept, but... Yuri's hatred for the Maggia had to take a backseat to making sure monsters like Hammerhead were put behind bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or behind glass, in this case.\" she said with a small smile, touching the glass and leaving small streaks from the grease on her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maggia were finished\u2014or at least close enough as could be. Most of the smaller thugs had been absorbed into the power vacuum that Fisk's presence had brought in, trading their three-piece suits and gold chains for hoodies and less distinctive outerwear. All of the SableTech was slowly being routed back to Symkaria to help with the rebellion, which meant that the City that Never Sleeps was finally put to bed, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still work to be done, of course. Shootouts, robberies, the <i>occasional</i> super villain attack. But what was she going to do about that? Her precinct pulled its weight and Spider-man took care of most of what fell through the cracks. The Avengers, Doctor Strange, and even Daredevil had been making appearances in town again, so almost everywhere <i>else</i> was fine too. Not like she'd ever transfer out of Chinatown, but the opportunity would have been nice. Now that the Maggia were done for, <i>really</i> done for... what else was there for Captain Yuri Watanabe to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat rage, that purpose that had driven her throughout her career, what had defined her as a police officer was just... gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, as a certain Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man had once said, \"Nothing fills an existential hole like Eddie's Pizza\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd damn if he wasn't right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd started ordering from there pretty regularly. They really did have the best pies in town; she could see why the Webhead wouldn't shut up about it. A few slices became more, then a few more, until the delivery guys started to learn her by name. \"The Captain Watanabe Special\" had undergone quite a few changes since she'd started getting her fix there on the regular...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...\" Yuri grunted to herself as she nestled back into her office chair, \"Gotta remember to wipe down before I start handling those case files after lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised the greasy, cheesy, triangle to her mouth and bit eagerly into it. Sauce dribbled from the corners of her lips, down onto her red-and-black button up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" she said in a hungry voice, \"I love this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone around the precinct knew that the Captain had let herself go. The only question was... how fat was Yuri these days?</span></div></div>",

Without her grudge against the maggia, Yuri was left with a hole the size of Staten Island to fill inside of her, and she'd been doing a great job of trying to clog it with enough grease to squeeze her through the cells in Lockup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, my shirt...\" Yuri's double chin creased in distaste as she surveyed the damage, \"I just got this dry-cleaned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew full well what a dollop of Eddie's sauce could do to a girl's wardrobe. She needed to get it out before it stained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure no one was watching, Yuri closed the blinds and began to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thick fingers fumbling with the buttons on her ill-fitting top, Yuri made small grunts of exertion as she struggled to get them going. Once she'd unbuttoned, the corpulent captain began wriggling in her office chair, her incredible amounts of belly fat wobbling as she struggled. Her pale gut hung down between her legs, settling comfortably on her pillowy thighs as she was forced to untuck it from her pants. Her fat arms caught in the sleeves slightly\u2014they jiggled in exertion as she shimmied them out awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, her \"emergency\" shirt was all the way across her office...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolstering herself, Yuri gripped either of her armrests. The poor chair shook with strain as she pushed off from the seat, doughy cheeks following behind her. The poor woman was mostly belly; no unrealistic body proportions for <i>this</i> unlucky New Yorker. Not like that damn Black Cat. What she wouldn't do for a chest like that... hell, a <i>body</i> like that. She might have even considered giving up pizza for good, if it weren't so tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri's plush body jiggled with her every step, belly bouncing beneath her bra as it hung freely in the open air. Reaching into her cabinet, past a few forgotten (and empty) boxes of Pop Tarts, Yuri found her own \"Alternate Costume\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the Web-Head can change his outfit, then why not me?\" Yuri curled a flat nostril in distaste as she pulled the cobalt blue tarp over her head, over her chest, and past her belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>and past her belly</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" she tugged at the hem of her shirt, which failed to cover that last stubborn roll of belly blubber, \"I can't believe I've got to go up another size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Yuri \"What a Whale\" Watanabe\u2014reporting for duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after lunch.</span></div></div>",
