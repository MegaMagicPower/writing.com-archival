Simple. However, what we're really doing here is writing are <i>What If?</i> scenario. This is an old Marvel concept where events happen differently than they do in the main story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's say you want Spider-Man to fatten up Black Cat. Well, do to the story, he'd have to break up with MJ, right? Wrong. You can make it so that Peter and MJ just never got back together again. Or maybe they already broke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, you are free to warp the universe/story of PS4 Spider-Man to fit whatever you want to write. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, what woman are we focusing on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After MJ had finished putting her clothes on, albeit with a struggle, she had went to do her typical work time at The Daily Bugle. In her lunch break she went and got herself some food at a local cafe and buffet restaurant, having gotten in Peter\u2019s cooking a rather larger appetite, her belly bulging out more than desirable for one like her and yet one good thing was that it was not exposed at least yet.. After MJ\u2019s work day, she called Peter and they agreed for a special dinner together at her place where they were living at together. On her way out to head back to work she got some rather unusually extra large bags of snacks of typical cafe types, like cookies, cupcakes, muffins, chocolates etc. When she got back, she then got herself with a far briefer struggle into her pajama clothing and placed herself on her couch more tiredly than normal, especially after how it was that her clothes were getting a little more tighter with her jeans a little more snug. Since Peter was not yet back, she decided to have a personal appetizer feast for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with her muffins, which consisted of chocolatey kinds etc., then got to some chocolate bars which consisted of ones without and with nuts but starting with the latter of those and saving the former kinds for last, and as she ate those, she grunted in pleasure of how tasty that they were. Then she headed for her other such delicious snacks besides the described ones like cream-filled pastries among chocolatey kinds etc., brownies, from regular chocolatey brownies to ones with vanilla and chocolate icing sandwiched between them. Soon MJ\u2019s pajama attire, as stretchy as it was, even itself was becoming slightly snug from the pants part of it with her shirt as a little tighter, especially as her belly was bulging more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter MJ finished those, she then went for her chocolatey muffins and cupcakes with the latter of those consisting of all manner of styles of chocolatey flavored kinds including ones with vanilla and with chocolate icing covering all those, and eventually went for saving for last her cookies from icing covered cinnamon ones, to ones with vanilla sandwiched between them and peanut butter and chocolate chip and all other such sweet kinds of chocolatey and peanut butter type with the chocolate chip types saved for last. As MJ ended up eating those and saving them for last, considering how large the amounts of them she got were, she decided to have the remaining amounts of those mixed in with some large bowl with large scoops of all chocolatey and vanilla type flavors she had in her freezer with some chocolate syrup and some milk to wash it all down with, and she grunted in pleasure at the tastes in her mouth that she felt, ignoring how snug her PJ Pants were getting and how tight her PJ Shirt was getting on her. \u201cSo good.\u201d Mumbled MJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs MJ had those snacks she watched some educational documentary show channel to pass up all that time. Finally MJ had finished those and yet despite how much she had eaten, was only feeling partly full from how much she had eaten by having eaten all of those goods, and was looking forward to the food feast that she and Peter were planning, and yet as she was disposing of those bags into the trash can, she did so rather slowly and did the same with her bowls and then went to have the rest of her cookies that were chocolate chip kinds that were not with any ice cream for last as there were still more left. Seating MJ\u2019s own self back down on her couch, she then went and finished those off and after disposing of those somehow with some still good talent at doing such things in such styles throwing them into her trash can, she then began quite absent-mindedly rubbing her particularly round belly that had now caused her shirt to just become rather skin tight, her eyes closed with her smile rather dreamy from the pleasure of these foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Peter got back, and changed from his \u201cThe Spidey\u201d outfit into some sleeping attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ saw him come in and pulled him in to kiss his lips and both his cheeks. Then Peter went to cook up what he said he would, the types of foods he was good at cooking as always, including with additional kinds and with additional recipes to it, including of Indian food and Italian food types, and set up a lot of those, only one serving of which he had for himself and gave the rest for MJ to eat, all with MJ sitting on their couch whilst eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Peter,\u201d she giggled, \u201cyou are <i>really</i> <i>starting</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>spoiling</i> <i>me</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply Peter had shrugged. \u201cWell MJ, you are my girlfriend. What I am supposed to be expected of over that is what exactly?\u201d And MJ had giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-O-O-O-Oh My Sweet Peter.\u201d Said MJ, giggling from feeling quite giddy from how much food she would get to eat up. And MJ did eat it up, and groaned in pleasure at how delicious it all was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon MJ surprisingly did eat it all up and was now starting to feel really full from it all, but as Peter was taking the dishes to be put in their dishwasher, MJ soon had soon just noticed what had resulted from it all, as she saw her particularly round belly that she thus began to be quite rather-semi-absentmindedly-soothingly rubbing had now pushed up her PJ Shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously My Sleep Shirt?\u201d Mumbled MJ. She leaned back as she rubbed her belly.</span></div></div>",

Some of those in tons had Peter bought and the rest of the tons had he baked himself but set up as a surprise - in part because today yet had his so ever dear sweet amazing brave girlfriend had been from within The Daily Bugle Company been promoted to a part in her chief editor position above her initial one wherein upon her return from Symkaria all so purely truly very surprisingly really safely in one piece all thanks to some help from Silver Sablinova Also To Know As Silver Sable - during which had they and as well as Peter - whilst as \u201cThe Spiderman\u201d of course exposed and had then brought to True Justice none so else other whilst than Norman Osborn who had at all such points been turned thus into \u201cThe Pure Green Goblin\u201d but after some utter commotion stopped and then incarcerated whilst with Harry Osborne freed and cured and a mysterious black goe like parasitic \u201calien rooted\u201d living organism known as \u201cA Symbiote\u201d put into some other laboratory for research - thus so would she not have to do things as a photographer and/or reporter would have to but instead be in a managing position for such ones at the place itself - whether there or at home - and so Miss MJ chose a balance in between both - and when she confirmed this to Peter did he say they ought to celebrate - but upon the sight of this which he brought to her did he decide without her knowing it to be for them to celebrate - her having feasts of food to eat and tons of such stuff at it yet on seeing it thus did MJ\u2019s jaw drop as she had struggled to refrain from drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. MJ had then squeed in delight at all of this so quite indeed very adorably at least if one were to ask her sweet boyfriend Peter, and she had thus clapped her two and somehow yet here truly very mildly chubby hands together in her delight all whilst very adorably if one were to ask her boyfriend perhaps so at least. Almost like she had not eaten in even a few days - even after a few weeks after her return alongside all else that has been described as ever taking place - which is whenever all of this here takes place after - and she turned her head to look at her boyfriend Peter with her hands placed together, as he brought it all and placed it on the large coffee table whilst set in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-Peter, you-are-just-so-awesomely-absolutely-incredibly-very-so-amazing!\u201d Squealed MJ in all out of her excitement. Then MJ had heaved herself all on up and squeezed her sweet boyfriend Peter in a quite so tight bearhug with her albeit yet very truly really mildly yet still equally chubby arms around his neck, and so then quite very passionately going for both his cheeks to have done so on there and then pressing her own against his lips to have absolutely incredibly truly very equally really passionately kissed him, a groan all so coming during the cheeks parts and more of one on that lips kiss as she did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Peter, a little bit hardened because of his genuine and truest of romantic love for her that was and is reciprocated whilst by her and even if because of that all alone, still had wrapped as much of his muscular and far more fitting and strong and muscular bodied body arms around as much as he could of all so from thus around her waist, very equally deepening their kiss so especially very so on their lips and a few moments later as they released each other she then sat back down and proceeded to \u201cdig in\u201d or so to say, using a spoon Peter also brought for her ice cream portions including so whilst in all her ice-cream-cake-foods, and she absolutely incredibly very clearly quite indeed did not even need to be told by Peter even so either of once or even twice to dig in very especially before her ice cream parts had melted and so she did \u201cdig in all those\u201d and then her ice cream bowls with which all very separately to eat and then she did then eat up the ones to mix in with all of what to mix it all in with and saving the cookies for last, including from among the large ice cream bowls ones with strawberry and hazel brown made and vanilla and lots of most so very especially very chocolaty syrups and saving all the ones with that third said stuff for last too. As she ate them all whilst very speedily, all so most here incredibly especially what with however so great her appetite was all so here becoming very increasingly quite massive etc and Peter sat as much of beside her as he could so, with she herself as paying very truly absolutely incredibly no heed whatsoever to her so ever here overindulged stomach turning into a so here very really spectacularly particularly all yet so quite very massively so bloated, distended, round and swollen big fat belly, not that either of them cared about it all here, just so long as ever so very truly absolutely increasingly to MJ as long as she could eat and Peter as long as he could even as so much as even so try whilst to ever even please her even if up to the point of proceeding on to \u201cspoil her also put in as to spoil his girlfriend\u201d.</i></span></div></div>",

You can never be too careful when you're unofficial allies with one of the most <i>destructive</i> saviors that New York had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there a part of her that wishes that she could have done it? Absolutely. Just looking at his smug face, the camera flash catching against the steel plate on his disfigured face, made her seethe from the inside. But what he became towards the end there, thanks to Project Olympus... there was no way she could have taken him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that metal, he wasn't even human anymore. Spider-man, radioactive spider-bite and all, had to have a PMC-grade jet to fire a laser at his skull <i>multiple times</i> while dodging rockets, getting shot at, and dealing with that pint-sized ball buster Sablinova. Yuri would have never made it that far. Hell, she would have never made it even close. He probably would have just headbutted her and taken her out then and there. It was a grim fact to accept, but... Yuri's hatred for the Maggia had to take a backseat to making sure monsters like Hammerhead were put behind bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or behind glass, in this case.\" she said with a small smile, touching the glass and leaving small streaks from the grease on her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maggia were finished\u2014or at least close enough as could be. Most of the smaller thugs had been absorbed into the power vacuum that Fisk's presence had brought in, trading their three-piece suits and gold chains for hoodies and less distinctive outerwear. All of the SableTech was slowly being routed back to Symkaria to help with the rebellion, which meant that the City that Never Sleeps was finally put to bed, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still work to be done, of course. Shootouts, robberies, the <i>occasional</i> super villain attack. But what was she going to do about that? Her precinct pulled its weight and Spider-man took care of most of what fell through the cracks. The Avengers, Doctor Strange, and even Daredevil had been making appearances in town again, so almost everywhere <i>else</i> was fine too. Not like she'd ever transfer out of Chinatown, but the opportunity would have been nice. Now that the Maggia were done for, <i>really</i> done for... what else was there for Captain Yuri Watanabe to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat rage, that purpose that had driven her throughout her career, what had defined her as a police officer was just... gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, as a certain Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man had once said, \"Nothing fills an existential hole like Eddie's Pizza\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd damn if he wasn't right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd started ordering from there pretty regularly. They really did have the best pies in town; she could see why the Webhead wouldn't shut up about it. A few slices became more, then a few more, until the delivery guys started to learn her by name. \"The Captain Watanabe Special\" had undergone quite a few changes since she'd started getting her fix there on the regular...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...\" Yuri grunted to herself as she nestled back into her office chair, \"Gotta remember to wipe down before I start handling those case files after lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised the greasy, cheesy, triangle to her mouth and bit eagerly into it. Sauce dribbled from the corners of her lips, down onto her red-and-black button up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" she said in a hungry voice, \"I love this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone around the precinct knew that the Captain had let herself go. The only question was... how fat was Yuri these days?</span></div></div>",

She hadn't found any truly good places to hit on top of her final encounter with The Spiderman and its aftermath yet still so and after her final moral ambiguity fueled thief activities, and thusly was sitting on a pile of priceless gems and other trinkets. So all she had really done for the past twenty four weeks that had passed since she had obtained so much money and jewels and the likes more than what to think of as to what to do with it all as at the same time so well as enough for her to be set for life which promoted for her to be able to also get a fancy apartment room place owned by her and somehow tax free etc and a huge mansion/manor too also tax free etc and remain set up for life, which could allow for her to be with money for very practically the rest of her life even so still here in consideration with how much she had even before it all, was sit on her rear and eat. For so obvious reasons, she got quite the round potbelly, which was her current problem with getting her \u201cBlack Car\u201d outfit on. \"Come..on! Why *huff* won't you... *huff* FIT!\" Grunted Felicia as she, as if by some sort whilst of a natural gift, got the zipper over her stomach. Before she could celebrate, she hit her second roadblock, her small yet still slightly curvy breasts. Already well endowed enough, Felicia had the top of her outfit already enlarged. Given her flabbier form however, she once more struggled for a good 3 or so minutes to get it on before she finally got her outfit completely on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting her wardrobe malfunctions settled, Felicia Hardy decided to have ascended to the top of her apartment home that was one of two homes with her other as her mansion/manor yet still with both as being in New York City Of New York. Readying herself for her next target, an old gold evaluating shop just closing, she then somehow also as if with such relative ease even now very successfully getting enough gold and jewels from this place that was some unethical practice using single rich male\u2019s personal front that had been exposed and also had been left for his money somehow being sent to her thanks to her secret involvement in his being exposed, it was on her way back that when all of a sudden, she caught whiff of the most intoxicating food she'd ever smelled. Looking around, Felicia Hardy spotted a car driving away from a local for-now-blacked-out-bakery-and-other-food-offering-all-one-can-eat-buffet-fancy- restaurant, presumably taking some of the goods to somewhere for one final delivery for today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus Felicia ran across the rooftops to get herself some of those baked and perhaps other food goods. At least, if she were thin as she were two dozen weeks ago. She slowly jogged, if that, across the rooftops, abandoning them halfway and taking the fire escape down to the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout Fifteen Minutes Later Felicia Hardy had so finally managed to make it into the place thus itself, known as \u201cNew York City Of New York Various Forms Of And Foods Among Goods\u201d, and then using a special remote gadget to disarm whatsoever alarm detected upon her activation of said gadget in her outfit\u2019s arm sleeves, then had she slipped on in after lockpicking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen The Now So Formerly Speedy Platinum Blonde Haired And Young Woman was greeted by each indeed and all of the greatest assortments of foods including of pastries that she had ever seen. With Miss Felicia Hardy herself as getting right down to work, she dug right in to a box of two dozen cupcakes, indeed savouring really every delicious bite of frosting. After that, she went after the twelve times extra large chocolate flavoured and chocolate flavoured icing covered cake in front of her. Not even bothering with a plate, forks or the like, she shoveled handful after handful of cake with one hand, the other rubbing her distended belly that was straining on the somehow still stretchable material made her still increasingly very tight fabric of her \u201cBlack Cat\u201d outfit whilst at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Quite Literal Few Minutes Later Felicia Hardy afterwards then had sat therefore licking her fingers for whatsoever remnants left of her feast. \u201cOh I must say it all is so *HIC*-*HIC* soooo goooood. Now however can and will I get some more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Miss Felicia Hardy, as if by luck, saw some poster hanging out front. \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d, it read, \u201ccombination of server and taste tester needed\u201d. Therefore Felicia, in part from her depression from being also unable to ever have \u201cHer Spider\u201d yet still had licked her lips very eagerly with that itself also as being at the prospect of getting paid to eat this, and so with that had she grabbed a box with two dozen of cookies and two dozen muffins and two dozen cookies and two dozen cupcakes and returned to her apartment home and set up a resume and cover letter to apply whilst online before switching into some very surprisingly even good her still very really stretchable fabric made pajama shirt and pants each of black colours and ending up as having her late night sweet food snack feast, excited for the next day.</span></div></div>",

Yet Felicia had just started without even knowing or even caring about it all with the development of such a quite so soon to be whilst ending up very increasingly massive appetite that she had ended up really only thinking about her being hired for what she was on her way to a job interview for that she had ended up as, and so all whilst ignoring them, she had looked out the window for the rest of the ride. Finally arriving at the same place as from last night not that she would mention it at all, she then walked inside, \u201chips swaying\u201d in part here from out of \u201choping to fall back on whatsoever sensual appeal whilst that she still had left\u201d. The interview was nothing special but instead consisted of all typical job interview questions such as whilst involving age, experience, why she wanted the job etc with her as mentioning herself to be in her earliest twenties etc and at all here not even five minutes after the interview had thus so even started, the male job interviewer whosoever was interviewing with Felicia Hardy somehow decided that he knew this was the best he and all the rest would get and so he had her declared as hired right on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Miss Felicia Hardy, from out of feeing quite so \u201cconfident with her success\u201d, had decided to have rewarded herself, getting for herself a quadruple extra large pint sized quadruple vanilla and chocolate flavoured eight-scoop ice cream cup and plastic spoon with it on her way back to the bus stop. Since Miss Felicia Hardy did not start her new job until a week from the one upcoming Monday Weekday with that itself as also four days from this day which was a Wednesday Weekday, she therefore still so had four days up whilst to until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore Felicia, upon her return to her home, therefore had decided to take her attire for her now at these points just passed job interview and switch into her black pajama pair described from the night prior to this here occurring day, then heading towards her fancy wealthy apartment home\u2019s living room set up large-and-capable-of-being-converted-into-a-bed-from-couch-furniture, she placed herself onto it via her back on it in the fashion of a \u201c<i>ker</i>-<i>plop</i>\u201d, after that then breathing <i>very</i> <i>heavily</i> <i>from</i> <i>sweet</i> <i>relief</i>. She was looking forward to when it would all get to happen, but for now decided to take up a nap, something she had rather <i>incredibly</i> <i>rarely</i> done even before this, if so ever here at all.</i></span></div></div>",
