The M.U.T.O's strength now proved to much as he was pushed onto his smooth back and continued to shrink until his body was pudgy and smooth. The M.U.T.O gazed down at the creature that once was the biggest threat to his kind now he was nothing more than a helpless hatchling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGodzilla rocked back and forth on his back trying to sit up, he continued to struggle until he felt a terrible sense of dread wash over him, he looked up only to come face to face with his prey, but said prey's head was now bigger than his whole body. Out of fear the little hatchling grabbed his tail and hugged it against his body as he began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What now?)</span></div></div>",

By this point the mucus was several inches thick on his body and was starting to impair his movements, and then it started to harden and take on a black color. Godzilla somehow managed to free his head from the encapsulating shell as piece of said shell formed atop his head making him look as though he just popped out. He let loose a storm of angry chirps at his predators which only resulted in them letting loose something akin to a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time the female had enough of the hatchling's defiance and lowered one of her smaller claws down on top of the hatchling's head where the egg shell was and slowly poked the brat's head back into his shell after a moment more the egg sealed leaving the once mighty alpha predator a helpless defenseless egg.<br>\r\n(What now)</span></div></div>",
