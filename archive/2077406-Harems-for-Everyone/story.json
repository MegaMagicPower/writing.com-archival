He had just got back from his first real mission outside of Konoha. It was a disaster, yes they won, Gato was dead and the Land of Wave was free. They quickly signed a treaty with The Land of Fire, for protection and trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got another ninja, Haku the last of his clan. He had the kekkei Genkai Hyoton, Ice Release. Which was power no where near the power of the Sharingan, but powerful. To bad he wasn't a real girl, he looks like a girl. If was a girl, she could have an excellent choice to help him remake the Uchiha Clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason he thought it was disaster was because he was the only one who did anything. His other two teammates if you could call them that. Sakura the pink hair Kunoichi, was useless. She was to busy fowning over him to do anything. Naruto might have helped but only when he used that red Chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was furious, he thought he could do anything if he was powerful enough, but now he realized he needed a team to take down power opponents. One person can only do so much, he wanted another team. A team who took training seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed his fist into a wall, he was shocked when his fist went right then the wall. He felt emptyness, he quickly pulled his fist out and looked into the hole. He was stunned to fine a room behind the wall. He quickly knocked down the wall and entered the room. He lift a torch to get some light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had found a secret section of his clan library. He quickly looked over the few scrolls inside. Most where to advance for him or he felt were not worth his time. Then he found two and smiled. This two could be a big help to solving his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne scroll had a way to make a target you slave peramently and the other can rewrite reality, changing a mle into a female peramently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke grinned, with this he can make any Kunoichi his slave. Sakura might be useful after all, once he makes her his slave. He can make her take her training seriously, reports say he was nartual for being a medic and genjutsu master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other if it really works, Haku be a great wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Sasuke go after first ?</span></div></div>",
