Suddenly, the lady vanished. You looked around in fear, thinking you had lost her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\" You turned around and saw her. She stood in front of a cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, you made your way over there, careful to avoid twigs. You reached her and she ushered you into the cave. The cave was mostly empty, and filled with glistening shells. You felt as if there was somebody watching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time! She is here! Let us kill her and use her blood for our freedom!\" The lady shouted. Several heavy-built man made their ways to you. They were armed with weapons ranging from arrows to swords. You were unarmed, how could you fight them all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only two choices now, you could hide, or you could run. Not being brave, both options seemed a lot to you. You knew you were wasting time but what could you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
