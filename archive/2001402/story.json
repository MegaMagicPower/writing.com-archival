The news shocked Jack, he's been looking forward on seeing and meeting the Royal family since he ever heard of the kingdom. Jack grabbed his stuff and ran down towards the Town square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When Jack makes it to the town square, it's already piled up with people wanting to watch the royal family as well.

He finds Maria's necklace that George dropped. Jack kneeled down to grab the necklace, then he shakes his head with a sad face as he place the necklace in his bag, hoping to give it back to her, someday. With his clothes all wet from the rain, Jack walks Out from the dark alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, dark clouds start to form and expand, covering the morning sky.

Causing him to trip over a fallen log, tumbling down a hill and fallen flat on his face. When jack got up on his hands and knees, he pound the ground with his fist before he remembers he still had his mothers locket on his hand. When Jack wiped the tears off his eyes and finds himself near a pond in the middle of the forest. Jack walks to the edge of the pond and washes off the blood off his hands and the locket. After jack wash is his face, he looks at his own reflection from the pond. \"Take this locket,  and save the kingdom. I have faith in you.\" Jack remembers his mother's last word's as he stars at his mother's locket. \"How am I supposed to do that, and why. I don't know what to-\" before jack could finish, he hears a voice calling out for help. Jack quickly where's the locket around his neck and runs toward the sound of the women's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was coming from a cave which was being blocked by giant boulders and rocks. \"Hello, is someone in here?!\" \"Yes. Hello? I'm trapped in here and and this is crushing me, please help!\" The woman in the cave replied as jack can here the pain of her words. Jack tries to move one the    boulders. \"It won't budge!\" \"Darn it, there must be some way.\" \" okay, just hold on and stay put, I'll, see if I can find a way inside.\" Jack said to the woman as he looks around the mountain for a way inside the cave. With no luck finding a way in. Jack climbs to the top of the  mountain and found an old well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious on knowing how deep the well goes. Jack grabs a gold coin from his money pouch and drops it in the well. Jack was Unable to hear the sound of a coin drop. \"Lady, I think I found a way in! if you can hear me, I'm coming down!\" Jack yelled to the woman as he claims in the well. \"Please hurry, I-, I can't feel my wings!\" \"Your what?!\" jack said as he losses his grip, causing him to fall down below the well to the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luckily, Jack manage to break his fall by landing on a pool of water. When jack climbed out of the pool. The light from the moon starts to illuminate the inside of the cave. But when jack looked around, it was not just a cave, it was a temple, an underground temple. Jack was amazed of what he stumbled across. Until jack heard a growl coming from behind him. When jack slowly turns around and found a dragon laying on it's side with it's wings being crushed by a large bolder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Lady?\" Jack asked the dragon when  he recognize her voice and slowly walks closer to the dragon. When the dragon opened her eyes and finds jack walking cautiously towards her. She gives a warning flame flying out of her mouth, causing jack to take two steps back. \"Get away from me!\" The dragon spoke as she struggles to move with the pain of her wings being crushed by the boulder. \"Huh, a human? Who are you,  What are you doing here, are you lost?\" \"Um, which question would you like me to answer first?\" \"... very well. The second one.\" I came to rescue you. Is that so, we'll then, if you can get this thing off of me. I would be great full. The dragon said as she struggles to move with her mind over the painful crushing of her wings. Jack nodded then he tries to push the boulder away from the dragon's wings. When the boulder was rolled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dragon stands up with the sound of the stiff bones in her body as she stretches with a deep sigh of relief. \"You helped me, thank you.\" The dragon said as she bowes her head to jack. \"It was nothing.\" Jack said with a smile. \"What where you doing here, anyway.\" \"I was... hiding.\" \"Hiding, from what?\" \"That's, all you need to know.\"  The dragon said as she walks past jack and heads toward the dark hallway, then jack try's to catch up with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen jack and the dragon reached to the end of the hallway, it was too dark to see. But the dragon closed her eyes, follows the scent of coal and uses her fire breath to light the coal. Suddenly, the flame starts to follow a trail of coal leading to a table, next to a stone wall on the other side of the bridge. \"What is this place?\" \"Your guess is as good as mine, human.\" \"Please call me jack.\" \"Pleasure to meet you, jack.\" \"Do you have a name?\" \"I'm... Whispa.\" after the conversation, jack and whispa reaches to what seems to be a dead end wall with ancient carvings on it. Jack was looking at a strange looking stone, displayed on the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Peacekeepers.\" Whispa said when she recognize the symbol on the wall. \"The what?\" \"The Peacekeepers, it's an old legend of the five guardians who saved the land of peragon many years ago.\" Whispa said as she tries to make sense of all this. Jack reaches over to grab the strange stone. Then suddenly.  A bright light shines from the stone, causing the wall to disappear in a bright flash of light. \"How did you do that?\" Whispa said. \"I think it has something to do. with this.\"Jack said as he shows whispa the unknown stone shard that caused it. Suddenly the power from the stone causes a cave quake. \"We need to leave, now!\" Whispa yelled over the sound of the temple falling apart. Jack and whispa runs through the tunnel witch was opened from the stone wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, Look, a way out!\" Whispa said as they get closer to the end of the cave. Suddenly the ground falls apart after whispa ran past it. Jack tries to jump over the large gap and holds on the ledge for dear life. \"Jack!\" Whispa yelled when she stopped and saw jack hanging on the ledge. When jack lost his grip, whispa managed to catch him with her tail. \"Hold on tight!\" Whispa yelled when she tossed jack on her back, then ran out of the cave. When whispa jumps out of the cave, she was unable to fly with her broken wings. So then they feel into a river near a water fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispa climbed out of the river with jack still on her back. Jack climbs off of her back and sites down against a tree to catch his breath. \"Hay, it's been, nice to make your acquaintance.\"Whispa said when she looks up at the sky. \"Huh, where are you going?\" Jack asked when whispa walks away. \"...Some where hide.\" \"Don't you have a home or family?\" \"Don't you?\"  Whispa said as she turns and looks at jack. Whispa continued to walk away with her head facing down with a sorry look.. \"...there's always tomorrow jack. There's always tomorrow. \" Jack said to himself befor he falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at a mercenary outpost. The mercenary leader runs to his office and finds his map glowing with the location of the stone that Jack holds. \"Rebecca.\" The Leader calls for his second in command. \"You ring, boss?\" Rebecca said as she leans against a wall in the shadows, holding her mask in her hand. \"I need you to hunt someone down and bring me this artifact.. The leader said as he leans and points to the picture of the artifacts on the table. \"Who is the target?\" \"His name is jack. You will find him at the town square near. Paragon castle.\" \"Consider it done.\" Rebecca said when she puts on her mask with a devious smile on her face.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the pain in his back from the impact of the fireball starts to take its toll. Jack looks around in search for a hospital. When Jack found the hospital, he knocks on the door as the pain gets worse. \"Now look here if you're going to-\" the doctor stopped talking when he opened the door and saw jack gritting his teeth in pain. \"Good heavens boy, what happened to you?\" The doctor asked as he helps jack inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day. The doctor and his assistant treated Jack's wounds with a bandage around his back.\" There you go, how are you feeling.\" \"I feel, great.\" Jack said as he slowly Stands up from the hospital bed. \"It will take time for your back to fully heal from... How did you get this injury?\" \"I Uh, fell on a campfire. And, burnt my shirt apparently.\" Jack said knowing that he could not believe what happened to him if he told him the truth. \"Well, be more careful next time you go out camping.\" \"Uh, yeah I will. Also could I have these bandages, for next time I get Clumsy.\" \"Very well, help yourself.\" \"Thank you for your help, my name's Jack by the way.\" \"dr. Jefferson, pleased to meet a friendly face once in a while.\" Dr. Jefferson said as he shakes hands with Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack leaves the hospital, he finds a whole group of people gathered in front of a balcony at the Castle grounds. When Jack walks closer to see what's going on. Rebecca wearing a dark blue hooded robe and mask starts to tail him. In the center of the crowd, jack saw Princess Maria next to the noble man Marcus as he prepares a speech. \"People of Paragon, I regret to inform you that the village of Karosa was attacked by bandits.\" \"liar, it wasn't bandits.\" Jack whispers to himself as he remembers that terrible night. After the speech, when Jack noticed that his money pouch was stolen, he saw Rebecca showing him his money pouch as she looks at him with the corner of her eye with a devious laugh. \"hey, get back here!\" Jack yelled as he chases after the thief. \"Huh, is that...?\" Maria said when she saw Jack chasing The thief. \"Maria, is there something the matter?\" \"excuse me, Marcus.\" Maria said before she tries to follow Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chase ends up in an empty church. Suddenly, the large doors of the church was locked up tight with Jack and Rebecca inside and Maria outside. \"Not exactly the best place for a confrontation, but it will do.\" Rebecca said as she sits on the stone table with her legs crossed. \"Hm... You don't seem to be the troublemaking type, are you Jack?\" \"How did you know my name?\" \"Oh, I'm sorry, you may call me Rebecca. My boss sent me to kill you.\"Rebecca said as she points to Jack with a surprised look on his face. \"Nothing personal.\" Rebecca said as she drops her hooded robe on the floor, pulls out her sword and tries to strike Him but Jack managed to dodge her attack. Jack kept on blocking and dodging her attacks using the items around the church until Rebecca swings her sword upward and breaking jack's locket just inches away from his neck. Followed up with a side kick to his gut, causing him to fly off his feet and land on his back. When jack struggles to get up. Rebecca points her sword to his neck. \"Not bad, jack, but this is where the fun ends.\" Rebecca said as she makes ready to stab Jack. But then Rebecca caught sight of jack's locket on the ground next to Rebecca. \"where. Where did you get this?\"Rebecca asked Jack as she picks up the broken locket, causing her to have flashbacks of what she did. \"That locket belongs to my mother, give it back.\"Jack said as he struggles to get up once again. Rebecca looks at Jack with a stunned look on her face. Suddenly, the guards outside the church tries to break down the doors, then Rebecca grabs her robe and disappeared in the shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the guards broke open the doors, they pointed their spears at Jack as he was standing up. \" Jack?\" \"Maria\" Jack said as he saw Maria walking inside. \"your Majesty, you know this man?\" \"put your weapons down soldier, this man rescued me.\" Maria said, then the guards points their spears away from Jack and went back to their post. \"Jack, I am so glad that you are alright.\" \"Likewise\u2026 your majesty.\"Jack said as he and Maria smiles. \"please, walk with me, tell me what happened.\" Maria said then Jack followed Maria outside the church and into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Jack told Maria about his home being destroyed. While they were sitting on a bench \"somehow I survived, and they did not...\" Jack said before he Shaded a tear, Maria grabbed his hand causing Jack to blush as he looks over at Maria. \"i'm so sorry.\"Maria said. Suddenly a crazy terrified beggar runs inside the city. \"dragon, there's a Dragon out there!\" The crazy beggar Shouted as the guards restrained him. The news made Jack worried that someone may have found Whispa. \"Jack, where are you going?\" \"Sorry Maria, got to run.\" Jack said as he runs outside the city walls, toward the Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Whispa was being chased by a group of hunters. But then she stopped at a dead end cliff . When Whispa looked behind her, the hunters cornered her to the edge of the cliff. \"whispa!\" Jack yelled as he saw whispa being cornered by the hunters. \"Leave, me, alone.\" Whispa said as the hunters gets closer to her. \"just leave me alone.\" \"Time to Claim our prize.\" One of the hunters said as the group pulled out their weapons. \"I said, leave...me...ALONE!!!!\" Whispa shouted as the flame in their heart starts to grow. Causing her claws, teeth, tail, and horns to grow sharper. Causing the scales on her skin to grow stronger. Lastly her eyes change to a fiery glow. followed up with a loud roar. Jack stopped a couple of feet away from the hunters when whispa changed to her rage state. When the hunters attack. Whispa defeated them with her tail and head. With the last hunter still standing. he picks up a longsword and charges in to strike her but Whispa grabs for longsword with her teeth. Then she tosses the Hunter holding the sword off the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Whispa was catching her breath, Jack slowly step closer, until he steps and brakes a stick. Causing Whispa to tackle Jack. \"Whispa, it's me!\" Jack yelled as he closes his eyes bracing for the worst while Whispa is holding Jack down with her Paw. When The flame in her heart dies down, Whispa regains her normal state. \"Huh, jack. Oh no, I i'm sorry, I did not hurt you, did I?\" Whispa asked as she takes her paw off of Jack and tries to help him up. \"don't worry, I'm ok. I'm just glad that you came to your senses.\" Jack said as he placed his hand on whispa's back. \" You need a place to hide and I need a New place to call home. Maybe we should travel together.\"Jack said as he picks up a spear from the dead Hunter when he closes his eyelids. \"Why, I would like that, thank you.\" \"also, if we ever run into the those types of guys again, do your best to fightback but please. try not to kill.... No one deserves to die.\" Jack said  before he breaks off the arrowhead of the spear with his foot. \"promise?\" Jack asked as he offers his hand to shake for the promise to be kept. \"... Promise.\" Whispa said after she looked at the damage that she made, then she shakes Jack's hand with her paw. Jack and Whispa smiled at each other knowing that they just became good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on top of a clock tower.

That was my rage state. It's easy to start but, difficult to Control and stop. My people where called Monsters for that same reason. they lose control then they act on instinct.\" \"I see, If you didn't go to your rage state, you would've been dead from those hunters.\"Jack said as he understands how Whispa survives in self-defense. \"are your wings still Broken? I have some bandage straps in my bag. It might not be much but it could help your wings to heal up.\" Jack said as he puts his hand on his bag. \"Why are you helping me? Why are you not afraid? I mean... I am a dragon. And your... A human.\" Whispa said in a confused tone. Jack pause then he looked away with a troubling expression on his face \"I wish I had an answer for that but-\" before Jack can finish  talking in his head. He hears something coming closer further down the road. \"Hide.\"Jack said as they look around for place to hide. Jack hides behind a tree while Whispa hides behind A large rock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound was coming from a carriage with four guards in horseback in a square formation around the carriage. When the carriage passed by, Jack caught sight of Maria in the carriage. Jack manage to cover his mouth before he calls out Maria so that he won't spook her or the guards. Suddenly The guards were shot and killed by bandit archers perched on top of the trees. After the surprise attack, Rebecca was leaning against and standing on a tree. When the bandits came closer to the carriage. Jack steps out with his broken spear. \"There you are you slippery little-\"before Rebecca could finish, there was a loud roar coming from the sky. \"Oh no, not now.\" Whispa said whether she saw a armored dragon flying overhead searching for her. The loud roar scared the horses causing them to run away, along with the carriage with Maria still inside. Running out of time, Jack runs past the spaced out bandits and jumps on to a seemingly brave horse to rescue Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running past the Forest. Jack gets closer and closer to the runway carriage.\"Jack!\" Maria Shouted when she saw him right next to the carriage.<br>\r\n\"Maria, Open the door!\" Jack Shouted as he struggles to stay alongside with the carriage. \"what should I do?!\" \"Jump to me!\" \"What!\" Maria Shouted with a scared look on her face. \"you've got to jump!\" \"I- I can't!\" \"yes you can, this road won't last forever and I can't get closer to you!\" Jack yelled. The runaway carriage was heading towards a cliff. \"Do you trust me?\" \"... Yes!\" \"Then Jump... Please.\"Jack said as he reaches out to catch her. Maria closes her eyes and jumps out towards Jack. When the horses broke free and the carriage fell down the cliff. Jack managed to keep a stronghold on Maria's hand as the horse stops just inches away from the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night. Jack and Maria got off of the horse and set down on a hillside to catch their breath. \"You were amazing back there.\"Jack said as he smiles \"I took a leap of faith and you rescued me, twice even. Thank you.\" \"... It was nothing.\"Jack says as he blushed and smiled once more. \"So what will you be doing now?\" Maria asked. \"well I've been looking around for a roof over my head but.\" \"you're looking for a house? I think I have just the thing.\"Maria said as she grabs Jack by the hand and leads him to an Old abandon clock tower looking over the ocean and the kingdom of Paragon. \"It's perfect.\" \"consider it as a gift for saving my life.\" \"I appreciate the kindness, your majesty. Thank you.\" \"you can call me that when were in the city. But please, call me Maria.\"Maria said causing Jack to blush. \"until we meet again, hero.\"Maria said when she climbs on the horse then rides back to the castle. \"Who was that?\"Whispa said suddenly surprising Jack. \"that was the Princess. And she just helped us find a new Home.\"Jack said, then Him and Whispa went inside the Clocktower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the mercenary outpost. \"what do you mean you where able to kill him!\" The mercenary Leader Shouted. \"... I'm sorry boss, he, caught me off guard. Not only that, but.. He seems to have... A dragon by his side. A actual fire breathing Dra-\" The dragon is of no concern.

Jack and whispa Where dismantling the large bell. \"Bring it down. nice and easy.\" Jack said \"it's..easier said than done, you know.\" Whispa Grants as she lowers the bell using the rope, with her teeth. Suddenly the sound of someone knocking on the door caused Whispa to open her mouth causing the bell to fall inches away from where Jack was standing. \"Sorry!\" Whispa apologize. \"What?! Hold on I think someone's at the door!\" Jack shouted with his ears ringing from the bell as he opens the door to see who it is. \"Hello?!\" \"Are you Mr. Jack?\" \"What?!\" \"I said, are you Mr. Jack?!!\" \"yes I am, but there's no need to shout. Jack said as his ears stopped ringing. \"... (Cough), I am a messenger from paragon Castle. Her Majesty, princess Maria sent me to invite you to this years royal ball at the Castle tonight.\" The messenger said as he gave Jack the invitation and putting out his hand expecting a tip for the delivery. Jack steps inside,grabs a fresh apple, and gives it to the messenger. \"what is this?\" \"That is an Apple, it's good for you, bye-bye.\" Jack said then he closes the door and the messenger walks away. \"What's that you have there?\" Whisper asked \"It's an invitation from Maria for the royal ball tonight.\" \"why that's wonderful... Yet you are not happy.\" Believe me I'm grateful. it's just, I don't have anything good to wear, all I have here is my Torn up Clothes.\" Jack said as he points to his old clothes that he's wearing. suddenly someone else was knocking on the door. When Jack open the door, there was a package on the doorstep with a note. \"See you there.\" The note reads. Jack open the package and finds a High class suit. \"Jack, what's inside the box?\" Whispa asked. \"It's a suit. Looks like I'm going to the ball after all.\" Jack said as he looks at whispa with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater today, after putting on his New suit. Jack gets ready to head on out to the castle. \"Will you be alright here by yourself?\" Jack asked in a concern Town. \"relax, I'll be fine, now go and enjoy yourself, go on.\" whisper said as she nudges Jack with her head to the door. With a smile and a wave, Jack heads towards the Castle. Meanwhile the bandit brothers were hiding behind the bushes as they saw Jack walk away from his house. \"Bingo.\" George said with a grin. \"Polo!\" Robert yelled before George puts his hand in front of this month. Look at that there's bound to be some treasure in that house. Let's go.\"George said as they both sneak inside the Clocktower. When the door swing open, whispa look down from The inside balcony and saw the two bandits stealing. whispa smiled and she thinks of an idea to pass the time and to scare off the bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night in the castle. The butler walks inside with Jack and introduces him to the rest of the Nobles and higher classes. After the awkward silence, The music resumes playing and Nobles resumed as well. Jack makes his way to the buffet table as he awaits for Maria's arrival. \"Not bad, I thought that suit would suit you.\" \"Rebecca, what are you doing here?!\" Jack said as he quickly grabs a chicken leg and points it at her. \"relax, I'm not going to fight you. Not tonight at least.\" \"were you invited?\" \"Huh, Who needs invitations when you can dress up like them. In this kingdom as long as you have the gold, they don't care who you are... Typical royalty.\" Rebecca said in a sour town. Suddenly the sound of trumpets catches the attention of everyone in the castle. \"ladies and gentlemen, her Majesty princess Maria.\" The Butler said as Maria makes his way down the stairs. \"wow, She looks, beautiful.\" Jack said as he looks at Maria. \"I don't think you're her type.\" \"Jack.\" Princess Maria said as she waved at jack. \"She knows you?\" \"I, ran into her a few times\" Jack said as he scratches the back of his Head.  \"... I'll just leave the two of you alone.\"Rebecca said then she disappears as she blends in with the crowd. \"Jack, I'm glad you came.\" \"I am honored to receive your invitation.\"Jake said as he blushed from the site of her smile. \"Please,come with me, there someone that I would like you to meet\" Maria said as she walks with jack over to Marcus. \"Marcus.\" \"Maria. How are you my love?\" \"I am fine. There's someone-\" \"Who are you, what are you doing here, this place is for Royal members only. \" \"Marcus please, this man is my savior I was telling you about. I invited him.\" \"What?\" \"This is Jack from Karosa, he rescued me.\" \"when you were wandering off?\" Marcus said causing Maria to look away to her shoulder. \"now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.\" Marcus said as he makes his way to the war room. \"A survivor from Karosa? but, he can't be.\" Rebecca said when she eavesdrop on the conversation. \"He seems nice.\" Jack said in a sarcastic tone. I'm sorry. he's not usually like this but he keeps on treat me like a little girl.\" \"Is he your brother, or something?\" \"...not exactly. But enough about me. please enjoy yourself. and jake....thank you.\" Maria said with a smile as she walks away to talk with the Nobles causing Jack to smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of shady Noble guards walked up to Jack. \"Hey, are you the farmer?\" \"Well I'm A farmer so-\" before Jack could finish, The guards grab jack and taken him to a abandoned storage room. \"let's make this quick before the guards finds out where we are.\" The fake Guard said as they pull out there disguise revealing themselves as mercenaries. After jack takes a couple of hits. The mercenaries pulls out there daggers and attempts to stab jack. But then Jack manages to counter their attacks as he disarms and knocks out the mercenaries. Suddenly A mercenary flies through the door from Rebecca's sidekick. \".....we have a problem.\" Rebecca said when she saw Jack standing next to the knocked out mercenaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Rebecca ran to the ball room to see what's going on. when they got there, Rebecca grabs jack and hide behind a support beam. The bowl room was threatened by mercenaries, posing as high-class guests. \"What are they doing. I told them, no civilian casualties.\" \"are they with you, what are they doing here?\" \" they were supposed to be at my backup team, but looks like The bounty on your head is making them reckless. Idiots.\" Rebecca said. \"I'll ask again. where is the farmer?\" The mercenary Captain asked the old Butler as he grabs him by the Neck. And the other mercenaries were holding Maria hostage. \"I, know, nothing.\" \"Worthless!\" The mercenary captain Shouted as he threw him on the floor. When the mercenary captain it pulls out his sword to strike The old man. Jack ran down the stairs, grab the old man's cane, and blocked against the mercenaries sword. When Jack pushed away the mercenary, he turned to help the old Butler. \"Are you alright sir, Can you walk?\" \"ah- yes, I'm fine.\" \"not for long. Man, attack!\" The mercenary captain ordered the other mercenaries to attack jack. As the old man runs away to find help. Jack defends off and counter attacks the handful of mercenaries without killing them. \"don't move, Farmer.\" The mercenary captain said as Jack looks behind himself and saw the mercenary Captain Holding Maria while pointing a pistol at her head. \"Maria!\" \"Jack!\" \"One wrong step... And the kingdom will lose its Princess.\" The mercenary captain said with an evil smile. \"let... her... go.\" Jack said as he fears for Maria's life with an angry look on his face. \"how about this? you drop your cane. And I'll let her go.\" As Jack slowly places the cane on the floor. Rebecca slowly pulls out a throwing knife from her dress. The mercenary captain points the gun away from Maria then aims the gun at Jack. But then, Rebecca through her knife at the mercenary captain spine. Causing him to shoot at the ceiling as he yells in pain. The bullet cuts the rope of a big chandelier suspended right above the mercenary Captain. Jack runs towards Maria then tackles her away from The mercenary captain before the chandelier fell on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night. the guards were arresting the mercenaries and taken to prison.Jack was sitting on a bench outside of the castle with the cane he took for a Souvenir. \"Jack, are you okay?\"Maria said as she walks on over and sits beside him.\"Maria, I'm fine but, I should be asking you that question. After what happened.\" \"don't worry about me I'm fine. I was afraid at first, but I feel safe now, and so are the others thanks to you.\"Maria said as she gave Jack a hug causing him to blush. \"what were those mercenaries doing here? What did they want with you?\" \"I don't now, but I need to figure this out before anyone gets hurt...or worse.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night. When jack was close to the Clocktower. \" Ahhhhh. ghost, monsters, the clocktower is haunted!!\" The Bandit Brothers said when they stormed out of the Clocktower and ran away. Out of curiosity, Jack goes inside his home. \"You can come out now.\"Jack said as he can hear whispa laughing. \"Hahaha, scaring off those bandits just made my day hahaha.\" Whispa said as she keeps on laughing. \"so how was your Night in the castle?\" \"oh whispa, you won't believe me even if I told you.\"Jack said as he sits down against the broken Bell on the floor.</span></div></div>",

Jack tried to tackle the chicken but it jumped away from his grasp. Whispa laughed as Jack was geting back on his feet. \"What's so funny?\" Jack asks. \"This is how humans hunt for their food?\" \"Hay, i'm a farmer not a hunter. What are you doing to help?\" \"Looking for my own food, I would love to help you but-\" Whispa suddenly picked up a sent of something delicious. While Jack was chasing after the chicken. Whispa was following The smell of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back here you little chicken!\" Jack Shouted as he gets closer and closer to catching the chicken. But then suddenly Jack steps on a rope trap which pulls and hangs him upside down. \"Ha, Out of all the chicken's in the forest, I catch the biggest one of all.\"Rebecca said as she jumped down from a nearby tree. Rebecca pulls out her sword to cut the rope, causing Jack to fall on his head. \"Ow, Who are you calling a-. Rebecca!\"Jack said as he quickly gets up on his feet into a fighting stance. \"what are you doing here?\" \"don't you remember? we still have a little score to settle.\" \"i'm not gonna fight you if that's what you're saying. which reminds me, I think you still have something that belongs to me.\" \"Oh, you mean this?\" Rebecca asks as she shows Jack his family's locket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Whispa Continues to follow the smell of food. when she walks outside of the forest. She spotted a sheep out in the open. Whispell was more hungry than curious, \"lunchtime.\" whispa said with a grin as she runs, jumps and sinks her teeth on the sheep. \"Huh? What the-\" Whispa said as she noticed the sheep was fake. Suddenly  A group of mercenaries struggles to restrain her as thay hit her with powerful sleep darts. Whispa was unable to trigger her rage state to break free. By then she passed out. \"One down, one more to go.\" The mercenary leader said as he walks over to see Rebecca's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in the other side of the forest. \"give it back to me.\" Jack said as he points to the locket that Rebecca is holding. \"Or what, you're going to Dodge me again? Your luck is bound to run out, and when it does, I'll finish it.\" \"Then...then why did you hesitate?!\" Jack asked and yelled causing Rebecca to stutter with a surprised look on her face. \"back at the church, you could have finished me off. Instead you grabbed my mothers locket then vanished, after you apologized!\" Jack Shouted, hoping to finally get some answers. Rebecca took two steps back as she looks away. \"if that wasn't enough, back in the castle, you could've let the mercenary Capt. Shoot me or finish the job yourself! But no, you killed your own Capt. To save either the princess or me!\" \"T-The captain took matters in his own hands...and he paid for it... with his life.\"  \"Maybe so, but that doesn't change the facts. If you really are a assassin, then why can't you... Why can't you end it. why can't you kill me?!\" \"Because I murdered your mother!!!\" Rebecca shouted at Jack before she could shed tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack fell to his hands and knees as he begins to cry. \"...that's why I apologized...that's why I ran off...and that's why I can't take your life... I'm...sorry.\" Rebecca said as she puts away her sword. Suddenly a sound of slow clapping coming from the mercenary leader as he makes his way towards Rebecca and Jack. \"Rebecca my girl, there is absolutely no reason for you to feel sorry for yourself. After all, his mother is the reason you're mother and my wife is gone.\" \"Liar!... My mother would never do that!\" \"Ah, and you must be Jack. I never thought I have the pleasure to see Benjamin's only son before me.\" \"Ben...who?\" \"strange you don't remember your father. no matter, you and your dragon friend are coming with us. we have a lot of catching up to do.\" The mercenary leader said with a dastardly smile. From the corner of jack's eye, he saw whispa being dragged away two horses. \"Whispa!!!...what have you done to her, What have you done?!! Jack shouted as he gets up but then gets knocked out by one of the mercenaries blunt end of there swords. And now Jack and whispa where taken to the mercenary outpost.</span></div></div>",

When the mercenary guard took the sack off of Jack's head. He regains consciousness as his vision returns. \"We meet at last, Jack.\" the leader said as he looks out the window \"I should've known that the storm wouldn't be able to take you down.\" The leader said with his hands behind his back as he slowly walks towards Jack. \"And you are?\" Jack asks as his arms are being restrained by two guards. \"... I  am Gavin. The leader of The mercenaries. Your father and I ...were good Friends.\" \"My father?\" \"yes, Benjamin. You never heard of him?\" \"....?\" \"did your mother ever told you?!\" \"Huh?\" \"HE WAS A LEGEND!!!\" Gavin shouted then he punched Jack in the face, causing Rebecca to take one step forward with the surprised look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many years ago. Benjamin created The peacekeepers. they were paragons finest warriors. One of them was my wife, Rosie.\" Gavin said as he flashback to the year of what happened. \"Mother...\" Rebecca said as she folds her arm while leaning against a bookshelf. \" we've been through many hardships, many battles. But, that's when our friendship has ended. ...we were at war, against the Dragons\" \" The Dragons?\" \"yes. They invaded our land and attacked our people! We were the real heroes. we were so close on finishing them off.... until that day. The peacekeepers used the guardian Seal! Everything we've done, All of our sacrifices all of our victories, have been FOR NOTHING!!!\" Gavin said as he takes his anger out on Jack by punching him in the gut. The two guards who were restraining Jack releases him. Causing Jack to fall on the floor while cringing in pain. \"But Gavin's sir, what does Jack have to do with anything, he's done nothing wrong.\" Rebecca said as she stands between Jack and Gavin.\" Are you becoming soft Rebecca or do I see those innocent eyes again?\" \"Ah...no sir.\" Rebecca says she looks down in fear of speaking up to Gavin. \"this Child is the last bloodline of the peacekeepers. Once he's dead, then no one will stand in my way from finishing what we started years ago.\" Gavin said as he raises his fist with a smile. \" what...are you, going to do to my friend?\" Jack asked as he struggles to get on his hands and knees. \"Hahaha... Don't worry, we won't kill her. We will just...use her as Target practice.\" Gavin said with a evil laugh. \"take him to the dungeon.and prepare for the execution.\" Gavin said to the guards. Before the guards could grab him, Jack pushed away the guards, reached for Rebecca's knife, then grabbed her as a hostage with a knife near her throat. \"Let me and my friend go, NOW!\" Jack yelled as the other mercenary guards stand their ground. \"... Go ahead then, do it.\" \"Huh?!\" \" haven't you heard? She's the one Who killed your mother. At the very least you get your revenge....go on, make your mother proud and a avenge her.\" Gavin said with confidence, but Rebecca couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"...no...\" Jack said as he begins to tear up. \"...you can't can you? Your mother must've raised you to be soft and weak, just like your father.\" \"I...am not...weak.\" \"then prove it. Kill her!\" Gavin Yelled. Jack looks down at his hand slowly opens to drop the knife to the ground, then he let's go of Rebecca. \"...don't worry, it will all be over. soon.\" \"...you monster...\" \"call me whatever you like...but this kingdom, Will know me as a war hero....take him away.\" Gavin said as the guards took Jack to the dungeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, In the dungeon. Whispa wakes up and finds a metal collar around her neck keeping her in her cell. By then, Whispa saw Jack get dragged into his cell by the guards. \"Jack, are you alright? Whispa asked with concern when the guards left the dungeon. \"....\" \"Jack?\" \"....no...i'm not alright...but thanks for asking...\" \"Jack...are you...crying?\" \"......yeah...\" \"what's wrong?\" \"it's complicated.\" \"Jack?\" \"you don't want to hear it!\" \"Jack!... Please.\" \".....I am to be executed.....\" Jack said after he wipes away his tears, then he tells Whispa what happened and what's going to happen. \"...Wow...\" Whispa spoke after the silent pause. \"...Yep...\" \"So your-?\" \"yes.\" \"You survive the-?\" \"that's right.\" \"and they're going to-?!\" \"exactly.\"  \"My people, they're in danger. we got to do something.\" \".....there's nothing we can do.\" \"What? We can't call it quits. innocent lives will be in the crossfire!\" \"Enough!\" Jack shouted as he takes his anger out on the cell door. \"I have nothing to fight for.\" \"but, your a peacekeeper.\" \"i'm just a Farmer, without a farm... Without a home... Without a family.\" \"it's over...\" Jack said  as he leaned his head down and Whispa sheds a tear. \"He's right.\" Rebecca said as she appeared from the shadows. \"You! How long were you standing there?!\" Whispa asked as she growled at the unknown stranger. \"Long enough, to know what's going on.\" Rebecca said as she unlocks, opens, and walks inside jacks cell. \"What do you want?\" \"...answers.\" Rebecca said as she takes out Jack's locket from her pocket and tossed it to him. After Jack catch it, it was open, and he saw a picture of his mother and father inside the locket. \"I need to know. did she kill my mother?\" \"... Your an assassin. why do you care about the person you kill?\" \"You think I enjoy it?! Unlike some murders, I have morals. I will not take the life of the innocent. But to bring justice to the wicked. That's the promise I made...after my mother left me.\" \"What happened next?\" \"...Ever since my mom left, my father, I mean Gavin, teach me how to fight when  I was 10 years old, I had my first sword at The age of 12.\" \"What?!\" \"Keep your voice down. Do you want to get executed early?\" Rebecca asks. \"you've been combat training ever since?\" \"Yes. But it doesn't stop there. He gave me this mask.\" Rebecca said as she points to the mask that she's wearing. \"he gave you a mask, why?\" \"to hide my identity? I don't know, I never ask him questions, but...it's like, he can look at me in the eyes again. And now he's talking about wars, dragons, and peacekeepers. He never tells me anything!\" \"do you ever questioned him? you have the right to know.\" \"...I can't. I'm...scared of him. ever since, that one day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" that one day, you mean...?\" \"Karosa, yes. Gavin told me who killed my mother. I was angry, I wanted revenge on the person who did it. Later that day we went to Karosa to confront her.\" Rebecca says as she flashes back to the day of the dark sky. \"Jack, where are you my son?\" Jack's mother said as she looks out the window with worry. \"hello there Sarah. remember me?\" Gavin said as Sarah looks behind her to see him alongside with Rebecca. \"Gavin!\" Sarah said but before she could do anything, Gavin ran up, grabbed her by the neck, and lifted her up. \"it's been a long time. With all the other peacekeepers gone you're the only one left.\" \"Gavin ...i'm sorry... We were not able, to stop the darkness. we were not able... to save you.\" \"Shut up!\" Gavin Shouted then Gavin punched Sarah in the gut and through her at the wall. \"Gavin called me to give the final stab. But I hesitated when I saw her eyes.\" \"Her eyes?\" \"I can tell between a heartless killer and a grieving mother. Between the truth and the lies through their eyes. By then my father grew inpatient then he grabbed my hand that was holding the sword and stabbed her. Do you know why I am telling you all this?\" \"... Why?\" Jack asks as the bell suddenly rings. \"Times up... Say your goodbyes.\" \"Gavin is going to start a war with the dragons.\" Jack said as Rebecca was about to leave. Innocent lives will be in danger, and you are going to follow the orders of a madman?!\" \"this madman is my father.\" \"...then what are you to him... His daughter... Or his puppet?\" Jack asked but Rebecca did not answer, then she left the dungeon before the mercenaries came in, grabbed Jack, Then brought him outside as whispa struggles to break the chains.</span></div></div>",

She could go as far to say that her father became somewhat distant from the people. Mandella sighed as she started to pick some berries. After picking berries Mandella was on her way back until a large shadow soared above her head. She looked and saw a red dragon flying high in the sky. It is said that spotting a dragon could mean various things, but spotting one after having a fortune told about a possible civil war is definitely not a good sign. Judging by his speed at which he flew the dragon was heading towards Flareton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could that dragon have something to do with Madam Halsey's fortune? It must be. The perpetrator will use the dragon attack to sway the people. I must warn father at once!</i> Mandella thought as she rushed off with her basket of berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Castanovo watched the horizon and saw his daughter running with a grave expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father! We need to head back immediately! I just saw a dragon fly towards Flareton! I believe that the traitor might use this incident to turn the people against you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what you say is true than we must go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCastronovo and his men hastily pack up and head towards the town.</span></div></div>",

Of course when their leader decides to go hunting is when their city gets torched not by an army, but by a dragon. The people respect dragons but they do not like rogue dragons coming in and burning the city whenever they felt like.
