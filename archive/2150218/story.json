The last thing you remember is that the intergalactic voyager that you were in suddenly had engine failure and started to fall towards the nearby planet Kython. You look yourself over and see that you are okay. You undo the restraints holding you to the chair and stand up. After checking to see if the planet can sustain human life, and getting the green light, You open the latch to the outside world, but before you step outside are you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pod doors opens slowly, the outside light blinding you, while you raise your hand you feel around head. As you raise your body out of the life pod you notice that your helmet is still on. with the atmosphere being perfectly able to sustain life you tap a button the side of your helmet. the steel almost liquefies into the shoulder piece of your suit. The full heavy helmet the protected your skull has retread deep into your suit. You begin checking your self for injuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cryo-stais  burns, no. Re-entry burns? No. Planetary difference sickness...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lurch forward, knees buckling under the mere mention of the sickness, as it has been know to end a life in so very capacious manners. From bleeding out of all the holes on your body to a lung suddenly exploding years later. you begin to press another button on your suit to check your vitals. The suit emits a low green light and a disc ejects from your back side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please state the nature of your medical emergency.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc I need a deep examination for planetary difference sickness, I can't tell if I have it or not. the situation might be dire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drone hovered quietly floating in air making a low hum. Its scanner going up and down your body and circling you several times. Finally it spoke, unfortunately the news was worse than any sickness could possibly do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jericho Eden, age four-teen, parents are James Eden and Veronica Eden. Both parents are deceased. The crew of the Intergalactic voyager named as Hope's wings has been terminated. No life signs of any humans have been found on the entire planet. Jericho Eden, you are the last surviving member of the Human race. Recommended actions; Locate the crash site of the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT, WAIT, REPEAT THAT! Re.....peat the last part about the crew.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJericho sits on the pod. Slowly putting hands on its exterior. grasping as tight as possible attempting to prepare for the shock. The shock of it all setting in, in this familiar tale. He has heard it before, before the great migration. The tale of a lone survivor being left on an alien world without any way to contact a fleet or passing ship. The stories of finding the people left alone for so long to where they are barely sane, or where they find the remains from people who hand been trapped on a world for an entire life time. Alone. all alon.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crew is terminated, however only one satellite was launched into orbit of this world. The mission directive is still in effect. As the protocol dictates you are the final member of the crew and there promoted to captain. Launching the other satellites would allow a full scan of the planet, thus enhancing this drone's ability to check the planet's entire surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't scan all of the planet? I though the directive was to launch all of the orbital recon satellites and then touch down once we established that the planet could sustain human life. Did we not follow it through?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your predecessor; Captain Angelica Klanie, did not want to set down. She used the over ride command to prevent the last two orbital satellites from launching. Then after a 36 hour period tensions reached a climax. and then a meteorite composed of Star heart hit ship. during a meeting they failed to launch out. Pods were launched a total of 17 pods 11 of which are made for groups and families have been verified to have a successful escape. The ship still has power, it has begun to go into emergency mode. We have 7'986 years to reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJericho paused slowly raising himself he steadied his hands. pushing through the idea that everyone was gone. He began to formulate a plan. He brain was turning its gears, the brain storm was strong and soon he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc can you get a full message out to the reaming pods and other drones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly Captain, I would need to connect to the main frame and enhance my broadcasting abilities to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I'll gather what I can from the pod, then we will move  out in the morning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ill-advised. there are natives that have human level of intelligence. recommendation; Move there is an approaching group of 15 armed life forms.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The crowds listened to the crier, having only one option to understand the events that had transpired. At dusk the previous day an event of cataclysmic proportions had begun Signaling its call on the stage. The earth trembled with an unnatural force, the city's structures were wailing under the strange forces in play, and finally the object of interest burned through the sky; A blazing chariot of heavenly origins. Its light had almost made the people believe the sun had returned, but the fear of the unnatural, made the crowds run from their homes. Yet a miracle occurred, something fell from the chariot. A small light was dropped on the earth, \"a gift from the gods.\", they thought. No sooner than its departure from the massive chariot did it disappear, with a loud bang and a light emanate from the area it seem to land in The men on the walls had see it's place of descent. The people struck with awe gathered at gates and looked towards the land where it laid, before the moons had even rose to their highest peak, tales were being spun of a small light crashing on the earth; its treasures being possibly the most valuable of anything in the known world. A heavenly Warrior sent by the gods to bring about the changes and unite the world. The number of tales were impossible to count. Many a citizen had witnessed its grand entrance on their home world. Only after speculation and aid from the church did the people begin to return home and to their places of gathering. They were struck with many heavy thoughts as they begun to head back into their homes and businesses. Soon sleep began to spread and those who were watching through out the night looked to chariot's path. Its fate was unknown, but The night watch had a moved many guards to the eastern gate, for fear of the unknown is the greatest force known to all. They prepared for battle; donning heavy armor and readying the best of their city. The long hours ticking away at them. not a single one the night watch slept in rotation. The Small light had gone dark. They looked to east until sunrise, hoping for an answer. Those who witnessed this event had begun to spread their thoughts: Fear, curiosity, and, a renewed faith. The church had to begin a controlled containment of the unfaithful, those who would speak against their gods. Soon even the highest powers began to gather. One the after another. They plotted to gain this boon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEAR YE, HEAR YE; BY THE COMMAND OF THE KINGS AND THE HIGH COUNCIL, THE KING'S BLADES AND CHURCHES HAVE COMMANDED TO SEND OUT THEIR FINEST TO COLLECT THE HEAVEN'S GIFT. THE GODS HAVE GRANTED US A BOON IN THESE DARK TIMES. WORRY NOT CITIZENS!!!!! YOU ARE SAFE!!!! NO FOUL EVIL SHALL TOUCH OUR SACRED CITY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crier had said it all, again and again. The city's people were reassured, after all the kings and high council had made plans to go and retrieve the gift. The nine kings had their champions called to action. The people watched as the Blades paraded through the main streets. Their companies all gathered, armed, and ready. The churches had assembled their devout warriors as well, for if this was what they all had desired, a new power to command. they would betray each other. Easily</span></div></div>",
