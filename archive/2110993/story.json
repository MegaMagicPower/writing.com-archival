The creatures and humans to be found in the north are as hardened as their homelands and are not to be taken lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The East:</b> Lush and overgrown, the eastern region is a land of bounty and abundance. Various forests and meadows cover this area, making it seem like a veritable paradise. Most parts of the east would be paradise if it wasn\u2019t for the protective and sometimes hostile native species who live there. It should be noted that none of them are like the monsters of the north who desire to torment victims; they would just rather be left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The South:</b> With the exception of some swampy jungles in its northernmost area, the south is particularly dry. It is however a hub for major trade routes. Spice trade is the major export of this area, but there are some other goods too. Just like the hot deserts though, beware the hot tempers of its inhabitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The West:</b> The west is fairly isolated from the rest of the realm. The large canyons and caves that surround the area are very good at keeping people from its greatest secret: Dew-Drop Forest, a haven in the wilds. None have yet survived the creatures of the canyons and forests to get close enough to this forest to discover its secrets and who lives there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Central Region:</b> The most urban of all the regions, the central area is home to the kingdom and various noble lords who control the land. The area is a bustling hodge podge of species and cultures, though it is mostly populated by humans. Other creatures are slowly beginning to immigrate here to learn about their ever increasing neighbors.</span></div></div>",

Where to from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Racovania:</b> The only thing close to a city in the north are the villages that make up Racovania. This is the primary location for humans in the region, most of whom are small livestock farmers. These villages are generally poor and rely on the patronage of the local vampires, who serve as really the only political leaders in the area, and negotiate trades with the neighboring regions to secure agricultural goods for the humans. These services do not come free, however. In exchange for these services, the vampires, almost all of whom come from the illustrious Stranken family, can have their pick of the local maidens to keep as \u201ccattle\u201d for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Overvektige Peaks:</b> Home to the highest mountains in all of Yndyre, very little is known about the Overvektige Peaks. They are considered very inhospitable, and the only humans who live around the area are the iron miners. However, it is considered home to a substantial population of harpies at its highest peaks. The locals are wary and do not venture too far up the mountains, but that does not stop some foolish travelers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lava Reaches:</b> Just on the southernmost edge of the Overvektige Peaks lie the Lave Reaches, the barren wastelands at the bottom of a dormant volcano. Some lava wells near the base are mildly active, but it poses no threat to Yndyre. While there are some rich iron mines nearby, many would rather avoid this area as it is the known home to succubi, who enjoy nothing more than torturing and tempting whatever victims they can find.</span></div></div>",

Their skin would burn and even burst into flames if exposed to too much sunshine, so the covered sun was appreciated; even if they did prefer to head out at night anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such denizen of the night was Cameena Stranken. She spent much of her time enjoying the lavishness of her castle (one of many in the region, each populated with many vampires), gazing out of the many tall windows at the bleak landscape or feeding from her cattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVampires kept humans as walking blood-banks, saving them from hunting at night like animals. And in most cases these humans were treated very well; most even grew quite fat on the hedonistic lifestyle the vampires offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now Cameena was lazily settled on her throne, its bone-like design reeked of the macabre nature of her kind\u2019s tastes, she was placing her grey chin on her knuckles as she lazily stared out the window, as hunched-over servants fidgeted in the darkest shadows. As she stared, Cameena\u2019s belly gave a small gurgle, her vampiric hunger needed to be sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising slowly, the rubenesque vampire was now in full sight. She had thick ripe hips that made her blood-red dress billow out quite sharply, her waist thinned to a corset made of many rib-cages (which secretly held her one small shame), her gray-skinned bust appeared swollen as her breasts peeked out through the gap around her cleavage. Her long black hair spilled over her back and rested on her plump rump, perfectly straight and well washed in baths of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sauntered forward towards the massive iron door of her throne room, Cameena\u2019s servants ran to her side, eagerly raising her dress\u2019s train off the stone floor or showering her with praise and compliments, before opening the doors for her with a great creak of the ancient iron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena barely even paid attention to these thralls as she made her way down the familiar trail to the second set of living quarters in the castle, where she kept her \u201ccattle\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to this room were much smaller than that of her throne room, with bat-head doorknobs that the chattering servants quickly opened before Cameena could so much as raise her arm. As the doors gently swung open, the hungry vampire was greeted with her number one live-in resident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara had been a timid girl when she had been offered up by her village to the local vampiress. It was a simple trade really, one youth, ripe with rich blood for the continued safety of the village, its people and its lifestyle. Initially she had shaken like a leaf; she was in abject terror the entire coach-trip to the castle, she shook in fear and the cold in the castle courtyard, and she desperately tried in vain to look for an escape route when she was placed in her lavish room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena had insisted many times that no harm would come to Clara, and even had her servants bring her food and fine clothes. She even offered the servants service to her, they would obey her smallest instruction, apart from grant her freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken many months of learning that Cameena would barely lay a finger on her, and that she was privy to an entire castle\u2019s services for Clara to become used to her new life. Then she became indulgent, then lazy, then gluttonous. Nobody from her village ever ate well, so having enough food for an army offered to her every night was too much for the farmer\u2019s daughter to resist. Now she ate gleefully and in vast quantities, turning her into what Cameena saw before her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire grinned as she stared at what the years of rich decedent food had done to Clara, she was truly enormous. Her stomach was a massive pair of rolls that spilled over onto the sheets and spread to the lip of the bed. Her legs were a pair of fat stumps that jutted out from under her love-handles and partially wrapped around her stomach. Massive arms lay limp to her sides, rendered useless by the cascading layers of lard around them; she had the servants to lift food for her now, no sense wasting energy getting her arms to do it anymore. Humongous breasts rolled over the top of her belly before spread to the sides of the topmost part of the dome. And her face\u2026oh her face; Clara had such a sweet cherubic look to her once despite her years, but now those chubby cheeks were huge sacks of fat, propped up by more chins than her father had goats. She sat on her bed constantly now, her vast weight pinning her down and stripping her of the ability to walk by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concentrated only on eating now, her wardrobe of progressively larger dresses abandoned once she drew more pleasure from stuffing herself than pressing her swelling body into increasingly more uncomfortable clothes, pretty as they were. The thralls still kept her tidy and prim though, despite her nudity; including pulling her hair up into a pair of ponytails, although this served another purpose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you are still enjoying the pleasures of my thrall\u2019s services\u2026\u201d Cameena purred as Clara merely grunted happily in response, she was like a pig in mud. \u201cI might have to ask you to pause for a mere moment Clara dear, I think I would like a bite to eat as well\u201d the vampire added as Clara huffed, nodding her head indicating for the stooped-over creatures to leave them. Bowing many times the misshapen fiends scarpered, shutting the door behind them. Clara then leaned her head a little, revealing a pair of small wound in one of the fat rolls around her neck from where Cameena had dined before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her dark-gray lips, Cameena strode closer and leaned over the immobile cow, opening her mouth to reveal her pair of sharp white canines. Swiftly she plunged the dagger-sharp teeth into Clara\u2019s neck and began to gulp down her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat woman barely felt a thing, she had so much thick skin that a pair of incisions like that was nothing to her, and her body contained oh so very much rich blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena\u2019s eyes rolled back in her head a little, god the flavour, the taste! The other vampires were fools to deny themselves from indulging fully in their carnal pleasures. This blood was so sweet, so rich, and so good! The vampire was drinking so much of it that she could feel her corset begin to pinch a little; perhaps she should have removed it first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Chapter provided by Trampltrum</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cameena could almost feel herself become lost in the feeding, each gulp of blood felt more delicious than the last\u2026but she had to stop. The last thing she wanted was to drain her beloved cattle so much that she grew weak or even perished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back to her full height, Cameena lapped up the blood dripping from her fangs in one last attempt to keep the delicious taste of the calorie-rich blood in the tip of her tongue. This then made her think to herself; the blood of such obese humans was so rich, so delicious, she NEEDED more. But she couldn\u2019t slake her fill from just Clara; she might even <i>lose</i> weight as a result and that would be no good at all; she would lose her scrumptious flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a thought came to Cameena, why not gather up a few more maidens? Most vampires had a whole slew of human women lined up to feed from, but Cameena had only taken one due to thinking someone so large would have more blood. Easier to keep and look after this way. But the gluttonous vampire had not accounted for the cravings Clara\u2019s sweet nectar would create, there was only one answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you like some company my dear?\u201d Cameena purred towards the immense blob that appeared to be growing rather restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould I still have as much food?\u201d Clara grunted. Cameena was not sure Clara was becoming hungry due to Cameena just feeding from her, or if her hunger was just that great these days that a few minutes without something to swallow caused her great discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course my pet.\u201d Cameena purred again, tenderly caressing Clara\u2019s belly with her long-nailed hand. \u201cYou are still my prize cow, you can have anything your greedy little heart desires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026more food then.\u201d Clara huffed. Cameena then snapped her fingers, summoning her little thralls back once more to resume their non-stop service to the heaving mass of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as the sun began to fade behind the mountains and a red tint spread across the lands, Cameena strode out from her castle, claw-like nails holding on to her dress to make sure it did not touch a speck of the gravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of her was her coach, a pitch-black vehicle pulled by four horses whose skin was so dark it made coal shine bright next to them, their eyes blood-red and their mouths fuming. Inside the coach were lavish seats, also red and so soft to the touch that one could easily fall into a sweet slumber on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout as much as a word to the hooded creature sitting on the top of the coach, the driver lashed his whip, setting the horses into a frenzy as they charged towards the open iron-wrought gates and down the long winding path towards the local village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locals knew the sound, and in pavolvian fashion a crowd began to assemble in the village square as the horse-drawn carriage approached, slowing as it reached the huddled masses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hushed breath was caught in the mouths of the peasants as Cameena stepped out of her carriage. Her beauty was incredible, even with her sickly-gray skin, claw-like nails and fangs. Her face permanently looked like she had just returned from the best make-up artists in the land and her clothes were worth more than the entire village. It was no wonder some villagers willingly put up their daughters as offerings to their vampire lord, in hopes their daughter would obtain some of this wealth for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring out your daughters.\u201d Cameena spoke in a tone that while not loud, was instantly heard throughout her audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling around like mad, old men and women began to push forward their offspring, most shaking in terror at the site of the alpha predator standing before them. Eventually they all formed a single line in front of the vampire, and the countess began her inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravelling up and down the line Cameena surveyed her offerings. Some were tall, some were short, some blonde some dark-haired\u2026but unfortunately for the hungry vampire all were rail thin. On one hand this disappointed the fanged monster, she was so looking forward to some instant satisfaction when she returned to her castle. Her years living off Clara\u2019s fatty blood had made ordinary blood so\u2026thin and weak by comparison. But on the other hand there was something exhilarating about the idea of watching her potential meals bloat and fatten up before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that the latter frame of mind was a better state to be in, Cameena began selecting girls, ordering each in turn to board her coach. She tried to choose the ones closest to plump, those with big boobs were a good choice, meant they had a tiny bit of a head start. They were all extremely beautiful women as well; one in particular had a fire in her eyes that told Cameena she could have made a fantastic vampire herself\u2026but her destiny was to become a massive blood-bank for Cameen, oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a terse waft of her hand to dispel the crowds, Cameena returned to her carriage and sat on the seat opposite her latest cows. She had picked five this time rather than one; it would mean her demonic helpers would have their work cut out for them in the kitchens, but Cameena could always summon a few more to help keep all six of her cows satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were all shaking in terror, clearly looking for a moment to escape the vehicle, so Cameena decided to rest their fears\u2026or try to anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to fear me girls, I am not here to harm you. In fact when we reach my castle you will be treated as well as I, so long as you remain within the walls. All my servants will be your servants, my extensive wardrobe will be yours, and any desire of yours will be satisfied.\u201d This did not help, so with a cross of her long legs Cameena tried a more personal touch. \u201cMy name is Cameena Stranken, what are your names?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst to speak was a short red-head with plentiful freckles. \u201cAnna\u2026\u201d she squeaked, prompting the others to follow suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I-I\u2019m Alisha, and this is Mina.\u201d A girl with long black hair (not unlike Cameena\u2019s) introduced, pointing to her twin sat next to her. Twins, Cameena had hit the jackpot. She was already day-dreaming of the two; fattened to blob-like status and sat on identical beds across from each other\u2026delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Claris\u2026\u201d the blonde girl next to them spoke, snapping Cameena out of her little gluttonous fantasy. She was tall and lanky, it would take a LOT of food to make her immense, Cameena thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreta.\u201d The last girl stated firmly. This was the confident and prettiest of the lot, with silky white-blonde hair and extremely beautiful features. Cameena had to stop herself licking her lips, she was going to enjoy making her so fat she couldn\u2019t stand. In Cameena\u2019s eyes, fat was no less beautiful than thin (even moreso in fact), and seeing someone so stunning being made even more beautiful tickled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, such beautiful young ladies such as yourselves should not be walking around in such\u2026filthy rags.\u201d Cameena stated, trying to sound friendly. \u201cThe first thing we are doing when we arrive in my\u2026or rather <i>our</i> castle is I shall show you the castles wardrobe, to make sure you are dressed as daintily as you look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn\u2019t change their expressions at all, earning their trust was going to take a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month, perhaps two or three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna started to explain the first steps of her scape plan, which according to herself should be able to execute within the timeframe of a month, from there they would have an easy ride towards freedom, well as long as every single one of them played their roles to perfection<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor which during the execution of the plan they should keep a low profile, play along Carmeenas sick game and hopefully they would gather enough information in a couple days to make a great scape, all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls were not that convinced about Ana\u2019s optimism for the situation. They had just witnessed the fate of the girls taken by the vampires, and if their bulging aching bellies weren\u2019t enough proof, no one has ever heard of any woman escaping from a vampire\u2019s grasp.  For all they knew they would be fed to oblivion every single day until they became bigger than even Clara, that without counting the fact that being stuffed like a duck every single day would severely difficult any plan they would come with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut truth be told, no other girl in the group a better idea, they were busier about easing the pain on their bloated bellies, so they let Ana ramble about her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst hour in the morning the twins will start searching for information around the castle, maybe a library or anything that may help us get a layout of this place\u201d Said Ana as the young girls nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ana pointed towards Greta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreta, you are extremely charismatic, so I need you also help to gather information, from the other people in the castle, specially from Clara\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026blob?!, what will she be useful for?\u201d Grata argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has obviously been living here longer than us, maybe she knows things that may help us, she may be a useless ball of fat now, but at some point she was just like us\u201d Ana answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna continued her description of the plan until Claris interrupted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all sounds nice and dandy Ana\u201d Claris commented, \u201cBut how are we going to do any of those things if Cameena keeps fattening us like pigs every single day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna, hadn\u2019t thought about that, but in a swift moment of brilliance she got the answer, although this may require some sacrifice from Claris and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t like to do this but we are going to need to take one, or three for the team Claris\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris was a bit confused but she understood what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna explained what would the dynamic be during breakfast, lunch and dinner; Greta and the twins would just eat enough to survive, and Claris and herself would have to eat the rest; this in turn would mean they would start to pile up on weight faster than the others, but as they were both the skinniest, it would take more to start affecting their mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris accepted this plan, although she was not happy about it. She had worked hard for her slim physique, well if the plan worked she would be free to regain her shape again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end all the girls walked, or better said slugged to the center and the room and joined their hands together as a symbol of their compromise to the scape plan. After it all of them went straight to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was the last one to fall asleep, and as she did she whispered to herself that her plan was going to work, that she would get them out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in other part of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmeena was enjoying herself a small midnight snack, courtesy of Clara, who was dresses with a pink dress, which looked more like a giant courting with flower decorations and several grease stains; As the vampire was sucking her blood, the gigantic woman was devouring several drumsticks being fed directly into her mouth by an imp servant, who dashed back and forth bringing her more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire woman finished drinking the blood that she needed, giving the obese woman a mild case of dizziness, strong enough to make her stop eating for a couple seconds, after which she resumed eating like a wild boar; Such situation surely meant that Carmeena felt excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire woman had drink from Clara for several years now and would swear that each time it became thicker and richer every passing day in relation to every pound added to the body of her favorite pig, not a single one of her siblings or Eviana, lady of all vampires, herself had such delicious stock in their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that soon she would have five more on her hand filled her with enough happiness that her heart almost started to beat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmeena swaged her way towards her chambers, sporting a bloated belly filled with the blood she had just drunk, forcing its way out of an extremely tight corset, which creaked with every step the vampire gave, slowing down her pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at her throne and bathed on the dim moonlight which entered through a colorful stained glass window. Almost on instinct the vampire woman started to rub her belly, she hadn\u2019t had such a feast in several months, and soon she would be able to have one every night if so she desired. Ideas started to flow inside her head. What would the new girls taste like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould the twins be one sweet and the other sour? The thin one would have softer blood? How would their taste as they grew as big as Clara?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so a spark created a chain reaction inside her brain, and culminated in an idea, small but brilliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment\u2019s notice Carmeena ordered her imps to bring to the room her personal \u201cChef\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew moments passed and inside Carmeenas throne room appeared a chunky woman, wearing a white apron which contrasted with her black hair arranged in a braid, who upon entering the room made a reverence for her lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiovanna, darling! I have to congratulate you, whatever you been feeding Clara with the last weeks have given her blood such a decadent and tasty flavor!\u201d Carmeena said with unusual happiness to the chubby woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, I used a recipe I got from my trips to the elven lands my lady\u201d Answered the woman. \u201cBut I doubt that you, lady of the moonlight, would have called me with such urgency only to praise my cooking skills\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO ho ho, you are very keen darling. It is true, I called you to discuss a small plan I have for the new girls\u201d Explained Carmeena as she descended from her throne, belly bouncing on every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmeena and Giovanna sat at the sides of a table, and the vampire started to explain her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026So basically you want to make every girl have their own distinct flavor my lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, I\u2019ve never had these much cattle at a time, but it would be boring if all of them ended up tasting like Clara, don\u2019t misinterpret me, she is gorgeous and delicious, but I want some variety in my life. Do you get my drill?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course my lady, and I have just the means to do it\u201d Answered the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! in that case, after the first tithing ill choose the most delicious, and then change the flavor for the next one, and so on. Therefore, from tomorrow I want you to nurture the girls into...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were all groggy from staying up all last night planning the grand escape. When they tried putting on their clothes from the night before they found that they were already a little snug. Greta cried about her figure for a little bit \u201cWill Mike even take me back like this a fat cow!\u201d Claris went over to comfort them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  After Greta calmed down, Anna reminded every one of their roles to play. \u201cSo Claris and I are the buffer while you guys get info we will regroup tonight and update our plan of escape.\u201d Just as Anna finished Carmeena knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLadies I\u2019m coming in,\u201d Carmeena\u2019s voice was a little sing song-ish. The door swag open colliding with the Wall, \u201cOh, sorry sometimes these doors are a little to ready to open you know. Now who\u2019s ready for breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Carmeena lead the five down stairs toward the dining hall. As they went down Anna noticed that all the window\u2019s doors were locked shut and that it must be for Carmeena\u2019s safety. Speaking of Carmeena she wasn\u2019t looking so thin herself was that a food belly. The spiral stair case was long and tire some for them especially since their bodies were so tired from eating all that food last night. Finally Mina grunted after three minutes of climbing down the stairs \u201cHow -huff- many -huff- steps are there -huff-?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry my pretty this was the long way I just thought that you might want to see it.\u201d Before you you can anymore Carmeena thought. \u201cBut worry not we are almost there.\u201d As she said so they where in site of the base of the stair case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once on the main floor they walked down a hall and into a kitchen. The kitchen was filled with load clangs and bangs, delicious smells wafted from everywhere, but the oddest part were the cooks. The cooks were ape like creatures with red fur and short horns on their heads. \u201cCarmeena I wasn\u2019t expecting you!\u201d A Voice broke out over all the noise. The hole group turned their heads to see the main chef. She was stout women with pointed ears and braided black hair that went to her back. For her size she was a little bit on the plump side. \u201cAnd I see that you\u2019ve brought me our new roomies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cAh yes I wanted to show them where they could get food if they ever needed it, Giovanna,\u201d Carmeena smile at her chef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOf course any time.\u201d Said Giovanna. She hooped at her masters smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry to ask but are you an Elf?\u201d Alisha then slouched a bit when the two looked back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood question!\u201d Giovanna quickly answered realizing that the girl had gotten frightened by her. \u201cNo I\u2019m not an elf but I am an underling. You see Carmeena turned me into a vampire, but I won\u2019t be a full vampire for another sixty years until then I work for Carmeena.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cSorry to cut our visit short but we must eat breakfast,\u201d Carmeena intervened before Giovanna started telling them her whole life story as she tended to do. Carmeena lead the party finally to the dinning hall. The table was once again filled to the brim with foods but this time there were also large caskets of what they guessed was mead on the table. At the head was Clara already feasting. \u201cAh, Clara you were supposed to wait for me and your new sisters. You are such a naughty girl. Carmeena said in mock anger as she walked to her seat right beside her prized cow. \u201cPlease sit all of you. Now unlike last night I want all of you to finish your glasses before you leave last night some of the cooks were upset you didn\u2019t finish off you cups and we don\u2019t want to be rude now do we.\u201d Carmeena mocked lectured like a mother. Then the feast began they all were taking big swigs of their mugs in between bites but every they look at it, it still looked all most full. As this went on the girls got more and more tipsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSo what will you guys miss most about home?\u201d Carmeena asked after they were all throughly drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u201cMy Mikey oooooh, My -hic- sweet sweet Mike he was so -hic- good to me\u201d Grita sobbed and to a huge bite out of a chicken lag. The girls had forgotten the plan after the sixth drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry to hear that my darling, maybe if you are a good girl I can bring Mike to you.\u201d This was just what Carmeena wanted, to hook them on to staying here she was no dummy she knew they were planning to escape they always did even her precious Clara. She just didn\u2019t know their plan yet. \u201cWell I\u2019m off when you finish you can explore the inner castle just ask the imps at the door to lead you there ok. See you in a couple of hours for brunch!\u201d Carmeena walked back into the the kitchen. There she met the chief again. \u201cYou truly are a genius, the refilling mugs did just what they were supposed to.\u201d Carmeena high fived her servant in appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m glad every thing is going right to plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in the dinning hall...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Racovania was a sleepy little village nestled in the mountains. Its people were simple farmers, with few exceptions, and the quality of life was questionable at best. Townsfolk were nurtured by hard work, tilling the soil and wrangling the livestock, and those that weren't were similarly forged by equally unpleasant lifestyles. Miners, who worked further up the mountain closer towards the Peaks, couriers who made the treacherous path up and down the mountain and across the country to deliver parcels and letters. Even those who performed service duties in town, like smithees and traders, were not granted easy lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for this reason, because of their tedium, that the barkeep of the Bleakfrost Tavern put such a great emphasis on keeping her customers bellies filled with good food and mead. After a hard day at work, around dusk, almost everyone who didn't return to their homes could be found at the Tavern\u2014of age or not. The fire was warm and the company was good. Somaria, \"the best chef in all of Racovia\", kept herself busy trying new recipes and inventing new specials to appease the watering mouths and rumbling gullets of her faithful patrons. It could have been well into the night, eeking into the morning, and the Tavern would still be alive with music of the bard and the drunken laughs of her patrons. Bleakfrost Tavern was very important to Racovania and it's people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was precisely why Olga had found herself so eagerly wanted there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the house, blue-eyes.\" came the sultry voice of the barkeep, Helga, \"Courtesy of the gentlemen who've been eyeballin' you all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga Forgedotter shrunk slightly, her face flushed and her smile crooked. She waved sheepishly to the burly men tucked away in the corner, their bellies brushing against the table as their rosy cheeks burned with beer and lust. They waved back, rather loudly, and one men put his fingers in his mouth to blow a piercing whistle her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't been at this job very long, and she wasn't very good at it. Every day Olga tripped and fell, spilled pints and dropped food on the floor. But the customers kept coming, even more eagerly than ever in fact! Helga mostly had her work mornings, when the traffic was easy and the workload was light. However, Olga was placed very strategically so that she would get off at six in the afternoon, when most of the lusty-eyed men started pouring in at five. Helga got to lure all the lecherous customers she wanted inside for their business, and let Olga go early once they were good, drunk and hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it so personally\u2014it's all in good fun.\" Helga reassured her barmaid with a pat on the back and a hearty laugh, \"Or at least it better be. It'd be a shame if all the tips they gave you had to go to hirin' that Orc to walk you home every night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga was an older woman. Not close to graying just yet, but she was old enough to have flirted with her Father when they were young. She was strong and sturdy, a farmer's daughter, with long brown hair and deep green eyes. Her skin was ruddy and her figure was plump\u2014she was a head shorter than most men in Racovania, but had a set of hips wider than some men's shoulders were wide. When she pat you on the back, you felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can take care of myself.\" Olga said with a smile as she reached behind the bar and grabbed her basket, \"Do you think I could get a steak and stew to go? It's Tora's turn to cook dinner and... I don't actually think she remembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more.\" Helga said with a smile, and then a hearty laugh, \"Hey, maybe I'll throw in an extra roll for the two of you, huh? Eat them both on the way home, Olga. You're far too skinny to be working in <i>my</i> Tavern!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNestled against the dull gray slab of the mountain, lit by the fire of the forge as the life slowly flickered from it, Olga's homestead was of a generous size. Her father's father had built it with the money he had bought from selling <i>his</i> father's farm, and it had been designed with a legacy in mind. Not only did it function as a forge for smithing, its two stories were both a business and a home for his family. A store room and a floor downstairs housed and displayed armors and weapons for the hunters, mercenaries, adventurers and enthusiasts that had been forged outside, while the second floor had all the furnishings a family might need. There was a kitchen, two bedrooms (one that Tora and Olga had shared as children), and a modest living space with a roaring fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their father gone, it seemed almost too big for Olga and her older sister. While Tora had done her best in replacing her father at the forge, no one could replace his rolling laughter or the presence that his boisterous personality claimed all to itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tora!\" Olga cried out, the wooden door slamming behind her, \"Oh sister, I've brought home dinner~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful\u2014I'm <i>starving!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora was Olga's older sister by three years. They had been very much the same growing up, both frail and waifish girls with blue eyes and blonde hair like their father. But since she had become the smithee of the house, lifting the hammer and forging all day, Tora had since grown hearty. Where Olga was waifish, Tora was toned and strong. Though she still had the same sweet face of her mother, her long blonde hair had been cut short so as not to be struck at the anvil, or caught ablaze by the coals. Despite her newfound burliness, Tora was not without her suitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's funny, because it was <i>your</i> turn to cook dinner tonight.\" Olga chided her older sister as she sat at the table, \"And your loving, caring, oh-so-<i>responsible</i> sister just so happened to remember that <i>you</i> always forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet your tongue. You're hanging around Helga too much\u2014you're becoming an old nag.\" Tora rolled her eyes and wiped the water from her brow, \"I'm just now washing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The biggest.\" Tora grumbled as Olga set her plate and bowl down in front of her, \"I'm happy that word has spread all the way to Adinah, but this is the last time I let them order in bulk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga didn't believe that for a moment, but she bit her tongue. Tora worked hard to keep their family (what was left of it) afloat. She had to pay for steel, for materials, and occasionally protection. On top of keeping them both fed. It was a wonder they weren't bare bones by now\u2014though admittedly, what Olga earned from working at the Tavern helped a lot more than Tora was keen to admit. Times were hard for the Forgedotters, but like her father had always told them, \"tempered steel is strong steel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they ate. Olga regaled her sister with stories from the tavern, Tora responded in kind with gossip from her merchants. They went to bed early and departed to their separate bedrooms. They both had busy days ahead of them, Olga knew. Tora had her order to fill, and Helga had her and the other barmaids preparing for the Racovanian festival already. It was just... there had to be more to live than this? Even in Racovania, surely this wasn't <i>all</i> right? As much as she tried to be optimistic, things could get so dreary sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga sighed heavily as she went to bed early, was it so much to ask for something <i>different</i> to happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Olga know, as the turned and tossed beneath her covers, that her challenge had been accepted. Her prayers heard by the Gods (though which God, no one could be sure), that which was once certain began to become decidedly less so. What may have or perhaps should have been a humdrum life with her sister, one day after the other with only slight variation, grew uneasy as the winds of fate began to change...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In perhaps a sick twisted sort of way, Olga did get her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had offered to stay late that evening  at the Tavern. Preparing for the Racovanian Festival was a tall order, and Helga could use (and handsomely paid for) all the help she could get. A little toiling in the kitchen with Somaria was well worth the extra gold that she would earn for what little she managed to help the seasoned chef in the kitchen. The bar was alive with mirth and pleasure. The bard was singing, the other barmaids were tapping drinks and serving plates. Helga was roaring with laughter, not-so-subtly flirting with Thorne the Elder as he made his own clumsy advances. Olga could have almost sworn that this was the slight, subtle difference that she had been looking for in life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then everything just stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in Racovania knew the tell-tale sound of the carraige's black wheels as they clamored down the road that lead further north. Up there was Vampire Country, owned almost exclusively by the Stranken Clan. Those blood-suckers offered protection and supplies for the townsfolk... but at a terrible price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that no one in the town had gone untouched by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a whole lot of them. The Stranken family was represented by several castles dotting the landscape of Racovania, up into the Peaks even. Every so often, at least once a year, one of them would descend upon the town looking for payment for their services. They were a necessary evil, tolerated by the town. But if any one family could kill such a warm, pleasant night, it was the Stranken Clan of Vampires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the dull gray of the twilight had grown to an unhealthy sort of reddish glow. The soot and clouds above may as well have been made of lead, blocking any and all sunlight that dared to peek beyond the smoky veil into the town. A black carriage, manned by a foursome of fearsome black steeds (each one as dark as coal) and no driver rolled down the mountainside and into the main road that ran through the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, not just the patrons of the bar, shuffled outside. It was a fate far worse than death for those who dared ignore the call of the Strankens. No one had dared try it since Olga had been alive. Her father had always told her to report dutifuly, keep her head down, and try to look as unappetizing as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the carriage stopped, a small crowd of begrudgingly diligent townsfolk crowded around it. Before long, literally everyone was circled around it. The entire town's population was at the beck and call for these Vampires whenever they rolled through. Sometimes, though not often, they were simply passing through. Olga could only hope that now was one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olga\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nilheia's mane!\" the busty barmaid jumped, covering her mouth, for fear of upsetting the ominous carriage's occupant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only Tora, thankfully. Her older sister had managed to find her in the crowd and had made her way over to the congregation of taverners who had gathered in a particular area. With her strong arms, Tora pulled her sister in close for a warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody knew what those fanged freaks did with the women that they abducted. No one (literally, no one) had ever seen nor heard from the abductees once they had been spirited away in one of those black carriages. Rumors had emerged of course, albeit in hushed whispers, that they were eaten whole. Or sacrificed to Damus in unholy rituals. Olga shuddered at the thought of what those awful creatures must do to their victims\u2014wasn't it enough that they sucked blood? How much worse could vampires get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet girl, quiet.\" Tora said, breaking away, \"They'lll... they might hear you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the carriage door opened with a sharp whine. The black hinges creaked as the wooden door opened to reveal one of the more \"well-known\" Stranken Vampires. Lady Cameena was the one located most closely to Racovania, and the one with which most of the public dealings with the town were done. She was feared none-the-less, but she was easily the most well-known among the common folk. Olga had heard stories of an even more terribly beautiful creature named Eviana, but had not seen such a woman for herself. Legend had it she was the Mother of all vampires\u2014all of them, even Cameena, were descended from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne long gray leg extended from inside the coach and planted itself firmly in the dirt. Thick, ripe hips emerged as the rubenesque Lady of the Night descended fully into the town, her long black hair flowing in the soft breeze that carried throughout the silent town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora squeezed Olga's hand, like when they were children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening to you all.\" Cameena said, her voice hauntingly low and beautiful, \"I hope you are all having a pleasant evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one dared answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come to the decision that I require another tribute. As my clan has already collected, I understand that this may come as... a sort of shock.\" The woman bit her ebony-black bottom lip, \"But whomsoever's family I rob of one of their <i>delicious</i> daughters will be handsomely rewarded. I am not a cruel mistress, nor is my lady Eviana, but our needs are... <i>growing</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGentle sobbing filled the town from one corner, lower lips quivered everywhere as the earlier mirth was hollowed and filled with a sense of great loss. The poor girl hadn't even been chosen, and the town was mourning her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order to provide for you so that you may live out your pitiful...\" Cameena looked around distastefully, \"Existence. My clan must be well nourished and paid for our services\u2014those who would replace us would do much more than take one of your daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now girls...\" she said, checking her nails, \"Step forward then, would you? So that I might pick the prettiest among you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, as commanded, each of the eligible daughters of the village stepped forward. There was Anna, the neighbor girl. She was a bit younger than Olga. The merchants' daughters, Alisha and Mina. Claris, and Greta. And finally, Olga and Tora stepped forward with heavy hearts. While their father was no longer alive, they would forever remain \"eligible\" in the eyes of the Stranken Clan\u2014'til they bore children themselves, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well...\" Cameena lined them all up, looking each girl up and down, \"Such a small selection... what happened to the redheaded girl from a few years back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...She married.\" the girl's father answered quietly, \"I-Into a nice family in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pooh.\" Cameena curled her nose, \"Wasn't there a, uh... oh... the <i>Priest's</i> Daughter, what happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Elvira claimed her last year.\" someone else said, \"The father... he took his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's depressing.\" Cameena rolled her eyes, \"There was a whole <i>slew</i> of girls from that round-faced family with the pig farm. What happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Pox.\" coughed yet another villager, \"That was quite a few years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ugh</i>.\" Cameena put her hands on her hips, \"So you're all that's left then? This village is turning into a real sausage fest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, children were off limits. Once a girl had her first blood, she had from then until her first birth to be claimed by their winged sentinels. Suffice it to say, marriages were a frequency in Racovania. Baby showers too. Children were something celebrated and cherished, as they represented freedom from the agreement that the Stranken Clan held them all to, in one way or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Olga gulped as Cameena walked the line of eligible girls, she was far from ineligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crop of seven\u2014all sisters in a strange sort of way, bound together by this horrible agreement\u2014were examined. Up and down, from their heads to their toes. Cameena even extended a greying arm, gave a couple of girls a good squeeze. Tilting their heads, examining their necks. She made a poigniant stop, her breasts bouncing ever so slightly, and made her announcement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\" Cameena extended one taloned finger, pointing squarely at...</span></div></div>",

Everything went cold and dim, the blood red moon may as well have been gray and the fog that had encroached clear. She felt and saw nothing. Not the embrace of her sister as she sobbed into her shoulder, not the pained expressions of the townsfolk as they said goodbye to yet another Racovanian youth. She didn't register the relieved, though saddened, exhales of Greta or the twins. She didn't even really seem to register Cameena Stranken herself, looming venomously over there as her arm bent at her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was just cold\u2014there was only the chill of the mountain air, and the sound of her heart as it drummed behind her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do quite nicely.\" Cameena said with a smile, \"Come now. Into my carraige.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, one of the riderless horses sputtered, calling Olga into her seat beside the blood-sucker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Y-You can't!\" Tora pushed off of Olga, facing the Vampire Elite with a familiar fire in her eyes, \"She's my sister you heartless, uncaring... <i>thing!</i> She's but a girl\u2014take me instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tora...?\" Olga managed behind watering eyes, \"I... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When our father died, he left Olga in my stead\u2014I'm in charge of her!\" Tora shouted at the ashen ambassador, \"So I volunteer. Take me instead, a-and let my little sister live. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA proud woman, Tora had never so much as begged for an extra dessert at suppertime. Which was why it was so strange to see her fall to the ground, on her knees, with her hands clasped out in front of her. Hot tears streamed down her cheeks as she was overcome by all manner of sisterly emotions\u2014perhaps even motherly, given their lack of parentage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Cameena said with a smile, one that showed the presence of her fangs, \"But no. You're far to... hrm... <i>stringy</i> looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made my choice. I demand that barmaid for myself, and if I am denied again, I will raze this entire town with but a flick of my wrist!\" Cameena puffed her grey bosom and arched her shoulders. Indeed, the night seemed to come sooner and grow colder as she presented herself in such a way. Tora simply shrunk into herself, rescinding the offer quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tora?\" Olga repeated again, tears running down her cheeks, \"I... I don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...\" Tora embraced her younger sister tightly, \"I-It's... it's okay. Just... be brave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the touch of a gray hand on her shoulder, Olga's eyes widened in fear. It pulled at her gently, and then decidedly less so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tora?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be brave, Olga!\" the older Forgedotter shouted as Olga was ushered to her coach, \"...Be brave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride up to Cameena's palace was a rocky one, and unbearably slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had never been on many carriage rides. Everything (well, most everything) she had ever needed was in town. The market for food, the Tavern for entertainment, her family for warmth and comfort...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, she'd been somewhat spared from having to do too many of them. She didn't much care for them. She got motion sickness sometimes, and rockier roads gave her headaches. What made this one especially bad was that she was sitting uncomfortably close to a blood-sucking mistress of the night. Cameena Stranken's broad hips brushed against hers every so often. It made her flinch and recoil noticeably, which made her \"hostess\" incredibly displeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, you humans are so skittish.\" Cameena said in a friendly sort of tone, as if she hadn't just kidnapped Olga but rather had been giving her a ride into town, \"We're both women here. It's perfectly natural for our bodies to touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">There's nothing natural about you</font>...\" Olga whispered underneath her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Cameena asked in that same sort of tone, cupping a hand to her ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I said I'm hungry...\" Olga corrected herself, \"I hadn't had a chance to eat my supper before... <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">before</font>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well then there's no worries there, darling!\" Cameena said with a dismissive wave of her hand, \"I'll make sure you're treated to a <i>wonderful</i> meal\u2014surely one <i>much</i> better than whatever paltry porridge you were going to slurp down from that <i>disgusting</i> inn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga hunkered into her seat, drowning out Cameena's prattling with the sound of the carriage. The horses neighing. The wheels turning. Everything just sort've melted away. This was it, Olga thought, she was going to die. She'd always known that this was a possibility\u2014being picked by one of these awful creatures as their feast\u2014but there was no real way to prepare for it. How could she have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"At least you'll feed me before you suck me dry...\"</font> Olga muttered again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... <i>something</i> like that.\" Cameena licked her lips, \"Now chin up dear... we've almost arrived at your new home.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once they finally arrived, Olga thought, for one very brief moment, that maybe things wouldn't be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle looked rather impressive up close. It inspired feelings of foreboding from a far distance, given its gothic design and the perpetual rain that seemingly enveloped the entire mountainside. And yet, Olga couldn't help but marvel at how well-put together the design was. Every block, every tile, every single piece of the infrastructure was positioned perfectly; not a detail imperfect, everything where it needed to be. Add in the complimentary dark paintwork, the gothic statues and spires, and the castle certainly had an artistic aesthetic to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepressing and dark. As expected from one of the merciless bloodsuckers who plagued the North.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home,\" Cameena said in that same tone she'd used the whole ride over. That tone of casual friendliness, coming form her kidnapper. It was so wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt an arm gesture from the vampire, the massive gate doors slowly creaked open. And once again, Olga found herself spellbound, this time by the interior of the castle. Or rather the main entry hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been expecting a dreary atmosphere; no lights, torn tapestries, a shattered window here and there, and maybe some of those creepy shadow creatures crawling about. Instead, Olga was greeted by an illuminated hallway, a clean-tiled floor with a fancy dark red carpet, beautiful tapestries, and mystical-looking decorations. The former barmaid found herself blinking in awe and confusion. This was not what she had been expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come this way, come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga froze, her heart hammering as she suddenly felt Cameena lean uncomfortably close into her personal bubble. The vampire wrapped a gray-skinned arm around the blonde's shoulders, who responded by trembling horribly and whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop with that,\" Cameena frowned, tightening her hold on the sniffling human before moving her fingers to grasp at her cheek. She forced the girl to look at her, Olga shrinking before the cold gaze of the vampire's crimson eyes. \"Like it or not, this is your life now. <i>You </i>are <b>mine</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's blue eyes brimmed with tears, a hiccup escaping her as her new master continued to glare into her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you can make the best of it,\" Cameena continued, coldly. \"Learn to adapt, you'll be all the better for it. Keep sobbing, and you'll only annoy me. And believe me, you do not want that. No matter how you look at it, <i>this </i>is your reality now. Am I understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's tears fell, but she silenced the sob that wanted to be let out. Instead, she used what willpower she could muster to steel her shaky self, look the monster in the eye, and nod. \"Yes, my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" Cameena smiled in satisfaction, loosening her arm's grip but still keeping it wrapped around the blonde's shoulders. \"Now, come. Into your new home. And...\" to Olga's numbing shock, Cameena moved a long, talon-like finger to wipe away the tears from her cheeks. \"No more of that. No <i>guest </i>of mine will exhibit such unsightly behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga stared for a moment, before averting her gaze to distract herself with the tapestries they passed by. She wondered if Cameena was playing some sort of sadistic game with her, lulling her into a false sense of security before sinking her fangs into her neck. Yes, that had to be it. And that only served to increase her anxiety for her impending doom. Why did she have to play such a game? If she was going to die, could she just not get it over with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low, rumbling sound cut off her inner ramblings. And the overall silence of their walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena grinned disturbingly, her eyes looking upon Olga's thin middle approvingly. \"Yes, oh yes. I knew you had promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga, for her part, simply blushed in self-mortification. So much for dying with a shred of dignity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, come!\" Cameena said giddily, increasing the pace of their walk, much to Olga's shock and horror. \"My servants have worked to prepare a feast for your welcome. We must hurry before it gets cold, and your belly cries for more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was now very much certain that she was going to die, one way or another, by tonight. If not from her vampire mistress draining her of every drop of blood in her, then definitely from the humiliation she was currently suffering through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly hoped she could. Whatever Cameena had in store for her would be horrible, that much she knew. But for it to involve food? Olga hoped she could be miraculously struck down before the lady of the night could carry out whatever ghastly torture she had in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga blinked. Had she been thinking so deeply, her mind had wandered off? One minute they were in the enormous grand hallway, and now they were suddenly before another set of double doors? Or maybe...had Cameena moved them <i>that </i>quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could so much as ask, the doors were pulled open. Olga caught a quick glimpse of the creatures, expecting them to be some more of those shadowy beings that seemed to hover near Cameena when she needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw instead made her yelp. Two beings, completely chalk white, humanoid in appearance, were what had pulled the double doors open. They may have looked human in shape, but they lacked distinguishing features. Nothing to indicate if they were male or female. Hollow, naked bodies that were devoid of any characteristics or physical traits. And yet, what Olga found truly disturbing about these creatures was their faces. No facial features at all. Just this...blocky shape that seemed reminiscent of a mask. Black, empty eye-holes were eyes ought to have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Olga could not ponder on the bizarre creatures for long. Cameena was already leading her inside, and at once her nose was assaulted by a most delectable aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the middle of the enormous dining room was a great long table. And upon it, more food than Olga had ever seen on a table before. A succulent turkey in the middle, a big leg of lamb smeared in sauce and butter, three pies that smelled of beef, heathen cakes, roast pork, and so on. It was too much for Olga to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly growled urgently, even louder than last time. Her mouth watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come this way, darling,\" Cameena purred, guiding Olga to the table, to the seat closest to the feast. \"Eat. Eat to your heart's content. All this is yours to gorge on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was having difficulty listening, her gaze focused entirely on the spread before her. \"All this...for me?\" she smacked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course!\" Cameena said joyously, sitting at the head of the table, next to Olga. \"Nothing but the best for my...guest. Now please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena's red eyes seemed to shine as she observed the blonde human's focus on the food, her grin stretching from ear to ear, her tongue lolling out to lick her lips as Olga picked her first helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Enjoy yourself</i>...\"</span></div></div>",

Yes, that's a good girl. Eat up.\"</i> Cameena gleefully thought, rubbing her pale hands together with an almost sadistic chortle, eagerly awaiting how substantial her newly acquired bloodbag will become in the near future. And yet, as if like a crackle of thunder, the seemingly svelte vampire countess was soon interrupted by the chiming of Olga's voice, still bearing a mouthful of chewed-up cuisines as she muffled, \"*munch* Am I rweally *munch* *munch*...Your guesht?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it certainly knocked the dark-haired countess out of her lucrative daydream, unintentionally staring back at the still chewing Olga, which seemed rather...<i>odd</i> to the vampire. After all, out of the many <i>\"piggies\"</i> she's acquired and developed over the decades, most of them didn't outright withhold a small yet normal conversation with her out sheer fear of the gluttonous bloodsucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...Here was Olga, attempting to make small talk with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis alone surprised even Cameena, as she now had to stoop herself to just conversing with her newest pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to her begrudging outlook of the situation, Cameena couldn't help but feel like there was...<i>something</i> underlying all of this idle chitchat, as she reluctantly took a seat beside Olga, doing her best to put on a friendly reassuring face towards the chubby Northerner, placing a pale long-nailed hand upon Olga's shoulder and feintly said, \"...Absoultely, my dear! After all, we of the illustrious Stranken Family pride ourselves on...<i>luxury</i>,  you would say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her current situation, Olga felt like believing in Cameena's words, as she continued munching down on the delicacies, all whilst making some small talk with the vampire countess, obviously out of a need for company. However, much to her chagrin, Cameena pretended to keenly listen to Olga's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 2 Hours Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! I'd thought she would NEVER stop talking!\" Cameena raved, now currently inside her illustrious yet lavish personal quarters, her servants undoing her corset, which let her budding belly fully expand from the strict confines, still a little frustrated as to how long it took for her newest livestock to have a full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh*...Well, at least she has some potential for rich potent blood. Though, I won't admit this outright to the other Nobles and that damnable Eviana, but...that human, Olga. The little chat with her felt quite...<i>stimulating</i>, if I do say so myself.\" Cameena thought aloud, her mind contemplating uncharacteristically about her newest <i>\"pet\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, little did the vampire countess realize under her own intuition, that there was something...<i>affectionate</i> between the two completely different individuals.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Have I been taken to die, or warped into a dark fairy tale book?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga uttered not a sound as she was quietly ushered into her room by one of the castle's many stone-faced maids. Once more she had been expecting something dreary and dark to remind her of her grim predicament. She expected to be sent to the top of one of the castle's spires, where there would no doubt be a room so small and unkempt that there would be no illusion it was a prison cell. A room so dirty the cobblestone tiles looked severely outdated and covered in moss. Dust everywhere, a mangy old desk next to an unclean bed with torn sheets. Something to display Cameena's complete disregard for those beneath her, and her sadistic joy in torturing her captured souls by making them as miserable as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the young blue-eyed blonde had been presented with a room that was the exact opposite. If it could even be defined as a \"room\" to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Olga took note of was that her new room was big. <i>Very </i>big. Comparison-wise, it was equivalent to the main floor of the Bleakfrost Tavern, except no tables, no stairs, no counter, and in place of all that was a single bedroom with an absurd amount of space. A queen-sized bed, far more space to spare on the mattress than Olga was accustomed to, was set in the middle, against a wall with two giant glass windows to the side, each leading to a grand balcony. The bed had a canopy, lustrous carpets dripping down to the floor and, in Olga's opinion, giving an almost tent-like appearance. The windows had these fancy curtains draping from them, barely touching down the carpeted floor of the room gracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far left side about ten feet from the bed was a desk with a grand mirror, accompanied by several assortments ranging from make-up kits to writing utensils, complete with blank pages laid on the surface of the desk. On the right, equally ten feet or so from the bed were two things; a big wardrobe and next to it a single wide door. A door so wide and high that Olga figured maybe three of her could fit through it no problem. She ventured over to it, cradling her stuffed tummy from the dinner just a while back, and opened it to another jaw-dropping surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bathroom unlike any Olga had seen. Instead of the typical white tub or single bucket, there instead was a square construct protruding from the middle of the room, filled to the brim with hot steaming water. Squared tiles on the floor, with a small carpet at the entrance for wiping bare feet of water purposes, along with an assortment of towels in a transparent cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is a bathroom? It's bigger than mine and Tora's house!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, the Forgedotter sisters lived in a blacksmith's house, but the point still stood. Olga was presented an entire set of living arrangements that not only contradicted every one of her expectations, but everything she was used to. Was this what vampires did with their reaped victims? Were all vampires so accommodating? Olga had a hard time reconciling the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her inspection of the bathroom, Olga came back into the bedroom to notice a sizable red nightgown laid out on the bed for her that hadn't been there before. She looked towards the entrance to find the maid standing there, still in perfect pose and expressionless. Had she picked out the nightgown while she was inspecting the bathroom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lady encourages you to get comfortable,\" the pale, raven-haired woman said in a blank tone. \"You are free to move about the castle as you see fit. This is your home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...whole castle?\" the disbelief in Olga's voice was palpable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid merely nodded. \"This is your home now. Lady Cameena has nothing to hide from her guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga absorbed that sentence and all its implications. Steeling herself, she dared to ask the question that had been plaguing her since arriving. \"Are there...others here? Others she has...\" she gulped, her resolve failing. \"...taken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her great discomfort, the maid's wooden expression did not change one bit. \"That is something you will have to take up with Lady Cameena on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid had said it with no change in her countenance, yet her tone had taken a noticeably more icy tone to it, enough to make Olga flinch. Even so, she managed to press on, meeting the maid's cool gaze. \"I-I thought she had nothing to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not a servant's place to gossip,\" the maid coolly retorted, before giving a quick cordial bow. \"Now please excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was gone, closing the door quietly behind her. As if to reinforce that the entire castle was Olga's home now, there was no sound of the door being locked. She really was being granted the freedom to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now Olga didn't want to explore. Now she felt the full exhaustion after a day as draining as this one, and the epic meal she had consumed not five minutes ago. Her hands fell to her inflated middle, not yet meaningfully big, but now a budding pot. She turned to the bed, which looked very inviting right now. And the square bathtub full of hot water was certainly calling out to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot bath helped in soothing her body, but not her heart. As she washed herself, she thought back to her home. She thought of the Bleakfrost Tavern and all her fellow barmaids. She thought of Helga and all her matronly wit and love. She thought of Somaria and all her wisdom both in the kitchen and the world around them, being an older sister at work. She thought of Tora, her beloved older sister whom she would most likely never see again. All of them, whom she had been snatched away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wept quietly to herself, curling on herself in the bathtub as she released her held-in sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she emerged from the bathroom and changed into the red nightgown laid out for her, she was still sniffling a little, but a lot calmer than before. Her exhaustion now doubled from crying, she climbed into the bed and sunk into the covers. She didn't even register the comforting warmth of the plush sheets, because as soon as her head hit the pillows, she was out like a light.</span></div></div>",

Horrible nightmares that seemed real, but thankfully turned out to be all just products of her imagination gone mad. She was still with Tora, still at the Bleakfrost Tavern with her boss and co-workers, still in her world safe and sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the last vestiges of sleep left her and she registered the ultra-comfy mattress she was nestling in, the fluffy and warming covers she was under, the softest pillows her head rested on was Olga painfully reminded of her new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes stared at the roof of her bed's canopy first, and then glanced blearily around. It was going to take some getting used to, waking up to this room. Being reminded every waking moment this was her life now. Just that was enough to make her sink back into the bed, whimpering in misery. It was at that moment her stomach reminded her of its <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">demands </span>needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga sighed. <i>I can't stay in bed all day, now can I...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made to move her legs slowly out from under the covers, ready for the sensation of her bare feet gracing the carpeted floor. However, her intended action of getting up was frozen upon registering one alarming fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA maid, different from last night's, standing a mere two feet from her, a little serving tray held up in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde shrieked and fell back into the covers, bringing them up to cover her face. She stayed like that for a few moments, hoping beyond hope that the new maid had scurried away. She peeked from the covers until her eyes could see. The maid was still standing her, her posture unbroken, and completely nonplussed by the human's terrified reflex action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What...?\" Olga stammered, still peeking from the covers timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A treat before breakfast,\" the maid, this one red-haired with dark skin and golden eyes, droned mechanically. \"Courtesy of Lady Cameena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga just stared. Snacking before breakfast? What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A show of hospitality. A gesture of thoughtful kindness from the Countess,\" the maid elaborated, presenting the tray forward. \"She is well aware how humans work up appetite in the time they slumber. So she sends a precursor to the meal that awaits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga watched as the maid proceeded to lift the silver cloche from the bowl on the tray. The plate within carried rye bread, five slices total, and each slice was slathered in butter and jam. To the side was a tiny glass of mead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga stared. Her stomach growled. Working at a tavern she never had to scrape for food like most people did, but then again Racovania did benefit from good harvests as a result of the deal brokered by the Stranken vampire clan. Still, to be tended to like this, served a snack before breakfast...all this royal treatment was too much for Olga to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" her stomach growled again, and the maid lowered the tray within reach of her. \"Th-Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate daintily, unnerved by how the maid continued to just stand there all machine-like. She wondered if all the servants in the castle were like this. Surely not, as she had overheard some energetic bustling and words from the kitchen the night before as she ate dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bread tasted so good, though. Perfectly accompanied by butter and jam. And the mead...practically honey in her mouth with its sweetness. And this was just a prelude? After the big dinner she had last night, now Olga wanted to see what breakfast was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" the maid suddenly spoke and Olga froze up. \"Hold a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde flinched and shut her eyes as the woman lifted her hand, anticipating a reprimanding action. Had she committed some faux pas? Made an offensive display with her eating? Well why did they bring her a snack covered in butter and jam to bed, then?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a harsh discipline, Olga felt a soft fabric brush along the edges of her mouth. She opened her eyes, realizing the maid was merely wiping at her mouth with a napkin. Before Olga could make sense of that, she glanced down at her plate, and saw to her shock that she had already finished the five slices of rye bread and the cup of mead. She must have woken up hungrier than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...this was not normal. Slightly chubby as she was, Olga had never been one to indulge like this. Then again, after last night's grand feast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come. Lady Cameena awaits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga only now just registered that the maid had taken the tray back, and was waiting for her to rise out of bed and follow her. Blushing and with a timid demeanor, Olga got out of bed hesitantly. Her bare feet touching the carpeted floor soothed her somewhat, as did the rest of her baggy nightgown as it flowed and covered her well like a giant blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way,\" the maid led Olga down a great hall as luxurious and brilliant as the main entry hall. They went down a flight of stairs, took a left into another long hallway, and down another flight of stairs that were spiral in design. It was a long walk, and as much as Olga could marvel at taking in more of her new home, the silence was uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" she muttered, pausing to steel her nerve. \"Do you...have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thora,\" the dark-skinned red-head said without pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thora...\" Olga tested the name. \"And the one from last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aina, most likely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga blinked. <i>Most likely?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though sensing the blonde's confusion, Thora elaborated. \"She is the most experienced. There is no order on which maid attends to the Mistress' property, but Aina usually takes charge as she has worked here the longest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Olga said carefully, taking this all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued on in silence, eventually reaching the grand double doors that lead to the main dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here,\" Thora announced calmly, gesturing at the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga watched in fascination as the faceless mannequins from last night materialized again to open the doors. She really should asked what were those beings and if they just appeared anywhere whenever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive doors crawled open, revealing the majestic dining room in all its glory, with the lady of the castle sitting at the head of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here she is,\" Cameena crooned, looking up from the parchment she was writing on. \"Come, by my side, not a moment to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThora stepped aside so Olga could hesitantly walk forward. Any meek greetings she was about to say died in her throat as she took a good look at the gray-skinned countess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena was dressed much more casually as opposed to the usual regal armor she wore. Compared to last night's commanding attire, she now wore a black gown with red shades. <i>Only </i>that black gown with red shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's face reddened as she noted how Cameena's gown was a lot more revealing than hers. Where Olga's swallowed her legs and hid her feet, Cameena's thick gray legs were bare and crossed over the other from where she sat. Where Olga's had sleeves that reached her hands, Cameena's stopped at just the elbow lines. Where Olga's gown covered her budding potbelly well, Cameena's had an open space specifically for her bigger belly to slide out and rest comfortably on her thighs. Finally where Olga's neckline and chest were properly covered, Cameena's prominent chest was very much out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she had the decency to wear undergarments, but that was beside the point, as Olga's rapidly reddening face and stammering could attest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ill?\" Cameena asked in regards to the blonde's hot flush, expression twisting in distaste at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" Olga squeaked as she sat beside her eternal hostess, focusing only on the food both out of hunger and to not stare at the scantily-clad vampire. \"Just...the snack was really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it?\" Cameena leaned forward, resting her chubby face on her hands, red eyes glinting with much interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, tell me how good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena leaned a little closer. \"Tell me how good it was,\" she whispered saucily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga found herself reddening and paling all at once, unable to decide how to properly feel about the chubby immortal right this moment. \"It was...delicious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena closed her eyes and leaned back with a slow, strong inhale, humming to herself. Olga trembled, fighting to stay focused on the breakfast spread out before her and not at the intimidating vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious,\" Cameena said softly, thickly....dreamily? Olga wasn't sure anymore. \"Oh! Where are my manners? Please,\" she gestured at the spread. \"Dig in. Eat your fill, same as you did last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...\" Olga grabbed at her utensils and got started. Somehow, she was even more famished than she thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, good,\" Cameena purred approvingly at the blonde's appetite, watching her closely the whole time.</span></div></div>",

Can...C-Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*sigh* Oh, great. More idle chit-chat. This is annoying. And yet... Why do I feel so obligated to answer?\"</i> Cameena contemplated, unsure about her current standing with her esteemed <i>\"guest\"</i>. Sure, it was nothing to write home about when it came to her previous livestock, so...why did this one felt so...<i>different</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...L-Lady Cameena? Are...A-Are you alright?\" Olga stammered, which seemed to snap the curvy vampire out of her contemplative stupor, blinking twice and thrice as she finally responded with a half-feint friendly tone and retorted, \"Oh! Um...My sincerest apologies, my dear. I was just...<i>contemplating</i> on something. Nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, um...I-I wanted to know what it is like...b-being a vampire, y-you know?\" Olga meekly responded, chewing on another cinnamon bun with sheer hesitation, as if worried about making the somewhat plump vampire countess cross by mistake and naivety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, fortunately for the plump Northerner, she was wrong on that thought, as Cameena displayed a curious expression and gesture whilst sitting in her decadent chair, her thick right leg crossed over her equally thick left leg, bearing a rather pleasantly surprised look in her inhuman eyes, with a fanged cheeky grin upon her blood red lips as she quipped, \"Oh? ...And what exactly would you desire to know, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, despite her hostess' seemingly complacency in answering any questions she wholly desired to ask the svelte vampire countess, the problem for Olga was not to ask, but what question to ask. Sure, she could ask something straightforward as <i>\"What will happen to me?\"</i>, or <i>\"Will I ever get to see my sister again?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, the possibilities were quite literally endless. But eventually, after some momentary contemplation, Olga inevitably chose a suitable question to ask, exhaling a deep breath in order to relieve her shaking nerves and calmly asked...</span></div></div>",

Her black brows raised just so, and her half-slitted eyes opened a bit more as she balanced her prominent pointed chin on top of the back of her hand. Leaning forward onto the table, the right corner of her blue lips tugged until the faintest hint of a smile had formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As one with my prediliction tends to do.\" she added coolly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" a hasty, almost embarassed laugh came from Cameena's dinnerguest, \"Um... what does it... taste like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here, the seeds of Cameena's smile began to blossom into a little smirk. An odd noise of quaint amusement flowed through her gray nostrils in what Olga may have mistook for a little laugh. Her hostess repositioned herself on the table, lifting her head and nestling it in her other hand boredly. With her now free dominant hand, she gesticulated vaguely while contemplating Olga's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's a conversation I didn't expect to have tonight,\" Cameena said, more to herself than to Olga, as she glanced emptily at her nails beneath long lacy gloves, \"Whatever do you want to know that for, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, um...\" Olga gulped, \"Making conversation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How quaint, <i>you</i> trying to keep <i>me</i> entertained.\" Cameena said with what appeared to be genuine amusement at the situation before repeating the question. \"What does blood taste like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To you, it may all taste the same. I don't suppose cute little farm girls are in the habit of suckling on their neighbors necks, but I don't know many mortals who <i>enjoy</i> the taste.\" Cameena silently beckoned a mannequin to fill her glass with viscous red wine, commanding it to stop with just two fingers once the glass was full, \"But when you've acquired <i>the proper taste</i> for it, you'd be surprised with all the myriad ways that decide the flavor in one's veins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like... spices? A bit like spices.\" Cameena visibly struggled with the word, having gone for some time without the use for them herself, \"What one puts into themselves affects the various intricacies of the meal\u2014some people, you see, have a very thick blood while others are thin blooded, or say some have sweet blood while others are more bitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga watched from the other end of the dining hall, being attended to by the various servants as well she would allow. Everything was delicious, but something about tossing around the idea of drinking blood so casually made her sit uncomfortably in her seat. And the food sit uncomfortably on her stomach. She knew that she was the one who brought up the subject, and wouldn't object, but her eyes were far bigger than her stomach in this sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way that her horrid hostess seemed to become so enthralled with the subject was another matter. The comfort that Cameena seemed to feel talking about drinking blood was proportionate to the discomfort that began to rise in the pit of Olga's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the most important part is that the <i>taste</i> of the blood can be influenced by a number of things.\" Cameena spread her fingers laterally in front of her, \"The host's diet is a big indicator of what their blood will taste like, but things like exercise and overall health will affect whether or not the blood runs thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Olga gulped, \"So... if I eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your diet is very much reflective of <i>my</i> diet so to speak.\" Cameena chuckled with surprising warmth, taking the connection from Olga's shoulders and putting it onto the dinner table, \"To make a long story short... what you're eating now is going to impact how your blood tastes to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga felt her stomach drop out from underneath her. Her chest seemed to hollow out at the reminder that she was going to be feasted upon. Her blood was going to be drunken, whether she liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Olga's face turned sheet white, \"I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pish posh, you'll barely feel a thing.\" Cameena said dismissively, though not without seeming to understand that she'd made her dinnerguest uncomfortable, \"You've hardly touched the ham now. Eat up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room seemed to spin as Olga's mind spun out of control. Once more, the awful reality dawned upon her; she was this monster's captive. Her slave. Her pet. Fancy dresses and nice rooms and scrumptious breakfasts meant nothing, only that she was being kept comfortable for ease of access. This gray-skinned, blue-lipped she-demon was going to... going to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

She didn't notice or care for anything else except for the exit behind her, pivoting around and making a run for it before Thora and another maid could get their hands on her. She took off in such a hurry that her naked foot flying through her nightgown came dangerously close from colliding with the collapsed chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss!\" someone said, probably Thora or another of her co-workers. Olga wasn't sure because it all came as a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go,\" even Cameena's lazy command to the maids came as hazy and distant, and Olga's instincts immediately ordered her to capitalize on the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have a chance. <b>Run</b>.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd run she did, guided only by instinct as she pushed past the double doors, entered the grand hallway, and ran like she had never run before. More than once she came close to tripping as a consequence of her gown's flowing skirt, but thankfully fate was not that cruel. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept running with no end goal in sight. Anything to just get away from the monster. For a brief moment of clarity amidst her panic, she considered running for the main gates. She discarded the idea as quickly as it came; no way she could get out of the castle in any capacity. Trying to would be the most clear-cut way of getting caught. Or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice or care when she came to points where the hallway divided. She just picked one direction and ran down that hallway. It didn't matter to her where she ended up, she just wanted to <b><i>get away</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that she ran past many maids along the way. The castle's many attendants carried on with their tasks, completely ignoring the hysterical blonde running in their company. Some did pause in their duties to stare in silence as Olga ran past them, but that was it. Not a single ounce of surprise on their faces. Just this...blank curiosity that only served to unnerve Olga even more. It only encouraged her to run faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what turn she took or if maybe at some point she had stopped in her tracks to run the other way around, but somehow she ended up in the kitchen. Assuming this was the only kitchen in the castle, and taking into account what Cameena had said at the table, it was a safe bet there had to be more than one kitchen in this giant castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" a woman whom Olga assumed to be the head of the kitchen turned to look at the blonde intruder. No one else did, all the other females present busying themselves with their kitchen tasks, whether it was chopping meat or cleaning plates and silverware. \"Miss, you're not supposed to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga just stared, blue eyes wide and her mouth falling open and then closing as she breathed haphazardly. She was about to say something, but the executive chef gave a smile that made Olga freeze up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless...\" the azure-haired woman said. \"If you're here because you are still hungry, you need only say so. Shall we prepare a snack dish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere mention of food triggered another panic attack in Olga. She let out what was supposed to be a piercing scream, but what came out instead was a strangled gasp. She quickly turned on her bare heel and ran out of the kitchen, openly sobbing in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please!\" Olga wailed, shutting her eyes as her tears trailed behind her. \"J-Just stay away! Please! Leave me alone--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran headfirst into a body, shrieking in fright as she fell back, her arms flailing as she went. A set of hands that felt cold to the touch grabbed at her wrists, saving her from falling down to the carpet floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you finished?\" Cameena sounded amused, and Olga opened her eyes to see the little fanged grin the vampire was giving her. \"Honestly, if you weren't cattle, I would have said you were--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Olga shrieked loud enough to stun Cameena. \"L-L-L-Let me go! LET ME GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena stared in barely hidden shock, gaping numbly as the little human wretched like a rabid animal trying to get free. The immortal tightened her grip on the girl's wrists quickly, but continued to stare in surprise and, dare she say it, a little bit of awe at the hysterical ferocity the blonde was displaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now!\" Cameena started over Olga's screams and desperate fighting. \"Calm down--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" the human wailed. \"PLEASE! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena was silent for a second, absorbing those words and then blinking in honest shock. \"That's what this is about? You aren't going to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST LET ME GO! PLEASE--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga froze as Cameena's palm landed on her cheek and firmly stayed there. Her terrified, watery blue eyes looked up to meet Cameena's inhuman red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga trembled horribly from a combination of her terror, Cameena's displeased gaze upon her, and the cold the vampire's touch brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena just stared at her, actually growling a little as she made her displeasure known. Olga could only whimper and periodically gasp. She didn't notice the countess was looking at her chest, as though gauging the beats of her rapidly-beating heart inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena frowned. Human hearts aren't supposed to beat that fast. <i>I need to calm her...</i></span></div></div>",

Then, with the speed of a striking snake, her head lunged forward towards the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga\u2019s eyes went wide with shock as she felt the vampire bite down, it was like a pair of needles had struck her right in the neck. A sensation of coldness came over her, as Cameena\u2019s lips created a tight seal around the wound, and then it began in earnest. A light-headedness came over Olga as she felt her blood being drained, her entire body feeling cold and numb from the vampire\u2019s bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Cameena was trying to concentrate; she had no desire to drain enough to harm Olga, so she had to keep her parasitic appetite in check. Drain too much, and she could cause permanent damage to Olga, or worse. But it was proving more difficult than she anticipated; Olga\u2019s blood was naturally very sweet it seemed, a taste the vampire relished more than any other wine of the vein. For a brief moment, Cameena\u2019s eyes closed in bliss and she gulped a little too deeply, causing Olga to shake slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back to her senses, Cameena stopped herself and pulled her fangs out, her lips leaving Olga\u2019s neck with a wet pop sound. The girl looked pale and her head was lolling back, but her heart was still beating, good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena adjusted her grip, tucking one arm under Olga\u2019s back and the other down behind her knees, scooping the smaller woman up. There was nothing Olga could do, she had completely lost consciousness. With long elegant strides, the vampire began to carry her cargo back to the center of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga woke up, everything coming back to her; the dinner, the vampire, running down the halls and\u2026 then having her blood drained by that monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, the blonde noticed that she was once again seated in the dining hall, but where was that vampire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to bite you tonight.\u201d The voice caught Olga off-guard as Cameena strode into view, her expression was stern, like that of a disappointed parent. Olga just stared, so the vampire continued, \u201cIf you had just done as you were told, you wouldn\u2019t have fainted\u2026 now eat up, you need to regain your strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga turned her gaze forwards, noticing that the table had been re-set, with a new feast prepared for her. Despite her fear of\u2026 the entire situation, Olga leaned forward and began to help herself to a roast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, Cameena continued lecturing her, \u201cI told you that no harm would come to you in here.\u201d She said in an icy tone. \u201cYou are protected by the largest fortress for miles, and I do not tolerate intruders. No chance of being killed by famine, disease or one of the beasts that prowl the woods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of replying, Olga simply glared at her kidnapper. She wanted to give some sort of retort, but the vampire was far too intimidating\u2026 plus she really needed to eat, despite the meal earlier, she felt like she was on the verge of starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena sighed, \u201cPerhaps I need to iron out this relationship. I am not your predator, and you are not prey\u2026 you are my cattle and I am the farmer. Your every need shall be taken care of, and you will be very well fed here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished, Olga stared at a large chunk of beef before her, \u201cFarmers kill their cows\u2026 is that what you eventually intend to do with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, enough with the analogies\u2026\u201d Cameena sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t need to drain you completely of blood, I just need some.\u201d As the vampire spoke, Olga\u2019s eyes lowered to her host\u2019s middle. The gray-skinned woman\u2019s belly was looking a bit rounder than she remembered, and it bobbed and sloshed quite a bit as well. \u201cAnd things will be easier for you\u2026\u201d she continued, \u201cif you ate more and kept up your strength. As I said earlier, I didn\u2019t want to drink from you tonight, but you forced my hand. If you had just eaten well, it would have been a lot less unpleasant for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a prolonged silence between the two, as Olga continued to eat, but making sure to keep an eye on Cameena. The vampire didn\u2019t move though, she was intent on making sure Olga ate her fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, one of the maids entered through the great doors and approached the owner of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d the girl began, before whispering something to the tall elegant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems my presence is required elsewhere tonight.\u201d Cameena stated, still maintain her disapproving tone. \u201cRest assured though, I have no intention of letting tonight\u2019s incident be repeated\u2026\u201d she then turned to the maid, \u201cdo not let her leave until she has finished the meal.\u201d The maid nodded obediently, as Cameena strode past, a deep clang of the doors closing behind her as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga wasn\u2019t sure which she found more unnerving, Cameena\u2019s icy stare, or this maid\u2019s weird expressionless face. Either way, the blonde girl decided things would go best if she just ate what she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit by bit, Olga ate her way through the lavish dinner. If her situation would have been different, she would have quite enjoyed this, the meats were tender and rich in flavor, the sauces were thick and were almost delicious enough to drink straight from the spout, and she hadn\u2019t even got to the desserts yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I have had my fill\u2026\u201d Olga stated as she tried to leave her chair. But as she did, Olga felt strong fingers wrap around her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress said you are not to leave until it is finished.\u201d The maid stated flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga tried to wrest herself from the grasp, but found she could not. Either that bite had left her more drained than she thought, or this maid was far stronger than she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I guess I could have a bit more\u2026\u201d Olga mumbled, which seemed to satisfy the maid and released Olga\u2019s arm. She wasn\u2019t uncomfortably full, but what remained on the table seemed like a disproportionate amount of food for her to eat alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried her best though; thankfully Olga was on the desserts now, and they all went down smoothly, even if some sat pretty heavily in her stomach. Reluctant eating turned into slow plodding chews, as Olga\u2019s belly began to stretch and strain with its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a struggle for the poor girl to push the last slice of tart past her lips,  but down it went, she could practically feel it hit her stomach with a squelch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m done\u2026\u201d Olga panted, dropping her cutlery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid gave a polite nod. \u201cVery good. Follow me to your room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the maid, instead of helping Olga out of her chair, simply watched as the blonde girl heaved herself up. It felt like she had swallowed a lump of lead, and it kind of looked like it as well. Her dress may have been loose, but there was certainly a prominent swollen shape at the front. Gods, she looked like one of the pregnant women she had seen in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, she waddled after the maid, cradling her stuffed stomach as she was lead back up the flights of stairs, and into her lavish bedroom quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had had enough, she just wanted to go to sleep, and pray that this was just a horrible nightmare. Unfortunately the maid was still standing there\u2026 watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need any help\u2026\u201d Olga stated, hoping that it might make her go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she did. With another bow, she left, closing the door after her. Olga emitted a sigh of relief, finally she was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into towards her mirror, Olga pulled back her blonde locks to take a look at the damage. Two scabs were visible on her neck, where Cameena had bit her. She inwardly hoped they wouldn\u2019t scare, but it was the least of her worries. One of which being her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, Olga pulled her dress upwards, to reveal her stomach. It was stuffed alright, puffed out and very sensitive to the touch. Olga thought back to Cameena\u2019s words earlier, \u201cwas this what she meant by well fed?\u201d She muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the dress drop back down, and turned to her bed. It seemed it had been made since she left it last, and a nightdress had been laid out on top of it. Like her current one, it was quite oversized for her, and very frilly and elegant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga began to remove her dress; sleep was the only thing she was looking forward to right now. At least her dreams would take her away from this place.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the rest of her first day, Olga stayed in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunch that she had eaten was especially heavy, and Cameena's feeding had left her particularly drained of energy. She made an attempt at the dinner that was brought to her, but most of her night was spent asleep. The maids had helped her change into proper sleeping attire\u2014a long, silk nightgown that hung off of her like a rug\u2014and put her to bed properly. The nausea that came with eating so much rich food on a stomach upset by the onset anemia left her feeling dizzy and weak. She was put to bed after being forced to eat a quarter of another rich meal, and fell back to sleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke early the next morning, she hardly felt any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queasiness was still ever-present, curling the back of her throat and souring in the base of her nose. But the full moon over the mountain, high at this time of night, brightened her bedroom so much that she could hardly sleep. Edging herself towards the bed, Olga rose to rocking knees and wobbled unsteadily to the first window to draw the blinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when she realized that she could see her hometown down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it was dark. Very few candles were lit at this time of night. But she could clearly make out town square. And following it with her finger, Olga could see the Bleakfrost Tavern. Which meant Ms. Helga and Ms Somaria's houses were right there. Greta's was across the street. The Woodcutter boys were across the way and there, two streets over from them, was her and Tora's house. The shop that her papa had started. Where she, her sister, and both of her parents had lived, all together. Before tragedy took them one by one. First her mama, then her papa, and now her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the curtains flutter freely, Olga hurried to the door and struggled to turn the lock. They had locked her in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pounded at the door an shouted, hoping that maybe one of those maids would hear her. She wailed and pounded for an hour, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay in and day out, Olga was confined to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, Olga had viewed her confinement to her bedroom as punishment. A way of correcting her behavior after her first night in the castle. She thought back to the horse breeders she had known in Racovania, how they would sometimes take in a wild stallion and then have to break them before they could be saddle-ridden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow fortunate for her\u2014she'd gone from steer to stallion after showing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room was big enough to allow her walking space. A toilet, bidet, and bath were tucked into the corner and hidden behind a thick red curtain. With no other options for seating, however, Olga would spent a lot of her day in bed. When she wasn't pacing around the room out of boredom or looking longingly at her hometown from the window, she was laying in bed, staring at the canopy. There was nothing to <i>do</i>. Everything that she could have wanted was provided to her by the daily rotation of maids that tended to her every need. They cleaned up after her, they delivered her meals, and they helped to dress her. They were also her only conversation; Olga treasured her moments with them more than a starving man to a grain of rice. She kept them in her room for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, guests do not leave their rooms.\" Phyla had said one day with a small smile\u2014she was easily the most approachable of them, \"the mistress will call upon you when she's ready. Has she not been coming every night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I had dinner in the dining hall on my first night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you did. All of the mistress's guests do.\" Thora said somewhat gruffly, picking up the pieces of glass that Olga's latest accident had left imbedded in her rug, \"And do you remember how you <i>acted</i>? Only the Mistress's <i>favorites</i> get to dine in the grand hall. And even then, not every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm just to sit here in my bedroom for the rest of my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will do what the Mistress commands.\" Aino cocked a black eyebrow, \"I will see to that. You're just lucky that the Mistress seems so taken with your taste, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was going stir-crazy. The only thing there was to do in the castle was eat. Four times a day, a different maid would knock on her door politely before rolling in a right feast for Olga to consume. She finished every meal puffing and panting, sometimes she could barely see straight before she collapsed onto her bed, cradling her doming stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast, lunch, a second smaller meal before dinner, and then dinner proper. Olga ate enough to feed an entire shift back at the Bleakfrost Tavern. And with no exercise, all of Olga's muscles were melting away into soft jiggly flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena Stranken was fattening her up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sound so surprised, darling.\" Cameena had said to her during one of her daily feedings, \"I <i>told you</i> that you would be kept very well-fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's round face was especially so after the coming weeks. Her whole body had softened in light of the confounded conditioning she'd been put through. When she got here, she could hardly finish one meal. But after having nothing to do but eat all day, she'd gotten quite good at it. Her belly swelled out, her thighs widened and quivered with her every step. Her bosom blossomed outwards and hung lower and heavier. Without a mirror proper, Olga could only surmise the change by touch. But she knew that she was getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had learned how to keep herself steady now, after Cameena's feedings. If she ate enough, she would only feel a bit light-headed. And since her hostess popped by at random, and was <i>going</i> to get her fill, it was incentive enough to avoid the sickness that came with her blood being let out on an empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's not like you're not getting anything out of this.\" Cameena purred, poking Olga in the belly, \"Your tummy gets filled to satisfaction every night, yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena's finger sunk deep into Olga's pillowy paunch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" she purred before licking her lips, \"Do you think that you can manage another helping, darling? I'm a bit peckish today and your brand is <i>especially</i> scrumptious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is the book you requested, ma'am.\" Thora said, handing Olga a large leather-bound book from the castle's library, \"Some light reading after an especially heavy lunch then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" Olga took the book in one hand, \"How are you, Thora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm well, and very busy.\" Thora had caught wise to Olga's penchant for wasting precious minutes of her busy day of tending to Cameena's livestock, \"Enjoy the book, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shut behind her, and Olga just groaned and flung herself on the bed. The book fell to the floor. She was a Smith's daughter, she had no book learning! She could barely read! But the other maids would at least tell her about the book if they'd read it. Then maybe she could <i>talk</i> to someone about more than just food. Or the Mistress. Or her bedding or whatever thing she'd broken so they'd have to come and stay with her for just a minute longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terror that gripped her heart about this place was almost well and gone, but terminal boredom had been left in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There was nothing to do here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga groaned as she lay sprawled on the bed, belly rising high beneath her dress. Two meals into today and she was already stuffed. If untying her dress wasn't impossible without one of her maids, she would have done it by now. Let herself be free and breathe. After lunch was always the hardest time of the day. It seemed to come right after breakfast, whereas the small snack before dinner was much later in the afternoon. It barely gave her time to digest anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was probably the point. If that book didn't put her to sleep, her full gut might. Then she'd wake up just in time for her pre-dinner snack. Not cause any trouble. No begging for books she couldn't read or breaking priceless baubles so that the maids would come into her room and gripe at her. No trapping the help in conversations about the topics she knew interested them. Just eat and sleep, eat and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a good little farm animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Olga, an alternative method for occupying her afternoon presented itself in...</span></div></div>",

Interestingly enough, it had also been Thora the last time. The past two times, even. It was just, then, Olga was still new to the castle, and hadn't adjusted to her new dietary regimen yet. By the time the next maid had roused her from her slumber by arrival, the door was already locked behind them. Aino would come in and curse the last woman to walk through the door before slipping a silver skeleton key into the lock and getting on with keeping her charge well-fed, or Phyla would roll her eyes and lock the door silently before announcing that Olga had missed her chance to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't be missing it now, that much was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been some time since Olga had gotten so much excitement.

In her quest to explore and avoid running into any of the dutiful maids, she took every route that led downwards. That was the pathway she was most familiar with on account of every day being taken there for meals. So she knew where to go, nothing to fear, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept somewhere at the halfway point of reaching the clear path down to the main hall, Olga opted to go the other way at the fork of the spiral staircases. She figured the other, unfamiliar path might lead to the same area, albeit a different section of said area. Olga's curiosity just won out; she needed exploration, and she needed to find something <i>new </i>to entertain herself with now that she lived here. Better yet, anything new would do, even if that meant toddling down an unfamiliar path and risk getting lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the risk of getting lost proved to be extraordinarily high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga found herself pausing in her walk constantly to look around, take in her surroundings, and realize she recognized nothing of the hallway she was in. Granted, every hallway in the castle was visually identical to the other; same high walls, chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, tapestries and carpets hanging by the wall-high windows, carpets decorating the smooth cobblestone path, and giant stairs in the middle that either went up or down, with more stairs at the end of each hall also going either up or down with the ones at the end usually being the spiral variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't be scared</i>, Olga took a sharp inhale to steel her jittery nerves. Her chubby hands fell down to caress her swollen tummy--a nervous tic she seemed to have developed as of late. For how unhappy she was with her current predicament, her newly acquired flab proved to be smooth and even comforting at times. It's like the extra weight itself was a friend of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just turn back, find your way back...\" Olga told herself as she pivoted around and headed back to where she came. All she had to do was retrace her steps, and she'll be good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept...which staircase did she go down from again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga blinked, staring at the twin staircases. Both were completely identical, and she hadn't been paying attention from which direction angle she had come int. They looked absolutely the same!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The left one, yes, I'm sure it was the left one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went up the stairs, already showing the first symptoms of perspiring as she forced her bulkier body up the stairs, her breathing coming out slightly labored as she went. She felt so sure this was the correct path, but as she went into the next hallway, a grim feeling of uncertainty swelled up within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga paused in her step, now feeling very much unsure as she surveyed the area around her. She wondered if the castle itself was playing tricks on her, because right now it felt like her sense of direction had been erased. Fighting back her mounting nervousness, she pressed on, waddling down the spacious hall and taking a left at the next grand stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was perplexed to see that she was at what looked to be the same hall as before, and yet that feeling of unfamiliarity crept up again. She was about to go either left or right when the sound of the doors at the far end of the hall opening reached her ears. Her heart practically jumped to her throat, along with a surge of adrenaline. Olga moved with remarkable speed, running down the immediate stairs to her right before the maids coming into the hall could spot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran down another flight of stairs after that one, feeling like she had to put more distance between herself and any maids that may come. Miraculously, this seemed to have solved her present trouble. She still had no clear idea where she was, but she was close to the main hall. She could tell by looking out the window; she was at ground-level now, and glancing through the glass she could make out the outline of the castle gates on the far horizon to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elated smile stretched her chubby cheeks. She was on much familiar grounds, at least! Not the exact same hall, but this was an improvement over being completely lost. So if she took a right from here, she <i>should </i>be at the Grand Hall. She immediately turned to go right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she would have, had her nose not caught whiff of a particularly tantalizing smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Olga said, pausing to sniff the air properly. It was a divine smell, so heavenly and delightful. The blonde was hit with familiar waves of nostalgia and hunger as she continued to breathe in the aroma. She smacked her lips, rubbed her belly, and proceeded to turn left in the direction of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm, it would be about time for lunch right now,</i> Olga pondered as she went. If she had control of her senses right now she would be hurrying back to her room. But at this moment, she could only trail after the aroma of the afternoon meal time. She couldn't help it, Lady Cameena had awakened something of a bigger appetite in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am getting fat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Olga found herself not caring. As stated previously, her added pounds felt like a layer of comfort at times. And the food the Mistress ordered prepared was beyond compare. Nothing but the best for her favorite growing pet, she had said. The closest Olga could remember the quality of the food being compared to was Ms. Somaria's. And even then, Cameena's kitchen staff were on another level. Olga just couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, reduce the amount of potatoes this time. Last time she had too many...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga froze, fully back to her senses upon recognizing the voice coming from beyond the set of double doors she found herself in front of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cameena...!\" Olga whimpered, her hands flying to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And furthermore....What is it, Aina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga yelped as the doors flung open, and she was face to face with the gray-eyed stare of Cameena's head maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have ourselves a runner, my lady,\" Aina deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Olga trembled as Cameena peeked from around Aina, and subsequently shrunk into herself as the Countess regarded her with an initial look of surprise that quickly turned into a disapproving scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...hello?\" Olga said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena, looking noticeably plumper since the last time she'd had a taste of Olga's blood, continued to glare at her, though her expression softened slightly as she stepped forward to look at her properly. \"And what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Well...You see...\" Olga was sweating now, her lip trembling as she tried to form words. Try as she might, she just couldn't think of what to say in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her stomach made a growling noise loud enough to be heard by everyone present. Olga flushed as Cameena's gaze snapped to her potbelly before looking at her again. This time, the chubby vampire looked amused and not at all angry as she had been just moments ago. Olga didn't know if she should feel relieved her hunger announced itself like it did, or be further mortified at the continuing dose of misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, you are hungry, and the aroma must have traveled as far as your room?\" Cameena grinned, now all smiles and cheery tone as she eyed Olga's flabby belly approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, that's right!\" Olga nodded quickly. Might as well go along with this. \"A-And...I just couldn't sit still. I had to come down! Even if...it meant getting lost on the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena threw her head back and laughed. \"Oh, I like you, darling!\" she guffawed, her hands holding her own budding belly as she shook with laughter. \"Didn't even call for any of the maids! I knew you were special!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks,\" Olga did not know what Cameena meant by \"special\" in the slightest, but she was not about to potentially ruin the chubby immortal's good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Cameena's laughter toned down to giggles. \"I suppose it is convenient you came, anyway. I was going to tell you tonight that your punishment as of this day is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga perked up at that. \"So that means...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, darling. You can leave your room whenever you wish and wander about as a proper guest again,\" and like blowing out a candle, Cameena's cheerful demeanor shifted into a dark, cold glare. \"Provided, of course, you don't entertain any notion of escaping or resisting the next time I come to feed,\" she paused, and then added. \"And, of course, stay away from certain areas of the castle I tell you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible chill went down Olga's spine. She nearly lost all feeling in her legs and collapsed then and there. \"O-O-Of course not, my lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena arched a single raven eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga swallowed. \"This...This is my home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased, Cameena reached a gray hand to pat the human on the cheek. \"Good,\" she smiled as though she hadn't been glaring just a second ago. \"Now then, to the table with us. Come, come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga let herself be grabbed by the hand and led. By this point, she was used to her mistress'...eagerness when it came to watching her eat. Honestly speaking, if she wasn't so unnerved, Olga might have even found it charming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga froze. Cameena? Charming? If she wasn't so skittish at the moment, she'd be giggling at the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something amuses you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flabby farm-girl yelped, stiffening in posture as her cheeks reddened. Apparently, she wasn't as uneasy as she thought. Why else would she have unknowingly let a tiny giggle fly out and allow Cameena to hear it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just looking forward to lunch,\" Olga smiled, rubbing her belly to appear convincing. Even then, she really was rubbing her belly a bit too much lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena beamed, her fangs glinting. \"It makes me <i>very </i>happy to hear that, dear! Oh, you'll just <i>love </i>this spread...!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And what a spread it was. The banquet hall was filled with what normally would have been enough to feed Olga\u2019s entire village; there were massive succulent meats, huge hill-like loafs, trays upon trays of desserts\u2026 an absolute smorgasbord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 maybe I will have some of it\u2026\u201d Olga murmured hesitantly as she was guided to her seat. Sure she had gotten fat, really fat, but there was no way she could eat this much\u2026 or should for that matter. The dress that the fattened blacksmiths-girl had been provided with on arrival was tight on her like a sausage skin now. Cameena however was having none of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh uh uh\u2026\u201d She replied with a clucking of her tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re a growing girl, and my maids worked so hard on preparing all this for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga gulped and picked up her cutlery, and began to tuck into a pile of baked potatoes nearest to her. She didn\u2019t want to look too keen, but gods had she been hungry lately. Meanwhile, Cameena paced around her captive, like a starving wolf around a wounded beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t just Olga who had an appetite problem; ever since she had tasted the blonde girl\u2019s blood, Cameena had been craving nothing else. Seeing Olga had her wetting at the mouth on nearly every occasion. The vampire reminded herself to only feed from Olga when she needed to, lest she wear the girl (and her blood) thin. But the taste\u2026 it was like sweet nectar to her, more delicious than any other blood she had ever tasted before, how could she resist\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Cameena had to resist; she was a <i>higher</i> vampire, not some feral beast like those Lamia. She had an air of nobility and class to keep, and it wouldn\u2019t do for other vampires (especially those of her own bloodline) to find out she had been glutting herself like an animal. It had started to show as well; today Cameena had struggled to put her corset on, whenever she tried to wrap the garment around her thick waist, an extra large roll of flab bulged out to obstruct her. Several maids had to be called up to help. She needed to distract herself, the sight of Olga, feasting and fattening before her was driving her wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHem hem\u2026\u201d Cameena coughed. Olga responded, barely, the plump woman only slowed her eating down, not stopping completely. \u201cSince you are staying in my castle indefinitely, I thought I should make you aware that there will be a masquerade ball held here in the coming months\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga stared blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a party, we all wear masks and dance to music\u2026\u201d Cameena continued, \u201cAnd since my halls will be filled to the brim with vampires\u2026 some of which will have travelled long distances to get here\u2026 I thought I should offer you the chance to attend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color quickly drained from Olga\u2019s face\u2026 more vampires\u2026 here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should of course remind you that I do not desire to have any harm come to you\u2026 so trust me when I say that being by my side will be the safest place in the castle\u2026 you are not obliged to attend of course\u2026 but do choose wisely when the time comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still a look of terror over Olga\u2019s face, so Cameena tried to calm her nerves some more. \u201cI hear some other vampires will be bringing their cattle as well\u2026 you might enjoy their company\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to work, Olga seemed to relax, and continued to eat. Speaking of which, Cameena was very impressed; the constant large meals Olga had been subjected to had really swelled her appetite and capacity wonderfully, no surprise that she was growing so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena continued to pace as she inspected her cattle. Olga had developed a cute swaddling second chin that jiggled as she ate; a good sign that Olga would have some thick cushioning around her neck when Cameena planned to feed from her. The blacksmith\u2019s daughter wouldn\u2019t even feel the pin-pricks of the vampire\u2019s fangs next time. It was so much easier when her prey didn\u2019t have to stop eating when Cameena wanted to feed, didn\u2019t waste any time that way that could be spent making her succulent cow fatter and tastier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Olga began to slow down, her breathing thicker and heavier, but her movements were barely slowed. Cameena soon noticed the problem however, and it wasn\u2019t to do with her precious blood bank\u2019s capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help you there\u2026\u201d Cameena purred into Olga\u2019s ear as she leaned down, copious gray cleavage wobbling in front of the seated woman\u2019s eyes. Then, Cameena lowered one hand to Olga\u2019s belly; there was a slight flinch at her cold touch, as the vampire stroked her hand across Olga\u2019s rightmost thick fat flank, stopping at one of the dresses seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick flick of her index finger, Cameena slashed her long razor-sharp nail across the stitches, tearing a great gash in the material. Moving to the other side of her charge, Cameena repeated the action on Olga\u2019s left side. As she did, the chubbier woman#s belly surged forwards, engulfing more of her lap. \u201cBetter?\u201d Cameena asked with a predatory grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga nodded greedily, her gluttony overtaking her common sense as she reached for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the dress, I will have my best seamstress make you a new one...\" Cameena purred, \"It will be nice and roomy for you... plenty of space to grow into.\" The vampire was happy to make subtle little comments about the fate she had planned for Olga, not like the girl was listening anyway. The pleasurable noises she was making as she ate was plenty indication that she was far too absorbed in trying to clean the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena was quite happy to let Olga waddle around the castle again, there was little chance of her leaving now; she was too plump to run for too long, too chubby to construct a method to escape, and it wouldn\u2019t be too long before she was too large to even fit in the dumb waiters or clothes chutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as the well-rounded girl stuffed herself silly, Cameena thought back to her cattle comments; with Olga\u2019s plump face, small nose and flushed pink face\u2026 she was looking more like a sow than a heifer. It was all going as planned, with Cameena planning to...</span></div></div>",

Her body limp and useless, her corpse would have been tossed aside for the maids to tend to. Lamia did this frequently, as did the Vampires of the North in ancient times. As Man and the Beasts learned to farm, so too had the nightwalkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trick to keeping an accessible source of sustenance with beasts came with domestication. Cattle, pigs, and fowl were captured, bred, and fed well until it was their turn to be called to the dinner table. So too it was that Humans served his purpose for Vampires. Whereas cows and pigs were slaughtered, humans had come to be viewed as something to suckle on. A human kept in captivity meant that there was always a meal ready, which kept the free-range humans unculled in their little towns down the mountain, with the added benefit of hardly having to breed them. Though few gave them the attention that Cameena specialized in, many of the girls she'd claimed from Racovania were still alive somewhere in the vast web of Stranken family. Given proper care, a human could last for quite a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut <i>keeping</i> their humans was a bit more difficult than keeping cows, pigs, sheep, or chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them could pick locks or open doors. None of them could convince servants to let them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping a human was much more than an assurance that their new master wasn't going to drain them dry. While fear was a very useful tool to corral their livestock, Cameena had found that it had the equally unpleasant effect of sparking ill-plotted escape attempts that often left wounded and exposed to the elements. By the time they find the bodies, they aren't good for much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the most important factor in keeping them from running away is in making sure that they don't <i>want</i> to. Softening them up a little is a great way to ensure that they <i>can't</i> run away\u2014Cameena had taught that trick to plenty of the younger nightlings\u2014but the most effective and efficient way is to make them feel as much at home in their new life as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDomestication turned wolves into dogs, tigers into cats, and bulls into livestock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same trick worked wonderfully on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trips around the castle, today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThora had said it with an air of satisfaction to her. She had made it known more than any of them that she wasn't a fan of Olga plundering into this and that. It made her job difficult, and she had a rather unfortunate tendency to barnacle herself to whichever maid had the luck to have been the last one to talk to her. Sometimes that meant following her around for an hour or two, asking inane questions about this and that before eventually growing bored and toddling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had been dressed for lunch, a loose flowy gown hung off of her fatted shape. The swell of her stomach, still ripe from breakfast, billowed it out that much more. She had been laying in bed since then, her hands resting dutifully on her stomach as it squelched and struggled in vain to digest what had been a particularly heavy beginning to her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today.\" she said in a full, but soft voice, \"I think I ate too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThora tried not to look too pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I tell Giovanna to cut back?\" the red headed maid barely hid a smirk, \"That maybe you'd like it if there were less sausage in your omelets? Or perhaps there are too many eggs? Did you not enjoy the bacon, or was it the porridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, don't do that...\" Olga huffed, having grown rather attached to her big breakfasts, \"But maybe a light lunch today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Thora grabbed at the doorhandle, \"I'll tell the lady at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was alone, Olga regretted suggesting the change in menu. She was sure that it wouldn't be <i>light</i> (nothing had been, ever since she'd gotten here) but what if she was still hungry after a while, before her snack? Then she'd be starving before dinner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga drummed her stomach contemplatively. For the past few days, she'd hardly left her room. Ever since Ms. Stranken had told her that she could leave, suddenly the appeal had waned a bit. Her maids had been coming in more of their own free will, just to check on her. They'd been tending to her in the bath now, which was nice. And while she liked eating lunches and dinners in the grand hall, her favorite meals were breakfasts and her afternoon snacks, where she could eat at her own pace in her own bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own bedroom. When had she started thinking of this as <i>her</i> bedroom, rather than the room where she was kept?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis room\u2014opulent and grand as it was\u2014was the only piece of the castle that Olga considered <i>hers</i>. No matter how incorrect she may have been, somehow coming back here after a long day of wandering around the castle or exceptionally long dinners with the lady of the house, getting drained of her blood here and there... it was nice to think that she had someplace to go, now that she'd been taken from her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breakfast weighing heavily on her stomach, her eyelids began to close. Her thoughts drifted off into the ether as Olga fell asleep for what was now a customary pre-lunch nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the doorhandle jostled once more as Cameena stepped lightly into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she issss...\" she smiled, \"Fast asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena's chubby gray cheeks dimpled as she took slow, methodical steps over to Olga's sleeping shape. She'd fallen back, her hands resting lazily on her chubby stomach as it domed underneath her gown. Her long blonde hair\u2014having never once been braided in that farm girl design since she'd come to the castle\u2014flowed like a river down her neck. Cameena brushed it aside and plunged her fangs into the girl's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga awoke, briefly, before drifting off to sleep as anemia set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little snack of my own.\" Cameena purred and stroked Olga's gut lovingly, \"<i>You</i> have a wonderful brand, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fattened farm girl fell into a deeper sleep, one fueled by blood loss and ensured a hearty appetite when she woke up, Cameena licked her blue lips appreciatively. Her supple shape resting heavily on the bed beneath her, Olga was quite the appetizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> are coming along <i>wonderfully</i>, love.\" She said in a husky voice, \"I'll have Giovanna make you something especially nice for lunch today.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Clack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Cameena\u2019s high-heeled shoes echoed through her cavernous hallways as she made her way to get lunch. As the vampire trod the familiar route through her castle, she felt a new sensation; with each step, her stomach was touching her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena had never been a skinny person, even back when she was a human, but her figure always had this\u2026 rubenesque tendency. Now however her body seemed to have had enough of sending excess calories to her more womanly areas, and was now diverting excess calories to other areas. Not that Cameena minded of course, she had always been a woman of ruthless excess; even if now it was much harder to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Olga\u2019s blood that was doing this to her; the flavor was so intense, like a drug. There was a richness that was hard to describe; it made Cameena think back to when she had first bundled Olga away into her castle, and the curious girl had asked her about the flavors of blood. Before she could have comfortably described the taste of the wine of the vein that flowed from every neck she had pierced. But now, she could not be so confident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not only the addictive taste that was causing her new-found blubber to accumulate so rapidly; it seemed that this extreme richness of Olga\u2019s blood came with another side-effect\u2026 it was super high in calories. That might have really been the cause of both, but Cameena didn\u2019t really care as to the how\u2019s and why\u2019s Olga taste so delicious. But the curvaceous vampire did know that she needed more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was partly why she had been so invested in making Olga so fat. With each added pound of weight, that was an extra bit of richness added to her blood, a touch greater resilience to being fed from, and a decreased ability to escape. Not that the possibility of that happening was very high anymore, Cameena had been doing everything in her power to domesticate Olga, to make sure she never wanted to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had been quite hesitant at first, but it seemed she had finally succumbed. She spent most of her waking moments in her bed, being waited on by the diligent maids of the castle, as an entire banquet was offered up to her. Her life had been spent mostly going hungry, there was no way she could pass up a bottomless feast for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hungry vampire approached Olga\u2019s quarters, she saw the tell-tale signs that she was still eating well. Maids were approaching in quick-step with platters piled high with food, entering and exiting quickly to go fetch more. Cameena was impressed; Olga may have stopped coming to the dining hall for feasts, but was very content with the feast being brought up to her instead. Cameena liked that, it meant the bloated blonde wasn\u2019t burning any precious fat waddling up and down the stairs to get her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids stopped in their tracks, waiting for their mistress to enter the room. Cameena strode inside, her thick gray thighs rolling across each other under her long train. As she passed through the door, brushing it with her hands, she pondered. These were the final preventative measures in case Olga did have a change of heart and decided to make a break for it\u2026 once she was big enough for the frame to prove impossible of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello my dear Olga, how are you today?\u201d Cameena purred in a predatory fashion as her eyes locked onto her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was lying on her bed, legs splayed out at a ninety degree angle, allowing her fulsome stomach to roll between her pudgy thighs. Her fat udders were perched atop her hillock-like belly, providing a perch for some of the side-plates to rest on. The rest were simply laid on her bed, as thick sausage fingers grasped them, before happily guiding the contents to their destination in her waiting maw. Olga\u2019s face would have seemed unrecognizable from the petite sunken look she possessed before; now her cheeks were well-rounded, her neck ringed with a massive second chin that rest on her chest, and the slightly pointed shape had given way to an overall roundness. Yes she was certainly more than double the woman she had been on arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello *oomph*\u201d Olga replied, her eyes meeting the vampire\u2019s gaze. But no longer filled with fear, there was almost a sign of excitement, as if some pavlovian link had been made between the sight of Cameena and more culinary satisfaction. She didn\u2019t even stop eating as Cameena approached, such a good girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you know what time it is\u2026\u201d Cameena purred as she slunk over, sliding her bloated backside onto the bed-covers just to the left of Olga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga nodded, and ceased eating, but not before licking her fingers clean of any residue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena leaned in, the back of her right hand pushing Olga\u2019s long blonde hair back over her shoulder. It really was getting quite out of control\u2026 perhaps she should send a maid up with a set of shears, cut it nice and short, then it wont get in the way of either of them eating. She also noticed that Olga's latest dress was starting to get tight; the fabric was clearly strained the most around her big midsection. The vampire made a mental note to tell the maids that did the seam-stressing that they needed to make a much greater allowance around the belly, she didn't want Olga's appetite to be artificially curbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her right hand, Cameena planted her palm on top of Olga\u2019s head. The girl didn\u2019t even flinch at the icy-cold touch of her undead owner, as she began to stroke from the top of her head to the back. Cameena then leaned her head in, the tip of her nose brushing the ring of neck fat insulating her cattle\u2019s most vulnerable spot. Opening her mouth wide, Cameena slit her fangs through Olga\u2019s dense fat skin, before plugging the wound with her icy lips, and she began to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste danced across her tongue, such exquisite flavor\u2026 oh it was just otherworldly! If Cameena had her eyes open, they would have been rolling back in her head, this was better than any feeling she had ever felt\u2026 it made her almost feel alive again. She wished the flow would never end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had to stop some time, or else her favorite cattle would suffer for it. Reluctantly, Cameena retracted her fangs from Olga\u2019s fatty neck, with one last lick to both clean the wound and get the last droplets inside her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the entire thing Olga had remained conscious; granted she did seem slightly out of it now, but it was certainly an improvement. Cameena thought back to some cattle she had owned previously that were so big that they didn\u2019t even notice Cameena feeding from them\u2026 hell one didn\u2019t even stop eating! The thought of Olga one day reaching that size, and her taste improving along with it, was breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was work needed to get her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling my dear?\u201d Cameena asked, placing a palm onto Olga\u2019s cheek and checking her eyes. They still responded well, but were much duller than a few minutes ago. \u201cHmmm\u2026 come!\u201d Cameena snapped, beckoning to one of the maids that had been standing closest to the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mistress?\u201d The woman asked, bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo down to the kitchens and tell them to prepare a lot more food for the cattle\u2019s quarters. I have recently fed from her and she needs extra sustenance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn receiving her commands, the maid bowed and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena had noticed that a bit more life stirred into Olga when she mentioned more food. And was that\u2026 a lick of her lips? Well well well, she was becoming the perfect hungry cow\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The only thing tastier than a well-prepared meal is one that has been seasoned appropriately. That is the one constant in the culinary arts Cameena takes to heart the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome would call her greedy, some even go as far as to label her a glutton. To Cameena, the biting words from her own kin hardly hold any weight to her self-esteem. They can call her what they wish, she knows she is a true woman of the night. Not like the Lamia, and certainly not like her relatives who would seize any of their cattle, drain them dry, and then move on to the next course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't say it often, but Cameena considers herself an artist. She has a much more refined palette, and her methods may draw much mockery from her family, but at least, as evident in her plush figure, the end result pays well. Her family just has the misfortune of not being capable of understanding how fruitful and long-lasting for the long run her methods are. Cameena may be just a capable a bloodsucker as any other creature of the night, but she is not wasteful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this human, Olga Forgedotter, she has discovered (and thus, <i>obtained</i>) the proverbial diamond in the rough. Her blood is special--<i>very </i>special. In all her years as an undead immortal collecting human maidens for food source, she has never tasted a blood as succulent and enthralling as Olga's. She is truly one of a kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present, Cameena lounges in the privacy of her chambers, dressed comfortably in her favorite black nightgown with crimson outlines. She sits on an armchair, her right hand holding a cup of wine gracefully in her fingers while her left makes odd, absentminded strokes at her round belly. Her posture is one of nonchalance with an air of imperiousness, one leg crossed over the other as she leans back into her seat, humming thoughtfully as she takes the occasional sip from her wine cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes, her maid for the night, dutifully refills her glass without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena hums with closed eyes, feeling for the beating presence of Olga two floors below her. Her precious cattle sleeps peacefully, and Cameena can tell by the ever so often shifts in rhythm that she is snoring softly. Her deliciously fattened form rests comfortably on that mattress fit for royalty, and the countess can the silhouette of her arms as they rest on top of her gut. Inside that softened body flows the sweetest blood, the most intoxicating brand any human could have possibly possessed. And it is all Cameena's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is truly magnificent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena blinks. Seems she was voicing her thoughts again. An odd occurrence that seems to happen whenever she focuses on Olga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's nothing,\" Cameena says smoothly, waving a dismissive hand. \"You can retire for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes bows in gratitude. \"Thank you, my lady. I am at your service at all hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena utters a little noncommittal noise in return, her gaze focused on observing Olga sleep down below. She takes the occasional sip from her wine, her gaze never moving from her sleeping, growing pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, should I come down for a snack?\" Cameena's left hand rubs at her bulging belly slowly, the idea of tasting some more of that enthralling blood proving a very tempting proposition. \"Mm, but...she's not at her full potential...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, the joys of properly seasoning one's cattle. Sacrificing eager indulgences to increase the potency of the blood's taste. It's annoying, but Cameena loves the end result too much to be truly bothered by the inconvenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...\" Cameena purrs, her belly stroking gaining some energy as she thinks of the delicacy that awaits her. The payoff for her patience. \"Yes, that will do nicely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watches Olga sleep for a while longer before retiring for the night. Cameena is aware she is growing unusually fond of her latest prize, and honestly she doesn't find problem with it. Olga is one beautiful specimen, and her special brand of blood mandates extra care. Of course Cameena feels the need to dote on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, looking at her sleeping form, at ease in her castle, it brings a certain peace of mind to her. Never before have one of her cattle looked so at home in her domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm...\" Olga fidgeted slightly in her seat, partly in response to Cameena's sudden query, and partly because she was subtly adjusting herself in her seat. She was <i>very </i>embarrassed to note her cheeks were on the verge of drooping ever slightly off the chair's edges. \"Just...there's more meat than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena arched a black eyebrow, smiling amusedly. \"So there is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Olga considered making a point on the increased meat, but found she couldn't voice it. \"It's...great! Lamb is my favorite,\" she finished lamely before quickly taking a bite with her silverware. She lost herself to the deliciousness, mewling in pleasure. \"So good...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena smiled, pleased. \"Just a moment, dear,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Olga turned to address her lady, and promptly froze as Cameena's gray, cold finger pressed gently against her lower lip, right at her budding double-chin. She shivered slightly as the chubby immortal dragged her finger up, pulling it back to show the meat juice her finger had collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Cameena purred, pushing her finger into Olga's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde was paralyzed both by having her personal space penetrated and the cold feel of her mistress' finger in her mouth. But she couldn't resist. Meekly, Olga started to suckle on the vampire's finger, her cheeks reddening as she enjoyed licking and sucking off the bits of meat juice clinging to Cameena's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena gave a low, soft moan as she plucked her finger from Olga's lips deliberately slowly. \"How did that taste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Good,\" Olga was feeling very confused. The experience just now had been unnerving and yet...interesting. She wanted to dive back to her meal to drown out these weird sensations. \"Th-Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Cameena said cheekily. \"Aren't I just the best host, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes,\" a feeling of boldness overcame Olga. \"The best M-Mistress...!\" She meant it mostly to keep the bloodsucker pleased. The happier Cameena was, the more good things would be for Olga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good of you to say,\" Cameena smiled. \"Now eat up. The steaks in particular are supposed to be extra tender with lots of juice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold a moment!\" Cameena had said another day at lunch, stopping Olga just as she was bringing a piece of bread to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What is it, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena reached forward with a knife, stabbing at the plate of butter to collect some, and then slather it on the bread in the blonde's grasp. \"It was lacking in butter. Do add more on all the next slices you consume, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes,\" Olga never questioned Cameena on her strange orders anymore. She'd been doing this for a while now, and she'd learned to just roll with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the chicken?\" Cameena asked next as she sat back in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's eyes brightened as she smiled honestly. \"It's really good! Cooked to perfection, and very tender! I haven't had chicken since...\" she paused, a rueful smile dimpling her cheeks. \"...since I was younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the depressive mood shift in her pet, Cameena took a quick initiative. She took hold of Olga's arm, startling the young human at the cold touch again. Olga let out a strangled noise as Cameena brought her wrist to her cheek, nuzzling at it lovingly. Her face reddened as Cameena turned her chubby wrist to kiss at the veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I am so happy to hear that,\" Cameena said lowly, fangs glinting as her red eyes met with Olga's blue. \"Keep eating, sweetie. You can have as much as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga dived back into her food only too eagerly, once again to bury the surge of conflicting emotions Cameena seemed to have fun triggering in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena, meanwhile, chuckled huskily. <i>Delicious blood and delightfully skittish. I like her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for showing restraint...\" Cameena reprimanded herself thickly as she toddled into her room, her belly full from having just fed on Olga for the night. \"But can I help it? Of course not! She just had to be extraordinarily delicious. And I've been helping make her blood taste even better lately, so I can't help it if I nibble! Ohoho, I am so naughty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lied down on her bed, happy to be off her chubby feet. Her hands rested on her belly as she rubbed at it. \"Hmm, but that is true. She <i>is </i>unusually delicious...\" she mused. \"I daresay she's even tastier than Clara...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, reflecting on the implications of that statement. For a brief moment, the gears were turning in her head for a...particularly nefarious idea. But then she shook her head, dismissing the idea almost as soon as it came. For some reason, turning Olga into...<i>that </i>felt distasteful. Not to mention unworthy of her potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena slapped her belly, staring at the canopy of her bed all the while. \"I will not have her turned into <i>that </i>if I can help it. Her blood is too precious. And rightfully belongs to me. All of her is <b><i>mine</i></b>,\" she swore darkly. \"All mine...\"</span></div></div>",

Honestly, I'd never thought it would gain this much traction. Anyway, just wanted to let you all know how grateful I am. And now, allow me to add another chapter to the story of Olga and Cameena. Hope you all enjoy it!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, when it came to <i>intimate</i> affairs with the livestock her illustrious clan obtains, Cameena usually sustains a mostly professional yet, oftentimes, gluttonous demeanor, especially when it came to her long-term ambitions of acquiring livestock with blood akin to nectar fit for the gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as of late, while she finished feeding on one of the...<i>lesser</i> quality livestock she has acquired, Cameena almost...<i>distant</i>, as if it didn't feel the same as occasionally feeding on Olga's blood. As she slinked back onto the floor, with Thora promptly wrapping her vampiric mistress in a silken dark red robe. the dutiful maid easily noticed her mistress's current behavior, which gave her some subtle hints of concern as she politely asked, \"...Is something the matter, Mistress? You seem...distant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Obviously.\" Cameena huffed, akin to a human enduring a substantial lack of sleep, as Thora casually wrapped the sash around Cameena's body to decently cover her mistress's mostly nude form, obviously noting how the vampiric countess seemed to be just a dab bit heftier than the previous week, and the week before, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, if it is any consolation, Mistress, I am here to assist you.\" Thora boldly stated, like the dutiful servant she was to her dark lady, to which Cameena briefly displayed, surprisingly, a grateful upward curve of her lips then retorted, \"...I greatly appreciate your ever-consistent loyalty, Thora. However...these are circumstances I must overcome solely by my own clawed hands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my Mistress.\" Thora complied, bowing before her mistress of the night, where the loyal maid proceeded to head towards the castle kitchen, most likely to prepare a bountiful feast for Cameena's most favored livestock, thus leaving the vampiric countess to her own machinations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once Thora had disappeared from her sight, Cameena soon reverted back into her seemingly disillusioned state of mind, exhaling a deep sigh whilst she rubbed the bridge of her nose with her left thumb, index finger, and middle finger in some form of frustrated self-contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...By the damnable gods, what is happening with me as of late? It seems that all I can think about is...her. Olga...\"</i> Cameena thought to herself, as she began to slowly pace out of the medieval underbelly of her gothic abode, feeling the recently acquired adipose on her gray-skinned form wobble and jiggle subtly with each forward step. Her thoughts continued, <i>\"And yet, despite my attempts to *blech!* sober up... Why is it that I can't shake these aberrant thoughts from my conscience?\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a paused moment, Cameena looked down at her right hand, and much to her complete surprise...it was shaking a little! Was it in hesitation? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnticipation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...Could it be merely from withdrawal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, it seemed that she seemingly longed for the Forgedotter girl, clearly for some undetermined reasons, as an uncannily strange idea had creeped it's way into her subconscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in her personal quarters, Olga had just finished consuming a hearty breakfast full of sausages, omelets,  and baked scones, as she calmly licked the succulent crumbs and syrup remains from her plump fingers, especially from the meal that Aina had brought up to her personally, obviously out of duty to keep her well-fed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, she slowly felt how utterly stuffed her now protruding belly had become, as the fabric of her newly resized nightgown was starting to become a little snug around the abdominal regions of her physique, which didn't seem to annoy her as much as it used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*sigh* ...I've gotten pretty fat.\"</i> She thought, noting her encroaching boredom. Sure, she felt satisfied with having a full stomach, but even that was slowly losing it's mysticism and charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Maybe a walk around the castle will stave off my boredom.\"</i> Olga continued, where she soon began the now slow arduous task of dismounting herself from the lavishly comfortable confines of her bed, which was made all the more longer due to her now full stomach acting like several sacks of potatoes weighing her down somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet fortunately for her, she was <i>somehow</i> able to pull it off, as she carefully lifted her corpulent self off of the edge of the bed, now standing fully upright, having to cradle her almost painfully full stomach with her left hand to lessen the overstuffed pangs of discomfort in her expanded abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff* huff* Okay, that...was a little harder than I thought--\" Olga said to herself, whose attention was soon abruptly diverted toward the audible sounds of someone entering her room, as both double doors swung open with seemingly relative ease.  Moments later, it was revealed to be none other than...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was still feeling her breakfast digest. \"Is it time for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the moment,\" Thora shook her head. \"The Mistress would like to see you in her room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga blinked, and then stared. She was to go to Cameena's personal quarters? In all her time here, that had never happened. A feeling of unease welled up in the pit of her gut, and she was sure it wasn't from digesting her hearty breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, then,\" Thora indicated towards the door. \"The Mistress does not like to be kept waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had long gotten used to the maid's stiff tone. Granted, the other maids had warmed to her somewhat. Aina was all-business, but she made sure to come across as accommodating, especially when answering whatever questions Olga might have. Phyla seemed to enjoy being helpful in every way she could, be it making sure her bed covers and pillows were clean and comforting, or even willing to sit down and converse if the farm girl had anything on her mind. Even Giovanna was warming to her, the head of the kitchen always taking the time to ask her how she would like her eggs, if the bacon servings were adequate, and if she had enough butter for her bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn general, every other maid in the castle had gotten used to Olga's presence and spoke to her with a degree of familiarity bordering on warmth to make her feel welcome. Not to say Thora <i>wasn't </i>accommodating, no no. She worked hard and was as helpful as her fellow co-workers. She was just a tad blunt, is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why she didn't try to make as much small talk as she usually would with the other maids. Thora did indulge her, but her short answers made it clear she would grow slightly irritated at being forced to converse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she say what this was about?\" Olga asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She only said to bring you to her,\" was all Thora said, eyes forward as she lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga didn't say anything else, instead opting to glance around the grand halls while cradling her belly and arching her back slightly to calm the unease of moving on a full stomach. As they moved along, the passed another pair of maids carrying cloths. The two working maids didn't pause in their walking, but they did look Olga's way for a moment. That was all it took for the two to engage in some light conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the Mistress has summoned her,\" One of the maids whispered to her co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She <i>is </i>coming along quite well,\" the other maid cut her eyes at Olga's figure, making the blonde turn her eyes forward to Thora's back as she self-consciously shrunk a little into her shoulders. \"Her round stomach, and her posture...is she with child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mistress claimed a pregnant maiden? Poor dear.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be just a food baby, however. You know how it works around here for these girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the light--very light, as even during gossip these maids maintained professionalism--giggling that ensued, Olga felt her face flush hot. She brought a hand to her mouth and looked down to conceal her embarrassment, completely ignoring Thora shooting a look at the passing maids that made them go quiet and hurry down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore them,\" Thora spoke up after noticing Olga was still looking down in embarrassment as they continued their trip to Cameena's chambers. \"They don't mean to be mean-spirited. No one would dare insult Lady Cameena's chosen cattle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Olga said, feeling slightly better but still embarrassed that her new size had gotten her mistaken for being pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Thora's tone had a dismissive edge to it. \"As the Mistress' favorite sow, you are expected to be growing. Think of their comments on your size as compliments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat most definitely did not make Olga feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga perked at that, her eyes beholding a set of two grand doors in the center of the hallway. Intricate designs trailed the wood of the doors, lined up with what looked to be golden handles and silver lines. Definitely a set of doors befitting a rich and powerful monarch. Thora opened one of the doors, stepping in first and bowing low to her waist as she made way for Olga to toddle in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have brought her, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, very good Thora,\" Olga heard Cameena's purring voice from within the room. As she stepped in, she took a good look at her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena's room was similar in design to Olga's room, wide space with tall walls and everything. Except it was all at a much, much grander scale in terms of luxury. A red carpet that covered the entire floor. A bed that could accommodate five, possibly ten, people and still leave plenty of room, draped over by purple curtains hanging off the canopy. Massive windows with hanging curtains that lead to a balcony outside. From the corner of her eye Olga spied a set of hanging curtains that lead to a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, similar to her room, but naturally Cameena's was at a much grander scale. She wondered if this was similar to how royals lived in Adinah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, my most prized cow!\" Cameena cooed, stepping forward to bounce bellies with the human girl and plant her hands on her shoulders. \"I take it breakfast was satisfactory?\" She made a slight rearing back and then thrusting forward motion, coyly bumping her gut against Olga's slightly bigger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga blushed as she felt her flesh jiggle ever so slightly in tune to Cameena's own flab at the forced collision. \"Y-Yes, Mistress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Cameena's hand fell down to caress at the swell of Olga's belly, lightly poking it with her finger. \"Yes, you are coming along quite nicely. Why, the effort it's taking me to hold myself back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga blanched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop, I'm only kidding darling!\" Cameena laughed, patting the terrified girl on the cheek. \"Although...only just.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing important,\" Cameena said dismissively as she snaked an arm around Olga's shoulders, guiding her deeper into her room, by the bed. \"Now then, on to business. Please, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed Olga down a little to eagerly on her bed, and the former barmaid at once felt like a dirty intruder. Was it really alright for her to sit so casually on her mistress' bed? To ruffle the neatly arranged covers so brazenly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has come to my attention that you often request my maids read to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Olga felt like she was in the center of a town, everyone pointing a finger to her as she was caught taking bread from a baker's stand. She tried to say something, but the only sound that came out was a broken stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush now,\" Cameena said distastefully, hands on her broad hips. \"You haven't done anything wrong. I merely want to know if books fascinate you so because I could arrange to have several sent down to your quarters if it's a hobby you love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I like books,\" Olga started softly. \"It's...a good way to pass the time, and....\" she hung her head. \"....I can't read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena stared at her in a curious manner, wondering why it pained her precious cattle to admit such a trifle problem. \"And do you wish to learn how to read?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Olga snapped her head to look at the immortal. \"I, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena watched as the fattened farm girl fidgeted, and mused on the benefits herself. The taste of human blood is determined by many factors. And Olga already had a unique blood quality that made hers particularly delicious even before being as fat as she is now. The Lady of the Castle wondered if adding literature knowledge to her already unique being would enhance her flavor slightly. It wouldn't be same as the flavor from her eating lots of succulent meals, but experimenting with taste is always a welcome event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena was brought out of her musings by the blonde sitting on her bed. She looked her over, from every inch of that new chubby body of hers to her blonde hair and distinctly pretty blue eyes. Something seemed to wash over her being then. A sense of pity mixed with fondness. Of all her acquired cattle over the years, Olga really was more special than any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow why she thought that, she didn't know. Maybe it was out of sense of being a good master. Olga had done good adjusting to living in the castle and eating as was required of her. That had to be it. Cameena felt a need to reward such a good, loyal calf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's something you truly want, I will grant it,\" Cameena said after a moment, earning a surprised look from the human. \"You don't need to fear overstepping your bounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga just stared at her with those big blue eyes of hers. Cameena stared back with indifference, yet couldn't deny the tiny bit of a fond smile dimpling her cheeks ever so slightly. It gave Olga the courage to proceed.</span></div></div>",

What you truly want is of your choosing.\" Cameena softly spoke, as her fingers curled up upon Olga's hand, gently gripping it with ease, which ultimately culminated in the exact words that the vampiric noble was expecting to hear, as Olga exhaled a calming breath and inevitably answered, \"...Yes. I...I-I would love to learn how to read, Mistress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, a curved smile appeared upon Cameena's blood red lips, to which she then promptly yet soothingly retorted, \"An excellent choice, dear Olga. And please...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as if intentionally unexpected, Cameena leaned close to Olga's right ear and hushly whispered in a seductively soothing tone and said, \"...Call me Lady Cameena~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if time had seemingly stopped for the young Forgedotter, as (much to her utter surprise) her fuller cheeks began to...blush? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she had to be feeling a little under the weather. She had to be! Why would she show such expressions to her jailer and captor? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut such thoughts were unable to linger for long, as Cameena then stood up from the lavish bed, clapped her nailed hands twice or thrice, which prompted Aina to proceed inside, bowing before her mistress then flatly asked, \"How may I assist you, Mistress?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aina? Would please be a dear and escort Olga here to my personal library? It seems our <i>guest</i> is long overdue for some proper education.\" Cameena calmly ordered, speaking with the same regal yet soothing tone she always used, to which Aina voluntarily obeyed her vampiric mistress's orders, as the maid proceeded to escort the rotund Olga out of Cameena's private quarters and towards a new destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once the two individuals had finally disappeared from her view, Cameena slovenly slumped back down onto her bed in some sense of relief...to an extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, she momentarily examined the hand she used to grip Olga's own, and found a rather intriguing revelation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all her decades to centuries as an immortal vampire of the illustrious Stranken Family, Cameena Stranken...her hand was legitimately shaking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it from eagerness to sink her teeth into her newly chosen cattle? Was it from the stimuli of being so enthralled with molding and developing Olga's addictively succulent crimson nectar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...Was it something more. Something...primal,  something...Human? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Cameena attempted to shake off such humane thoughts. She was a vampire! A child of the night! She was above such sentiments from a lesser race!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...As she closely examined her mildly shivering hand with fervent curiosity, she couldn't help but be aware of the lingering warmth from gently grasping Olga's hand, which oddly wasn't as painful as she would've expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this...what falling in love feels like?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She merely stood there, bemused at the show being put on for her. Even the townsfolk ushered their eyes away, fearful of what may happen to Olga now that she had gone against the agreement that the Racovanian settlers held with the vampires, and saddened by their inability to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, my young friend, have made a grave mistake.\" Cameena arched her eyebrows as her smile turned sickly, \"My people protect your kind so that you may prosper\u2014but make no mistake, I <i>will</i> kill you if you continue to literally stand between me and my next meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olga, settle down.\" Tora whispered, \"Somehow I don't think she's playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't...\" Olga shuddered as Cameena removed her sister from beneath her, \"I can't lose you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tora?\" Olga cried out, \"<i>Tora</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be brave, Olga!\" the older Forgedotter shouted as Olga was ushered to her coach, \"...Be brave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No no no no.

Her older sister gave a sad little smile of false reassurance, her crop of blonde hair matted down by the deluge, as she was ushered inside by one of Cameena's servants.

It was a long dress maid of thick material. It covered her legs up to her ankles and her arms all the way down to her elbow. It was a bit tight around the chest, even moreso once she had tied on her apron. Her old clothes were taken to a small room with a cot and a nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the unexpected part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop dragging your feet.\" came the husky voice of a woman about her sister's age, with cropped black hair and a sense of duty about her, \"The mistress wants Supper to be ready by the hour\u2014we've got five minutes to make our entrance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had been getting kicked around by servants since she set foot in the door. They were a terribly insistent lot, making her change her clothes and shuffling her into the kitchen. No one would tell her what was going on or what was expected of her. She was just confused! It wasn't like Lady Cameena had told her anything other than what a burden she was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I <u>want</u> you to go to the servant's quarters.\"</i> Lady Cameena had barked over the sound of the rain, <i>\"Put on your uniform. My maids will instruct you from there.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Olga found herself more confused than ever. Why was a vampire preparing such lavish meals? They weren't supposed to be able to eat... were they? And <i>so</i> much of it. Lady Cameena seemed plush, but reasonably so. She was a woman of wealth, so naturally she'd be a bit fuller figured, right? But the amount of food readied for delivery into the dining hall... it was insane! Enough to feed an army, let alone one woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho were these women? Vampires? Humans? Where was her sister? And <i>why</i> weren't they already dead yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2014\" a platter was placed in Olga's hands by (whom she assumed to be) the head maid. It had an entire turkey on it, cooked to perfection, \"\u2014don't drop it. Walk in pace with the one in front of you. Put it directly\u2014<i>directly</i> in front of Her Darkness's guest and then stand to the side. Don't speak unless spoken to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What?\" Olga stammered, \"Gods this thing's heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" the maid said, \"Alright everyone, Lady Cameena is expecting flourish tonight\u2014on my mark, move into the dining hall for presentation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Olga could process what was going on, lost in thought as the confusion of the day overcame her, the backs of her shoes were getting stepped on as the maid behind her moved forward. She stumbled, but caught herself and the tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most important question of them all... what had she gotten herself into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grand Dining Hall wasn't at all like Olga had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no blood, for starters. Everything was very tastefully decorated. Sure it was <i>gaudy</i>, but that was according to the tastes of a poor smithee's daughter. There were a lot of brass trimmings. Huge portraits hung along the walls of the hall, the biggest and most stunning was of Lady Cameena herself, seated at the head. One long table traced the radius of the room. It could have seated twenty... <i>thirty</i> people with no trouble. With such a huge waitstaff, how often did this room get filled to the brim with thirsty blood suckers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga could hardly posit the time it took to wonder as she was shuffled along in line. Her uniform was uncomfortable, and a little snug. She had to take steps far bigger than she was accustomed to, so as to keep up with the strangely enthusiastic maids at Lady Cameena's beck and call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this to be her life now? Waiting on some vampire hand and foot, like the rest of these women?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach maid delivered their plate to the head of the table. Hams, fish, turkeys, stews, breads, all were placed artfully and carefully within reach of the grand seats at the tip of the table. Olga had never <i>seen</i> so much food. It looked so delicious\u2014what in Yndyre could a vampire want with all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as she got closer, Olga got her answer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Tora, sitting next to her! She had been all prettied up, decked out in an elegant green dress that had to have belonged to Cameena (once upon a time, anyway) and she had been made up to look anything like the tomboyish girl who toiled at the fires every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the longer Olga stared, and the closer Olga got to delivering her heavy platter, the more she noticed something was... <i>off</i> about her older sister...</span></div></div>",

For the first time in her life, she was alone. Her mother was gone, her father had passed, and now her sister had been spirited away from her by some horrible... <i>thing</i> who was going to feast on her blood. The last of her kin had been taken from her, and it left the once bubbly bar maid feeling more than a little hollow inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there on her knees for a while, alternating between eerie silence and uncontrolled sobbing. The townsfolk of Racovania pitied her, but knew all too well the pain of losing someone close to them to those Strankens up the mountain. So one by one, the townsfolk flitted away into their homes\u2014contented that it wasn't <i>their</i> who had been taken, or <i>their</i> daughter, their kin or otherwise who had been abducted without provocation. The ring of condolences surrounding Olga slowly dissipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was lost in herself. Her mind racing, but blank. The hows and whys weren't important. She was beyond rational thought by this point; ruled entirely by her emotions as they raged and stormed inside of her. The poor thing might have honestly snapped, and no one would have blamed her if she had. She wasn't nearly as strong as her sister had been, taking charge of the family when both their parents died. Everyone knew that. Olga knew that. The only recurring, comprehensible thought that echoed in her mind was <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do I do now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as if to answer her question, a blanket was draped over her shoulders. Her eyes widened in confusion and fear as strong hands wrapped themselves around her. Soft flesh enveloped her back as the familiar scent of stew and mead embraced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now, blue eyes. Come on.\" Came the friendly sound of Helga's thick Racovanian accent, \"Let's get you inside the tavern. You can stay in the spare bedroom\u2014the one we rent out from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she was helped onto her feet, the blanket still draped around her shoulders, as Helga took her inside. She closed down the Tavern\u2014no one was in much spirits to celebrate after such a thick gray cloud rained on their good times anyway\u2014and set Olga up with some hot porridge and a roaring fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now, atta girl.\" Helga said as she sat her down on the bench seat, swathed in the thick blanket like a child, \"You're going to be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like to stay with us, we have an extra room.\" Somaria suggested invitingly as she stroked Olga's back, \"Not much sense in it now that the Inn's repaired\u2014I'm sure Helga wouldn't mind if we let you stay there for a few nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as they stroked her back, petted her and called her blue eyes, Olga knew that her life would never be the same again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not to say that her life was comparatively <i>worse</i> from that point on. Just a bit more different. A little less lonely in some ways, and a lot more in others. Not a day passed where Olga didn't think about her poor sister in the back of that Stranken Carriage, but over the course of the next year the pain she felt in her heart faded with her passing thoughts. The wound would never heal, not completely, but she had found ways to keep herself busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had been forced to sell her home. There was no way that she could keep up the fare on such a land working as a barmaid. It went to a nice family who moved to town with no daughters. They were smithees and looking to set up shop in Racovania. Olga felt guilty every time she saw her home under the care of another family\u2014she tried not to go that way too terribly often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the gold she had earned by selling her family's homestead, she had permanently settled into the spare room in the Bleakfrost Tavern. Helga regularly charged her rent at a decent rate, and she got to keep whatever she made from working at the bar. It was a busy life\u2014something that turned out to work rather well for Olga in light of recent tragedies. She could pour herself into her work, and that helped her deal with losing her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy at first. For the first week, Olga hadn't gotten out of bed. And for a while after she wasn't quite \"herself\" (if she ever could truly be that again.) the patrons were kind to her, mostly, and gave her generous tips. It wasn't too terribly long after, though, that she was back to at least keeping up the illusion of herself. Some nights were harder than others, even a full year after Tora had been taken, but Olga survived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd night after night, she became a little bit more \"herself\" than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that time, Helga and Somaria had come to be like a sort of surrogate family to her. They had taken her in when she needed them, she and Helga lived together, and Somaria was always there for her with advice when Helga was being especially demanding. Having them around helped ease that tide of loneliness that rose and fell within her heart. Since all three worked at the Tavern and two of them were roommates (Somaria lived very close anyway, in a small one-bedroom home near the Tavern) so the three of them grew quite close. Despite the bickering and the teasing, Helga and Somaria obviously cared for Olga\u2014a sentiment which she shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a weird way, it almost felt like Olga had parents again. It wasn't the same of course, but... it had helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, one of the best pieces of advice that had gotten Olga through her recent string of tragedies had come from Helga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to keep your mind occupied, blue eyes.\" Helga had said one day, early on, \"When you're not at work, all you do is sit in your room. You need to go out. Or at least get a hobby or something. It'll help... trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had neglected to pry further into Helga's expertise on the matter, partially because it seemed personal and otherwise because that particular piece of advice had come at a time when she just wasn't ready to open up to anyone yet, but she had taken it to heart. It wasn't long before she had found herself a hobby to do after her time at the Tavern was spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly it was this that had kept her going. Helga was right, in so many more ways than one! It had given her confidence, she was learning a new skill, and every time she made a major breakthrough, Olga would feel over the moon! It made her happy to know that if her older sister could have seen her, and how much she had grown since Tora had been taken from her, she'd be proud of how far she'd come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut truth be told, in all of her lifetime, Olga had never seen herself actually learning how to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But truth be told, in all of her lifetime, Olga had never seen herself actually learning how to cook\u2014and she never could have imagined that she'd be so good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one would have really considered Olga the \"creative\" type, so to say. When they were girls, Tora was always the one who picked the games that they played in the streets or around the house, and she had never really had much talent for painting or sketching like her mother had. Meanwhile her father, and eventually Tora, showed such a passion and tendency towards smithing and forging that Olga might have sworn up and down that they were born from the very coals that they used if she hadn't known better. Olga had never really given much thought to cultivating her own creative interests, even when she was left in the stead of her sister. There was gold to be made and tables to serve\u2014Olga had no time for foolishness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that she didn't have a sister to look after, or parents to help, Olga's time was almost exclusively open. When she wasn't busing tables and delivering meals to hungry customers, refilling mugs and mopping up spilled mead, Olga had nothing to do <i>but</i> find herself. And now that she lived in the Tavern with Helga, she had to find <i>something</i> to keep her mind occupied and to distract herself that she wasn't living in her home of eighteen years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one night, Somaria had asked for her help in the kitchen. It was an especially busy night\u2014a troupe of minstrels had wandered into Racovania unannounced and kept the town up far into the night\u2014and, despite her inherit clumsiness around the kitchen, she offered to help the poor overworked woman. What began as paced tips and orders barked over steaming pots at the haste of hungry customers gradually became actual lessons. As the night wore on and the bards tired, Somaria's fires cooled and she took the time to teach Olga her way around the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meats were kept there, the salt there, this was the spice rack, this was how to make stew...Just a precaution, really. In case Somaria ever got sick, <i>someone</i> needed to know how to cook for the Tavern\u2014it'd go out of business!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a couple more nights, Olga found herself bored, and Somaria found herself in the teaching sort of mood. Soon Olga was learning how to make dishes and soups, what to put where in order to make her meal scrumptious and inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Olga was in the kitchen almost every night for a study session with Somaria! She would spend up to two hours after she hung up her apron taking notes and experimenting with the firepit. Sometimes she'd make sauces to be drizzled on the meat, sometimes she'd cook the meat, and sometimes Somaria would let her bake the sweet rolls. And with every passing day, it seemed, Olga came closer and closer to matching Somaria's years of practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly, she <i>liked</i> to cook. It took her mind off of more recent troubles. Olga could throw herself into the kitchen, and walk out with her head held high and a deserved sense of accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this how her father would feel after forging a sword or armor? Is this how Tora felt when she took over their forge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought would sometimes bring a little tear to her eye as she carried this treat or that into the dining area of the tavern, much to the applause of whomever she happened to be waiting on. More often than not it was Helga\u2014most of her \"experimenting\" came to fruition after hours, when only Helga remained\u2014but even the taverners had taken a shine to her cooking. It meant a lot, knowing that so many people thought her skills were coming along so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a night like any other in Bleakfrost Tavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had just finished preparing a hearty plate of sweet rolls as practice for the upcoming festivities. These would keep until the morning, and would make fine appetizers for the Racovanian Festival. She would place them in the pantry to keep, that way they'd be safe from Helga's greedy fingers. Not that Olga could blame the tubby tavern keeper\u2014her cooking really <i>was</i> coming along nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncidentally, Olga would have to make a mental note to go by the dressmaker's shop a little further into town. And to stop sampling from her own wares, unless she wanted to pop out of her dress in the middle of the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe many hours in the kitchen, surrounded by all that wonderful food and privvy to popping little bits of this and that into her mouth to taste, Olga wasn't quite as lithe as she used to be. All her frequent snacking had put some extra padding along the edges of her figure; her bust was bigger and her hips were wider. Between them, a soft little tummy was developing as a slight curve outwards. It was nothing serious\u2014in fact, most of the barflys had barely noticed it. But it was a little troubling to know that her dress from <i>last</i> year's festival that she had bought before Tora had been...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she hadn't <i>worn</i> it last year. Maybe it was tight then too, and she just didn't know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga shook those thoughts out of her head. She had a big day tomorrow\u2014and was getting paid as such. She'd be working all night in the Tavern, but in the kitchen. Helga had Greta and Claris (her newest, youngest and prettiest barmaids) picking up Olga's slack while she worked alongside Somaria at the fires. She couldn't afford to let herself get down now, when she was going to be working from nine til well into the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga opened the door to place her tray of sweetrolls into the pantry, a second set of hinges squeaked behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga whipped around, the kitchen door opening to reveal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Aye, blue eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga breathed a sigh of relief. It was just Helga in the doorway; she must not have heard her heavy footsteps, or the floorboards below her squealing at her girth. How a woman of that size had snuck up on her, Olga would never know\u2014she really <i>was</i> thinking too hard about Tora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time it had taken Olga to realize her passion and calling for the kitchen, Helga had become twice the woman in weight that she had been before she had taken Olga in. Perhaps it was a consequence of having two talented chefs at her beck and call, or perhaps it was Olga's fault for being a bit too insistent that she tell her how she had done on this dish or that, but regardless of the reason, Helga the Taverner had become very large indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long brown hair fell over her heavy shoulders, rolling and cascading like a river of chocolate past her chubby cheeks and resting onto her heaving chest. She was breathing hard, no doubt from toddling all the way from her room to the Tavern's larder. How often, Olga wondered, did Helga make such a trip in order to get so large? Olga definitely wasn't feeding her <i>that</i> much extra. And Somaria was always insistent that Helga stop eating so much recently, so it wasn't her fault either. Where had that big belly come from? It was bigger around now than almost anyone, short of that Orc who hung out at the Inn, could reach. It fell into two distinct rolls, outlined by the tautness of her dress and even her aprons. Her arms were thick and wide, much like her legs. It had gotten to the point where Helga rarely dismissed herself from behind the bar due to her colossal hips and overly broad bum getting stuck fast in the space between it and the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helga!\" Olga exclaimed, her chest pounding, \"You nearly scared me to Damus and back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize!\" Helga said, her accent as thick and rolling as her waistline, \"I knew you were poking around back here, practicing for tomorrow. I just wanted to see you to bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Olga put her hands on her hips wisely, \"You can't fool me, you sneakthief. You were going to walk me to my room and then thunder back here to raid the pantry again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not!\" Helga's round cheeks grew flush and hot, \"Th-The thought that I would sabotage my own business with my own heedless snacking is ridiculous. You've been hanging around Somaria too much, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving both Somaria and Olga around, both constantly creating treats and snacks that were off-menu and tantalizing to the taste, had certainly not done well for Helga. She had gotten so greedy and round, seemingly unable to go one day without a feast fit for the royalty of Adinah. Her weight had been the talk of the town lately. In a town where not much happening, a barmaid blowing up to twice her size in less than a year made for ready gossip, after all. The way she walked with her back arched, or how she stroked her gut greedily even in conversation, some had thought she was pregnant. Some still thought she was\u2014perhaps with an Orc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that habitual stroking of her stomach told Olga that she was much more right than wrong. Even as she denied it, Helga couldn't keep her eyes off of the pantry. Her pink lips wetted as her breathing became husky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe just a little.\" Helga rescinded, \"I can't be helped for sampling my own wares, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to bed, Helga.\" Olga chuckled, \"I'll be done soon\u2014don't want to nod off during all the partying I'll be doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had better be partying in my kitchen.\" Helga put her chubby hands on her wide hips, the change in stance making her belly bob menacingly in front of her, \"You didn't make any plans tomorrow, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, I was joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Helga softened, \"But I didn't just come up here to chide you like an old nag. <i>Or</i> to get your guard down so I could raid my pantry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Olga piqued, her blue eyes wide with wonder, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Helga purred... </span></div></div>",

Say what you want about the tremendous taverner, but at least she could take a joke. If anyone had pointed out Olga's recent, and comparatively tiny, weight gain like that she might have broken down into tears. But Helga's great gut wobbled and shook with mirth, her double chins quivering as she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good!\" Olga settled, her cheeks rosy, \"I'm happy to know that my lessons with Ms. Somaria haven't been a complete waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk like that, blue eyes.\" Helga said with joyful reassurance, taking a couple of heavy steps forward so that she was completely in the room, \"You've been making me a lot of money since I brought you in. It's like you're my little golden hair good luck charm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, it was comments like <i>that</i> that made Olga feel appreciated. Wanted. Maybe even loved. She had to get used to not having a family for the past year, but no one other than Helga and Somaria could have made the transition so much easier than it had already been. Between Helga being so generous and Somaria teaching her so much, Olga had fit right into the tavern lifestyle. Even the other barmaids were beginning to become like family to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sweet, old woman.\" Olga said with a smile, a bit more somber than the last one, \"Thanks for letting me play around in your kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\" Helga said triumphantly, \"In fact, I bring it all up because I really need you to bring your best to the table tomorrow. We're expecting visitors to this years Racovanian festival, and I can't have you slacking off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisitors? To Racovania? That almost never happened. Even with the festival being a big deal, the most \"exotic\" they got around here were the miners who lived further up north in the Peaks visiting home for the day. No one dared venture into Vampire Country. Even if they tended to stay to themselves, those bloodsuckers up the mountain had put quite a reputation on this place\u2014one that kept away a lot of potential business!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Visitors?\" Olga repeated, closing the pantry door, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I say \"visitors\"... but what I <i>should</i> say is something like \"foreign dignitaries\".

Living a relatively sheltered life in Racovania, she'd never had to deal with many reptiles. And the ones that she had were small, manageable. Decidedly less humanoid than any Naga that she'd ever heard of. They lived in the Southern region of Yndyre, a far cry from the icy region that Olga had called home all of her life. How could anyone be so excited to hear that the queen of those slithering serpents was coming to rain down scales on their little festival?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, how had she even heard of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... great!\" Olga said with a smile that she hoped didn't seem <i>too</i> forced, \"Just... <i>great</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn straight it's great.\" Helga said in her thick accent, \"Having someone of Queen Coatzintli's status at our festival is about as big a celebration as we get here up in these mountains\u2014can you imagine, a whole city of them snake people gabbin' about what a good time we showed them up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Olga cringed, \"That'd sure be swell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd send their dignitaries our way when they were in the area, we'd make so much more money\u2014\" Helga's fat face began to flush, \"Oi, look at me... I'm getting myself worked up over it already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that a distinctive sound emanated from the other side of the room. Helga's gut growled urgently, commanding to be fed in order to ease her appetite. Whenever she got herself worked up like this, Helga had taken to eating. Exciting news called for a leg of lamb, and maybe a few pies to go around the bar after all. She had been in such good spirits since Olga had started helping out, it was no wonder Helga had gotten so large. What with staying leaned up against the bar, as she was now with her belly oozing over the countertop like that, Helga probably got more exercise working herself up than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Olga couldn't have been less enthused. She wasn't racist but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she'd never <i>met</i> one of these snake people before.

Olga closed the pantry (making sure that Helga was in no way close to the yummy contents inside!) and hurried off to bed. She <i>did</i> have a big day tomorrow, snake people or not.

There were drapes, attractions, food-stalls lining the roads; it was amazing watching this normally dreary rather dower hamlet suddenly spring to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was on a short break, and using it well. The barmaid-turned-chef was exploring all the local sights, taking in every sight and smell around. As blonde lass took in an extra large breath she smelled something\u2026new. It was an odd scent, like the earth after heavy rain, but much stronger. As she turned around that breath was lost as Olga opened her mouth in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising above, and parting, the crowd was what appeared to be a large palanquin. The massive dais was covered in rich bright green foliage (that explained the rich earthy smell); as it approached Olga caught a glimpse of four large burly men that were lifting the stone and wood construct, they were wearing only some kind of toga made from heavy scales and their muscles were well oiled. But the oddest sight was just who it was that sat upon this portable throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Olga mistook the person for a human woman, but a second glance brushed that thought to the back of her mind. The figure lounging back had brown skin with black stripes above her waist, while below a thick heavy green tail (also with black stripes) coiled itself neatly like a spring. The figure was clearly female, with a pair of very imposing breasts and no less than four lithe arms; two of which were waving to the crowd while the others roved lower\u2026to a gigantic belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had been around quite a few years and she knew pregnancy when she saw it, but this serpentine woman looked more heavily pregnant than several woman put together! The serpent\u2019s girth did not seem to distress her though, her thin face with its lacking nose looked calm and serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaid continued to stare even as the palanquin passed her by. Finally shaking herself out of her trance Olga realized the time, her break must surely be up and the customers must be famished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiving back through the crowd and winding through some shortcut alleyways, Olga ran back to the Bleakfrost Tavern as fast as her long legs would carry her. Carefully she slipped through the tradesman\u2019s entrance and began to slip her apron on just as Ms Somaria spotted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlga! Where have you been!\u201d The older woman hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry\u2026\u201d Olga sheepishly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time for ya sorry\u2019s girl, you wouldn\u2019t believe who just came in!\u201d And with a beckoning finger, Somaria called Olga over to take a peek through a crack in the kitchen door. Olga\u2019s eyes widened again as she saw the four burly men from before, standing with their arms crossed and acting as a wall of muscle between the other patrons and one very BIG customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had not seen the Naga queen next to another person, but she never realized just how BIG the woman was! Had she been a human this green and brown-skinned queen would easily have been eight feet tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s asked for more food than we have prepared!\u201d Somaria explained, \u201cWe are going to need some of your magic touch here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Olga set to work, employing all her skill and technique she had learned since her sister\u2019s abduction to cook up a storm. Each dish barely lasted a second before it was sent off disappear down the snake queen\u2019s gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed and still Olga cooked, how much could this woman <i>eat</i>!? Just as the blonde woman felt like she was going to pass out from exhaustion Somaria returned to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind taking this last one to her?\u201d She asked; \u201cMy old leg is acting up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Olga replied, half in a haze as she took what must have been an entire cake and wandered out. As Olga approached the guards they parted in one motion to reveal Coatzintli, the queen of the naga\u2019s and lady of the Motee Marshes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, divine!\u201d The snake-woman cooed as she dropped a fork to her plate, her forked tongue licking her lips. It was then that she noticed the much smaller woman\u2019s presence. \u201cAh! You there! I asked to see the cook of these fabulous dishes\u2026is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga stood stunned for a second, dam she had been tricked. Somaria must have sensed she was nervous earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes your majesty.\u201d Olga replied, trying to bow whilst still holding on to the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must congratulate you.\u201d The queen replied as she snapped her fingers and nodded to one of the guards, who took the cake and placed it at the queen\u2019s table; without wasting a second she began to dig in. Queen Coatzintli was certainly ravenous that was for sure, but she was sure dainty about it. Every swift twirl of her fork was elegant and never spilled a drop onto the masses of gold that covered her gravid figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy was she looking round! Olga didn\u2019t know that naga\u2019s had super-stretchy skin, otherwise there was no way Coatzintli could have demolished the food stores of an entire tavern by herself. But she sure looked like she had; the queen\u2019s belly was carefully placed under her table, swelling out and downwards until her soft brown skin was just touching the wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, exquisite, another perfect dish! I must say ever since I started being ready to spawn nobody has tickled my taste quite like you have\u2026I do look forward to eating here every day, but it would pain me to leave such delicious food.\u201d As another forkful of cake disappeared between her sharp teeth the queen\u2019s eyes were the ones to bug. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d the stated firmly, turning her gaze for the first time to meet Olga\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gulped, her majesty\u2019s eyes were yellow with a black slit running vertically trough them, they seemed to pierce into her very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo they pay you well here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was caught unawares by that. \u201cUhhhh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a yes or a no? Because if not I can offer you a very\u2026handsome salary. My kitchen staff no not how to cook like this, and I would adore for your cooking to be available to me at any day or time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey uh\u2026pay me enough here\u2026\u201d Olga replied a little more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a shame\u2026because I AM a queen you know\u2026I can pay any price you want; do you desire richs? I have gold, jewels\u2026or is it romance you seek? I can offer one of my naga subjects as a bride if you so wish...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga felt like she had a frog in her throat, go and work for a QUEEN? How could she respond to that!?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, Olga wanted to blatantly refuse such a temptatious offer, considering that she still needed to rescue her sister from the vampiric Stranken Family. But on the other hand though, she was being given the offer to work for a Queen. A Queen! One could swear her mind would blow a fuse or two upon thinking of what her ultimate decision should be. However, Queen Coatzintli soon queried once more toward the chubby chef and said, \"So, my dear... What is your decision?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga yelped nervously, swiftly turning her plump form to face the Naga Queen, where she hesitantly replied, \"...Y-Yes! O-Of course I will work for you, y-your majesty!\" Suffice to say, said frog in her throat made her croak aloud and unintentionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, in response to such an answer, Queen Coatzintli soon but sluggishly rose up from her lounged position, her pregnant-esque belly straddling against the front scales on her serpentine lower half. From there, she calmly slithered toward the plump Olga, where Coatzintli then grasped both of Olga's chubby hands, expressing a gleeful fanged grin on her brown-skinned face and said, \"Tell me: What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's, um... O-Olga. Olga Forgedotter, y-your highness,\" Olga nervously answered, her somewhat cherubic face blushing profusely, considering that she honestly wasn't expecting to be holding hands with royalty today. And yet, here she was, holding hands with Naga royalty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, Olga Forgedotter... You are quite lucky and skilled for a Human. I am looking quite forward to your culinary mastery when we return to the Motee Marshes in the South.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, moments later, just as the Naga Queen was slithering back towards her lounge area, Olga's mind began to race once more, wondering what she should do now. That was, until an idea popped into her head, as she instinctively blared out, \"A-Actually, um... T-There is something you can do for me, your highness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such a query, Coatzintli then turned around to confront the tubby human female and questioned, \"Oh? And what exactly do you have in mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga nervously fidgeted with her chubby hands a little, her eyes darting from left to right slightly as she hesitantly retorted, \"...It's...I-It's my dear sister, Tora, she... *sob* ...She was taken from me by the Strankens. I-If you could possibly negotiate for her release, I'll... I'll, um... Please! I'll do anything for you if you free my sister!!\" And just like that, Olga began to mentally break down, worried day and night over the fate of her older sister at the deathly hands of Cameena Stranken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Coatzintli felt a little embarrassed watching Olga bawl like an infant over the loss of the human's sibling. And yet, despite such an depressive outburst from the female chef, the Naga Queen couldn't help but feel a twinge of sympathy towards Olga's familial plight. It almost reminded Coatzintli of an event many moons ago when her beloved wife and childhood friend, Patli, was injured when they were younglings. Suffice to say, Olga's plight was certainly pulling one or two of Coatzintli's heartstrings. After all, it seemed it would be in her best interest to keep her new chef quite happy if she managed to negotiate for Tora's release and freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a full long minute of hearing Olga sobbing like a lost child, Coatzintli then approached the distressed female human, placing a hand upon the human's shoulder out of calm reassurance and answered, \"I see you have endured much hardship, Olga Forgedotter. Fortunately, I am a benevolent leader of my people. So, out of sympathy for your plight, I will see if I can grant your sister freedom from her vampiric captors.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the words from Coatzintli's forked tongue, Olga swiftly wrapped her chubby arms around the Naga Queens bulbous fertile stomach while she yelped, \"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!\" Of course, such physical contact with the Naga Queen didn't exactly sit well with her entourage, as they began to maliciously leer towards Olga to intimidate her, but Coatzintli successfully persuaded them to back off some, considering how much of a fragile state Olga was currently in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Coatzintli gently placed a hand on Olga's cherubic face, leaning the human's head upwards to face the Naga Queen, where Olga still had a few tears streamjjng down her somewhat chubby cheeks. From there, Coatzintli spoke toward Olga with a clear but commanding tone of voice as she quipped, \"However, there is a certain...condition, you will have to endure if you want my aid in your sister's freedom, my dear Olga.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything. I'll do anything to save my sister, your highness,\" Olga retorted, showing a wave of utter conviction towards rescuing her sibling from the vampire lords of Racovania. Right now, she didn't care if such a condition included becoming a part of a Naga noble's obese harem, or becoming an immobile obese pet or bride to one of the Naga Queen's personal advisors. Overall, she almost didn't care about her own fate at this point, as long as it meant granting her sister freedom from possibly a fate worse than death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a moment or two of silence, Coatzintli spoke toward Olga and said, \"I admire your conviction and bravery, Olga Forgedotter. But as for what the price shall be for your sister's freedom, you will have to become...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...One of my advisors, Quessa, has been quite... let's say 'fascinated,' with your species, with humans...\" Coatzintli explained, divulging on what the price was for her granting Olga's sister freedom from the Strankens. She continued to speak toward the chubby Olga Forgedotter while she slithered toward a nearby window, observing the jagged mountaintops as she explained, \"Now, I am not one to pry into such personal trivial matters that each of my advisors hold dear, unless it involves the safety and well-being of my people, whether they be warrior, farmer, priestess, or noble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....are you saying, your highness?\" Olga asked, attempting to steady her rattled nerves while she keenly listened in on every word spewing forth from the Naga Queen's forked tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to such an unavoidable question, Coatzintli calmly turned around to face the plump female chef, all four of her arms positioned behind her back as she retorted, \"What I am saying, Olga Forgedotter, is that if you truly seek my aid in granting Tora her freedom from Racovania's vampiric lords and ladies...you will have to become the bride to my advisor, Quessa. Now, you will still be given the duty of being my personal chef, catering to giving me such addictive...'delicacies.' However...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Coatzintli soon calmly but slowly slithered toward Olga, where she then placed one of her lower arms and hand upon the chubby human's left shoulder, as she continued speaking toward Olga and continued, \"Once we return to our capital city, Vaal Za'haraam, you will be arranged into a marriage with Quessa.\" Obviously, Olga could clearly see that Queen Coatzintli wasn't sugarcoating every detail of what would transpire within the near future of her life, thus allowing the depth of such a price for her sister's freedom to sink in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, deep within the recesses of her subconscious, Olga didn't seem to care that this would be her fate, just as long as her older sister would be free from the Strankens. Right now, she didn't give a damn about her own fate, just Tora's, and nothing else. But, if she was to be betrothed to one of the Queen's advisors...so be it. However, another thought seemed to have crawled it's way into her subconscious, where she soon uncharacteristically but calmly spoke toward the Naga Queen and bluntly replied, \"I don't care about what my fate will be from now on, your highness. Just as long as Tora is safe and free of the Strankens. Nothing more, nothing...less.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly surprised at how determined the chubby female chef seemed to be, Coatzintli then displayed a calm but reassuring smirk, where she then patted Olga on the shoulder twice or thrice then retorted, \"Your determination to save your sibling is quite admirable, Olga Forgedotter. I must admit, I never have thought humans such as yourself would display such bravery and courage in the face of...inevitability.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your highness. But...if I had to ask, what is your...advisor, Quessa, really like? If I am to be her betrothed, at least tell me who she is like to you,\" Olga asked, lowering her head some to show respect toward her superior, despite the racial and species difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the plus-sized female chef, Coatzintli was quite willing to disclose such information to her new personal chef. After all, Olga had undoubtedly proven herself to learn such information, where the Naga Queen slowly yet calmly slithered around Olga in a wide circle, speaking toward the female human as she thoroughly explained, \"Your bravery, courage, and tenacity is commendable, Olga Forgedotter. Thus, you deserve the right to learn of your betrothed. Quessa, she is...'unique,' to say the least. Before I became Queen, she was one of my closest friends, always the optimist. And yet, she was known to have, um...what is it that you human's call something unique to an individual?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quirks?\" Olga said, answering Coatzintli's question, thus allowing the Naga Queen to continue speaking as she continuously explained, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, quirks! Thank you, Olga Forgedotter.  Anyway, she had these, 'quirks,' as you humans would say, which always involved studying and understanding humans. From your kingdoms, to your laws, even your...anatomy. Eventually, shortly after I was coronated, I made her and a few other exceptional Nagas as my council of advisors, with Quessa being Priestess of Knowledge, archiving our civilization's history and lore with extensive proficiency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, even after many moons have passed, her fondness over your species had only increased in ambition and anticipation. It is one of the reasons why I have decided to journey across the lands of Yndyre, from the vast forests of the Pyknos Verge, to the sprawling cities of the Futotta-Machi, even to the snowy mountains of Racovania,\" Coatzintli answered, where she then looked out the window and observed as the sun hid behind the jagged mountaintops and mountain peaks. From there, Coatzintli soon turned her head to look back at Olga once more, where she continued to speak as she explained, \"Overall, my point is, Olga Forgedotter, that if you are worried if Quessa will chain you to a wall and study you like a parasitic disease. Then fret not, she is not a malicious individual. For most of my life, I have known Quessa to be very compassionate towards others. And who knows, Olga Forgedotter? There is a chance you will truly find her as your one and true soul mate. *chuckle*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Olga couldn't help but feel somewhat relieved from Coatzintli's solemn truthful words, even though her biggest priority was to free her sister from the vampiric Strankens and their fortress of a manor. However, shortly after that, Coatzintli then gestured one of her servants to pour a pitcher filled with what appeared to be alcohol into a bronze engraved goblet and a iron beer mug. From there, Coatzintli handed the beer mug to Olga, who swiftly grabbed it, while Coatzintli grabbed the engraved goblet. Obviously, the plump chef spoke toward the Naga Queen and asked, \"Um... Your Highness? What is this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a special brew of my people's famed alcohol. We call it 'Serpen-Kaja.' We usually use this in special ceremonies of romance and fertility. Consider it as a 'consolation gift' to what will be in store for you when we arrive in Vaal-za'haraam,\" Coatzintli elaborated, just as Olga took a good sip of Serpen-Kaja from her mug, feeling the alcohol's tangy but spicy taste, nearly spitting the brew from her mouth due to how intense the flavor was. \"Do not worry, your tongue will become accustomed to it's intensity, Olga Forgedotter,\" Coatzintli replied, just as Olga managed to recover enough to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more as she asked, \"Your Highness, you...you said earlier that you would like me to be your personal chef, but you never gave me a reason for such an offer. Why me? You probably have a small army of cooks dedicated to serving you. Why pick me over them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom listening to Olga's question, Coatzintli understood that the chubby female human wanted to know why the Naga Queen chose her over numerous cooks and chefs in the whole Motee Marshes, which did raise a valid point to the dark-skinned Naga Queen. So, after a sip of Serpen-Kaja from her engraved goblet, Coatzintli then looked back towards the plus-sized female chef, gazing upon her with a pair of serpentine eyes and calmly answered...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why pick a human such as yourself over much of my people's finest culinary artists? *chuckle*\" Coatzintli quipped, chuckling a little over Olga's semblance of curiosity. So in response to such curiosity, Coatzintli casually slithered her way toward the plump female chef, almost to the point where the front scales on the Naga Queen's serpentine lower half was clearly brushing against the front of Olga's outfit and chubby potbelly, as if Coatzintli was almost boasting her physical dominance over the human, as Coatzintli looked down at Olga due to towering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she continued speaking toward Olga and explained, \"Because, Olga Forgedotter... I heard that you are the best cook in all of the villages in Racovania. Plus, I am one for quality over quantity. When I entered the first village of Racovania, some of the humans in the tavern spoke highly of your mouth-watering cuisines and delicacies with great reverence and appraise. Tell me, with your heart...do you truly believe yourself worthy of such appraise, Olga Forgedotter of Bleakfrost Tavern?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, hearing that her still-growing reputation managed to reach the ears of the Naga Queen, Coatzintli of the Motee Marshes, Olga couldn't help but become a little unnerved from such a question. After all, her mentor, Somaria, was the one who truly deserved such praise, not her. After all, she was merely a prodigy, who still had a lot to learn in the culinary arts. So eventually, after five full minutes had passed, Olga proceeded to gulp heavily out of nervousness before she even uttered a word. From there, Olga slowly began to speak toward the dark-skinned Naga Queen, still showing signs of unease as she bluntly answered, \"...I...I-I never truly claimed myself to be THE best cook in all of Racovania. That title...i-it belongs to m-my mentor, Somaria. I-I'm merely a student t-taking lessons from someone m-more experienced than me. B-But I... I can promise you th-this, your highness: I...I put a lot of heart, passion, and soul into every p-plate of food I cook, whether it's a slab of meat or a barrel of mead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga spoke toward her, Coatzintli began to see the truth in the human cook's words, whilst Olga continued to speak as she explained, \"...I-I may not be a true master cook like Somaria, but... I am a swift learner a-and a keen listener. I-If you want a specific m-meal in mind, I-I can make sure it is cooked to your needs and desires. You m-must be pregnant if y-your belly is as big as it is n-now, I-I can make sure you have enough food to feed both you and your hatchlings.\" When Olga was finally finished talking, Coatzintli soaked in every truthful word that came out of the chubby female chef's mouth, as it began to paint a clear enough mural within the Naga Queen's subconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after several long minutes of silence, Coatzintli eventually came to a decision, where she soon began to understand what made Olga Forgedotter such an extraordinary culinary artist. From there, Coatzintli displayed a generous fanged grin, where she then placed all four of her hands upon Olga's rounded shoulders, gently patting them once or twice as she boldly answered, ...I admire the truth and conviction in your words, Olga Forgedotter. You truly have the heart of a Marsh Wolf: honest, tenacious, and unrelenting. You truly have earned my respect. This is why I have chosen you as my personal chef.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, Olga felt like her heart had skipped a beat or two from the tension and suspense. However, she was undoubtedly glad to have earned Queen Coatzintli's respect out of all that has happened to her recently. But in the end, all of this insanity might be worth it if Coatzintli could truly free her sister. So, in response to the Naga Queen's gesture, Olga looked up at Coatzintli with a reassured smile on her cherubic face, where she then spoke toward the dark-skinned Naga and said, \"Thank you, your highness. I'm glad to have earned your respect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine, Olga Forgedotter.\" Coatzintli quipped, where she then looked outside the nearby window and witnessed the skyline darken and fade to black. From there, she soon turned back to face Olga and said, \"Well, it seems it might time for you to head home, Olga Forgedotter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about my sister? You promised to rescue her!\" Olga exclaimed, which soon prompted Coatzintli's bodyguards to brandish their golden spears, thinking that Olga was threatening their queen. However, Coatzintli swiftly gestured her bodyguards to stand down and lower their weapons, which they reluctantly did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Coatzintli placed all four of her hands upon Olga's rounded shoulders once more, staring directly at her, where the dark-skinned Naga Queen then spoke toward the chubby female chef and calmly but sternly answered, \"I have not forgotten what was promised, Olga Forgedotter. We Nagas never break a promised oath.\" Fortunately, this managed to calm Olga down some, as Coatzintli continued speaking toward her as she explained, \"Listen, I greatly understand the concern for your sister, Olga Forgedotter. But right now, I need you to head to your home dwellings and rest. After all, you will need your strength for the journey back to Vaal-Za'haraam. I promise by tomorrow morning, you shall see Tora once more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with little to no other choice, Olga reluctantly complied with Coatzintli's solemn oath, as she huffed out a deep sigh of stress, where she then spoke toward the Naga Queen and replied, \"*sigh*...I understand, your highness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Olga walked toward the coat rack and put on her ramshackled winter coat, ready to head out and return to her home, as she pulled open the wooden door, allowing the cold mountainous air to flow through. However, before she exited the Bleakfrost Tavern, Olga soon turned to look back at Coatzintli then firmly said, \"I'm not leaving my village until my sister's free from Cameena Stranken.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Olga finally left the tavern, closing the door behind her in the process. Moments later, one of Coatzintli's bodyguards approached the Naga Queen, where she then spoke to her and asked, \"Not to be rude, My Queen, but... Are you sure that this is a wise decision? Eviana Stranken and her brood are quite persistent in keeping what they claim to be theirs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am fully aware of their persistence, Shemal. But then again, this isn't my family's first time negotiating with these 'bloodsuckers.' And besides... I have something in my possession that Eviana Stranken herself has been yearning for for five centuries now.\"</span></div></div>",

She was in a very delicate state right now, being in just the early stages of her pregnancy and honestly felt quite frail. Were she at her full strength then Coatlzintli would have felt more confident, in case the vampire decided to pull something during negotiations. She had to play this carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As her dais approached the castle the naga looked up at its pitch-black stonework and tall be\u2014spiked spires with menacing gargoyles. It was a far cry from the golden palaces of her swampy home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached tiny creatures dressed in robes skittered about, opening doors for her entourage and jabbering among themselves as they beckoned. Coatlzintli and her guards were led through a large stone courtyard, into a gigantic set of wrought-iron doors and into a massive hallway. The stone was just as bleak on the inside as the outside, with just red carpeting and drapes to break the color-scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creatures still beckoned though, leading on to a side set of doors almost as large as the first. Inside this room was a long banquet table. Its chairs sat empty, bar one; and relaxing there with a goblet in her hand was the \u201cqueen\u201d of the castle, Carmeena Stranken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did not know I was expecting guests\u2026do what occasion do I owe the pleasure of such royalty in my castle?\u201d The vampire purred before taking a sip from her cup. \u201cI would offer you something to drink\u2026but I just finished a hearty meal and I don\u2019t think the flavour is quite to your\u2026tastes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga queen looked long and hard at the creature sat before her. She had encountered these loathsome bloodsuckers before, but she never remembered any of them being quite so\u2026corpulent. Carmeena Stranken looked absolutely stuffed into her clothes; her corset could actually be heard creaking with each slight movement the vampire made, her face had a clear double chin, her breasts were bulging almost lewdly out of her brassiere and her thick thighs seemed to be almost wrestling with each other. \u201cI see you are looking well.\u201d Coatzintli commented, trying to hide her rather mild touch on the vampire\u2019s girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am here on business.\u201d Coatlzintli stated firmly, rising a little out of her dais as it was placed on the ground. Being the queen of the naga came with some nice perks, like an overall larger frame than the majority of her kind; this gave her an edge when it came to bargaining with anyone smaller than her (which happen to be nearly every race in Yndyre).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBusiness?\u201d Carmeena repeated, twirling one of her long locks of raven-colored hair between two of her gray fingers. \u201cI am not sure what I have that you could want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA girl, human, from the village below.\u201d The naga stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmeena at the statement simply threw her head back. \u201cHohoho! You are going to have to be more specific, I have many girls here and there within my walls.\u201d Composing herself, the vampire continued; \u201cAnyway\u2026what does the great queen of the naga want with a lowly human girl? I can see you are not want for more slaves.\u201d She gestured to the four men that stood by the dais.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlonde hair with blue eyes, she had a sister in the town. And never you mind why I want her, what matters is what I can give you in exchange\u2026\u201d Coatzintli offered, snapping the fingers of one of her upper arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmeena then got a bit sniffy. \u201cI was going to ask; as I do not give up my cattle lightly, even if you\u2026are\u2026\u201d The vampire stuttered as she saw what one of the eunuchs was holding. It was a massive glass container, filed to the brim with red liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli smiled, she had a hook. \u201cI heard that vampires love rare blood, especially from sunny realms they do not wish to visit. And this batch was especially hard to recover\u2026I assume you have never seen tyrannosaur blood before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026never\u2026\u201d Carmeena stuttered, her fangs sinking into her dark-gray lip as she tried to contain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you say, the girl for the blood?\u201d The naga offered, gesturing with her left-two arms at the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire wanted to hold back, to try and get a better deal, but she couldn\u2019t The idea of blood from such a rare and exquisite creature was too much for her; oh the tastes from such a beast must be amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026take her\u2026one of my servants will show you to her room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga smiled again. \u201cGood to do business with you.\u201d She thanked, sliding back onto her dais as one of the eunuchs placed the jar at the far end of the table and joined his fellows as they picked up a corner each and escorted the heavily-laden queen out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother of the little robed imps led the way. It was to a small side-room on the other side of the hall (clearly Carmeena liked keeping her food close by). As the doors opened Coatzintli covered her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Tora, lying on a massive elegant bed while a pair of imps dashed back and forth stuffing food between her lips. She was dressed in a disheveled dress that had probably been elegant once, but was now more tattered food-stained rags than anything else. And her size was shocking as well; Coatzintli was used to seeing big, but Tora looked more than just that, she looked like a wave of lard trying to cover the bed. Tora's face was framed by a big fat ring of a double-chin, her arms were like hams and her belly was trying to overtake her whole lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFood?\u201d She burbled as the imps stopped feeding to see who had entered. Hurriedly they began nattering with the one that had guided Coatzintli inside, and then left the queen alone with Tora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the gods\u2026lower me now!\u201d Coatzintli demanded before slithering over to Tora\u2019s side. The girl was bleary-eyed and looked completely out of it. \u201cShe isn\u2019t well, we need to get her to a physician\u2026put her on my dais!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eunuchs moved as one, taking hold of some part of Tora as they raised her from the bed and onto the leaf-covered carrier. All the while the girl still mumbled about more food and how hungry she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuickly, we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d The queen hissed as she placed her lower hands on her taut belly, before slithering out the door eunuchs\u2019 in-tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga queen muttered to herself that this was an awfully big risk to go through, but the vampires were vile parasites and this would be a blow to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in the dining hall\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh *oomph* so good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmeena had wasted little time in helping herself to the container. The greedy vampire had never been able to restrain her bloodlust very well, certainly not for long periods anyway. She gulped greedily, allowing the blood to flow into her mouth like a waterfall. She could feel her belly press ever so much more against her corset, but she ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh\u2026*urp* that was exquisite\u2026\u201d The vampire remarked to nobody in particular. But as she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand she noticed something odd. Her gray skin had a little\u2026mark on it, the more she looked at it the brighter it seemed. Then there was another one, a dark pink in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen of the night then looked at her arm; the same things were running up it! She was coming out in horribly blotches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly Carmeena felt a pressure in her chest, it was like her corset was trying to choke her! Struggling with the strings, the vamp decided to simply rip it from her person! Big gray boobs bobbed naked in the air, her modesty vanishing into the night as her dark-gray areola jutted outwards like huge plugs. It was then she noticed the problem, her boobs were swelling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmeena cupped her massive mammeries as they grew bigger and bigger, overwhelming her hands like sacks of lard. It was then that she realised she had been duped, and she let out an unearthly screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAARGH!\u201d She roared, \u201cCow\u2019s blood!? I hate cow\u2019s blood! It goes right to my tits! Ugh!\u201d Carmeena was furious that she had been had; the vampire thought to giving chase\u2026but what if one of the other vampires or Eviana saw or heard her? She would be the laughing stock of the clan if that happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing to herself, Carmeena tried to hug her swelling boobs to her chest, begging that the growth would stop soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTora! Oh gods what has been done to her?\u201d Olga was in tears, she had her sister back, but the state she was in was horrible. \u201cPlease..\u201d she sniveled, turning to the queen, \u201cYou have to help her!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the fact that Olga's sister was now out of reach from Cameena's gluttonous fingers, even Coatzintli felt disgusted towards how the sibling of her new personal chef was being treated within the walls of Cameena's gothic castle, rendered into becoming nothing more than a living feedbag to the bloodsuckers. And yet, out of all of them, it just had to be the gluttonous one of all, Cameena Stranken. In a way, it almost made the Naga Queen lose her composure and vomit the food within her stomach. Either way, the deed was done, and now all that remained...was how to aid the fattened sister of Olga Forgedotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Coatzintli slithered toward the distressed Olga, placing both her right hands upon one of Olga's chubby shoulders, where she then spoke toward the distressed female chef and asked, \"Are there any physicians who can aid your sister here in your village?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...N-No, your highness! The Strankens took all of the healers and physicians in every village across Racovania. Th-They needed them for...something. I-I'm not sure why they needed them,\" Olga replied, stuttering a little from how distraught she was from seeing her older sister in such a fattened yet fragile state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Coatzintli now realized what the vampires needed from the healers and physicians: They needed such individuals to keep the humans they've fattened up healthy, as well as making sure their blood was sweet and delectable. Overall, what Tora was forced to endure was undoubtedly a fate worse than death. Whether such healers were willing or reluctant in such insidious tasks... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the gods know of such an enigma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Coatzintli weighed her options going forward. She knew that they undoubtedly weren't returning to the lion's den, because there was a high probability that Cameena would certainly be waiting for them. That is, if the vampire could muster the courage to reveal herself with such enormous mammaries. Inevitably, Coatzintli knew there was only one option available now, as she calmly spoke toward Olga and sternly said, \"Then, I guess we have no other alternative...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT leaving my sister to die, your highness!\" Olga exclaimed, which the Naga Queen clearly understood the context behind the plump human's outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such an outburst, Coatzintli sternly spoke toward the distraught Olga and answered, \"That is not what I have in mind, Olga Forgedotter.\" From there, Coatzintli turned her head to look toward one of her bodyguards, Shemal, and firmly commanded, \"Shemal! Prepare the second dais! We're taking Tora Forgedotter with us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, your highness!\" Shemal swiftly retorted, where the bodyguard quickly hustled out of the ramshackled lodge and towards her fellow servants, commanding to prepare the second dais.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're.... Y-You're taking my sister with us?\" Olga questioned, her expression in a semblance of slight disbelief yet also relief as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintlii then approached both siblings, then began to slowly cradle the half-conscious Tora in her dark-skinned arms somewhat and retorted, \"In actuality, Olga Forgedotter, WE are transporting your sister with us. Judging from her current state, her mind must have been unwillingly and forcefully altered to be more docile to their indoctrination. Fortunately, we have a few healers and physicians who are experienced with such trauma, but we will have to return to Vaal-Za'haraam immediately so your sister will be given the proper treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...We're leaving tonight, aren't we?\" Olga asked, quickly connecting the dots as to what was unraveling before her eyes. And judging from how hasty the Naga Queen was slithering, Coatzintli must have done something insulting to someone, most likely to Cameena Stranken of all people. So, as Olga assisted Coatzintli in carrying her fattened sibling, the chubby female chef soon spoke toward the Naga Queen and said, \"You...You did something while you were rescuing my sister, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say say I gave Cameena Stranken cow blood.  Made her think it was actually Tyrannosaur blood. Consider it as revenge for her atrocious crimes against your sister, Olga Forgedotter. However, right now, it is imperative that we pass the southern borders of Racovania by dawn's light. Otherwise, we shall be expecting a rather hostile Cameena Stranken once she recovers from her bloodied drunk stupor,\" Coatzintli confessed, being truthful and honest about what troubles she had willingly committed against the ruthless Cameena Stranken, as Olga managed to assist the Naga Queen and one or two of her bodyguards in carrying the now corpulent yet half-conscious Tora onto the newly built dais, making sure not to injure the older sibling when they laid her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, shortly after they laid Tora down on the second dais, Coatzintli soon spoke toward Olga and sternly said, \"Olga Forgedotter, you will be transported alongside your sister in this dais. So, if there is anything that you need before we depart, now is the time to grab the necessities.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Olga instantly knew what the Naga Queen meant, as she then quickly sprinted back inside the hut, grabbing a family portrait and the quilt that her mother made for her and Tora when they were children, then rushing back out of the lodge and sitting on the dais alongside her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're ready to leave, your highness,\" Olga flatly answered, letting Coatzintli and the bodyguards know that they were ready to leave Racovania. From there, as the group commanded their Marsh Wargs to pull the dais, Olga began to gently stroke her sister's unkempt lengthy hair, gently whispering into her sibling's ear as she calmly muttered, \"It's okay, Tora. It's okay, you're safe. We're gonna get you help, I promise. I won't leave your side until then.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although they were involuntarily left with no choice but to leave their village without properly saying goodbye to everyone they knew, Olga and Tora Forgedotter were now on their way to the Naga capital city within the Motee Marshes, known only as \"Vaal-Za'haraam\". And yet, even though Olga was already well aware that she could no longer return home, Tora on the other hand... She wasn't even consciously aware of her current surroundings due to the involuntary brainwashing she was forced to undergo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, both siblings had quite a long way to go until they reached the Motee Marshes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite how quick such events had transpired, all that Olga could care about...was her beloved older sister, who was currently rendered in a half-conscious and somewhat gluttonous stupor, always automatically yet subconsciously muttering for more food. Seeing her sister in such a jumbled ramshackled psychological condition certainly tugged heavily at Olga's heartstrings, causing the chubby female chef to shed some tears of grief and familial sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, by the time dawn's first light peered over the mountains, the entire group had long passed the southernmost borders of Racovania. Fortunately for them, the vampires weren't reckless and foolish enough to step out into broad daylight to hunt them without being burnt by the Sun's blazing light, and Coatzintli and the group were already deep in the rolling hills and farmlands of the Plains of Grobland, with farmers going through their fields to collect and harvest their homegrown produce and edibles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as they were halfway through the Plains of Grobland, Olga began to gently sing towards her half-conscious sister, hoping to entice some semblance of a familial response from her weakened yet fattened sibling, as she began to gently stroke Tora's hair while she softly sang, \"Hhhmmm, hmmm-hm... I see your red door... I want to paint it black... No colors *sob* anymore... I want them to turn black... I see the children walk by, dressed in their summer clothes... I have to turn my head, until my darkness goooes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Coatzintli and the Nagas paid no mind of Olga's singing, which was surprisingly good considering that the plump human was never known to be a singer. However, it was at the second set of lyrics that the Naga paid close attention as Olga sang once more as she said, \"I see your lines of colors, and they're all painted black... With flowers and my love, both never to come back... I've seen people turn their heads, and quickly look away... Like a newborn baby, it just happens everyday...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was unfamiliar with Racovanian folk songs, Coatzintli could easily understand that it was a song filled with somber tones, which made her feel all the more sympathetic towards Olga's familial plight. From there, Coatzintli gestured the servants to move her dais to be alongside the dais that held the two siblings within, where she then spoke toward Olga and calmly quipped, \"...That was a beautiful song, Olga Forgedotter. I was unaware of your talents as a songstress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Coatzintli's voice, Olga immediately stopped singing, where she then turned around to look at the Naga Queen and retorted, \"Th-Thank you, your highness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume the reason for such a song was to entice a response from your sister, correct?\" Coatzintli calmly replied, her voice displaying a compassionate tone towards the plump female human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response, Olga firmly nodded yes in confirmation, where she then spoke toward the Naga Queen and explained, \"It was a song our mother used to sing to us when we were children. *sob* B-Back when we were still naive... I-I thought I could snap Tora out of this if I sang our mother's song to her, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Coatzintli swiftly placed a dark-skinned left lower hand upon Olga's left rounded shoulder, reassuring her as she answered, \"Fret not, Olga Forgedotter. Once we reach Vaal-Za'haraam, I shall have my people's healers and physicians begin on healing and mending Tora's mind immediately. In the meantime however, I need you to be here for your sister. It might help if she has a familiar face beside her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you, your highness. It...It means a lot from you to help Tora.\" Olga said, feeling grateful for Coatzintli's aid in this dire matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Naga Queen soon answered, \"Your thanks is appreciated, Olga Forgedotter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Coatzintli's dais swiftly pulled ahead of the dais that Olga and Tora were transported in, just as Shemal and the other bodyguards trudged alongside their Queen's dais. \"Permission to speak freely, your highness?\" Shemal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Naga Queen swiftly replied, \"Permission granted, Shemal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, my Queen, but... Why are we risking so much for one human and her sibling? I understand your position as Queen and your duties to our people, but is it worth invoking the wrath of the damned bloodsuckers?\" Shemal questioned, wanting to understand why Coatzintli was making such unnecessary risks for one human and her now weakened but fattened sibling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to such skepticism, Coatzintli firmly spoke toward one of her most decorated bodyguards and queried, \"I understand your skepticism and doubt, Shemal. However, ask me this: Do you deeply care for your beloved Ku'Sari?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am willing to do anything for my betrothed, my Queen, but...What does this have to do with my question?\" Shemal asked, confused as to why her Queen would bring up her lover, Ku'Sari, so trivially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in response to such a question, Coatzintli firmly spoke toward the bodyguard and explained, \"Shemal, you witnessed what had befallen on Tora Forgedotter with your own eyes. Imagine what should happen if these vampires decided that Nagas are much more delectable. What the human's sister has endured is truly a fate worse than death. I'm not trying to sound threatening, but do you want your betrothed or any one of our people to endure what Tora Forgedotter has undergone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon listening to what her Queen had said, Shemal began to imagine such a grisly and unsettling fate if her beloved Ku'Sari was to succumb to a similar fate as Tora. Suffice to say, it was certifiably more than enough to make her vibrant serpentine scales to stand up on end in disgust and horror, which swiftly prompted her to swiftly speak up and replied, \"...N-No, my Queen! I would rather die than watch my betrothed be seduced and rendered a bloated feedbag to those gods-forsaken bloodsuckers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you know exactly why we are lending our aid to such a poor unfortunate soul, Shemal. I want no more complaints until we reach Vaal-Za'haraam. Understood?\" Coatzintli sternly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted Shemal to salute her Queen and replied, \"Yes, my Queen!\" And from that point forward, the long journey ahead was a modestly silent one, as each of the individuals contemplated on what should be done once they reach Vaal-Za'haraam, capital city of the Nagas.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say the trek was long and arduous was considered almost an understatement, considering they had little time to gather the proper supplies due to Coatzintli's deceitful trick upon the gluttonous Cameena Stranken. After all, the only supplies they had in stock were barrels of Serpen-Kaja to keep their strength up. However, over the course of two days and nights, Olga began to drink more Serpen-Kaja with each passing day, not out of thirst or sustenance, but out of stress towards her sister still in quite the half-conscious and somewhat gluttonous stupor, which mostly resulted in her sleeping often due to passing out drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, it was all the chubby female chef could do for the time being, since her fattened sister kept drifting in and out of consciousness. And even when she was conscious, the blubbery Tora would often ask for food with this docile, blank, and drone-like expression in her eyes, as if she was still inside the gothic castle she was imprisoned in, vividly unaware of her current deposition and situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Olga and the others, they reached the northeastern edge of the Motee Marshes by the early morning of the second day. And now, the only thing standing between them and the city of Vaal-Za'haraam were miles upon miles of moist, wet, and humid marshlands and swampy rivers. Upon arriving at the edge of the Motee Marshes, it was there that Olga soon noticed a large, finely crafted pontoon raft parked alongside a stone pier. Still feeling the after-effects of drinking nothing but Serpen-Kaja for the past two days, Olga rubbed the sides of her temples as she sluggishly asked, \"Erm...Y-Your highness? Wh...W-Why are we stopping here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fret, Olga Forgedotter. We are merely preparing the raft for transporting the dais,\" Coatzintli explained, as she soon felt the eunuchs lift up the dais and carefully positioned them evenly upon the gold and wooden raft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, several of the eunuchs began to grab onto these large rod-like oars, where they began to slowly but surely stroke and row the lengthy oars, thus propelling the intricate raft with relative ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, becoming curious about her new surroundings, Olga couldn't help but stare in both amazement and awe over such an unfamiliar area. Of course, Coatzintli obviously noticed Olga's bewildered staring, which prompted the Naga Queen to speak toward her personal chef as she queried, \"Impressive, isn't it, Olga Forgedotter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, your highness. It's just that...I've never got to see the world outside of my village before until now. *sigh* I...I just wish my mother was still alive to see all of this,\" Olga answered, contemplating and reminiscing about her mother a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, such a revelation did make the Naga Queen quite curious about Olga and Tora's biological progenitors, where Coatzintli then spoke toward the chubby female chef and asked, \"I do not intend to pry, Olga Forgedotter, but...What was your blood mother truly like? She must gave been an...intriguing human.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, she was, your highness. She-\" Olga replied, but was abruptly interrupted by a nearby violent upsurge of water, which revealed one of the Motee Marshes' indigenous predators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the creature was far bigger than the raft, as it it's great long jaws snapping like a gigantic bear trap. It looked like a huge scaly bird, but with the most fearsome head you could imagine, with teeth bigger than bananas lining its jaws. It peered toward the group, it's mangy feathers bristling and it's tiny eyes narrowing as it began to snarl as Shemal exclaimed, \"Tyrannosaurus!! Soldiers, protect the Queen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Coatzintli's bodyguards quickly grabbed their golden halberd spears, brandishing them towards the massive creature, ready for a fight. But then, just as the armored reptile was to attack the raft and it's passengers, another creature just as large dove out of the water and lunged at the Tyrannosaur, slamming it against a nearby riverbank. In appearance, this other creature was like a gigantic old hairy man. Long lank reddish fur covered its' body and it had jowls bigger than even the fattest human. Olga was left in complete shock and astonishment upon seeing such enormous beasts, as she witnessed the two large behemoths duke it out, slashing, clawing, and roaring at one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Your highness? What in the Gods were those things!?\" Olga yelped, being reasonably unnerved by such a near-death experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she saw that Coatzintli was still calm as ever, as if this was an ordinary occurrence for someone like her, as the Naga casually turned her head to look at the unnerved Olga and leisurely answered, \"*hearty chuckle* Fret not, Olga Forgedotter! This is merely an everyday occurrence here in the Motee Marshes. In fact, the creature that just saved us is a gigantopithecus. They hate large predators like our friend here. There is no need for concern, they only attack if they feel threatened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, upon hearing Coatzintli's explanation, Olga felt a little more relieved from such a revelation, still feeling her shock wearing off little by little, as she noticed the bodyguards and eunuchs swiftly return to their original positions on the raft. Eventually, as the sun began to finally descend over the horizon, the group had inevitably arrived at their predetermined destination: Vaal-Za'haraam. The capital city of the Nagas. Olga couldn't believe her own two eyes, as she soaked in every nook and cranny of the stone and gold-laced metropolis. There were large huts and established shops and marketplaces scattered along the city, as there multiple branching rivers that functioned as the swamp city's roads and streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, across the four corners of Vaal-Za'haraam, there were four large temples, which appeared to be both spacious and intricate in design.  Olga could only guess thagg those temples must functioned as either the home of Coatzintli's personal advisors, or as religious temples to their deities, or possibly both. And finally, perching high above the city alongside two adjacent waterfalls, stood what Olga could only assume to be the palace, where Coatzintli lived since she is the Queen of the Nagas. Upon seeing the city for herself, Coatzintli spoke toward the chubby female chef and proudly boasted, \"Olga Forgedotter, welcome...to Vaal-Za'haraam!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out of some of the things that she has seen as of late, seeing the notorious city of Vaal-Za'haraam in person was another thing entirely for the plump female chef known as Olga Forgedotter. After all, many travelers had often told stories of their exploits and adventures across the land when they were drunk on mead at the Bleakfrost Tavern. However, out of many of the astonishing tales from such adventurers, one always stuck out in her mind: \"A massive city in the heart of the Motee Marshes, built out of limestone and trimmed up with gold and silver. And like the crown of a King, there sat a palace made of gold and jewels adorned atop of two converging waterfalls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, here she was, sitting on a floating pontoon raft alongside the Naga Queen herself, entering a city that looked like something out of a fantastical myth, as most of the serpentine denizens proceeded to cease going about their daily businesses to greet their revered and benevolent Queen, bowing and cheering in applause, while the raft made it's way toward one of the decorated temples. In a way, Olga felt a little overwhelmed, believing she just entered a metropolis fit for the Gods themselves! \"Is there something amiss, Olga Forgedotter?\" Coatzintli asked, easily noticing how flustered Olga appeared to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Olga swiftly spoke toward the Naga Queen and replied, \"Oh! Um... My apologies, your highness. It's just that... I feel like I've stepped inside a city fit only for the Gods.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*hearty chuckle* Good to see that our fair city has left an impression on you, Olga Forgedotter! But do not fret, you shall become accustomed to Vaal-Za'haraam and it's inner workings.\" Coatzintli quipped, reassuring the chubby female human that she'd get accustomed to the capital city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Olga looked back towards the pregnant Naga Queen and asked, \"So, um... I don't mean to be rude, your highness, but...where are we going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the Temple of Knowledge. It is not just the foundry for all of our civilization's history and lore, but it is also known as a place of healing and rejuvenation. If we are to mend your sister's mind whole once more, the Temple of Knowledge is our best hope for your sibling.\" Coatzintli explained, elaborating on where they were heading now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the group had finally arrived at the Temple of Knowledge, as the eunuchs tied down and fastened the pontoon raft to a stone drydock, where they then proceeded to lift up the dais and transport them further toward the enormous temple. Once they reached the base of the Temple of Knowledge, they were greeted by a group of five Nagas, four of which were all dressed up in what appeared to be priestess garments and robes. However, upon closer inspection, Olga noticed to first Naga leading them appeared to be drastically different from the other priestesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, she had the appearance of your average Naga, but her serpentine lower half was extremely similar to a Corn Snake, with red and black scales with a set of tan rings circling around a good portion of the Naga's serpentine tail. Her skin tone was of a Caucasian tone, but what was the most striking thing about her was this unique red tattoo, which started from her left shoulder, wrapped around her upper back and left breast, and ending just above her lips. Her hair was black as coal, but was extremely lengthy, as it reached just above her scaly butt, as it was put into a lengthy braided ponytail. However, the front bangs of her hair was a striking contrast to the rest of her hair, as her bangs appeared to be a bright pink hue. Her eyes her a golden yellow, with serpentine slits for pupils. And to top it all off, Olga easily noticed that this unique-looking Naga had a chubby physique similar to her own, complete with a bulbous pair of Triple E-Cup breasts. Finally, Olga noticed that this specific Naga also wore what appeared to be a pair of specialized goggles brandished upon the Naga's brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Coatzintli casually dismounted herself from her royal dais, slithering over toward the unique-looking Naga, where Olga witnessed something unexpected: The Naga Queen and the other Naga were hugging one another, as if they were old friends! \"Coatzintli! Oh, it is so good to see you, your highness!\" the Naga excitedly quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli soon spoke back as she replied, \"Yes, it feels good to be home again, Quessa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the conversation between the two Nagas, Olga managed to put two and two together, quickly realizing who this unique-looking Naga actually was: This Naga undoubtedly had to be Quessa! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they approached the dais, Quessa noticed the second dais, where she then spoke toward Coatzintli and curiously queried, \"Hmm, what's in the other dais, my Queen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Coatzintlii displayed a fanged smirk upon her dark-skinned face and answered, \"Oh, something I'm certain you'll be exhilarated to see, old friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Quessa quickly realized what she was saying and said, \"Humans?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Coatzintli firmly nodded in confirmation, which then caused Quessa to excitedly raise all four of her arms and jump up and down in a rather childish manner, as if she was joyfully celebrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as Quessa soon swiftly slithered over toward the second dais, Coatzintli quickly spoke toward her exuberant friend and retorted, \"I must warn you, Quessa, one of them is not-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the Naga Queen could finish her sentence, Quessa had already unveiled the dais' curtains, revealing both Olga and the incapacitated Tora. Obviously, Quessa couldn't exactly contain her excitement, as she saw the two human females, speaking aloud with unhindered excitement as she exclaimed, \"By the Gods!! You brought me two Humans!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quessa, meet Olga Forgedotter. She will be my personal chef and your bride.\" Coatzintli explained, introducing the excited chubby Naga to the somewhat unnerved female human, who seemed about ready to hide from Quessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as Olga was about to make a run toward the Naga Queen, Quessa quickly calmed down some, quickly showing herself to be not a threat as she retorted, \"Hey, hey, hey! It's okay, Human- I mean, Olga... I'm not here to harm you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Quessa slowly extended her slightly chubby right upper arm toward the startled Olga, attempting to reassure that she was not a threat to the plump female chef. Fortunately for Quessa, Olga extended her own right hand and grasped Quessa's hand, where they slowly shook hands as Quessa said, \"See? I'm not here to hurt you. I'm your friend, Olga.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, Olga mustered up enough courage to speak toward the exuberant Quessa and said, \"Please, y-you have to help my sister Tora. I-I don't know what's wrong with her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Quessa looked downward and noticed the bloated elephantine Forgedotter sibling, where Quessa then spoke back towards Olga and calmly asked, \"Tell me, Olga: was your sister always this...larger than life?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga swiftly shook her somewhat cherubic face in firm confirmation. From there, Quessa swiftly placed her specialized goggles over her serpentine eyes, and began to thoroughly examine every speck of the half-conscious Tora, muttering to herself as she said, \"Let's see... Decrease in muscle density and mass... Increased volume of cellulite across the anatomy... Dilated and jaded pupils... And what appears to be a vampire's bite mark on her right jugular... By the Gods, what has happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fate worse than death, Quessa. Can your healers be able to mend her mind whole once more?\" Coatzintli explained, not wanting to divulge on what she had witnessed back in Racovania. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to her Queen's question, Quessa then gestured the four priestesses to approach as Quessa spoke toward Coatzintli and answered, \"Normally, we can mend the average Naga's mind in a matter of days. However, since this is the first human we have ever operated such a procedure on...we'll have to be extremely careful, which means it will take more time to complete. As for how long, I'd estimate a week or two at most. That is... if we begin immediately.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Begin your preparations immediately, Quessa. In the meantime, I must return to the Palace, Patli must have become awfully concerned for my well-being during my time away from Vaal-Za'haraam,\" Coatzintli replied, where she parted ways with one of her closest friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she departed for the Palace, Olga then spoke toward the Naga Queen and asked, \"Your Highness, should I go with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I had said previously, Olga Forgedotter. You are Quessa's bride, which means you shall be living with her from this point forward. I shall give you a week of recuperation before you shall begin your duties as my personal chef. But until then, I bid you farewell for now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, after the servants hauled Coatzintli's royal dais back onto the pontoon raft, the eunuchs began to row the rod-like oars forward toward the Golden Palace, thus leaving Olga alone with her incapacitated but fattened sister, as well as the chubby exuberant Naga known as Quessa, as Quessa soon approached the female human chef, bearing an eager fanged grin on her slightly plump face and asked, \"So, my dear Olga... What should we do first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"W-Well, I, um-\" Olga hesitantly said. But before she could say any further, her plump stomach began to rumble and growl aggressively, interrupting the plump female chef in the process, as it began to demand for food and sustenance. Of course, Olga began to blush profusely from such an outburst from her own stomach. However, Quessa began to giggle lightly, as if it was a nostalgic reminder of her stomach's gluttonous habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she placed a left upper and lower hand on Olga's plump lap out of reassurance and casually retorted, \"Ah! You must be hungry. *giggle* I bet you didn't have anything to eat on the way here to the Motee Marshes, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, Ms. Quessa... I, um... only drank that Serpen-Kaja stuff on t-the way here,\" Olga hesitantly answered, attempting futilely to not make direct eye contact with the chubby Naga, which ultimately proved fruitless, as she watched as the four Naga priestesses grab and carry her rotund, incapacitated sister into the Temple of Knowledge, which prompted Olga to speak up instinctively as she asked, \"W-Where are they taking Tora? What are they going to do to my sister?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Olga... I completely understand the need to protect your sister, given her current...ailment,\" Quessa answered, grabbing a hold of Olga with relative ease. After all, even though she appeared to be noticeably chubbier than the other Nagas she'd seen at this point, Olga could feel that Quessa still had some considerable strength to her physique, as Quessa gently but firmly held onto Olga with all four arms, speaking to her directly as she explained, \"However, you must understand that you cannot help your sister at this stage of mental trauma. I promised my Queen that I will help mend Tora's mind whole again, but it will take time to do so. In the meantime...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Quessa then extended her left upper hand to Olga, gesturing to grab it as the plump Naga queried, \"Would you mind if I personally escort you to your new home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Olga wanted to outright deny Quessa's offering hand. However, in the back of her mind, a thought emerged: \"I don't know who she truly is, but... She seems more than nice enough. After all, she's more than willing to help Tora. Maybe...maybe I should give Quessa a chance.\" And with that, Olga slowly but surely began to reach out with her left hand, which began to overlap and wrap around Quessa's hand, which made Quessa display a gentle reassuring smile towards the plump female chef as she replied, \"I promise you this, my dear Olga: I will not stop until your sister is capable of hugging you once more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Olga slowly but surely dismounted herself from the dais, where she somewhat reluctantly followed alongside Quessa, as they slowly made their way to the Temple of Knowledge. \"So, um... I take it that this is also your home as well, Quessa?\" Olga cautiously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa swiftly explained, \"Oh yes! The Temple of Knowledge isn't just a foundry dedicated to Naga history, lore, healing, and rejuvenation, it also functions as my lodgings... Or rather, should I say, 'Our' lodgings, Olga.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a somewhat long trek toward the Temple, both Quessa and Olga made their way inside the substantial Temple of Knowledge, just as the female chef witnessed the four Naga priestesses carrying Tora into a different room ahead of them, while she and Quessa proceeded further into the temple, ascending up an elevated stone ramp, and into a spacious area of the temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Olga soon laid her eyes upon was quite astonishing and awe-inspiring. \"Olga, welcome to our humble abode,\" Quessa quipped, introducing the plump female chef to quite the spacious dwelling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the entire area was the same size as two to three large village huts bundled together, which was considerably massive to Olga. There were aisles upon aisles of bookcases, each filled to the brim with books and scrolls of abundant varieties. From there, she noticed a large bed off to the side, adorned with massive animal skins and pelts as bed sheets and blankets, as she then saw a substantially large fireplace, with a massive stone table adjacent to the aforementioned fireplace, complete with equally wide stone stools. And finally, Olga then noticed a beautiful patio adjacent to the spacious living quarters, complete with it's own stone table and stools. Overall, it was certainly quite the step up from her old lodgings back in her Racovanian village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Impressive, is it not?\" Quessa quipped, snapping Olga out of her awestruck stupor, in which Olga promptly nodded in confirmation. However, they were soon abruptly interrupted by Olga's stomach once more, as it growled and grumbled relentlessly. From there, Quessa swiftly guided Olga onto one of the stone stools as she said, \"And speaking of priorities, we should really give you something to eat. And I know just what you need...\" Shortly after that, Quessa swiftly slithered toward the kitchen area of her living quarters, pulling out an enormous bronze plate. Moments later, she returned to Olga, carrying in a large roasted hunk of meat on a bronze plate, where the chubby Naga placed the plate in front of the plump female chef and quipped, \"Ta-Da! A nice big chunk of Triceratops rump roast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Olga was in surprise was an understatement, as her vision soaked in the grilled Triceratops meat, gawking at how utterly absurd the slab of meat's size was. However, something else hit her as well, which came in the form of an erotic yet delectable aroma, coming from none other than the Triceratops rump roast. Needless to say, Olga had never smelled anything like this before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Already watering at the mouth, are we?\" From there, Quessa began to cut up a good slice of Triceratops meat, just enough to give Olga a taste of which was offered, as Quessa calmly reassured, \"...Go ahead, try it. I assure you, this will be something you haven't tasted before, my dear Olga.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a Siren's call beckoning her, Olga grabbed the slice of meat with both hands, lifting the meat slice up to her mouth, where she then took a bite out of it. At first, she tasted nothing, but once the bitten portion of Triceratops meat made physical contact with her tongue, Olga began to experience this explosion of flavor on her taste buds, which left her wide eyed in the process. \"By the Gods... THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS MEAT I'VE EVER TASTED!!!\" she thought to herself, her taste buds lighting up like a starlit night sky, unable to contain her inner food addict, causing her to take larger and more voracious bites out of the Triceratops meat. From there, Quessa soon handed Olga a gold knife and fork, where the plump female chef used the utensils to begin her assault on the Triceratops rump roast, tearing it down slice after slice until...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A wise man once said, \"Be careful what you wish for... It might just get you.\" Well, for Olga Forgedotter, right now besides wishing her sister to be healed, she instinctively wished she couldn't stop eating the flavorous Triceratops rump roast. Although her mind and her hunger was willing, her body on the other hand... was barely able to store all of the Triceratops meat within the stores of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of this moment, Olga was currently laying on her back against the stone floor of Quessa's living quarters, gently stroking the undoubtedly bloated and taut sides of her now engorged stomach, uttering guttural moans and grunts of mild pain. After all, she just completely devoured what she could assumed to be one of the buttcheeks of a Triceratops, so she basically didn't even want to get up under her own volition out of concern for upchucking what her stomach was currently digesting at this very moment, as she painfully muttered, \"Uuuugh...So...Full *BUUUURRP!!!!*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, such engorging did take a bit of it's toll on the plump female chef's clothing, as there was now a prominent tear down the middle of the abdomen of her dress, with a decent portion of belly fat jutting out some from the newly created tear in her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Quessa had written down some notes in a hardcover book with her lower hands, writing down every detail regarding Olga's current physical state, preserving such notes for future studies. From there, the chubby Naga closed the book and placed the book into one of the bookcases, where she then cautiously carried the stuffed female human in her four arms and said, \"*giggle* Well, I must admit, you certainly have quite the appetite, Olga. Impressive, very impressive, indeed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Quessa gently placed the stuffed Olga down onto the large bed, unfurling the animal pelt blankets, and gently laying the female human's head upon a leather headrest, thus allowing Olga to get some rest, as the bloated female human slowly but surely began to drift in and out of consciousness, soon realizing that she was about to go into a food coma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't worry yourself ragged, dear Olga. I shall make sure your sister's mind is made whole once more. So for now, sleep tight...and sleep well,\" Quessa whispered, softly speaking into one of Olga's ears, letting the human know that her fattened psychologically damaged sister was in capable hands, just as Olga had finally gave in and lost consciousness, now rendered fully asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Jynera, Goddess of Revelries, grant you safe passage through the dreaming world, Olga Forgedotter,\" Quessa whispered, quoting a small prayer for the slumbering human female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Quessa quietly slithered her way out of her living quarters and toward the room where the other priestesses had carried Tora's unconscious body into earlier. In appearance, the room was adorned with various mystical artifacts and items, such as steamy candles, jars full of sacred herbs, and having an air of spiritualism swirling throughout the interior. This...was known as \"The Spirit Room\", and it was an integral part of the rejuvenation process when it came to healing one's mind and spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the four Naga priestesses began brewing and concocting the proper potions and ingredients for the upcoming ritual, Quessa calmly slithered her way inside the room, where one of the priestesses swiftly noticed their superior as she said, \"High Priestess Quessa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, all four of the Naga priestesses stopped what they were doing and proceeded to properly salute their leading priestess, which came in the form of kneeling their heads down while crossing their upper arms into an X formation. \"At ease, my fellow priestesses,\" Quessa retorted, prompting the other priestesses to lower their upper arms and raise their heads to look toward their leader. Quessa then calmly spoke toward them and explained, \"Now... I understand your apprehension towards aiding a human in a critical state such as her's. However, as healers and physicians of Knowledge, we have an obligation to learn not just about our anatomy, but the anatomy of other species as well. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By your command, High Priestess!\" the priestesses retorted, all four of them speaking in unison towards their spiritual leader. From there, they began their work upon the incapacitated yet corpulent Tora, having Tora subconsciously ingest a few of the alchemic brews the priestesses had concocted earlier, hoping to entice some form of subtle response from ingesting such mixed chemicals. Suffice to say, Quessa certainly knew that this was probably take a few all-nighters to illicit some semblance of physical or psychological response from the fattened older sibling.</span></div></div>",

However, once she opened her eyes and began to hear the hustle and bustle of the city of Vaal-Za'haraam outside, the memories all came back to her, making her succumb to the truth...that she wasn't dreaming, that what has transpired over the past several days was real and bona fide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*long sigh*...So...I guess that I wasn't dreaming all of this, was I?\" she said to herself, positioned in a sitting posture on the large bed, where she then slowly noticed the increased pudge on her abdomen, along with the tear in the middle of her dress. Out of curiosity, she gently placed a hand upon her slightly enlarged belly, jiggling it mildly to estimate it's increased girth. Overall, she undoubtedly noticed that she had gained some additional weight from devouring the Triceratops rump roast from yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a good night's sleep, my dear Olga?\" a voice rang out, which seemed to startle Olga somewhat, quickly turning her head towards the origin of the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she soon calmed down a little upon realizing that the one who spoke to her was actually Quessa, who was currently sitting at the large stone table, drinking...something, from a silver goblet. However, Olga couldn't help but notice something different regarding the chubby Naga's demeanor, as Olga slowly dismounted herself from the bed, speaking toward her supposed \"betrothed\" and retorted, \"No, I-I'm afraid not, Quessa. I...I just couldn't stop thinking about my sister. I'm...I'm just so worried about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said before, Olga. We won't...*yawn*...We won't stop until...*longer yawn* By the Gods, I'm tired,\" Quessa answered, becoming somewhat unable to continue finishing her sentence to Olga due to staying active throughout the entire night performing several rituals upon the incapacitated yet corpulent Tora, prioritizing work over sleep hygiene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Olga easily noticed the tired expression in the chubby Naga's golden eyes, making the plump female chef feel a twinge of sympathy towards what Quessa was enduring. From there, Olga placed her hands on her womanly hips, staring at Quessa and firmly asked, \"And I'm guessing you didn't get any sleep last night, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*yawn*...Regrettably, yes, Olga Forgedotter. Why? Do you *yawn* have a remedy for such drowsiness?\" Quessa queried, blatantly confessing her tiredness to Olga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to her own surprise, Olga began to walk over toward the kitchen area of the living quarters, pulling out what she recognized as cocoa beans. From there, she yanked the silver goblet out of Quessa's upper hands, where she grinded the cocoa beans into cocoa powder, pouring the powder into the goblet and stirring it with a bronze spoon. Finally, she promptly returned the goblet back to Quessa, where Olga then firmly retorted, \"Drink this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat reluctantly, Quessa drank a good sip of the newly brewed drink in her goblet. At first, she didn't feel anything. But seconds later, she felt her spirits reinvigorated once more, becoming alert and aware as if she had a good night's sleep, where she swiftly spoke toward Olga and said, \"By the Gods... I feel inexplicably rejuvenated! What was in this brew?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called coffee, Quessa. It's supposed to raise one's spirits when they're sleep deprived. You can thank me later,\" Olga coldly replied, as if she still somewhat didn't trust the chubby Naga fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as Olga sat herself down in another stone stool, Quessa easily noticed the plump human giving her a bit of the cold shoulder, which seemed to have made the chubby Naga reasonably concerned for her arranged betrothed, prompting Quessa to speak toward Olga with a concerned tone as she asked, \"You...don't fully trust me, do you Olga?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What do you think?\" Olga queried, crossing her slightly chubby arms in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of concern, Quessa slowly slithered towards Olga from behind, gently wrapping her four hands around Olga's rounded shoulders, where the chubby Naga spoke toward the chubby female human with a calm but reassuring tone and explained, \"Olga, I clearly understand your....apprehensive feelings about being my bride, but I can assure you...I'm not the villain in your story. That belongs to whoever rendered your beloved sister in such a damaged state.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Quessa's reassurance, Olga reluctantly kept herself silent, but keenly listened to the chubby Naga's words. However, in a further attempt to prove to Olga that she isn't a heartless individual, Quessa soon spoke once more and reassuringly answered, \"Listen, I made a solemn oath to mend your sister's mind whole once more, and I fully intend to fulfill such a promise. However, I must know if you are willing to give me a chance as your betrothed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, no response from Olga, so Quessa proposed an offer that the chubby human couldn't blatantly refuse, where the chubby Naga then retorted, \"How about this, Olga? Since I have more than enough spare time, we go on a date. You know, explore Vaal-Za'haraam to our hearts' content. And since Queen Coatzintli has given you an entire week to yourself, we can spend some quality time together. However, if you still are not having fun during our time together, I will still heal your sister and call off the marriage between the two of us, no strings attached. Well, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Olga soaked in every word spewing from Quessa's forked tongue, now seeing that Quessa was willing to go out of her way to appease her. At first, she wanted to explicitly refuse the plump Naga's generous offer. However, the more she thought about it, the more it seemed a fair trade to the chubby female chef. Eventually, she made up her mind and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright. I'll, um...I'll take you up on your offer, Quessa,\" Olga flatly retorted, agreeing to give the chubby Naga a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to the plump female chef's answer, Quessa quickly wrapped all four of her arms around Olga in a light excited hug, just as Quessa exuberantly squealed, \"Eeep! Oh thank you, Olga! You surely won't regret this, I promise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could speak any further, Olga swiftly pressed a hand against the chubby Naga's lips, temporarily rendering the giddy Naga quite for a moment or two, as Olga then said, \"Uh uh! Before we go anywhere, I've got a few conditions of my own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my dear! Name your offer.\" Quessa quipped, calming herself down a little, promptly severing her embrace from Olga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Olga then bluntly stated, \"First off, I want to see Tora every now and then. I need to know what her current condition is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable. However, I cannot allow you to interfere with the rituals we'll be performing upon your sibling,\" Quessa retorted, setting a few ground rules as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to Olga speaking toward the plump Naga and replied, \"Fair enough. After all, my sister's life is in your hands. Second, I get to choose where we go on this...'date' of ours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I can do. However, I can't allow you to venture outside the city and explore the Motee Marshes without proper authorization,\" Quessa explained, letting the plump female chef know that she wasn't allowed to venture outside of Vaal-Za'haraam and explore the Motee Marshes in it's entirety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, after having a near-death experience with a Tyrannosaurus and a Gigantopithecus yesterday, Olga definitely wasn't going to be voluntarily exploring the Motee Marshes anytime soon, as she shuddered a little in unnerved hesitation and bluntly complied, \"*shivers* You don't have to tell me twice on that, Quessa. And third, could you, um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, just as she got onto the third condition, Olga began to blush profusely, as she continued, \"C-Could you, um...get me more of th-that Triceratops meat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, upon seeing such a drooling lustful expression on the female chef's somewhat cherubic face, Quessa could easily see that Olga had just developed an addictive hankering for Triceratops meat, which she couldn't help but giggle mildly at how fast Olga got hooked on such an average cuisine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Quessa could see why Olga found the Triceratops meat to be so enticing, probably because she hadn't tasted anything similar in flavor and intensity. So, in response to the plump female chef's gluttonous request, Quessa placed her hands on her scaly yet plump womanly hips, bearing a smug fanged grin on her lips and retorted, \"You're in love with the Triceratops meat, aren't you, my dear Olga?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Olga snapped out of her ravenous stupor, blushing profusely while she fidgeted with her hands and fingers, where she soon flustered, \"No! Um...Maybe?\" Quessa still displayed that smug grin on her lips, which easily demolished Olga's failing facade, causing the plump human to blare aloud as she confessed, \"Okay, okay! I love the Triceratops meat I ate last night. Happy now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Very. But don't fret, dear Olga: I will make sure you get more than enough Triceratops meat to gorge on,\" Quessa remarked, vowing to make sure Olga had more than her fill of Triceratops meat, as the chubby Naga slithered over toward the counter-top to grab what appeared to be satchel full of gold coins, hanging it from her sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides, dear Olga. Once the Rainy Season swings into high gear, you'll certainly be seeing a LOT more of me. *giggle*\" Quessa retorted, vividly promising Olga that she'd be seeing a lot more Naga when the Rainy Season truly begins. Of course, Olga had little to no idea what Quessa meant when she said she'd be seeing a lot more of the chubby Naga. From there, Quessa then gestured Olga to come along with her as she quipped, \"Now then, what do you say we get you some new clothes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she promised the chubby Naga that she'll try to enjoy her stay at Vaal-Za'haraam, Olga cautiously approached the ecstatic yet calm Quessa, following closely behind her as they exited the Temple of Knowledge. From there, they proceeded toward another pontoon raft, as they got onto the wooden amphibious vehicle, where the eunuchs began rowing the raft up the canal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Quessa? Where, um...Where are we heading to first?\" Olga asked, wanting to know what their first destination was here in Vaal-Za'haraam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Quessa was quite willing to disclose such information, where she spoke with a hearty chuckle and replied, \"*hearty chuckle* Do not fret, dear Olga. Our first destination shall be...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Our first destination shall be none other than the Keiku Bazaar. Apparently, they're well known for having a various assortment of clothes, Olga,\" Quessa explained, as the eunuchs continued rowing the pontoon raft down the elongated canals of Vaal-Za'haraam, turning at several different canal intersections along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Olga couldn't help but gawk and stare in awe at her new surroundings, still relatively amazed at how vast and expansive the Naga capital city was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is there something wrong, Olga?\" Quessa asked, noticing the chubby female chef in her current state of mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Quessa's question easily snapped Olga back to reality, where she swiftly answered, \"Oh, um...N-No, nothing's wrong, Ms. Quessa. It's just that...I am still becoming accustomed to how massive this place really is. I mean, I've never been to a city before until now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's quite alright. And please, call me Quessa. And...thank you,\" Quessa replied, which seemed to confuse the plump human when the chubby Naga thanked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to what the chubby Naga said, Olga looked back at Quessa and asked, \"For what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For being honest and truthful with me, dear Olga,\" Quessa retorted, displaying an honest fanged smile towards the plump female chef. The chubby Naga then spoke once more and said, \"I understand that you're still mostly apprehensive with being my betrothed, but at least allow me the honor of being your friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Olga was reluctant to offer Quessa such a friendship. However, something in her gut told her to give the chubby Naga both the benefit of a doubt and a chance to become the human's friend in such an alien environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after much debating with herself, Olga eventually extended her hand out toward the plump Naga, where Quessa performed a similar response, grasping Olga's hand in the process, as Quessa then quipped, \"Friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends,\" Olga firmly answered, where they then shook on it, as the pontoon raft had finally reached it's initial destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the eunuchs then tied the pontoon raft to a stone dry-dock to prevent it from drifting off down the canal while they're preoccupied with shopping. Shortly after the eunuchs had tied down the raft, Olga and Quessa dismounted themselves from the raft, standing on the dry-dock, looking at the main entrance to the Keiku Bazaar. And with that, Quessa then looked at the plump female chef and queried, \"So, my dear Olga, shall we see what the Keiku Bazaar has to offer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that the Keiku Bazaar was considerably impressive and expansive was quite a moot point, as Olga was in complete bewilderment at how much was available at each market stall. Clothes, jewelry, exotic fabrics, and so much more were to be found, as she and Quessa casually roamed the expansive Bazaar, looking at whatever caught Olga's attention. However, after several minutes of searching, they came across a large store with a variety of clothes for different species, as Quessa quipped, \"Ooh! This place shall do wonderfully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Quessa proceeded to drag along Olga towards the store, where they accosted one of the clerks of the store. In appearance, she was a Naga with vibrant green and white scales on her serpentine lower half, with a Hispanic skin tone, short blonde hair, and a petite physique. \"Ke'Lani!\" Quessa excitedly exclaimed, as if she was seeing an old friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Ke'Lani quickly responded in kind, rapidly hugging the plump Naga as she retorted, \"Hey, Quessa! Long time, no see! So, how is my favorite High Priestess of Knowledge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga soon noticed that Quessa and Ke'Lani appeared to be old acquaintances, where Quessa swiftly quipped, \"*giggle* Oh, you know me, Ke'Lani: I'm basically a Tyrannosaurus when it comes to knowledge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*hearty chuckle* Well that's good to hear,\" Ke'Lani replied, glad to see that Quessa was her usual curious self. But then, moments later, the petite Naga soon became aware of Olga standing alongside Quessa, where Ke'Lani leaned down to examine the plump female chef, which unnerved Olga slightly as Ke'Lani asked, \"Oh? And who's our tubby little guest here, Quessa? A friend of yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot! Ke'Lani: Allow me to introduce you to Olga Forgedotter. She is Queen Coatzintli's newest personal chef.\" Quessa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis completely surprised the petite Naga, prompting her to bow before Olga as if she was royalty, as Ke'Lani then replied, \"Forgive me, ma'am. I was blissfully unaware of your position as the Queen's personal chef!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...I-It isn't a big deal, Ke'Lani. I was merely lucky enough to impress her highness with my cooking,\" Olga bluntly explained, as Quessa quickly gestured Ke'Lani to stop bowing before the chubby female human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby Naga then retorted, \"Olga: Meet Ke'Lani. Or rather, she's better known throughout the entire Bazaar as 'Ke'Lani The Seamstress.' because of her proficiency with creating and tailoring custom-made clothes for her clients, whether they be human or Naga.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, Quessa. Enough with the praise, you're embarrassing me!\" Ke'Lani quipped, her thin cheeks blushing profusely in the process of such appraisal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Quessa quickly retorted, \"Nonsense! You're one of, if not, THE best seamstress in all of Vaal-Za'haraam. After all, you deserve all of the hard work you've done for numerous Nagas during the Rainy Seasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, Quessa. Anyway, enough about me! What can I get for you two lovely ladies?\" Ke'Lani asked, diverting the subject some onto why Quessa and Olga were here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to such a trivial question, Quessa spoke toward her friend and explained, \"Well, we're here to get Olga some new clothes to wear. After all, her current garments won't last long when the Rainy Season truly begins, if you catch my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but of course! Anything for a good friend of mine!\" Ke'Lani swiftly quipped, becoming anticipated some over tailoring her first human outfit, slithering inside the store, with Olga and Quessa following suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as they browsed through the various articles of handcrafted garments, Ke'Lani soon spoke toward them and asked, \"So, what exactly are you looking for then, ladies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to such a question, Quessa spoke toward her petite Naga friend and answered, \"Well, we're  looking for...\"</span></div></div>",

Olga had never heard of that before, normally in Racovania there were four seasons, and none of them contained excessive rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga then watched as the saleswoman slithered off and returned with a loincloth, but it was only when Olga saw Quessa place it around herself did she see just how <b>big</b> the item of clothing was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was huge! It had more than enough stretch to contain even Coatzintli\u2019s massive pregnancy belly. Despite respecting the naga\u2019s local customs quietly, this Olga had to speak up about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm Quessa\u2026isn\u2019t that a little\u2026big for you?\u201d Olga nervously pointed out, trying not to insult the serpent woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa slithered around and smiled at Olga. \u201cOk, leopard\u2019s out of the bag I guess\u2026\u201d She chuckled, \u201cIt\u2019s for the rainy season, every year the rains come and harvests bloom in the marshes, and this also attracts plenty of animals as well. We use this as an opportunity to eat much more than normal, it\u2019s a big festival to celebrate nature\u2019s bounty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was only partially satisfied with this answer however. \u201cSo\u2026what\u2019s with the big clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa chuckled again, \u201cBecause I\u2019m going to get fat silly\u2026I did say you would be seeing <i>more</i> of me after all. In fact we all are!\u201d At this Quessa then stopped and put one of her fingers to her chin, \u201cHmmm, you should join in too! I would love to observe the effects of excessive eating on a human first hand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis certainly took Olga back. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026I am not sure if I want to...get fat.\u201d She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will help you handle life here better.\u201d Quessa quickly added, taking two of her hands and gently holding Olga\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t do as much harvesting during the drier months, so food will be harder to come by. I am not saying you need to get huge\u2026just plump enough to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Olga relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geeky naga looked ecstatic with Olga\u2019s reply. \u201cYay! Oh! Then we need to get you some rainy season clothes as well then! Ke\u2019lani! Another selection of dresses please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, the naga in charge of the stall slithered away and returned with a heaping armful of new clothes. A lot were in various electric-blue tones, seems Ke\u2019lani thought they would complement Olga\u2019s blonde hair very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa and Ke\u2019lani helped Olga put the clothes on, clipping the various fastenings and showing Olga how naga clothes worked. Most of which seemed to expose a <i>lot</i> of flesh. In fact the most conservative of the bunch was little more than what Olga considered a bra and a loincloth. She was constantly worried about Quessa\u2019s hands touching her skin, but the naga was honest enough to know that they were not close enough for that, and so refrained for actually contacting skin-to-skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Olga felt a bit more relaxed with the situation, and was starting to get into it a bit. She pulled the odd pose for the pair as they showered her with compliments; she even forgot how her pudgy tummy drooped a little over the waistband of the loincloths, or how much cleavage her now-larger breasts showed in the tops. Eventually Olga settled on a set of blue clothes with yellow thunderbolts trimming the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Olga thought that their shopping trip was over Quessa then turned to Ke\u2019lani and reminded her of something. \u201cOk, since she likes this one, do you have it in a rainy season size?\u201d The naga asked, to which the shop-keeper nodded and slithered away, returning with something far larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to fit into <i>this</i>?\u201d Olga choked as she held the garment around herself. The new matching blue and yellow set was frankly enormous; as the blonde woman held it around an imaginary version of herself it would fit, she noted how it was at least four times wider than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you will grow into it!\u201d Quessa added in a positive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026thought you said I would only need to get a bit plump?\u201d Olga gagged as she held the gigantic top aloft, noting how each cup was bigger than her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that is plump for us.\u201d Quessa nonchalantly stated. The former waitress gulped, if that was plump she did not want to know what the naga thought truly fat was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after picking up Olga\u2019s \u201crainy season clothes\u201d Quessa picked out her own outfit and coins exchanged hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later Quessa and Olga had made their way to a local tavern and eatery. It wasn\u2019t too different on the inside than what she was used to in Racovania. Wooden tables, cheerful waitressing staff (even if they were all snake-woman) and plentiful mead. The seats were also very comfortable as well, covered in pillows to allow the naga to rest their entire serpentine lower-halves in comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa and Olga ordered some food and conversation began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how are you enjoying the city\u2026and our little date?\u201d Quessa teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026enjoying myself\u2026more than I thought actually.\u201d Olga admitted. There was no sense in lying or being overly malicious to Quessa, she had been honest and genuine with her so far, and had respected all of Olga\u2019s boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad! And we haven\u2019t even got to your favourite part yet!\u201d Quessa replied, with a nod towards the kitchens where the unmistakable smell of roasted triceratops rump could be smelled wafting through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga tried to deny it a little, but her belly grumbled, giving her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! You can\u2019t fool me. We will have you plumped up for rainy season in no time.\u201d Quessa chuckled, putting the back of one of her hands to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga sighed, she feared the naga was right on this. As the laughter of the serpent died down, Olga took a deep breath, there was a pressing question she wished to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuessa\u2026\u201d Olga began, getting the woman\u2019s attention. \u201cDo you\u2026like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I like you, I wouldn\u2019t be here with you if I didn\u2019t think you were a nice person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s\u2026not quite what I mean\u2026do you like me like me?\u201d Olga asked, \u201cAs in do you think I am attractive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa blushed a bit at this. \u201cWell\u2026yes, you are very pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Olga\u2019s turn to blush this time; \u201cWell\u2026thank you. You see though\u2026I am not sure I am\u2026well\u2026attracted to woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Quessa replied, \u201cDo you mean I am not pretty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had to backpedal quickly at this. \u201cNo no no! You look adorable! It\u2019s just\u2026do you have naga men?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMen?\u201d Quessa stated quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, broad shoulders, no breasts\u2026you use human men to lift the big platforms\u2026\u201d Olga tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Them\u2026wait do you mean\u2026you have two sexes?\u201d Quessa looked serious right now, deadly serious. Olga simply nodded at this. \u201cWoah! I totally need to write this down\u2026darn the one time I forget my notes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Olga\u2019s turn to chuckle now. \u201cWell, basically I like men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026so there are no all-women couples in humans?\u201d Quessa asked, she was clearly finding this all fascinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga paused and thought; there was that pair of farmers who visited the tavern a few times, they were from the southernmost part of Racovania and were both women. \u201cThere are some\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026I guess you are not one of them then.\u201d Quessa asked rhetorically. She sounded quite down about this. Olga thought to herself, did Quessa more than like her, did she actually love her? Had she just broken the heart of this poor woman who had only tried to make a good impression?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga felt pretty guilty about that, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She found men attractive, not women; and certainly not woman who were half reptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the as the silence couldn\u2019t get any more awkward between them there was a sudden interruption. \u201cEnjoy!\u201d cooed the curvy waitress who had slithered up with their meals, dropping the plates on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga salivated, triceratops rump\u2026dam she had never known she could love something so much until she had come to this city. Without wasting a second Olga began to dig in, ripping the meat from her utensils and gulping it down like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blonde woman wolfed down another hearty mouthful she looked across at Quessa delicately eating her food. She was awfully cute, eating virtually like a prim princess.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olga was, suffice to say, very overwhelmed when she first saw all the festivities involved in the rainy season. To begin with, the capital city was far busier than a small little village like Racovania. In fact, Olga could not recall a time when she saw so many people at once. Then there was the fact that she was the one that everyone was gawking at. Being the only human among naga folk certainly would do that. Olga felt a tad embarrassed being stared at constantly. Quessa hardly noticed and seemed to ignore it. She merely continued about her way, showing Olga all the sights, sounds, and especially food involved with the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really have to wear this now?\" Olga said, referring to her rainy season garb. It was far too loose on her and she had to hold it up most of the time as they walked. \"I don't think I'm going to get big enough in one day to hold it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa laughed. \"No, of course not, but you'll want something with room to grow to help ease the digestion. For the next several weeks, we're going to be feasting almost non-stop. Trust me, you'll grow into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga sighed. She wasn't exactly keen on the idea, but she was willing to respect their culture. More importantly, if what Quessa said was true, then she would need the extra weight to keep sustained through the dry season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the two of them passed by so many stalls. A few sold a few trinkets and items such as last-minute rainy season clothes, jewelry, toys, and noisemakers for the children. But most of them sold food, and lots of it. Quessa wasn't kidding when she said that the rainy season brought in many crops. Fruits, vegetables, baked goods, and plenty of meats were all available, and cost next to nothing. In fact, very few vendors actually charged them for the food. Being close to the queen's high priestess did come with that benefit. Most of them just felt sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, aren't you a skinny, little monkey,\" one said to her before pushing a pile of foods that Olga didn't have names for onto her. \"Here you go. Well, go on, eat. There's plenty there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll help fatten y'all up,\" another hearty merchant said. \"Can't have the high priestess going hungry, now can we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like that all day. Olga tried to keep up, but there were two problems standing in her way. The first was she wasn't used to this tradition. She hadn't built up the stomach capacity to eat as much as Quessa could. Second, Quessa and the other nagas could open their jaws incredibly wide to intake massive amounts of food. The priestess had even explained that they could eat entire animals whole this way. It made Olga want to hurl the first time she saw it. But, nonetheless, she could not accomplish this feat. Still, she tried to keep up and eat as much as she could. But, she was starting to hit a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling alright?\" Quessa said, when she noticed Olga was starting to look a little green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just...ohhh,\" Olga moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga was at her side in an instant. She looked at the human's outstretched and engorged middle. \"You poor thing!\" she gasped, touching it gingerly to find that there was no more room left in there. She would've burst for sure if she had eaten anymore. \"Here, let's sit down and digest for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa led the former waitress to a set of benches where Olga could lay back, letting her throbbing stomach lay reclined. Every breath seemed to hurt. \"I'm sorry,\" she said between labored gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" the naga said. \"This is your first rainy season. Happens to the best of us. Here, let me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two of her free hands, Quessa helped to rub the taut sphere. If Olga wasn't in such pain, she would've objected to such close physical contact. But god, did that help so much! She lay back and let out a pleasurable sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga giggled. \"Didn't know you'd like that so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It helps,\" Olga muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa was silent for a moment, collecting her thoughts. \"I'm sorry,\" she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I should not have expected you to have feelings for me from the very beginning. I did not mean to be so forthright the other day,\" she explained. \"I mean, we've only just met and all. I understand if...if you'll never come to like me. I do not understand your people fully, and I should have perhaps thought of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga felt incredibly sorry for her naga companion. She knew she had upset her that day she had explained she did not like women. In fact, this was the first day the naga had seemed like her perky self once more, and perhaps that was just all the festivities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too,\" Olga said. \"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. It's just...so very new to me. I mean, one minute I'm all alone in my old village, and now I'm here among all these naga. It's a lot to take in. And, it's not that I don't like you at all. I think you're terrific. You've been nothing but kind to me since I came here. And, look...it's going to take a while, but...I think...I could like you more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" A vibrance seemed to come back to her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I'd like to... Let's start from the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beginning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga smiled coyly. \"Hi, I'm Olga.\" She held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa smiled back. \"Hello, Olga. I am Quassa.\" She shook her hand eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat quietly for a while, feeling like a certain tension had been released. And speaking of tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm feeling better now,\" Olga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good. I predicted something like this might happen. I brought a few potions with me. They'll help give your stomach more capacity for food. Because, after all, every night of the season, there's a grand feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feast?\" Olga wasn't so sure she could take even more eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga nodded. \"Yup, and we'll get to be at the best feasts of all. We get to eat in the queen's tent. She has the biggest feasts during the season. I guess, she has to now. After all, she's not just getting big for the rainy season. She has to make sure she has enough for the little ones. Oooh, look at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would never cease to surprise Olga how easily distracted Quessa could get. They were standing in front of a jewelry stand. The naga was busy examining a lapis lazuli necklace. \"Here, try this on,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga put on the finery, and had to admit, it was pretty, and it did look good with her dress. Quessa smiled. \"It suits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former waitress smiled back. True, there was a lot to get used to in this new and strange land, but with Quessa by her side, maybe she could learn to like it...and more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time passed deeper and deeper into the rainy season in the Motee Marshes. Olga soon found out why it was called that, the raindrops were like pellets of lead some days, thundering down outside her new home and creating a pleasant rumble on the rooftop. But the passage of time during the rainy season yielded more than just excess water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you it would fit.\u201d Quessa teased as she saw Olga entering their living room. The naga\u2019s predictions regarding Olga\u2019s increase in girth was right on the money, the blonde woman had swollen up like a balloon. With fattening food thrust upon her, and a culture that pretty much demanded she were eating all the time, Olga was now looking heavier than even her former boss. Olga had become big and very very round, in fact she was struggling to be able to make her fingers touch if she tried to grab all of her monster belly now. Not that Quessa hadn't had her own share of seasonal pounds; the scientific naga was now sporting the same kind of girth as Olga was. Her belly was round and lapped over the waist of her loincloth and her backside had swollen immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still *huff*\u2026a little loose\u2026\u201d Olga puffed as she waddled slowly forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot after today it won\u2019t.\u201d Quessa tutted knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga raised an eyebrow, \u201cI can\u2019t get fat <i>that</i> fast you know\u2026thought you were supposed to be an expert on human anatomy.\u201d She remarked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I am\u2026but today is the day of the grand feast, and you are going to need that last bit of stretching room.\u201d Quessa responded. Olga meanwhile gulped, what had the naga got planned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both women were ready they headed out for the palace, as Quessa was a high priestess she was supposed to have her grand feast in the palace itself alongside the other high priestesses and the queen herself. Olga had not seen queen Coatlzintli since she had arrived, so it might be nice for her to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the palace was quite arduous for Olga, her legs were so caked with fat that she had to start swinging them a little as she walked, producing her little waddle. Quessa meanwhile had no legs, and therefore no such problem. Although it did make her booty bounce like crazy, something Olga caught herself staring at quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair arrived they were granted immediate entrance by the guards, who Olga noted were also looking fatter and much less threatening than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was not the kind of regalness Olga expected, it was built out of the same gold that all the other upper-class houses in the city were made from, but the biggest difference was the sheer volume of decorative plants. They covered the edges of each room they passed into, until they finally reached the great hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair entered Olga gasped at the sights; the ceiling was taller than any building she had ever entered, and there was an immense table littered with a multitude of freshly prepared animal carcasses, but the most striking sight was what laid at the far end of this table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli was reclined on an immense throne at the back, but if it wasn\u2019t for her signature color patterns Olga would have struggled to recognise her. The naga queen was fat, fatter than any naga so far, she looked like the pictures Olga had seen of whales in books; her tail was thick as a tree-trunk, her face round as a dinner plate with two additional chins, her arms looked like fresh hams tipped with little sausages for fingers\u2026but her belly\u2026what a belly. It seemed Coatzintli\u2019s pregnancy was going well; her majesties gravid tummy swelled forward like a ripe melon, resting on the steps to her throne as it protruded forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair took their seats Olga whispered to Quessa. \u201cDon\u2019t queens visit their guests?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga leaned back over, \u201cNormally yes, but our queen has taken herself beyond movement as of late, so she will just announce everyone\u2019s presence when all the other dignitaries have arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Coatzintli was having food passed to her from the table, rather than her moving to get it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair waited as more quests filed in and took their seats at the table. Once all the seats were filed the queen\u2019s attendant coughed and made an announcement. \u201cOur queen Coatzintli welcomes you all to her first rainy season feast! Remember it is customary that all shall finish their plates!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the attendant and then the queen spoke Olga gulped and looked up; in front of her was an entire water buffalo. The dam thing was bigger than she was! How was she supposed to eat all of <i>that</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the speech came to an end and there was movement abound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga watched as a naga slightly across from her bite down into her meal and began to unhinge her jaw. The blonde woman\u2019s eyes grew wide as saucers as she watched the snake-woman\u2019s mouth grow wider and wider as she began to envelope the carcass entirely with her lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her side Olga watched as Quessa was trying to do the same! It seemed she had to try\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully someone had been kind enough to give her cutlery, so Olga began to hurriedly cut great chunks out of the meal and wolfed them down with barely a chew. She mowed through the meat as fast as she could; making what she thought was excellent progress. Olga had been building up her appetite for the entire rainy season, all these rich foods all day had stretched her stomach until she found herself eating more than twice what she used to in a day! But this\u2026this was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga doubled over as best she could; her gut was in serious pain. She tried, she tried so hard to fit in but this was a physical barrier she couldn\u2019t cross. Far more of the meat remained than laid within her stomach. Why was she doing this? Eating till she felt like her gut would rupture just to impress a few snake-people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlga!\u201d Came a soft voice next to her, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear dribbled down Olga\u2019s fat cheek. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d she whimpered, \u201cI can\u2019t it\u2019s too much\u2026\u201d Olga then turned to look at Quessa and her tears temporarily ceased. The snake she had been sharing so much time with looked radically different; her belly was <b>enormous</b>; swollen to such an insane degree that the serpent was sitting sideways to allow her monster stomach to rest off the table\u2026and reach down all the way to the floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour\u2026your stomach\u2026\u201d Olga mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Quessa brushed off, \u201cThis is what we have been practicing all rainy season for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman sniffled; Quessa had been eating a lot for this feast to prove herself, and now Olga was wimping out. Olga looked again at the food and shook her head, \u201cI can\u2019t eat anymore\u2026\u201d she wept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought this might happen\u2026here\u2026\u201d Quessa noted as she reached into a satchel by her side. \u201cDrink this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026it hurts\u2026\u201d Olga sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but this should ease the pain\u2026a few sips should make your stomach have enough stretch to help you digest properly.\u201d Quessa explained as Olga looked at her quizzically. \u201cIt\u2019s something we use for young naga who can\u2019t stretch their bellies enough the first time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga graciously took hold of the bottle of potion and looked at it. This was why she was so concerned about finishing this, she wanted to make sure Quessa saved face and didn\u2019t look bad in front of her peers\u2026Olga cared for her. Looking again at the bottle Olga turned back to Quessa; \u201cWhat would happen if I drank all of it?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it would give your belly some serious stretch\u2026but you don\u2019t need to\u2026\u201d But before Quessa could even finish her sentence, Olga had downed the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt weird; Olga grunted as the potion filed her drum-tight belly even more\u2026but then the pain faded. A small golden glow then enveloped Olga\u2019s fat stomach and a familiar feeling came over it. \u201cQuessa\u2026\u201d Olga stated, \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u2026\u201d And with that Olga returned to her meal, attacking it with the same gusto she had at the beginning, but this time nothing could stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga ate and ate and ate, her belly swelling like a ripening fruit before everyone\u2019s eyes. There was a slight hitch when it started to bump into her chin, but Olga just spread her legs wider and her belly dropped to the floor, hitting it with a dull thud as she continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunger was incredible, she even cracked the bones of the buffalo to suck out the nutritious marrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more she ate until barely scraps remained. Sure her plate still had broken bones on it while everyone else\u2019s were empty, but that she be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping to drop her cutlery, Olga leaned back. But as she did her belly <i>still</i> remained in full view, cresting her horizon like the morning sun. It was huge, bigger than the buffalo she had just consumed, she was literally more belly than woman at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Olga began to feel her eyelids droop and grow heavy. \u201cQuessa\u2026\u201d Olga mumbled deliriously. As Quessa leaned in Olga turned her head to give her a dopey grin. \u201cI have something important to tell you.\u201d She hazily mumbled. \u201cI lo\u2026I lov\u2026I\u2026I think I am going to sleep now\u2026\u201d And with that Olga blacked out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing Olga saw upon awakening was her enormous belly, which now seemed to cover her entire view. The swelling had gone down considerably since the feast, however long that was, but now she was left with a mass of wobbling fat nearly pinning her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga grunted and struggled to try and sit up. She couldn't get the momentum going to roll herself up. \"Oof,\" she grunted, giving up, and just resigning to lie there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her pudgy fingers kneed and poke at her expanse. She was now a pile of flab, everything squishing beneath her fingers. Easily, she was twice her size since the festival, she had eaten so much. Speaking of eating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach began to growl with a loud rumble. Finally, Quessa was at her side. \"Oh, good, you're up,\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga had to come around to Olga's side for her to see the priestess in full view. If Olga was twice her size since the feast, Quessa had gotten to about three times her size. She was now incredibly wide, her massive backside taking several seconds to stop quivering after she came to a stop. Her gut was even bigger than Olga's drooping down, almost touching the floor when she stood, and folded into several rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga leaned back on the pillows and groaned. \"How long have I been asleep?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, only a couple days,\" Quessa said. \"You really outdid yourself at the feast. I'm surprised you didn't go into a longer food coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days!\" Olga said in disbelief. \"I've been asleep that long! Well...how did I get back here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she had ended up back in their home, sleeping comfortably on the large bed, which she was surprised could hold her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga chuckled. \"Well, everyone kind of gets that way at the big feast. The queen always prepares for this. She had some of her stronger servants carry guests back on litters. I'm really impressed, Olga. The way you ate back there, it was amazing. And just look at you! I don't want to sound too optimistic, but you look like you'll do just fine through the dry season.\" She let her four hands start exploring Olga's expanse, gently prodding her bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had gotten used to this. All through the rainy season, Quessa had massaged and rubbed her belly to help ease any tension and pain. She had gotten to where she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled again. \"I'm kind of hungry,\" Olga said. \"Maybe some of that potion is wearing off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess smiled. \"Well, your stomach will always be this stretched now that you've taken the potion. There's no reversing it. And, unfortunately, it is the start of the dry season now, meaning food isn't going to be as plentiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\" was all she could say. Not only was she going to be this bottomless pit, constantly craving massive quantities of food, now she wasn't going to be able to satisfy those hungers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Quessa sensed her concern. \"Don't worry. It's not like you're going to starve. We still have food in the store houses. Part of the harvest festival was storing away enough food to last through the dry season. But, building the extra fat stores in our bodies helps us be able to ration those foods without having to worry about losing energy. I'll have a nice lunch prepared for us at once. It won't be as much as you're hoping for, unfortunately, but it'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how long am I going to be this big?\" Olga asked. Now that she thought about it, she was perhaps as big as Tora was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt bad. This whole rainy season, she hadn't asked about Tora. That was perhaps a good thing, since she wasn't nagging Quessa constantly about her, but now she missed her sister again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most of the weight will burn off as you live off of small meals and your fat stores, but most of us still end up a little chubbier than when we started a year ago. I wouldn't worry too much about it. You look simply beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga blushed. \"Um, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess smiled, continuing to knead Olga's fat lovingly. \"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you were about to say something, back at the festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Yes...you were trying to tell me something, just before you went into your food coma. I think you were trying to tell me something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashes of memories came back to her. Between the memories of gorging and stuffing herself, she did somewhat remember having certain feelings, and a special something she was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that?\" Olga said, a warmth rising in her cheeks. \"Well, I mean, I was pretty dazed after all the food. I don't know where that came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa's face started to fall. \"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Olga recovered. \"Oh, no, no, I didn't mean anything bad. I just mean that I say stuff that's on my mind when I don't know what I'm doing. But, I don't know, I kinda meant it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was it you meant?\" the naga asked, an even bigger grin creeping to her face.</span></div></div>",

However, that...th-that all ch-changed...when I first met you, Quessa,\" Olga elaborated, fidgeting with her now chubby fingers, as well as expressing a profusely noticeable blush in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Quessa still had that expressive grin plastered upon her plump Caucasian face of her's, where she slowly slithered towards Olga and coyly queried, \"Oh? And what is it about me that changed, dear Olga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Olga easily felt the metaphorical butterflies in her stomach growing in number, as she then spoke toward the now rotund Naga Priestess of Knowledge and shakingly explained, \"...W-Well, um... When w-we first met outside the temple, I-I was very protective of my sister, along with being a little c-cowardly. B-But...eventually, I...I-I began to know you a little more with each passing m-moment we spent to-together, I... Quessa, I...I...I, um...I -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as she was about to stutter her way through the words coming out of her own mouth, Olga suddenly felt Quessa press her substantially larger form against her own corpulent physique, with the rotund Naga Priestess interlocking all four of her hands with Olga's plump hands, where Quessa stared longingly into Olga's own eyes, still expressing a gleeful fanged grin on her lips as she quipped, \"It's alright, my dear Olga... Let your heart speak out for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I....I l-love...y-y-you, Quessa. I am d-deeply in love with you,\" Olga hesitantly confessed, the blushing on her plump cheeks greatly increasing in volume, size, and hue. From there, as if out of pure instinct, both Olga and Quessa swiftly began to passionately kiss one another, despite being hindered somewhat by their now burgeoning bellies, rolling around a little on the large bed in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Olga had felt like a great weight had been lifted from her now substantially larger form, as her chubby hands wandered and began to playfully grope some of Quessa's belly flab, causing Quessa to exhale these pleasured moans as Olga went to town on her belly blubber. And throughout the entire night, the two women were certainly and vividly enjoying each other's company. That is, until they've both passed out on the bed from exhaustion, still wrapped in a loving embrace with one another.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A wise man once said, \"Time flies for those who enjoy their lives\". And for the now substantially larger Olga Forgedotter, those such words weren't far from the truth. Ever since she had confessed her affections toward the the corpulent High Priestess of Knowledge, Quessa, Olga began to feel more comfortable around Quessa and possibly other Nagas as well. Although, despite her increased body mass and weight, Olga managed to adjust fairly well to her newly acquired almost elephantine physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Olga did acquire some assistance courtesy of Quessa from time to time when it came to properly standing up from the stone stools in her new dwellings, especially since her newly established apron of a belly often tended to weigh her down at times. Plus, the potion she drank during the Rainy Season Festival had a permanent effect on her physiology, not just giving her a greatly increased stomach capacity, but also an increased appetite as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this left Olga with quite a gluttonous hunger, enough to potentially store a whole Triceratops hatchling in her stomach if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all of the extra bulk and padding began to take somewhat of a toll on the obese female chef, often leaving her quite exhausted during those long leisurely strolls around the Keiku Bazaar and the city of Vaal-Za'haraam as a whole. Fortunately for Olga, Quessa easily noticed her lover's feelings of complete exhaustion, so she decided to give the human another potion, only this concoction was brewed to enhance a malnourished Naga's muscle density and strength. Suffice to say, it was very effective upon the morbidly obese female chef, feeling as if she could lift a horse above her head with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Quessa &amp; Olga's Dwellings, Temple of Knowledge</b><br>\r\n<b>Vaal-Za'haraam, Motee Marshes</b><br>\r\n<b>Two Weeks After The End Of The Rainy Season</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Olga had certainly \"packed on the pounds\" was certainly an understatement these days, as she casually stood up and sluggishly dismounted her corpulent self from the large stone bed. Of course, it was thanks to that Muscle Enhancement potion that Quessa gave to her earlier that she is still able to get out of bed without assistance. Otherwise, she might as well be rendered immobile by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Well, another beautiful morning, and another day to be hauling this mass of flesh around,\" Olga quipped to herself, feeling the undercarriage of her hefty apron belly, and jiggling it mildly out of mere amusement. After all, Quessa was certainly enjoying feeling her at her current size and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga calmly waddled her way toward a nearby full body mirror, gazing her widened reflection, where she jokingly decided to pull off a few sexy poses in front of the mirror, giggling a little in the process as she chirped, \"Still can't believe there are people out there who find girls at my size to be sexy. *giggle*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, before she could continue, as if on cue, Olga soon heard her blubbery stomach growling profusely, demanding to be fed with something juicy and full of flavor. \"Alright, alright, I'll get you something to eat,\" Olga said to her irritated stomach, gently patting it, as she then calmly waddled off toward the kitchen, her burgeoning hips sashaying from left to right with each waddling step she made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Olga was now wearing a green and white bra and loincloth ensemble, and the ensemble had these silver spiral engravings all over the bra and loincloth. Once she made her way into the kitchen, she could see that someone already cooked her a juicy meal, which came in the form of a Triceratops rump roast splayed out on a bronze platter. Needless to say, it definitely got Olga's mouth drooling with gluttonous anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, just as she then began to voraciously tear into the platter of succulent Triceratops meat, Olga soon heard Quessa slither her way into the lofty dwellings, bearing an excited fanged grin on her cherubic face, where she eagerly slithered behind the rotund female chef, wrapping her four plump arms around Olga in a loving embrace as she chirped, \"Good morning, my beloved Olga. Did you sleep well last night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Chomp, then gulp* Certainly, sweetie! Especially with you around for company,\" Olga retorted, planting an affectionate kiss upon Quessa's chubby right cheek in response, just as the corpulent Naga Priestess calmly severed the loving embrace, where she then slithered her way to an adjacent stone stool and sat her fattened rump down upon the stone stool alongside her beloved Olga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what's with the fanged grin on that beautiful chubby face of yours, honey?\" Olga queried, curious to know why Quessa was much more ecstatic than her usual peppy self, just as the rotund female chef took another large bite out of the Triceratops rump roast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what she wasn't expecting today was what Quessa said to her as the corpulent Naga Priestess gleefully chirped, \"Well, I have some rather excellent news, my dear Olga! Your sister, Tora, is quickly showing signs of consciousness!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, upon hearing such a revelation, Olga accidentally swallowed a large chunk of Triceratops meat without properly chewing it up first, choking on the succulent meat for a brief moment or two. Fortunately, she managed to recover from the brief ordeal fairly quickly, where she quickly stopped eating, stood up as fast as her nearly elephantine physique would allow her, looking at her beloved Quessa and exclaimed, \"TORA'S WAKING UP!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Olga quickly waddled up towards the equally rotund Quessa, grabbed both of the Naga's lower hands, and quickly said, \"Quessa! That's the best news I've heard today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* I'm glad to see that you're happy with such a revelation, my love,\" Quessa retorted, where she then proceeded to hug the corpulent female chef, despite size of their bellies hindering such an endeavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Olga then looked back up towards her equally large lover and asked, \"Thank you so much, Quessa! Is there any chance that I can see her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after hearing what Olga said, Quessa soon spoke toward the almost elephantine female chef and explained...</span></div></div>",

But she IS indeed subconsciously responding to the healing process quite well. Of course, we'll have to take into account Tora's state of mental health and trauma. Plus, we will also have to -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quessa! You're rambling to yourself again,\" Olga retorted, easily snapping the substantially larger Naga Priestess out of her quirky science-fueled ramblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to her betrothed's statement, Quessa looked back at the rotund Olga and embarrassingly quipped, \"Oops! *giggle* My bad, love. Force of habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...do I have permission to see my sister again?\" Olga asked, wanting to know if Quessa would be willing to allow her to see her sister once again after all this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the corpulent female chef, Quessa gave a firm affirmative nod and complied, \"To put it bluntly, my beloved Olga... Yes, you can see your sister. After all, it is the reason why I have come to you personally with such information first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Queen Coatzintli already know about my sister's current state?\" Olga queried, especially since the Naga Queen was in fact the one who both brought them to Vaal-Za'haraam and allow Tora to be taken care of by the Priestesses here in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such a question, Quessa nodded once more and explained, \"She soon will be, my dear. I've been sending her Highness several reports of my progress to her via messenger bird for several weeks at this point, updating her from time to time on your sister's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other words, my love: We can head over to the Spirit Room to see your sister right now...if you want to, of course,\" Quessa answered, letting Olga know that she can visit her sister at any time she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the corpulent female chef wanted to see her beloved sibling as soon as humanly possible, where she then promptly spoke toward the rotund Naga Priestess and retorted, \"Right now, you mean? Of course I want to see her, Quessa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* I figured you would say that, sweetie,\" Quessa chirped, speaking with a flirtatious tone in her voice, just as Olga soon followed closely behind the rotund Naga Priestess, easily getting a clear view of Quessa's humongous scaly derriere with relative ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as they calmly made their way toward the Spirit Room, Olga felt this eerily minor itching sensation from one of her large thighs. Of course, she instinctively scratched the source of the itch for a brief moment, where it oddly enough, began to cease it's dry assault on her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... That was...weird.\" Olga thought to herself, deciding to inevitably ignore such an odd feeling for the time being. After all, she needed to see her beloved sister Tora as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, both Olga and Quessa made their way inside the spacious Spirit Room, where they noticed a few of the other Naga Priestesses patiently waiting for their superior's commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please wait outside, my fellow priestesses,\" Quessa commanded, where the Naga Priestesses firmly obliged with her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saluted her as they bluntly retorted, \"By your command, High Priestess Quessa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the remaining Naga Priestesses calmly slithered their way out of the Spirit Room with relative ease, despite their increased girths. Now that they were the only ones within the room, Olga slowly approached her obese unconscious sister, gently caressing her now longer hair with her somewhat plump hands and fingers, where she calmly spoke toward the unconscious Tora splayed out before her and said, \"Tora... Tora, please wake up. It's...I-It's me: Olga, your sister. Don't you remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of slowly regaining consciousness, Tora, despite now weighing much more than she previously remembered, suddenly shot up from the stone slab, screaming her lungs off, as if she was experiencing a vivid nightmare. Of course, Tora quickly responded to her sister's psychological trauma, quickly grabbing her hands as she exclaimed, \"Tora! Tora, Stop!! IT'S OKAY YOU'RE SAFE!! IT'S ME, OLGA!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for both Olga and Quessa, Tora was able to somewhat calm down upon hearing her sister's voice, her eyes darting from left to right, stopping when she finally gazed upon her sister, who was bearing a grateful teary-eyed grin on her plump cherubic face, as Tora finally spoke her first words in quite a while as she quiveringly said, \"...O-Olga?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to her sister saying her name, the tears of joy running down Olga's chubby face continued to flow, where she nodded in confirmation once or twice, causing both siblings to quickly hug one another in a loving familial embrace, like two lovers who have been separated but finally reunited after quite a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tora...oh, Tora, I'm so relieved to see you once more. *sob* Y-You've had me all worried to no end!\" Olga sobbed, greatly relieved to see her beloved sibling very much awake after what felt like months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Tora placed a plump hand upon her younger sister's chubby left cheek in reassurance, where she then looked at Olga and shakingly replied, \"*sob* It is so good to finally see you again as well, little sis.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, slowly but surely, Tora eventually began to notice a lot of things that seemed off about...well everything she was seeing in her peripheral vision, and the first thing she noticed was...</span></div></div>",

Though Quessa looked like her typical, perky, and jolly self, seeing what was essentially a snake-woman with sharp teeth did nothing to ease Tora's nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, what on earth is that!\" she cried. She looked around at the magnificent temple. \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had a feeling this wouldn't be an easy transition. \"Well, I kind of struck a deal with the queen of the nagas to set you free,\" she answered. \"This is Quessa, a high priestess. She was the one who brought you out of that...whatever that spell was the vampires used on you. Don't worry, she's friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora only mouthed a few syllables, unable to process it all. \"F-friendly?\" she said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. Anyway, part of the deal was I come here to the capital city to be the queen's personal chef, so that's why we're here. You're actually in the Temple of Knowledge, which Quessa is a part of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa took that as her cue to slither up. \"It is finally a treat to meet the sister of dear Olga. Here' let me help you up.\" She came around behind Tora and helped push her into a sitting position. Her immense flab shifted and settled as she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods!\" Tora moaned, running her hands through her own fat. \"It's worse than I thought.\" She then looked at Olga. \"Olga, you're...you're huge too! I know what happened to me...sort of, but how...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this juncture, Olga's stomach began to growl once more. She rubbed her gut, trying to sooth it like a whining dog. \"Maybe we can discuss that over something to eat. Surely, you're pretty hungry too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa and Olga helped Tora get from the temple to their home, which was no easy task. True, Olga and Tora were roughly the same size, but Olga at least had been up and about, getting used to carrying her weight, and the potions also helped. Tora, unfortunately, having been bed-bound by the vampires, and in a coma for some time in the naga city, found her muscles unable to really help her get around. They had to order a litter to be prepared to carry her back. Tora didn't like this at all, as she was still unsure of the naga, and she was embarrassed to consciously be aware that she was too fat to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pleasant lunch was prepared for the trio, and Olga ate voraciously, all the while, telling her sister of the events that followed after Tora was whisked away by the vampires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anyway, there's this big rainy season here, and during that time, it's important to eat as much as you can to store as fat for the dry season, which is going on now,\" Olga said, licking her fingers after having finished another hearty helping of triceratops meat. \"And, that's how I got to looking like this.\" She grabbed a handful of her stomach and wobbled it for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora was still in a bit of shock. There was so much to take in. She was in this immense city out in the middle of gods knew where, with nagas of all people. She had just been rescued from what she had assumed was an endless fate in the hands of Cameena Stranken. Her sister had bargained her own life away to save her. And to top it all off, the two of them were now round, fat, balls of flesh. Still, there was one thing that she couldn't just sit idly by and say nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've...you've married this naga, I mean, Quessa?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it's actually worked out for the better. I really do love her,\" Olga said, already anticipating her sister's next question. \"I mean, at first it was just part of the deal, but I guess it just felt right after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora shook her head. \"I can't say I really understand it, Olga, but if it's what makes you happy, then I'm happy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it,\" Quessa said, coming up behind Olga and taking her plate for her. \"Dear me, Olga, I don't know what I'm going to do about this appetite of yours.\" She tickled the side of her belly. \"You may just end up staying cute and chubby like this all the time. I could like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga laughed. \"Maybe. Those appetite enhancers really have made it hard to keep full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that'll be good news come next rainy season. You can eat all you want then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're really staying here?\" Tora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga could see her pained expression. She knew her sister missed their home, their forge, and all their friends. She wasn't sure how to say it. \"Well, yes. I mean, I did promise myself as the queen's cook, and I don't think I could ever bring myself to force Quessa to leave her position as a high priestess just to come back to the north with me.\" Tora winced a little. So, she had assumed that they would leave without Quessa. \"And, I kind of like it here.\" She said this one quickly, hoping not to upset her. \"It's warm, it's nice, no vampires...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora sighed. This wasn't exactly what she had planned. Then again, what did she have planned. Before, she was trapped under the spell of Cameena, so escape wasn't happening that way. But, this didn't exactly feel like joyful freedom either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it a try,\" Olga said, resting her hand over her sister's. \"I think you'll come to like it.\"</span></div></div>",

It's okay if you don't want to talk about it, but I just wanted to know how it all happened...that is, if you remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora took a deep breath, unsure where to start. She did remember bits and pieces of the ordeal, though most of what she remembered happened early on. \"Well, I'll tell you this, it wasn't at all what I expected,\" she began. \"She didn't say much on the way back to her manor, and I think she just wanted to let me dangle a bit, get myself worked up. I really thought she would just drain me as soon as we got in there. But, that's when things got weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told me she was hungry, and I was waiting for it. I knew this would be the end. Instead, she bid me to follow her to one of the other chambers. Damus preserve me, that's when I saw what really happened to all those poor girls who get taken. She took me to see this one, probably could've once been an adorable little brunette when she was first taken. Now, the poor thing was a useless blob, big as the bed she was laying on. All she could do was lay there and eat. I've never seen someone so big. Cameena was just thrilled with how big her 'cattle' had gotten, and that's when she sunk her fangs into the girl's belly and began to drink. I thought I would be sick right there. Course, the girl was so fat, I don't think she felt a thing, thank the gods. When she finished, that's when Cameena explained that the vampires don't kill their prey, at least not for a long while. It makes sense, now that you think about it. They'd have to steal a girl every night if they did that. Instead, they keep them and only drink a small amount, just enough to leave them alive. But why just drink a few drops, you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why they fatten them up. The bigger they are, the more blood they produce, and the longer they can provide food for the vampires. They only kill them at grand feasts when they invite a good number of their kin. It's only then that they take an incredibly fat one, like the one laying before me and drain her dry. It just so happened that the reason I was taken was because Cameena had just hosted a feast the week before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't done with the tour yet, and she wasn't done with me. She took me back down to the dining room, where I got to see some of the more 'newly' acquired girls. A feast fit for the king was set out, and all of them were gorging on it like food wouldn't exist tomorrow. Each of the girls were at various stages of plump and fat as they devoured each morsel of food. Cameena explained that some of these girls ate of their own free will to avoid Cameena's wrath. Some even grew to enjoy it. Others had to be put under a hypnotic curse, which caused them to eat constantly, sometimes near to the point of bursting. That was when I saw her impish slaves drag one girl away from the feast, her stomach round like a boulder, and quivering like it would pop at the drop of a needle. She tried to fight back and run back to the feast to continue gorging. It was unearthly some of the sounds she made, like some wild boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cameena then gave me a choice, and asked if I would eat willingly or if I would have to become a dumb beast like that girl. For the time being, I decided it was better to have my wits about me. Perhaps I could find a way to escape. For the next several weeks, I stayed in the manor, being forced to eat heavy meals five times a day so that I could gain weight quick enough for Cameena's liking. She was eager to try my blood, and wanted me 'healthy' enough to endure the ordeal. That was...that was the hardest part. I've never felt anything like that first time she bit me. It was this rush of pleasure mixed with pain all at once. It was horrible. I still have fevered nightmares because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite the fact that I was getting significantly larger, I still had the ability to go about the castle, and so long as Cameena didn't require my services, or it wasn't meal time, I was free to wander about as I pleased. That's when I thought I found my chance. I had found an open window in the manor, and I began gathering bed sheets to make a rope to climb down and escape during the night. I don't know how, but Cameena caught wind of my plans. She decided that I needed to be made into a more obedient pet, and that's when she put me under the curse. I don't remember much else beyond that...just memories of lots of food. I wake up months later, and I see what it's done to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora began to sob uncontrollably at the thought of all the torture she had undergone. Olga was at her side, stroking her shoulder. It was odd, she thought, now she was the one having to take care of her sister like an older sibling. \"It's alright, Tora,\" she said soothingly. \"You're away from all that now. She can't hurt you. According to the queen, she's not going to be hurting much of anyone else anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But look at me!\" Tora wailed. \"I'm an enormous fat cow! I can't even get up without your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga remained firm in her reassurance. \"In case you've forgotten, I'm as big as you are now. It's okay, it really is. I love you all the same, and it doesn't look all that bad. Like I said, it'll help a lot during the dry season here. And Quessa, I'm sure has more of the potion she gives me to help me get around, isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa nodded. \"Of course. I'll send for some right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora sniffed. \"I just don't know. This is all so sudden and frightening to me. Olga, how am I going to handle this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it for right now. We'll figure something out. Right now, all that matters is that you're here, and not with Cameena anymore.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tora could adjust to a lot of these new changes. She actually found the south much more pleasant than Racovania, both for the warmer weather, and the fact that there were no more vampires. Despite her initial reservations about the naga, she had adjusted to that as well. They weren't a brutal race, nor were they malicious to others. They were just isolated, and preferred to stay that way, meaning that invaders and unwelcome visitors often saw their brutality. But, Olga and Tora were guests, and they therefore received a lot of the local hospitality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could even accept her sister's full immersion into the culture. Olga always was the sort to find the silver lining and wonder in all things, so it didn't come as a surprise to Tora that her sister actually liked living among the naga. Most of the time, Olga was busy working in the queen's kitchens, so they only saw each other early in the mornings or late in the evenings, meaning Tora usually had to find ways to occupy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't come as easily. True, the potions Quessa had given Tora helped her at least have the strength to get up and move around on her own, but the fact of the matter was that she was still an enormous ball of fat at the end of the day. Cameena had taken everything from her: her freedom, her will, and her body. She tried to stay strong for Olga, but at night, when she was totally alone, she sobbed uncontrollably for all that had happened to her at the hands of that vicious bloodsucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, even with the added movement thanks to the potions, Tora could find little to do to occupy herself with. She didn't have a job like Olga did, and the nagas had their own ways of weapon making. Her smithing skills wouldn't come in handy here. There was very little to do about town, and therefore, she didn't exactly make any new friends. The only people she saw were Quessa and Olga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the hardest thing to adjust to. Tora had been prepared for a lot of the unusual changes that she woke up to, but seeing her sister in a relationship with the naga priestess was something she would never have dreamed of in a million years. To begin with, she had never pictured Olga being the type to like women. All the times she could remember teasing her sister about potential dates had always been about the young men in the town: the strapping son of the woodcutter or the tall and strong butcher's boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, the fact that Olga so willingly loved a naga made this incredibly awkward. Though Tora no longer feared them, she didn't exactly find them all that appealing in appearance either. Scaly bodies that slithered around and made her skin crawl seemed like the least attractive thing in her mind. Those serpentine faces didn't exactly do much for their looks either, she thought. Yet, Olga acted as if it were nothing, and would openly make out with Quessa any chance she got. Throw in the fact that both women were incredibly large, Olga now more so than Quessa, and it just felt incredibly odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the other thing Tora noticed. It seemed that as the dry season progressed, Quessa had been right: most of the naga slowly lost all their rainy season weight, including herself. The naga priestess was starting to look a tad less round, still heavy for sure, but starting to shrink. Olga, on the other hand, had remained just as fat as the day Tora had woken up, if not fatter. Despite the fact that there wasn't as much food to go around as there was during rainy season, Quessa had seen to it that Olga was well cared for and well-fed. Tora had heard what the naga sometimes called humans: hairless monkeys. She and Olga, though, looked more like pink pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Olga minded. She was still able to get up, go out, and enjoy life. She ate whatever she wanted, and Quessa still loved her all the same. What wasn't there to enjoy about this life? Not that Tora had lost all that much weight herself. Nothing seemed to change in the slightest for her. But Olga seemed content to remain fat and happy, and that concerned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Olga was just finishing the hearty dinner Quessa had prepared for them. Tora had picked at her food, not having found the odd meats they ate all that appetizing. Her sister had eaten until she was stuffed like the fat geese their neighbor used to raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wonderful. I really needed that after a long day at the palace,\" Olga said, licking meat juices off her fingers and rubbing her gut with her other free hand. At this rate, Olga would eclipse Tora's size easily by the next rainy season, and gods forbid what would happen then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa sat beside Olga, helping her rub her distended belly with her two free hands, the two nuzzling each other's foreheads. Tora thought she was going to be sick. The naga poked a little. \"Oh really?\" she teased. \"It looks to me like someone might have been snacking in the kitchens today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta taste test my stuff. After all, I'm supposed to be making only the best for the queen. She's almost due you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, I'm aware. I'm supposed to put together a blessing ceremony when the little ones arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be something Quessa wanted to say right then and there, but couldn't bring herself to do it. But Tora noticed. She wondered what sort of intentions the naga had for her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga yawned. \"Well, we'd best get some sleep. I need to be with it tomorrow. I was almost falling asleep making sauces today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loving couple got up and waddled/slithered to their bedroom, leaving Tora still dumbfounded, much like she was every night. What did Olga see in her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tora eventually decided that it was now or never. She had to have some way to understand what was going on with her sister. Maybe if she heard Olga's side of the story, she would get it. If not, then maybe she would be able to at least respect her decision. She took a deep breath and plunged for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had been given the day off, for now anyway. The naga queen had gone into her state of laying her hundreds of eggs, and clearly wasn't in a mood for eating anything right now, so overtaken by the ordeal. Quessa had been sent for to be at the queen's side and offer particular blessings and remedies. That left Tora completely alone with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I wanted to ask you something, and try not to get mad about it, okay?\" Tora began, sitting beside Olga, but then scooting back a bit when she felt the uncomfortable squish of both of their bulks squeezing together. \"But, what exactly is going on with you and Quessa? I mean, I know you're married and all, but how does that even come about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem to mind the question. That, or perhaps Tora just hadn't said it right. \"Well, that was part of the arrangement I made to bargain for your freedom. I would become the queen's chef, and marry one of her priestesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all that,\" Tora said. \"But, I mean, it's not like you act like you <i>had</i> to marry her. You look like you actually care about her. I don't want to be judgmental or anything, but I just don't see it. I don't see you in that kind of light. So, just help me understand: why do you love Quessa, or how did you love her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"It's hard to explain, I guess. Yes, at first, I wasn't at all interested in the marriage. I just did it to save you. To be perfectly honest, at first, Quessa was really off-putting. She doesn't exactly understand personal space, but that may just be how naga are used to communicating. She's sometimes loud and over-excitable. And, someone who's that peppy all the time can be tiring. But, she was incredibly nice and helpful, especially when I was missing you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora nodded, having followed along so far. Perhaps then, it was just a situation in which Quessa had become a \"replacement\" sister while Tora had been in a coma, and thus, Olga was confusing a very strong friendship with love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga continued, \"But I guess things changed around the time of the rainy season feasts. I felt like a fish out of water there. I've never seen such a culture as this before, and it all felt strange and new. Quessa just made me feel...like I wasn't a stranger, and that I actually mattered. She focused only on me that whole time. She did everything she could to make me feel better in this new world. I've never had anyone do that before. No one's ever given that much time an attention to me before, like I was the only person in the world to them.\" Tora coughed. Olga backpedaled. \"No, no, I don't mean that you haven't, but it's just been different, you know? Oh, I don't know how to explain it, but Quessa made me her equal in a place where I felt so small and inferior. That...that means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora listened intently. Olga spoke with such passion and sincerity, it was hard not to hang on her every word right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I don't know,\" Olga finished. \"It just sort of worked out in a way I can't explain. I really do love her, Tora. It's not some passing infatuation like before when I was a girl. She really is special to me. And, I know you're having trouble understanding everything and getting used to everything. I would be too if I woke up out of a spell and coma for several months. But, if you just give her a chance, I think you'll like her as much as I have...well, maybe not that much. She is my wife after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, but took her sister's hand in hers. Tora wasn't sure she understood all of it. After all, she had never been in love, true love that is, before, so she had no context to compare this to. Yet, she did trust that her sister was honest in her feelings, and that there would be no changing them anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she said. \"I'm glad you've found someone who makes you feel special, and I'd like to try and like her myself. Quessa is nice and everything, but how do you...you know, get past the snake thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga giggled. \"It wasn't easy at first, I'll admit. But, after a while you get used to it. Besides, the four arms really makes up for it. She really is pretty grabby in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora pinched a little of Olga's flabby side. \"Well, she certainly has a lot to grab, that's for sure. Does that worry you any? Quessa said that most everyone loses the rainy season weight, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little. I mean, it is starting to make moving around the kitchens a bit of a trick. I've knocked over a few things, as wide as I am, but I don't mind too much. I figure this is going to be what I look like after every rainy season anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach started to growl on cue. \"Hm, a good meal sounds good right now. I know Quessa's still busy at the palace, but I can whip something up. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora shook her head, heaved herself up, and followed Olga to the kitchens.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the dry season progressed, things seemed to return to normal among the nagas. Very few of them lazed about their homes anymore. As their fat stores had helped them conserve energy, and their metabolisms came back to speed, many left to go and conduct business as usual in the city. There was a bit of a fuss the day the queen celebrated laying all her eggs, and the city held a grand festival, but otherwise, their otherwise humdrum lives resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo an extent, that had happened for Tora and Olga, but they weren't exactly blessed with all the usual trappings of things resuming to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, there has to be an easier way,\" Tora sighed as she managed to heave her bulk out of bed that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything, the two sisters of Racovania had remained just as fat as they had after the end of rainy season, Olga perhaps being a tad heavier since then. Perhaps that was because what the naga considered a scarcity of food was nothing at all like the occasional famines the girls had been used to back up north. To them, there seemed to be plenty of food, if how much triceratops meat Olga packed away every night was any indication. Perhaps nagas needed much more food than humans, Tora reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the sister's reactions to this situation varied greatly. Tora bemoaned the fact that she hadn't lost even an inch of her size since waking up. Of the two, she really wasn't eating all that much. She didn't care for the dinosaur meat, and found herself giving at least the other half of her meals to her sister. Still, she remained flabby, wide, and big as a house, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, Tora hadn't exactly been a skinny twig of a girl before, nor did she obsess over being a slender and attractive catch like all the other girls in town had done back home. But, she had been hoping that now that she wasn't being stuffed around the clock like she had been under Cameena's care, she would perhaps go back to her original size, or at least start to. It seemed she had made no headway, and that upset her. She didn't want to be in the body that a vampire had created for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga, on the other hand, didn't seem to mind at all, and perhaps embraced it a little. And that may have been because Quessa encouraged it. She regularly told Olga how pretty she thought she looked, could hardly keep her hands off of some of Olga's fatter parts, and was part of the reason her meals were so generous. She felt loved, which meant, she had no reason to hate her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps that was what was bothering Tora. She had grown accustomed to her sister's relationship with the naga. It was still a bit creepy, since she didn't find nagas all that attractive, but she could clearly see that Olga was in good hands. Quessa really did love and respect her with all her heart. It was hard to not like that. But, at the same time, seeing them together reminded Tora that she didn't have anyone special in her life to make her feel comfortable, no matter what size. She could not help but feel a twinge of jealousy for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled through the halls of their home to find a typical scene in the mornings. Quessa was bustling about before leaving for the temple, fetching Olga a hearty breakfast, which always helped give her the energy to start her day in the queen's kitchens. She was just finishing the meal, licking meat juices off of her fingers, her belly full and almost taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, I'm starting to wonder who's the cook around here,\" Olga laughed. \"I've never eaten this good back in Racovania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuessa giggled, placing a hand on Olga's middle. \"Well, of course not. You were such a skinny, little waif of a thing back then. What on earth were your people living on? I can't imagine going that hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly mutton,\" Tora answered, sitting across from the two. \"Mostly sheep farmers in the area. Sometimes we'd get beef if we were so lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tora, I didn't hear you come in,\" Olga said. \"Did you want some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little, not too much though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga looked concerned at her sister. \"What's wrong? You don't seem like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just didn't sleep well,\" Tora lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" was all Olga said. \"I guess I had better get going. The kitchens await.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed Quessa on the cheek before tottering off. The naga priestess served a plate to Tora. \"I don't think lack of sleep is what is bothering you,\" she said bluntly. \"Surely it is something else bothering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, but I'm not interested in talking about it right now.\" Tora didn't mean to sound short, but it was hard for her to open up to anyone but her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that didn't seem to faze Quessa. \"You know what I think? I think you're tired of being cooped up in this home all day. Olga and I have our positions in the city, but you still have not found your purpose here. Maybe you could try going and exploring the city? I'm sure inspiration will strike you soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was better than nothing, and Tora had to admit she was getting a bit stir-crazy being here all the time. \"Um, thanks, Quessa. Maybe I will.\"</span></div></div>",

Suffice to say, the repetition seemed to be getting on her nerves quite easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming a little worn out from waddling her corpulent self across parts of the Naga capital city, Tora soon managed to find herself a sturdy enough stone bench that could support her rotund girth. From there, she began to contemplate to herself, thinking aloud as she thought, \"*sigh* I can't believe how huge this place is! And yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily, she briefly groped the undercarriage of her flabby belly with a chubby hand, her mind weighing in on her available options. Then, she continued, \"...Why can't I help but feel like I'm missing...something? *sigh* ...Maybe I should go pay my sister a visit. I just hope she's not too busy.\" Tora soon sluggishly dismounted herself from the stone bench and began waddling toward the Palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- 45 minutes later --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite it being quite a struggle considering her newly established flab and bodily girth, Tora finally managed to reach the gilded palace of Vaal-Za'haraam, taking a brief moment to recover from such a long trek, which left her rather winded from all that waddling. Ahead of her, she could see two armored Naga guards standing firmly, watching over the main entrance armed with golden spears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...Well, Tora...Here goes nothing,\" Tora thought to herself, regaining her strength, as she waddled toward the main entrance to the gilded palace. However, before she could even proceed inside, the two Naga guards swiftly crossed their spears in an X formation, thus denying Tora access to the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two Naga guards firmly spoke toward Tora with an air of authority in her tone as she said, \"No entry into the Palace of Vaal-Za'haraam except for the Queen, the High Priestesses, or any of the royal staff! Identify yourself and state your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...My name is Tora Forgedotter. I-I am here to see the, um...Royal Chef, Olga Forgedotter. She's my sister,\" Tora hesitantly replied, obviously a little unnerved by the Naga guards intimidating presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Tora, just as the two Naga guards were about to deny Tora entry once more, Olga just appeared just a few yards away from the main entrance, where she then turned around and easily saw her equally large sibling outside the main entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she quickly waddled over toward the two Naga guards, quickly reassuring them as she retorted, \"It's okay! She's telling the truth. You can let her in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Royal Chef! We were unaware of your relation to the human,\" the second Naga guard replied, and both guards uncrossed their spears, thus allowing Tora entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga answered, \"It's perfectly alright. You're merely doing your jobs, that's all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* We appreciate the compliment, Royal Chef,\" the first Naga guard retorted, just as Olga then grabbed her older yet equally fat sister by her chubby hands, pulling her along through the main entrance to the palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as they both stood inside the lavish main lobby of the gilded palace, Olga spoke toward her sister with a cheerful demeanor and quipped, \"So, what brings you all the way up here, sis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...To be honest, Olga, I...I kinda wanted to see you and where you work,\" Tora answered, which caused Olga to, despite her bulk, swiftly wrap her fat sibling in a flabby loving hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga then retorted, \"Aww, that's so sweet of you, sis! Say, how about I show you where I work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I would like that, Olga,\" Tora answered, which prompted Olga to swiftly grab her sister's hand and pull her along towards the palace kitchens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both siblings passed through a pair of double doors, Tora's sense of smell was hammered with a barrage of various aromas, all of which originated from within the large, spacious, and ornate kitchen. There were large platters filled with delectable and succulent cuisines, ranging from large fattened roasted boars to hefty servings of pies filled with fruits from the Motee Marshes. Overall, Tora subconsciously began to drool a little from such delicious meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side, Tora could easily see four enormous iron grills and roast spits, as they were in the midst of cooking another batch of succulent meats. Overall, this definitely was a vast improvement over the kitchens back in the Bleakfrost Tavern. However, Tora could also see that Olga wasn't the only chef in the kitchen, as Tora noticed that each of the 4 to 5 Nagas were considerably chubby and plump. But hey, as the old saying goes: \"Never Trust A Skinny Chef\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as Olga was about to introduce her sister to her fellow chefs, they suddenly witnessed a massive and rotund Naga slither her way inside the palace kitchen, who was none other than Queen Coatzintli herself. Immediately, the other Naga chefs suddenly ceased their activity to bow before their elephantine ruler, as Coatzintli calmly approached Olga, easily bearing a friendly expression on her cherubic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Olga began to speak toward the substantially larger Naga Queen and cheerfully queried, \"Welcome to the palace kitchen, your Highness! So, what brings your royal presence before us, my Queen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, Olga Forgedotter. Though I must admit, we are truly grateful that you have accepted our offer to become our personal Royal Chef. But as you are aware at this point, Olga Forgedotter...\" Coatzintli answered, where she began to lightly drum the side of her vast apron belly with both her plump upper and lower left hands, \"I am carrying yet another batch of future Naga, thus I am required to gain an enormous amount of weight to properly give birth to such an amount of offspring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your Highness! We'll make sure you're getting more than enough food to eat,\" Olga swiftly replied, agreeing to give the Naga Queen the necessary sustenance to aid in Coatzintli's pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as she was about to give thanks to Olga, Coatzintli easily became aware of Tora, looking at her with a curious look in her serpentine eyes, which made Tora cower behind her sister, which of course, failed miserably due to her bulk and girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And who is this, Olga Forgedotter?\" Coatzintli curiously queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis soon prompted Olga to introduce her sister to the Naga Queen, as the rotund female chef swiftly answered, \"Oh, I almost forgot! Your Highness, this is my older sister, Tora. Tora, allow me to introduce you to the very individual who helped me rescue you from the Strankens: Queen Coatzintli, Queen of the Nagas.\" Olga waddled a bit off to the side to reveal Tora to Coatzintli and vice-versa. Suffice to say, Tora was undoubtedly unnerved some by Coatzintli's sheer size and girth, which was understandable considering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, despite her immense bulk and girth, Coatzintli proceeded to bow a little in greetings toward the rotund Tora, where the elephantine Naga Queen then spoke toward Tora and said, \"It is a pleasure to meet the sibling of such a talented individual in the culinary arts. Although we have previously met in the snowy mountains of Racovania, I'm afraid you were in not the best predicament to properly greet us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, even though my memories are still a little...vague, from what happened during my time with Cameena Stranken, your Highness, I, um...I vaguely remember...someone, carrying me out of that damned nightmare,\" Tora replied, lightly scratching the back of her head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli then retorted, \"But still, we are greatly relieved to see that you have made a full recovery, Tora Forgedotter. I was well-informed about your progress by my High Priestess of Knowledge, Quessa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Coatzintli spoke toward the two siblings once more and said, \"I assume that you are not currently busy at this moment, Olga Forgedotter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Fortunately for you, your Highness, I am just about to take a lunch break when my sister stopped by for a visit. Why?\" Olga quipped, just as Coatzintli turned herself around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back towards the two equally obese siblings and queried, \"Would you both mind taking a stroll with me around the palace? We would appreciate the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your Highness!\" Olga swiftly replied, which made Coatzintli gleam with a fanged grin on her cherubic face, where they soon followed the elephantine Naga Queen out of the Palace Kitchen and down a lavish marble hallway. However, whilst they slowly trekked through the palace...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a spirit unseen since she was a girl, Olga's sleepy town was thrust wide awake with the arrival of the Naga from the South.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning after was when the  had arrived. Naga women slithering up the mountainside with their queen. Most of them were taller than the strongest and hardy men of the sleepy mountain country, and they looked to be just as strong. The sight of them intimidated the uneducated farm folk of the land. Vampires, they were used to. Fangs and bloodlust were all there in their new guests, met with scales and an extra set of arms, the fact that they towered over the women and children, and just the way that they wriggled across the ground... Olga wasn't the only one who felt that they ought not to have stopped here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what were they going to do? Aggrivate them? That didn't seem smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially not when they seemed to be in such good spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForeign music filled the cobblestone streets of Racovania upon their arrival as the approaching monarchy made its presence known. Queen Coatlzintli was a massive slug of a snake, standing more than half as tall again than any of the others in her entourage and incalculably more fat, being carried by a rhumba of their most robust warriors on a dais. Her great green tail, thicker than even the oldest tree in Racovania by several times over, flicked and sloshed uselessly while her great brown blubber rippled and quaked at the uneven terrain. She waved her uppermost arms, bigger around than most women, pleasantly as her puddling face smiled. A smaller snake woman, surprisingly slender and without much muscle, waved happily at the astonished crowd of farmers stuck stupid by such a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're celebrating new life.\" Somaria said, hands on her hips as she watched the snake women come into town, \"The queen has endured an especially heavy birth, if memory serves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" Olga watched the tens of servants huff and puff beneath their queen, \"She's enormous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's new.\" Somaria said with a wry smile, \"Queen Coatlzintli takes after her mother, that much is for certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, she's a fat fuckin' wad that one.\" Helga huffed as she waddled out from behind the counter, \"But that just means she's gonna be a hungry fat wad, so let's stop gawkin' an' get out there an' make some money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkwardness of having these creatures at their festival was palpable. The Racovanians weren't too keen about sharing the celebration of their survival from being picked off by monsters with other, less {i]outwardly cannibalistic monsters. And the naga were equally testy, being cold-blooded and in a land that didn't get much warmer than a brisk springtime. Not to mention the fact that their hosts were uneducated, ill-tempered farmers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alcohol helped--alcohol always helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bleakfrost Tavern was booming with business. Helga had gone and sent word ahead that snake women would get the first drink free and, upon being informed that there was <i>no way</i> that would do any damage to a naga's metabolism, Helga generously bumped it up to two. So again, her place was popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese snake women ate like holes--like you were shoving the food into their mouths to try and fill up their tails! In the money they spent giving away two free ales, they made that and more back keeping them well-fed. The barmaids were busy trying not to trip over their long bodies as the tavern filled with Coatzintli's personal entourage, plus some of their more open-minded customers. Olga and Somaria were kept in the back, keeping up with the orders as well as they could, while Helga did her best to keep the guests entertained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, you're a big one.\" one of Coatzintli's guard purred, her cheeks flush as her tail flicked flirtatiously back and forth, \"Are you with child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, a food baby.\" Helga sloshed her gut proudly, her accent drunk and thick, \"Been eatin' great since I got m'new chef!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remind me of our queen.\" the naga slurred, leaning into the bar to better pitch woo at her hostess, \"Would you like to be <i>my</i> queen tonight, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga wretched as she avoided the scene as best she could. Something about these snakes didn't sit right with her, and the idea of her boss getting cozy with one made her feel very uncomfortable. She pushed through the door to the kitchen and placed the empty dishes she'd collected on the low wooden table by the door. Somaria leaned against the stone wall, wiping sweat from her deep brown brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Somaria, I don't understand why they're all coming here.\" Olga grouched, \"I mean, there's a whole town to explore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helga's good with customers.\" Somaria said in an aside sort of way, \"She knows how to keep naga entertained just as well as she does humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but, still...\" Olga trailed off, scraping the scraps out the window and grabbing her rag, \"I just don't understand why it had to be <i>here</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomaria rolled her eyes and served the roast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a lot to learn, Blue Eyes.\" she said, \"About the world, and about the people in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not people.\" Olga crinkled her nose, \"They're monsters... the whole lot of them. Just like the ones that took my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence between the two of them as Olga's opinion hung in the air around them. The younger girl seemed to realize that she'd made some sort of faux pas, but what could it have been? Surely Somaria wouldn't sympathize with these creatures. How could she? They were barely half human! And with those scales and those fangs... they were so scary! They were bigger and stronger than anyone else in town, and there were tens of them! Maybe a hundred! They could eat this whole town at the rate they were going, and leave nothing for the <i>other</i> monsters just up the mountainside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go visit the Queen?\" Somaria said after a pause, \"On behalf of the Tavern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Queen?\" Olga made a face, \"That--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esteemed dignitary who represents another country and all of these very nice people who have paid us a lot of money?\" Somaria cocked a thick black eyebrow, \"Yes, that Queen. Trust me, she's hard to miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga could see her from the window. Queen Coatlzintli was far too fat to come into the tavern. She'd instead been steaded outside on her dais, revelling in offerings made out of respect (and probably fear) from the native Racovanians. She was a big scaly hill of brown blubber and hair, who had been sitting there like another hill added to the mountaintop since she'd gotten here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked for you by name.\" Somaria said with a smile, \"Helga's been talking your cooking up all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me. You might learn a thing or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short walk outside felt like a lifetime. All these snakes slithering around, the festival going on, it was just so much noise. Especially given what happened just this time last year. The last thing that Olga felt she needed was to talk to another monster on the anniversary of her sister's abduction. But admittedly, it was a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was beginning to chill as the sky began to dim. The stars were peeking through the sky and the torches were being lit around the town. On her dais, surrounded by torches of Naga design, was the Queen. Just as massive and bloated as she had been when she arrived. Maybe even moreso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer four arms rested heavily on her great stomach. Her lower rung of waist-thick appendages hung low enought to grip her great swells of fat that hung over her waist around her brown belly as it dipped low over her crotch. Well, where her crotch would have been if she were a normal woman. But her wide flaring hips and long meaty tail rose high in the air as she lay on her side, casually stroking her great brown landslide of a stomach as it pooled in front of her. She was as tall laying down as Olga was standing up--she was massive in every sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it took everything she had in her to not think about the fact that the Queen could eat her, right now, without any hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hello?\" Olga asked sheepishly, \"Y-Your majesty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, hello! I was... busy.\" the queen said with a lull, as if she'd been fast asleep or in deep thought, \"Well, if it isn't a little blonde girl. And such big blue eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they're... I'm blue.\" Olga bit her bottom lip in frustration, \"I mean, yes, they're blue, I'm Olga. The, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chef!\" Queen Coatlzinti's black eyes lit up like stars, \"Oh, your patron has been talking about you endlessly. All night long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... she has?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, you're the Bubble Chef of Bleakfrost Tavern!\" the Queen's chins rippled with laughter, \"The reason my den is leaving your country with full round bellies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me and Ms. Somaria...\" Olga admitted sheepishly, \"Um... are you cold, your highness? The other snakes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are not nearly as <i>well-equipped</i> to deal with the cold as I am.\" Queen Coatlzintli said with a pat of her chocolate-brown tonnage, \"I won't be feeling a chill any sooner than I will be slithering into that Tavern of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right...\" Olga smiled awkwardly, \"So, um... you wanted to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" the Queen said, hands rising from her pillowy flab, \"I have heard tale of your fabulous cooking skill, Olga Blue Eyes...\"</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s ok, you can call me what I am. I\u2019m fat, no need to butter me up\u2026 gods know that\u2019s how I ended up like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was slightly more taken aback, she didn\u2019t want to laugh at the joke, never being around royalty before, Olga didn\u2019t know if that was correct behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u2026\u201d the titanic queen continued, \u201cthat is my request. That you travel with me and my entourage back to my city in the Marshes, and become my personal chef.\u201d As she finished her sentence, a great rumble came from queen Coatlzintli as the simple act of her shifting position slightly was followed by much creaking and groaning from the platform beneath her immensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comparatively tiny woman was still confused though; \u201cWhy me? Do you not have chefs that would do so back home?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long draft of air was sucked through the reptilian woman\u2019s nostrils as she sighed, before Coatlzintli then looked at the door to the tavern and back to Olga. \u201cBecause even if were to ask them, they would not do so. We Naga can be very traditional, and the idea of a queen who is not fatter than she is long is foreign to my people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the queen finished her explanation, Olga remembered what Somaria had said about Coatlzintli taking after her mother; if Coatlzintli had been resisting her expansion into obesity... how big had the previous monarch been?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo as you can see, this is why I requested for you.\u201d Coatlzintli stated, pointing at Olga with one short pudgy finger on her upper-right-most arm. As Olga continued to look flustered, Coatlzintli quickly added, \u201cBut do not rush to answer me right away. We will be staying in your little town for a bit longer. Come see me before we depart in three days time\u2026 now go enjoy your evening.\u201d Coatlzintli gave Olga a warm smile from her multi-chinned face, one which the young woman struggled to return, even out of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had a lot to think about when she went back indoors, the warmth of the building barely registered to her as she went over what the queen had said. She didn\u2019t like these snake-people, but at the same time she was so deathly afraid of the vampires\u2026 not to mention it was hard earning a living in such a bleak little town. In a large city, and as a head chef no less, she would certainly be well taken care of. Ugh this was so difficult! She needed someone to confide in, to at least speak her mind to and get this off her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best person to talk to would be her current employer. So Olga began to peer around the various guests, looking out for Helga\u2019s well-rounded figure. But she was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomaria!\u201d Olga called as she spotted her co-worker, \u201cHave you seen Helga?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think she went to her room!\u201d Somaria bellowed back over the general hubbub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinding her way past the various snake-women as discreetly as possible, Olga made her way to the bar and around the back. From there she went through a set of doors and then onto a second set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga rapped her knuckles across the wooden surface, in a bid to get her boss to answer. There was no answer though, but she could <i>hear</i> Helga\u2019s voice coming from inside. Throwing caution to the wind, Olga placed her hand on the doorknob and turned the handle. \u201cHelga? I need to talk to you about something im\u2026por\u2026tant\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight that greeted Olga had her in stunned silence. On Helga\u2019s bed, was her boss\u2026 but ontop of HER was a very enthusiastic Naga. Helga had her arms wrapped around the serpentine-woman\u2019s brown-skinned waist, holding her tightly but not too roughly. Meanwhile the Naga had her top-most set of arms passionately fondling Helga\u2019s breasts, while the lower set were tenderly fondling the bottom of Helga\u2019s belly, and occasionally disappearing beneath it. Her long tail was encircling Helga like a massive muscular rope, and from the way that Helga was bucking, she was holding on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women had their lips locked together, eyes closed in passion as their tongues danced down each other\u2019s throat; while the floor was covered in strewn clothes and armour. And they were naked\u2026 both completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to hold her response internally, Olga screamed. A high pitched scream that caused the entwined women\u2019s eyes to bolt open, their lips breaking apart with a wet pop sound, and look in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOLGA!\u201d Helga screamed. \u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING!?\u201d Now the tavern owner and the Naga fully relinquished each other, with the latter women using one set of hands to cover her breasts, and the other to cover her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I wanted to discuss something important... but but\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Olga was on the verge of tears, panic overtaking all other emotions as her legs locked, refusing to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga whispered something to the stunned Naga, who nodded and slithered off of the bed, fetching Helga\u2019s dress and handing it to her. The bulky brunette hastily tossed it over herself and waddled over to Olga. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019m sorry for yelling\u2026 let\u2019s take this outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading Olga by the shoulder, Helga escorted her from the room, shutting the door behind her. \u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d Helga asked, putting on her most sympathetic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 *sniff* about the queen.\u201d Olga explained, drying her tears. \u201cShe\u2026 she wants me to leave Racovania and travel back to the marshes to cook for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga was stunned, \u201cWow\u2026 good on you girl! I would have killed for an opportunity like that!\u201d The beefy woman was about to clap Olga on the back in congratulations, but tears were still welling in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I want to go\u2026\u201d Olga sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hey\u2026 it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d Helga backpedaled, trying her best to be responsible. \u201cBut, as someone who has lived here all her life\u2026 you should go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Olga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Racovania isn\u2019t the place for a young sweet girl like you to grow up; there is barely any sun here, our crops wither every other year, and every so often, a bloodsucking fiend comes down and snatches people up at her leisure.\u201d This didn\u2019t seem to convince Olga much. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to say, you can build a life for yourself so much easier there, they clearly WANT you in the Marshes. Plus, when are you going to get the opportunity to travel like this, without paying a coin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 guess\u2026\u201d Olga replied, still hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga smiled, still trying to convince the girl. \u201cSleep on it, ok? This might be the best thing that happens to you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga smiled and nodded, surprising Helga with a hug before returning to the front of the tavern to get back to helping Somaria out with the influx of customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga straightened herself up and tip-toed back towards her room, opening the door a crack she hissed, \u201cShe\u2019s gone\u2026\u201d Within moments, she felt two pairs of strong hands clamp around her shoulders, and the sound of passionate moans filled the room once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next three days, the Racovanian festival trudged along at a horrendously awkward pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nagas\u2019 welcome didn\u2019t get any warmer after their first night in the mountainous country. If anything, everyone dealing with a hangover (humans and snakes alike) only invited more opportunities for clashing cultures. The stress of supporting the reptilian women was enough to make a few fights break out between the uninitiated and uninformed farmers and those who dared to suggest that maybe they weren\u2019t all bad. Then there was the odd \u201cfight\u201d between a snake woman and a Racovanian, though those ended very quickly. The size difference and warrior training made quite the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had truly been the longest festival that anyone could remember, for sure. But for Olga, there was an entirely different reason for the drag in this year\u2019s festivities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Ms. Somaria?\u201d Olga asked the head chef for what must have been the hundredth time that day, \u201cShould I go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, if that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d Somaria had repeated for what must have been the hundredth time that day, \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just two days ago that you were calling them monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Olga frowned, \u201cThey still scare me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLords know they ought to scare somebody in this bar.\u201d Somaria said in an aside, passive-aggressive sort of way. Olga supposed that it was just the work getting to her. \u201cBut plenty of girls your age would love to travel. And besides, you don\u2019t want to live your whole life up here buried in snow, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou moved here, though.\u201d Olga turned away from the dishes, \u201cAnd you\u2019re from the South.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, but that\u2019s <i>much, much</i> different.\u201d Somaria chuckled, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be comparing notes with me on that any time soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re here, and not there.\u201d Olga blinked, \u201cMaybe I want to be here and not there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another long, poignant pause between the two women. Those had been happening a lot lately. Ever since their first conversation about the queen, when Olga had gone outside to meet Coatlizintli. Whereas before Ms. Somaria had talked to her in a pleasant tone of voice, she had suddenly become much more\u2026 motherly. If that was the right word. She was still very nice, just more stern. It made Olga feel like a little girl now, when she talked to Ms. Somaria. She was so much more worldly than her and having all of these snakes around really made Olga realize that she hadn\u2019t seen that much of the world to begin with\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Somaria finally said, \u201cNow hurry up and get those plates clean. Helga wants us opened up early tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day of the Naga\u2019s departure was a happy one for many involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the snake women, they were getting away from these ignorant farmers who wanted to chase them off the mountain with torches and pitchforks. And for the farmers, they finally felt like they were getting back to some semblance of normalcy. Vampires were one thing, but something about shifty snake ladies made just about everyone uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatlzintli had been satisfied by her stay in the mountains, having eaten far more than her fair share of Racovanian cuisine at the behest of her people and her wife. The smaller snake, Patli, slithered around and over and on top of her big brown blob seeing to her every need for three days straight, keeping her positively full of food at every opportunity. The Queen\u2019s diet was in shambles already, but at least it had been a pleasurable shattering experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Somaria was simply happy that Helga\u2019s three-night-stand snake girl was going to be leaving with the rest of her army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, my beautiful little snowflower.\u201d The Queen\u2019s guard who had slept with Helga said as she cupped the barmaid\u2019s cheek, \u201cOur nights together have been <i>rapturous</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ain\u2019t no flower ye scaly sweet talker.\u201d Helga chuckled thickly, her belly bouncing as her lover\u2019s lower rung of arms held her close, \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky y\u2019ae only spent a few nights with me, or I\u2019d have yae poppin\u2019 raeght outta that armor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff of the Bleakfrost Tavern rolled their eyes at the courtship. Helga had hardly left her bedroom since she and Amoxtli had began their affair. But as the taller, burlier woman\u2019s hands fell and she slithered back towards the departing party, one of her hands clapped on Olga\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing, Blue Eyes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga squeaked in attention. She\u2019d gotten everything she could carry together. It wasn\u2019t much. Given that they didn\u2019t exactly have a lot of money even before her father fell ill, she\u2019d not been able to keep her room full of things in the Tavern. Now, leaving with even less than she had when Tora had been taken by the Strankens, she\u2019d been left with but a few changes of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye!\u201d Olga said finally, \u201cI\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Racovania was in the North, the Marshes were in the South, and Yndyre was a big continent after all. They would cut through the capital at Adinah in a few weeks, stay there for some time, and then resume their trek along the most prominent cities until they reached the marshes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in all, I\u2019d say it\u2019ll take two months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli was Queen Coatlzintli\u2019s wife. When compared to her queen, or even to just the other naga, she was very small. About Olga\u2019s height, with caramel colored skin and dark brown hair. She was somewhat plain looking, and lacked the colorful exotic scales of her sister snakes. Except for the vibrant yellow patterns along her back, she was almost completely earth-toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she lacked in color and panache, Olga was learning that she made up for in attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo months?\u201d Coatlizintli asked, immobile from her platform, \u201cPatli that seems a bit much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long are we planning on staying in the capital?\u201d Olga asked from her seat on the Queen\u2019s dais<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had never been below the mountains. Even when Father went into town, he was just going a little bit down to the base, and she\u2019d only ever gone once. Tora had been below a few times, when she ran the forge. But Olga was surprised at just how <i>flat</i> everything was. And how green, too. The animals were different\u2014softer, and sleeker than the burly beasts that lived up in the peaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in an army full of snake women, one of whom weighed more than ten of the others combined, and she couldn\u2019t stop staring at the rabbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo weeks.\u201d Patli answered matter of factly, \u201cKing Roland <i>loves</i> to show the royal families of the Marshes a good time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean he likes to feed me until I feel like I\u2019m going to pop.\u201d Coatlizintli touched four handfuls of the belly\u2019s bigness and rubbed it defensively, \u201cPatli, I won\u2019t have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Li, you can always begin your silly diet when we\u2019re <i>not</i> visiting the King.\u201d Patli said placatingly, stroking her wife\u2019s lower-hanging belly rolls as she slithered underneath and around her, \u201cAfter all, diplomacy trumps diets every time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen let out a low whine, looking to Olga for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Uhm, ma\u2019am, I\u2014\u201d Olga interjected, \u201cI-I think, a-as the um\u2026 the\u2026 er\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, who are you again?\u201d Patli sniffed, \u201cJust keep seated, sweetie. And quiet, please. We\u2019ll set up camp soon and you can get back on those\u2026 little things you have. Legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga grumbled and hunkered back down into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take it so hard.\u201d Coatlzintli\u2019s boulders of cheeks sloshed, speaking and chewing with precision and force as three of her two of her four hands fed her waiting maw, \u201cPatli\u2019s always been that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, your highness.\u201d Olga squeaked from her seat next to the mountain of her new boss, \u201cI mean, thank you though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d The queen burped, \u201cI recognize that look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen got her own tent\u2014the size of most homes back up in the mountains, Olga had added. Housing Coatlizintli\u2019s immensity meant that the size was anything but unnecessary. She and Patli slept there while the troops were given their own tents and bedrolls. Olga was to share a tent with Amoxtli, based on their <i>mutual friend</i> Helga back in Racovania. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Coatlzintli had made Olga feel very comfortable by her side. Much moreso than she would have been in the pit with the other snake women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatlizintli was well and truly immobile. Far too fat to slither underneath her own power. It took half of their army to move her with the speed required to make the trip in the time that it had. She was this massive woman, more slug than snake. And with the way her army kept her fed, Olga had very few reasons not to believe that she had earned every extra pound or inch that clung to her tonnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver since we were kids, she\u2019s been the smallest. I suppose that big mouth of hers is what makes up for it.\u201d Coatlzintli stroked her belly idly with her lowermost set of arms, \u201cShe can be a bit\u2026 difficult at times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli was at the tents with the guard, looking up at them as she made them stand at attention. Ostensibly, she was debriefing them for what they were going to do tomorrow. But from what Olga had gathered, it was equal parts organizing a hunting party for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem\u2026 <i>nice</i>.\u201d Olga chose her words carefully, \u201cOr to like me very much\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re here to undo some of this.\u201d Coatlizintli chuckled huskily as she lifted up a tier of her tonnous tummy as it pooled out in front of her, \u201cIf it were up to Patli, the whole mountainside would be emptied out and served to me for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour custom is weird\u2026\u201d Olga bit back, realizing what she\u2019d just said to whom she\u2019d just said it to, \u201cN-No offense\u2026 your highness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s definitely\u2026 strange.\u201d Coatlizintli\u2019s puddling face frowned tightly, \u201cI\u2019m the first queen in some time to venture outside of the marshes. I told Patli I\u2019d get as fat as she wanted if she\u2019d let me see the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour queens don\u2019t see Yndyre?\u201d Olga asked in moderate confusion, having taken everyone who <i>wasn\u2019t</i> a dumb farm girl for being far more apt to travel than she was, \u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re all too bloody fat.\u201d The queen said sourly, \u201cAnd that, my dear, is where you come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what you want me to do about it\u2026\u201d Olga thought back sourly now on all the weight Helga gained once she\u2019d been put on staff, \u201cI\u2019m happy to help cook you food, ma\u2019am, but\u2026 with how much you eat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly my point in hiring you, Blue Eyes.\u201d Coatlzintli winked, \u201cI'll only be eating what you make for me once we get back to the Marshes. But Patli is going to keep you plenty busy, and my kingdom will get leery if you don't make enough food for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My point in saying all this, is that I'll need your help in <i>disposing</i> of some of the food so that I'm not tempted and that no one will suspect anything.\" Coatlzintli giggled like a girl and less like the mountain of monarchy that she presented, \"That way I won't be tempted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga briefly pictured herself even attempting to eat the amount that one of the soldiers ate on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, you don't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, of course not.\" the queen waved a hand dismissively, an action that wobbled throughout her entire upper half, \"You would explode before you'd be of any use to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga tried not to look too relieved<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want you to <i>share</i> whatever I don't eat with...\"</span></div></div>",

The queen however was much more casual about the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHo ho ho! Don\u2019t you worry your golden locks, it will barely be any extra to them.\u201d Coatlzintli chuckled, while Olga looked at her quizzically. \u201cHow many children do you think I have in one sitting, hmm?\u201d The queen asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl scratched her head; clearly her majesty was trying to make her guess some high number, or she wouldn\u2019t have asked the question. From what Olga could remember, the tailor\u2019s wife a few houses away had three children at once some years back, so perhaps that was a good base to go off of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive?\u201d Olga answer hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the monolithic matriarch chuckled, her great wall of lard body rippling with mirth. \u201cFive\u2026 oh I wish\u2026 during my last pregnancy I laid almost one hundred and fifty eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga\u2019s eyes bugged at the number, \u201cOne hundred and fifty!?\u201d She spluttered, almost forgetting the notion that queen Coatlzintli had said she had laid eggs rather than given birth. Somaria had said it had been an especially heavy birth for her, but <i>THAT</i> heavy!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is my job as queen.\u201d Coatlzintli explained, \u201cMost Naga only have one child if any at all, so it is my duty to keep the population well supported\u201d.  There was a tone of wistfulness in the queen\u2019s voice, and her gaze turned to the tent opening. Olga felt almost bad for the queen; clearly she had planned great adventures for herself, but was (literally) tied down by the weight of her duties. Perhaps agreeing to go with her entourage was the best idea she had had in a long time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I am honored that I will be helping you.\u201d Olga replied, breaking the poignant silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, I do hope you are up to the challenge\u2026 Patli will be putting you through your paces when we arrive back in my palace\u201d. Coatlzintli broke her speech off for a moment to pluck a few tender morsels from her platter and stuff them past her ham-sized cheeks. \u201cYour first job will be helping me lose whatever I am going to put on in Adinah, that king loves to make sure everyone around him is eating well\u2026 you would do with loosening your belt around him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga gulped; she hadn\u2019t for a moment worried about her own waistline in all this. Now though, looking at the hillock-sized woman that lay prone next to her, potential weight-gain was a serious concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women were shocked out of their pensive moods though, as a figure slithered her way through the tent opening; \u201cSweetie I\u2026 oh\u2026 <i>you</i> are still here\u2026\u201d Patli wrinkled her nose in mild distaste as she saw the tiny little human sitting so close to her beloved. Turning back to her queen, Patli proceeded to act as if the tiny woman wasn\u2019t there, \u201cI have instructed the troops for tomorrow\u2019s march, made sure that there are sentries on guard at the edges of the camp. We are perfectly prepared for daybreak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful.\u201d Coatlzintli replied pleasantly, \u201cI guess time got away from us as we talked. Better catch some sleep Olga Blue-eyes, it\u2019s a long trek tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga nodded, getting up off the tent floor and walked towards the exit, Patli watching every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga left the premises, the consort to the queen swiftly pulled the screen across the gap. The blonde woman couldn\u2019t see what was going on anymore, but she could still faintly hear what was being said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that <i>the mammal</i> is gone\u2026 we can have some fun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you make me have another clutch, you won\u2019t be able to get me back inside the palace when we return\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will have the doors widened\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her pace, Olga headed back to her tent as fast as she could; she had had enough of snake-love for one lifetime already. Not that she could truly escape it; as on return to her tent she was swiftly reminded of the sight that would be burned into her mind\u2019s eye for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm hmmm hmmm\u2026\u201d Amoxtli hummed as she neatly placed her armour and weapons by her bedside. \u201cOh! Olga, I didn\u2019t hear you come in!\u201d The serpentine woman exclaimed as she noticed the smaller woman\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring to the other side of the tent, Olga noticed how all her things had been arranged much more neatly than she remembered leaving them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting where her tent-mate was looking, Amoxtli explained; \u201cI tidied up a bit\u2026 thought you might like that when you got back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 thanks\u2026\u201d Olga replied, not really looking the Naga in the eye as she walked to her bed-roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli sat in silence all four hands placed on top of each other, hoping for some positive remark, but none came. Instead Olga just sat on the edge of her bed, turned away from Amoxtli and lay down, still dressed in her day clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence pervaded over the tent, until Amoxtli tried to make conversation again. \u201cIf you\u2019re not getting enough to eat here, you can share some of my rations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmhm\u2026\u201d was all the response she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s because you saw me having sex with your boss isn\u2019t it?\u201d The Naga suddenly stated, causing Olga to sit bolt upright; Amoxtli continued, \u201cYou probably think I am so no good whore\u2026 but I\u2019m not! I don\u2019t let my hair down often, and Helga was really beautiful\u2026 and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Olga exclaimed, holding her hands up; anything to stop that mental image coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just thought we could be friends\u2026\u201d Amoxtli added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga still had her reservations; while she had started to get used to Coatlzintli, the woman was basically harmless unless she accidentally rolled on top of you. Amoxtli however was often bedecked in military finery, and wielding strange weapons embedded with the teeth of sharp-fanged animals of who-knows-how-big; not to mention she was really buff, and looked like she could break Olga like a twig if she felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know you\u2026\u201d Olga mumbled. This however seemed like a challenge to her tent-mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, my name\u2019s Amoxtli,\u201d The snake-woman started counting her life events off on her fingers as she went, \u201cI am of low birth\u2026 that means I am not one of the previous queen\u2019s daughters. I was the best Pok-ta-pok player in my street when I was ten, I joined the barracks when I was sixteen, and I was promoted to a royal guard when I was twenty two. I like my meat well-done, I\u2019m currently single\u2026 as you may have guessed, and I prefer the rainy season to the dry season.\u201d With a deep breath, she finished. \u201cNow you know me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga smiled a little, there was certainly more humanity to the Naga than she initially thought. \u201cI guess it\u2019s my turn then\u2026\u201d And with that, Olga recounted her life\u2019s story, and the pair chatted long into the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the course of their campaign back to the Marshes, Olga and Amoxtli continued their awkward dance of getting to know one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a troop full of unfamiliar faces attached to strange serpentine bodies, it served Olga well to have at least one snake woman that she could talk to. The Queen was not always available, turning away either due to her duties or her appetite, and Olga's presence was not always welcome in her tents. The Queen's wife certainly didn't seem too keen on including the \"legger\" (she'd picked up the term almost as soon as she'd been added to the Queen's court) in many conversations. It always helped to have a friend that she could turn to. But in this dire circumstance, the snake that she had walked in on her boss having sex with would have to do well enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, Olga thought, that a woman older than her, stronger than her, and more worldly than her seemed to work so hard to gain her approval. Amoxtli seemed eager enough to make sure Olga was fitting in and did her best to fill the awkward silence as best she could. And given the nature of their first meeting, there were many awkward silences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she's trying to make you feel comfortable.\" Coatlizintli snorted one night over dinner, two arms working feverishly to pour another helping of stew into her belly while the lower two sensually rubbed her digesting stomach, \"I have ordered her to. You are her responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but...\" Olga winced, \"I have... erm... seen her naked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-ho!\" Coatlizintli snorted, soup dribbling down her cheeks and chins as she bowl jostled with her boitrous belly laugh, \"So she <i>has</i> been making you comfortable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, ew!\" Olga slipped, her face growing bright pink, \"She and Helga, my boss! Back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean back in Racovania.\" Patli corrected as she dabbed at the spill on her wife's face, \"Your home is wherever your Queen is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" Coatlzintli said appreciatively, \"But try not to think too much of it. Have you ever known someone in an army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Olga answered softly, stirring her own stew petulantly, \"But I don't see what--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In due time.\" Coatlizintli answered quickly, \"Now, Blue Eyes, be a dear and hand us the Mastodon. There's a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs awkward as it was at first, the two of them worked out a sort of agreement. How things would be carried out from then on, if they were going to be \"friends\". Amoxtli was to be Olga's personal guard due to the \"handicap\" of not being Naga-born. She was the one member of their traveling army who was directly responsible for Olga's migration to the Marshes--a small extension of Coatlzintli's will bequeathed to her private chef. And Olga needed it! She was a farm girl, not a fighter. And with some of the dangerous meals that they hunted in the name of keeping their great queen full and fat, she needed the protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyrantosoreus?\" Olga repeated with some genuine diffculty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, <i>Ty-ran-o-saur-us</i>.\" Amoxtli spoke slowly, as if to a child and counted the syllables on her fingers, \"It's one of the many lesser reptiles that live in the marshes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... didn't seem that little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, lesser, like dumber.\" the red-scaled snake woman bit heartily into her slice of the great lizard, \"You will see. Tyrannosaurus is one of the Queen's favorite meals. She will have you learn many recipes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga frowned at the tough chunk of meat she'd been battling with for the better part of the night. It was from somewhere along the breastplate--a good hunk of the stuff, deemed high quality and split only with the Queen herself. It was a sign of respect that she get the prime cut, however, she'd barely been able to make a dent in it. It was like eating leather! Luckily, Olga had eaten her fill of the vegetables and the stew. What she'd tasted of the <i>ty-ran-o-saur-us</i> in there had been good, but still chewy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she eats this a lot then?\" Olga made a face, \"I don't see how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naga have strong jaws and fangs to help pierce the flesh.\" Amoxtli ripped a good bite from her own portion from along the tail, \"Are you not enjoying your supper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... too full.\" Olga smiled weakly, \"Do you want it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, absolutely.\" Amoxtli said with a greedy grin, reaching forward, \"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even bite into it.\" Olga rolled her eyes, \"You're more than welcome to have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven during their stopover in Adinah, where there were far more many two-legged people for Olga to talk to, she still felt out of place in the population of city folk. She was a farm girl through and through, and couldn't help but think that these civilized, cultured types were looking down on her. With the added inclusion of Sirens and Satyrs and Minotaurs and the various other strange species migrating to the hub of Yndyre, it felt so strange to be gravitating to her familiar den of snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, that girl's giving you the once-over.\" Cuicatl\u2014a member of the Eagle Warriors brought along to scout\u2014ribbed Olga in the breast during their stay in the HopFrog Tavern, \"You oughtta go over and say hello. Flash those pretty Blue Eyes, Blue Eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roaring laughter filled the booth that the five naga women, plus one dwarfed former barmaid, occupied in the rich Adinahn bar. The Queen and her mate, plus the members of her royal guard, had been at the King's castle for hours. There wasn't much to do for those so far from their native culture, the Marshes and farm girling respectively, to do in a hub like this except to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Olga smiled and waved awkwardly to the busty siren looking her over, \"I... don't really like girls. Or birds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother roar of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you don't like girls!\" Eztli snickered, \"What good are menfolk for anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make good eatin'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, aye, that's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get out of your shell a bit more, Blue Eyes.\" Amoxtli said drunkenly, winking at a very heavyset barmaid, \"You're not gonna find many men in the marshes that much is for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake women gathered at the table conversed in their native tongue for a moment before throwing their heads back in further drunken laughter. Olga didn't know much Naga, but it was probably a joke at her expense. She sunk lower into her seat, feeling more ignorant than ever, and wishing that she'd never agreed to come with these stupid snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer up ya legger, we're only teasin' ya.\" Amoxtli shoved Olga a bit on the shoulder, \"Want anything from the bar? I'm going to go see if the Big One is free tonight.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite all of the hiccups that came with being an outsider, Olga found herself fitting in well enough. Even if it was only as a \"legger\" could. She felt included at least, and that was something. The rest of the troop\u2014a few select members\u2014were kind enough to her, and promised to help make her feel at home. Which wound up working well for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're staying here?\" Olga asked in bewilderment, \"C-Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a few more weeks at least.\" Coatlzintli said in a thick, heavy voice as she reclined in the massive room that His Highness had set aside for her opulence, \"There are matters to attend to here in the Capital that are best suited to be done in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga somehow doubted the legitimacy of that claim. For all of the time that the Queen had been on her tour of the country, she'd been kept up well enough. But in Adinah, there was talk of her eating for hours on end with the King and his wives. Did His Highness have more than one wife? There were rumors about an entire court set up for decadent meals. His own royally robust figure suggested that he was no stranger to overindulgence. Perhaps he was just entertaining Her Majesty, who was clearly equally (and exponentially) predisposed to a similar affliction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all her talk about wanting to diet, Coatlzintli would be hard-pressed to leave meals of this caliber on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what does that mean for me?\" Olga wavered, \"Do I... stay here with you, your highness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I will be sending you with Amoxtli and a small squad of scouts.\" the Queen purred, stroking her magnificent stomach with her many hands, \"She will command them and make sure that you complete your migration to the marshes safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the conversation came to a close, the doorway to the Queen's provided chambers cracked open. Her mate slithered in, along with a small crew of the King's personal servants. Adinahn women, all of them, with plump round figures and healthy weights about them. Even Patli, scrawny as she was, had taken well to the portions provided by the crown in the three weeks they'd been staying in the Capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love.\" Patli purred, \"It is almost time for your meeting with the King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Coatlzintli turned to Olga again, \"You and your squad will leave on the morrow and march ahead of the remaining army. This will give you a few days to get situated in your new station as my head chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatlizintli then winked, slyly. Such a small action on such a mountainous figure was truly insignificant to anyone who wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to meet my daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga left the room, massive oaken door shutting heavily behind her, feeling more conflicted than ever. On the one hand, she was finally going to be out of the city. She'd rather gotten used to life on the road, even if it was with a bunch of snake women. She was protected and safe, and the conversations she'd have with the queen while on her dais were often quite pleasant. But on the other hand, six naga didn't sound like enough to adequately protect her from some of the beasts that had attacked them along the way. Add into that, she still wasn't very <i>comfortable</i> around the slithering, scaly beast women. They were loud and obnoxious, and being around them made her feel so... <i>weak</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo add to the mixture, with the way her Queen was eating, Olga would have her work cut out for her when she finally managed to make it back to the Marshes. Even if they had to roll her there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suddenly I miss vampires.\" Olga joked bitterly as she slumped against the wall, head in hands...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully, the smaller party did not have as much trouble with the native fauna as before they entered the city. With a relatively small force, they were a lot quieter and attracted a lot less attention. Good thing too, as Olga had overheard whispers in the tavern they had rented out for the few nights they were staying, there was apparently a creature called a Hydra that had been terrorizing the local farmsteads. The timid blonde was quite nervous as they had initially left the city, in case this beast attacked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days travel, Olga had completely forgotten about the many-headed monster, thinking that they had long left behind any risk of it attacking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day though, as the small troupe was making camp for the night\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the seven women being present and accounted for, the sound of a twig being trodden on echoed from out of a nearby copse. The guards stood to attention, with Amoxtli silently giving orders with naught but hand gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they saw a pair of yellow eyes glinting from between the trees. Amoxtli instantly reacted, using her upper arms to level her weapon at the best, but also using her lower pair to grab onto Olga and hold her tightly. Within a second, Olga had gone from shivering alone to having Amoxtli\u2019s girl-abs rammed into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga tugged her head up, trying to allow herself to breathe properly again. Her gaze was filled with Amoxtli\u2019s gold breastplate as it hung down over her torso. But Olga could still catch a glimpse of underboob, and all of a sudden, her mind\u2019s eye was filled with that image of naked Amoxtli again. Her dark brown teats the only thing Olga could think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing furiously, Olga buried her face back into Amoxtli\u2019s abdominal muscles, and closing her eyes tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistaking Olga\u2019s behavior for fear, the snake-woman thought little of it. Instead she kept her eyes locked on this predator that stared out from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SMACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the eyes vanished from the darkness, as one of the Naga\u2019s javelin\u2019s struck it clean in the forehead. Going in to retrieve her weapon, before returning, dragging back with her the body of a very large wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli slammed the pole of her weapon into the ground. \u201cPut away the rations girls, looks like meat\u2019s back on the menu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group continued to travel, Olga was quite intrigued as she watched the landscape change. From wide open plains, they then entered thick forests not unlike the ones at home\u2026 only with trees far larger than she could have imagined. Then the trees began to change as they headed further south, becoming thinner and taller. Their roots tall and thin like erect lines of parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they entered what Olga thought must have been the Motee Marshes, there seemed to be a lack of\u2026 well marsh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there supposed to be more water here?\u201d Olga asked as the group passed over a wooden bridge, covering an almost completely dry riverbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, but it\u2019s the end of the dry season. There has been no rainfall for months.\u201d Amoxtli explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDry season?\u201d Olga repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli began to elaborate further. \u201cHere in the marshes, we have half a year where it rains and food is plentiful, and the rest the rain stops and we have to make do with what is left after that rainy season. We are coming up to the end of the dry season now, so things will look a bit barren.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga may have had her curiosity sated, but it was certainly strange that was for sure. Did that mean they never got snow here? That was likely, she thought, what with how hot it was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after many months on the road, Olga got a glimpse of the great city of the Naga. There was a wide stone bridge to cross first, and here she was really feeling like she was somewhere totally alien. The number of Naga women was starting to increase, with many stealing glances at her as she passed. They were not dressed as the soldiers that had accompanied her were; they were mostly of similar design, a single color with bright colors edging the material; some wore large draping clothes that resembled huge shirts, others long dresses and a couple that were only wearing skirts\u2026 their breasts out for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city was nothing short of impressive as well. The buildings were all cut from stone, the houses topped with either flat stone roofs or triangular straw ones. Dotted amongst them were some larger buildings that must have been markets, apothecaries or barracks. But even rarer were some towering colossal buildings, the size of the castles in Racovania. They were huge triangular structures, with what looked like temples on the top and steps up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no less crowded than Adinah had been as well. Woman hustled and bustled here and there, while children played in the more open areas. One group were even playing with a ball, trying to pass it through a hoop attached to the side of a house using just their elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they reached the queen\u2019s palace. Like the triangular buildings, it towered over the cityscape. While similar in its base to the temples, it was a lot larger at the top, with a large multi-building complex atop it. There were plenty of plants as well, perhaps a series of gardens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was escorted up the stone steps and through the gargantuan doorway in the middle. On arrival, Amoxtli slithered over to some other guards and chatted with them for a moment, sending them off in several directions across the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for the grand tour?\u201d Amoxtli asked as she returned, leaning down towards her charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t really a grand tour, more a whistle-stop glance at all the important rooms in the building. Some not even shown to Olga, just directions were given instead. It seemed she was being hurried in one direction though, down towards the kitchens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what kitchens they were! The room used to prepare queen Coatlzintli\u2019s meals could have held several Bleakfrost Taverns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see, the staff are not in right now.\u201d Amoxtli stated, gesturing as to how there was nobody around. \u201cBuuuuut\u2026\u201d the serpentine woman added, \u201cNOCHTLI!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments there was a sound of crashing from one of the back rooms (this place had MORE to it!?) and a voice called out. \u201cComing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn slithered another Naga, like all the women so far, she had brown skin and black hair, which flowed down her back like a waterfall. She was shorter than Amoxtli, but certainly taller than Patli. Her lower half was a deep navy blue with a black stripe down the back, leading to a red-tipped tail. But what was most striking about her was that she was really fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Olga thought about it, she hadn\u2019t seen a single overweight Naga other than her majesty\u2026 until now. This Nochtli seemed to be the only exception; her face wasn\u2019t all that chubby, but all four of her upper arms were seriously big. Her belly was quite large as well, and her hips and tail were <i>REALLY</i> fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Nochtli, the queen\u2019s official taste tester.\u201d Amoxtli introduced, before adding, \u201cIf you couldn\u2019t tell that already\u201d patting the back of one of her hands on Nochtli's big brown stomach, sending ripples across the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Nochtli huffed, putting her fists on her fat hips. \u201cMy job is <i>very</i> important thank you!\u201d The Naga stated proudly, before turning towards Olga, \u201cHello! You\u2019re a human! Ummm Amoxtli, why is there a guest in the kitchens?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli placed one of her hands on Olga\u2019s shoulder, to try and give her a bit of moral support. \u201cBecause she\u2019s not a guest. Olga here will be your new head chef!\u201d The guard announced with a hint of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d The fatter woman cooed. \u201cThat means we are going to be working together a lot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice\u2026 to meet you\u2026 but what does a taste tester do?\u201d Olga asked, having never heard of the job before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy duty is to eat a little of the queen\u2019s food before it gets to her. To make sure any poisons, either natural or unnatural are spotted first, I have a really good sense of taste, so I am a natural!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty Nochtli.\u201d Amoxtli chuckled, calming the bubbly woman\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cWe need to get Olga going, she has a few more important duties before she gets started\u2026 the other guards should have rounded up the royal hatchlings by now...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olga and Amoxtli had entered the eastern wing of the labyrinthian castle. The humidity of the region was unlike anything Olga had ever experienced, and it had left her pink and damp. The change of summer clothes that she'd brought with her from home still left her moist and dripping with sweat. The suffocating warmth surrounded her, even in the great spacious caverns of the temple. The ceilings were built high and the walls seemed miles apart\u2014she imagined that the Queen would have no difficulty slithering underneath such construction, had she been able to move under her own power. The dais's added height and the servants hoisting her Highness's humongousness would even be able to account for the top of the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Olga had seen many strange things since she'd left Racovania, she'd never imagined living in a city of stone. Or, for that matter, a place so blasted hot. How could anyone think straight with this heat beating down on them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had been so busy puttering along trying not to get heat stroke that she almost didn't notice the entourage that was awaiting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Head Chef!\" said a chorus of voices in unison, shocking the sweaty blonde girl back to scaly reality <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"hatchlings\" didn't exactly foster the correct imagery in Olga's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had expected some small creatures, slithering up to her ankles. She had no idea how big or how small Naga got when they were children, and calling them \"hatchlings\" didn't instill the sense that they were anything bigger than housecats. When Olga and Amoxtli entered the royal chambers and were greeted with the sight of no less than a hundred snake women of varying shapes and sizes, her mind boggled. She had an entire <i>unit</i> of children, almost as many people as there were in her home town! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, as soon as the chorus was broken, giggling and conversations broke out amongst Coatlzinli's children. Some of them looked to be as young in the face as Olga, while others took more after Coatlzintli's strong royal features. They were anywhere from as tall as the Queen to as short as her wife, Patli. All dark-skinned with black hair, and a varying color scheme of scales between the lot of them that favored greens and vibrant yellows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Olga gulped, turning to the one friendly face in the room, \"Are these... <i>all</i>...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are all highborn.\" Amoxtli said with a laugh, \"Her Highness bears more in her clutches than any Queen in this dynasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Her Highness bears more\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a better look at them as they all got a good look at the Legger who had walked into their chambers, Olga noticed the subtle differences between a select few of them. They represented all of the diversity that Olga had seen in the short time since coming to the Marshes. Each of them decorated themselves in ornate feathers or teeth, colorful skirts wrapped around their tails or... sometimes nothing at all. The lot of them <i>looked</i> to be around her age, though Gods knew how old they actually were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, like Nochtli, there was a distinctive difference between the Naga within the royal walls and the naga who lived in the village outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could certainly tell that some of these girls were the Queen's lineage, that much was for sure. The Queen's ulterior motive for hiring her, so she could pass along the portions to some of these girls, seemed a bit redundant. There were some that were nearly as long as the queen herself and already quite heavyset. Even the smaller ones, some of them were quite plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll forgive them for being a bit rowdy.\" Amoxtli said with a laugh, \"They've never seen a Legger before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's fine.\" Olga said in an attempt to remain respectful in the faces of her employer's daughters, \"I'm a bit used to it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all wanted to see you for themselves, and now look at them\u2014still girls, the lot of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're always like this?\" Olga winced as the echoes bounced off of the high ceilings and spacious walls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always.\" the red snake snorted before repeating, \"Girls, just girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga introduced herself as well as she could. The crowd quieted, mostly, so she could speak to the Queen's daughters. Many of them looked at her with a sort of awe that Olga and her Racovanian friends would have looked at a Naga. They were entranced by her two bony tails, and the way she moved effortlessly without slithering around. Her soft, pretty features were untouched by scales and her fingers were so... dull!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor farm girl never would have thought that being an ordinary human would be so strange to some people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, ooh!\" one of the girls raised her hand and said in a somewhat broken attempt at common tongue, \"Will you be preparing the dinner tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, Ms. Olga has to get some rest.\" Amoxtli answered for her, \"It's been a long trip and we're both very tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be preparing the feast for when Mother gets back?\" another, bigger, deeper voiced snake asked from the back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about when the dry season's over?\" another girl, smaller and a bit fat, shot her hands up in the air, \"You only have two arms! How will you cook so much food?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the questions poured in Olga felt herself shrink at all the attention. Somehow, she felt that this was going to be a lot more than simply cooking for her new Queen...</span></div></div>",

They both had a helpful nature though, so that was something\u2026 Olga supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really should get something more appropriate to wear.\u201d Amoxtli commented half-way through a tour of the city streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 fine\u2026\u201d Olga huffed, quickly wiping the sweat from her brow to hide the droplets from her Naga escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fine.\u201d Amoxtli insisted, \u201cI can see the heat building up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was baffled, could Nagas <i>see</i> heat!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you will not wear something more comfortable\u2026\u201d The guard added as they continued down the cobbled street, \u201cYou should at least go topless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman\u2019s face turned the color of a tomato as she processed what Amoxtli had just said. She had seen enough snake tits from just that accident with Amoxtli to scar her for a lifetime, let alone coming to this sweltering city and seeing every tenth woman here with her bouncy reptile-boobs out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh now it\u2019s getting worse!\u201d Amoxtli added, mistaking the blush for Olga\u2019s poor ability to cope with the heat worsening. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the market.\u201d She added firmly, roughly grabbing Olga\u2019s wrist in one of her caramel-colored hands and directing her down a side-alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed a few houses, weaving in between the stone buildings before emerging into a much larger street. While Olga may have been in an unfamiliar city in an unfamiliar land, she could tell right away that this was a market. She could hear women bartering around her, tents covering people\u2019s wares as they flogged them and all kinds of items on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amoxtli let go of Olga\u2019s wrist, she felt a bit more comfortable. Here she at least knew the ropes. Meanwhile, her serpentine guide busied herself peering over the tops of the crowd, trying to spy a stall that was selling clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver there!\u201d Amoxtli called out, pointing at a shop just across the street. Olga was still reluctant, but went along with it. As the pair approached, the owner slithered out to greet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most of the Naga Olga had seen in the city, she was brown skinned, dark-haired and slim. She was comparatively modestly dressed, in a long skirt with a poncho draped over her top, but that might have been to show off her wares to potential customers. Beneath the skirt, Olga could spy a long vibrant green tail slithering behind her. \u201cWelcome! What are you ladies\u2026 looking\u2026 for\u2026\u201d The shop-keeper\u2019s greetings were stalled as she noticed the tail-less two-armed customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are looking for a loose dry season top, nothing with arm-holes.\u201d Amoxtli snapped firmly, she was all business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away, is this sort of thing what you are looking for?\u201d The shopkeeper replied, twirling around so the pair got a good look at her poncho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Olga nervously replied, she was at least happy that she had been taken for clothes, instead of Amoxtli being more insistent about her strutting around in the buff. \u201cDoes it come in a blue?\u201d She asked, gaining a little confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake-woman nodded, before rifling around with all four of her arms in a pile of clothes, before whipping out a bright electric-blue poncho. \u201cMatches your eyes.\u201d She commented, holding the garment up to Olga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli saw the smile on Olga\u2019s face. \u201cYou like it?\u201d She asked, receiving a nod in response. \u201cHow much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga jumped, \u201cOh no! Don\u2019t waste money on me!\u201d She quickly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, I am supposed to be showing you a good time here, it\u2019s my treat.\u201d Amoxtli replied, her lower set of arms producing a small pile of coins from a drawstring purse at her waist. \u201cJust promise me you will put it on when we return to the palace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt flows so much!\u201d Olga giggled; she couldn\u2019t stop twirling around in her new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it, good to know my coin did not go to waste.\u201d Amoxtli chuckled. The pair had gone to try on Olga\u2019s new outfit; the guard\u2019s quarters had been empty at the time, so Amoxtli waited outside as Olga changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga picked up the hem of her outfit, curious about the design that edged it, she heard little noises coming from the doorway. Turning her head to face the sounds, she saw strands of long black hair dart away, followed by giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think they like you haha!\u201d Amoxtli chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had suspected that some of Coatzintli\u2019s daughters had been spying on her. It was clearly harmless fun, after Olga found out it was them. The first time it happened she had felt a creepy sense of being watched come over her, it hadn\u2019t helped her with settling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, I can tell them to stop it.\u201d Amoxtli added, trying to break the awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! No no! It\u2019s fine,\u201d Olga insisted; some of them looked like they were just kids after all, plus she didn\u2019t want to be known as a bossy bitch right after arriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you need me to tell them off at some point, let me know.\u201d The guard added, \u201cYou are living in the palace after all, don\u2019t want them bothering you at the dead of night or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing Olga had to get used to. She had been given one of the servant\u2019s quarters in the palace; although calling it that was a bit harsh. It was very well furnished, with plenty of decorations and exotic plants to try to banish the dungeon aesthetic the stone walls would otherwise have put off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you don\u2019t need me, I\u2019ll be off on my shift.\u201d Amoxtli added, picking up her halberd and slithering for the door. \u201cIf you need me, I am stationed in the barracks. It\u2019s the building to the left when you leave the palace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga watched as her only friend for hundreds of miles left the room, followed by some yelling as the muscular Naga shooed the offending kids from earlier away. Guess it was time for her to do some of her own exploring before hunkering down with her new kitchen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite Amoxtli's interference with the small gathering of royal hatchlings, Olga would not find herself without an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverywhere she walked, she attracted stares. No human had set foot this deep in the Marshes for quite a long time, and certainly not one with long golden hair and such fair skin. The occasional pirate or explorer, for sure, but a chef? Olga was the least capable human that anyone had ever laid eyes upon! She stood lower than even the shortest Naga by at least a head, and scurried around beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a strange creature, some tailless armless <i>thing</i> that had wandered into the palace one day. The children were mesmerized by her presence. Many Naga in the Marshes went their entire lives without seeing hide nor hair of the scaleless, squishy species and were more confused by their seeming lack of defenses than anything. How did this poor \"Olga\" get around on those stubby little meat sticks? She was low to the ground, with no way to extend beyond standing on her... \"toes\", was that what they were called? And she had only half as many arms as any Naga proper, without claws or even wings like the occasional Siren that would fly inland from the Bay. Whereas Humans feared the Naga, the snake women were just more perplexed as to why (and <i>how</i>) this odd little species seemed to have claimed so much of Yndyre for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut among the countless pairs of eyes that seemed to watch her, one set seemed the most diligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few days since Olga had come to the palace. She'd done some exploring, gotten to know a few more of Coatlzintli's servants, and had a more general idea of what she was supposed to be doing throughout the day. Once she'd picked up a few more tunics (long enough on her to be worn as short dresses) and had been given a cursory tour of the Palace by Amoxtli, Olga had decided that it was time for her to get to know the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich naturally, given the vast difference between their two cultures and the <i>stance</i> of the people she'd be servicing, was much different than the one from the Bleakfrost Tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You light the coals underneath the stone,\" Amoxtli lowered a torch into the long bin of kindling that ran underneath the slab-built that extended from the wall, \"And while it warms, you prepare the meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen and larder were incredibly spacious. Various carcasses of felled beasts hung high up the walls, with barrels full of spices and vegetables. The heat was not kind to the meat's odor, this much Olga would admit to. It wasn't overpowering, but the smell of animal corpse was everpresent in the room. <i>So much</i> meat went into the Naga diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid to really season it. Peppers, spices, anything that will give it flavor.\" one of the kitchen aides demonstrated with one pair of arms while gesticulating with the other, \"I've been told that you humans have better tasty parts on your tongues than Naga. It might not taste good to <i>you</i>, but <i>you're</i> not the one who we're looking to satisfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. Just a few months ago she was an assistant chef to Ms. Somaria back in Racovania, and now she was going to be running an entire castle's kitchen and making meals literally fit for a queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your human sense of taste to say what goes well with what, and then double it.\" the aide said, kneading some mammoth muscle, \"No, <i>triple</i> it. We want the Queen to be happy, full, and not at all regretting her decision in hiring you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Atzi</i>\". Amoxtli hissed at the kitchen aide before cursing at her in Naga<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just meant given your lack of <i>experience</i> in cooking for Naga.\" the smaller snake corrected, \"Given that you're just a Legger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Atzi</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had gotten used to these kinds of comments. As harshly as the Naga were treated back in Racovania, at least they were respected. Here, Olga was treated like some kind of commodity. She often idly wondered how she'd been put in a position where <i>not</i> having a snake's tail and four arms had her considered a freak. It was sobering, that much was for sure, to be constantly talked down to. For having such a high position in the royal palace, she still felt like every bit the barmaid she'd started out as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in her grouching that she noticed a set of brown fingers wrapped around the edge of the arch that led into the rest of the palace. One golden eye peeped over the edge for just long enough to meet with Olga's before zipping back behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amoxtli?\" Olga said with an awkward and forced laugh, \"Looks like I've got another visitor... <i>again</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>HEY</i>!\" Amoxtli shouted, \"Royalty or not, I will tan your hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offending snake woman's tail flicked into sight as whichever one of Coatlzintli's clutch that it was flinched at getting caught. A small squeak of voyeuristic intention gave her away entirely, and the red-tailed guard snake rattled towards the doorway. She swore at the girl in Naga, all four of her arms flailing around angrily in her wild gesticulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been following around Ms. Olga since she got here!\" she said, finally, in Common, \"Present yourself and apologize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much shame and embarrassment for all those involved, the hatchling in question came into view...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With much shame and embarassment for all those involved, the hatchling in question came into view. And once she'd ducked her head and slithered more than partway into the kitchen, Olga found herself taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the Naga that Olga had met with stood taller than her. It came with having long tails to stand on instead of legs. Some were bigger than others, naturally. But apart from the Queen, the Naga that slithered in shamefully with her head ducked in the doorway, out of both shame and necessity, was easily the biggest one that Olga had ever seen. Not accounting for girth, she may have been as long as the Queen herself, with especially large humanoid parts to match! Had she stood on two legs, this member of Coatlzintli's clutch would have been a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>All the way</i>, Quetzalli.\" Amoxtli said sternly, both sets of arms crossed tightly, \"It's not befitting your status to do apologize halfheartedly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Naga let out a little sigh and did her best to coil her long tail in from the hallway. Feet upon feet of green and brown, with little yellow speckles long the pattern, wriggled into some semblance of place as she got into what Amoxtli apparently considered a more apologetic stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My apologize, Head Chef.\" she said in a surprisingly high voice to contrast her mother's contralto, \"I-I didn't mean to offend you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Olga blinked dumbly at the sight, \"No sweat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga blinked dumbly at Olga's human expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it's uh...\" Olga gulped, \"It's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl was easily twice the size of Amoxtli beneath her. It was quite the sight, seeing the shorter red-scaled Naga bossing around someone so large and imposing. With her broad shoulders and strong features, Quetzalli almost looked more like a warrior than Amoxtli did. Albeit without the bulging muscles. While not fat by any means, the sturdy and sizable Naga was a bit soft. A lifetime in the castle, for sure, was the culprit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish for me to send her back to her room, then?\" Amoxtli said like a stern parent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay.\" Olga relented easily, not wishing to upset the Naga any more than she already had, \"You're free to stay, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quetzalli.\" the princess answered excitedly, \"I'm Mother's oldest daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And next in line for the crown.\" Amoxtli added helpfully, \"So we <i>expect</i> her to act a bit more responsibly than her clutchmates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga could literally sit on this woman's shoulders and ride her like a steed. This was so wild. The Queen was an example of just <i>Size</i>. Of course Coatlizintli was hugely tall as well as obscenely fat. But Quetzalli was rather slender at her size. It somehow put the difference between their two peoples into perspective. The various breeds of Naga came with different sizes, scale patterns... everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Olga?\" the princess asked, \"Are you, um... okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga snapped back to attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course! Just thinking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother says that when she's hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry, Blue Eyes?\" Amoxtli pat her friend on the back, \"It <i>is</i> about time for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had never thought that she'd be put into such a strange position. Snake women, great stone buildings. Giant dinosaur carcasses hanging from the wall. Being put in charge of... <i>anything</i>. She was a humble smith's daughter, and now she was leading the charge in feeding a bunch of women with snake parts. It was all a little... destabilizing.</span></div></div>",

Atzli, Amoxtli and Quetzalli all let out a soft \"ah\" of approval. Their heads bobbed as they seemed to understand the problem. Of course her legs were tired, those weird bony things. Moving them so much and across such a big palace, no wonder the poor human was feeling tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right.\" Olga said a bit more confidently, having successfully gotten away with her deception, \"My <i>legs</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli slithered forward and placed a comforting hand on her charge's shoulder. Her hands were rough and battle-worn. They were strong but, admittedly, comforting. In any other time that she was experiencing a sudden and acute culture shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to have a dais prepared for you?\" she asked in all sincerity, \"It's quite a, um... <i>walk</i> back to your quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-May I accompany you back to your quarters, Ms. Olga?\" Quetzalli squeaked, \"Ms. Amoxtli? May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's blue eyes widened, suddenly feeling the pressure in her chest again. She very suddenly wanted to be <i>alone</i> and away from these snake people. To get some peace and quiet with the only bit of normalcy she had left in the world\u2014herself. But she'd gone and done made herself sound like a cripple, practically. How could she possibly have said no without also opening up the possibility of her going to lunch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuure...\" Olga said with a forced smile, \"That'd be... <i>greaaat</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if she's okay with it.\" Amoxtli nodded approvingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Quetzalli pumped her four arms excitedly and grabbed Olga by one of her hands, \"Come, Miss, I know the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was practically dragged off by the speed with which the Naga slithered away, left looking back at her bodyguard and kitchen aide as they looked on at her pitiably. It would appear that the handicap of being \"human\" was going to come in handy here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to carry you, Miss?\" the big Naga asked helpfully, \"With your little... walkers... and all being hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was put down gently in front of her private quarters about ten minutes later. Quetzalli was able to hoist her up and put her down without so much as breaking a sweat, despite all of her squirmings. Naga were much stronger, much more naturally muscular than humans, so even a spoiled city girl like Quetzalli was able to throw Olga around. Somehow, she was less than enthused by that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, Ms. Olga.\" Quetzalli said, much more chipper after her little \"stroll\" with the honored guest, \"Would you like me to put you in your bed\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No.</i>\" Olga said sharply, \"No thank you, Quetzalli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large naga woman was excitable, that much was for sure. She'd been one of the hatchlings chiefly bent on following her around. She'd never gotten a good look at her before, but now she was sure of it. Quetzalli had been stalking her since she'd come to the palace, and Amoxtli had only confirmed it. Any other day, it would have been sweet. But as she headed towards her bedroom, Olga found herself a bit annoyed with her fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miss Olga?\" Quetzalli peeped from behind her back, \"Um, I was wondering...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Quetzalli?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be okay if I... asked you some questions?\" Quetzalli did her best to hide a smile, \"About your culture. I-I've never met a Legger before.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was about to snap and let out all of the frustration that she'd accrued over the course of her journey away from home loose on the girl. Damn the size difference and damn the fact that she was a princess and damn the fact that she could literally eat her. Olga wanted some peace and <i>quiet</i> and to be away from anything that reminded her that she was literally across the land and far away from anything she'd ever known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she looked over the giant snake woman again. She seemed so excited. Amoxtli had been right when she introduced them to her\u2014they were just girls. Despite the fact that she was bigger, and maybe even older than Olga, Quetzalli was just as sheltered about the world as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe even moreso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Olga sighed, \"Come in. Um, mind your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's private chambers were high enough to accommodate Quetzalli's stature comfortably. Her long tail stretched across the room, giving Olga a good look at just how long and vibrant it was. Patli's bright yellow stripe coursed through Coatzintli's brown and green pattern, tracing the splotches in golden trimming that stood out in the candlelight. Olga sat on the stone bed (that was all that it was really good for, certainly not sleeping!) while the princess stretched across the equally stone floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head propped up in her hands, elbows resting on the floor as her tail swished excitedly at the end, even Olga had to admit that she was very cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So vampires are real?\" she asked with wonder in her eyes, \"And they like snow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody <i>likes</i> snow.\" Olga said sourly, \"They're just already cold and dead so they can't feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowww\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess was awestruck by every bit of Olga's Racovanian heritage that she could recall. Or embellish upon. Since coming here, everyone had treated her like a second class citizen. But this girl ate up everything that she could remember from her homeland\u2014how could she <i>not</i> at least try to impress the <i>one</i> Naga who didn't think she was a cripple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you a cook for your Queen?\" Quetzalli leaned forward again, \"Do humans have Queens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans do have Queens!\" Olga answered helpfully, \"But no, my Queen lives in Adinah, and I am in Racovania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those far away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that she was so big and broad, Quetzalli carried herself like a girl Olga's size. She was so shy in front of what she considered to be \"adults\" like Amoxtli and Atzli, even the other members of the servitude. But Olga had seen her really open up to her. It was sweet\u2014in a way. Olga was a commodity for the right reason here. A stranger from a foreign land, as she felt was more appropriate. Even if she was just a farm girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to stay through the Rainy Season?\" Quetzalli blinked, \"Oh shoot, you already said you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be staying here until your mother sends me back.\" Olga laughed, trying a little too hard not to think about never seeing home again, \"But with the way she eats, I don't think she's one to turn away cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, when I'm Queen will you be my chef?\" Quetzalli asked, \"Is your Queen big like Mother, even in the Dry Season?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In Naga culture, it's a sign of wealth and status to still be able to stay large in the Dry Season. Like, the bigger the better\" Quetzalli explained, \"When it's the dry season, is your Queen still fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't <i>have</i> a Dry Season.\" Olga answered matter-of-factly, \"We have two seasons where I'm from. Winter and Summer. So Cold and... Less Cold. So I guess she's fat all year 'round? If she's fat. I don't know. I've never seen her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowwwww\" Quetzalli said for about the hundredth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs strange as it was... Olga rather liked the big naga. She was sweet. And reminded her a little bit of herself. Not that she'd suddenly gotten all the more worldly since coming to this new place that she'd barely explored. But Quetzalli made her feel... important. It was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I begin cooking.\" Olga offered, \"Would you like to watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygods<i>yes</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, something told Olga that she'd made another friend in a rather high place. Somehow. Her luck had been awfully hit-or-miss lately. But Quetzalli seemed to be a nice addition to her growing circle of scaly friends. Things may have just begun with her new career at the palace, but at least <i>someone</i> here thought she was interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd need that, if she was ever going to get acclimated here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Quetzalli called it the rainy season, she <i>meant</i> it. Olga had seen more than her fair share of rain living in Racovania, through rain or snow there was little sunlight, but this kind of rain felt unnatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the rains had come, they didn\u2019t stop. Day-in day-out it rained and rained, with the water flowing through the various channels and gutters built into the city, sending the excess water out into the lake. It wasn\u2019t light rain either, thick heavy droplets that were almost painful pounded down onto the stone rooftops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what must have been two weeks of this deluge, it finally stopped\u2026 somewhat. There seemed to still be some rain every other day, but it was far cry from the torrential downpour that preceded it. As the rains slowed down somewhat, another change came over the city. The plant-life came into bloom, turning the dark-gray city into a rainbow of color. Not only that, but the markets were filled with foodstuffs, it made gathering for the royal kitchens far easier now that every stall seemed to stock everything required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt rains for *oomph* months, and then we get no rain *gulp* for months, then the cycle starts anew.\u201d Amoxtli explained as she and Olga leaned out of the palace window, observing the beautiful landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiiight\u2026\u201d Olga replied. She understood the rain/no rain concept perfectly fine, but why was Amoxtli eating all the time? It wasn\u2019t just her either; whenever she took trips down into the markets, almost every Naga seemed to be snacking on something; women washing their clothes with their upper arms, whilst passing roasted animal legs past their lips with their lower ones; gaggles of chatty teenagers using all of their limbs to pass snacks around as they gossiped. Even the soldiers who normally stood still as statues were eating on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had just started to feel like she was finally getting the hang of this city and its quirks, but then it just seemed to throw another weird cultural activity at her like this one. Feeling bold, Olga decided to pry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo why is everyone eating so much?\u201d She prodded, hoping it wasn\u2019t something sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli finished her mouthful, and licked her fingers. \u201cTo try and get fat.\u201d She responded casually, as it is was the most normal thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Olga replied. She was already kinda weirded out that pretty much the entire population wanted the queen to be the size of a large house (apart from ironically, queen Coatlzintli herself), but this was bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you do not have a dry season! How silly of me.\u201d Amoxtli added, berating herself. \u201cDuring the dry season, food supplies run low, but during the rainy season we have more than enough food to go around several times over.\u201d She explained. \u201cSo during the rainy season we build up fat stores to help us through the dry season.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there was still food around when I arrived.\u201d Olga pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause there is still some food, but not enough to keep the population going on an empty stomach,\u201d Amoxtli continued. \u201cEveryone rations, but their fat stores help keep them going. You should put on some weight as well; you won\u2019t make it through a whole dry season being all skinny like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was a bit taken aback by that. \u201cME!? I uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe dry season is many months long,\u201d Amoxtli added. \u201cYou were fine when you arrived, as we only had a little left of it\u2026 but a whole dry season? We better get you ready for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok Olga?\u201d Atzi asked, shaking the blonde woman out of her thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re going a bit slower than usual there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga looked down, she had become so lost in her thoughts, that she practically stopped cutting the meat on the chopping board. \u201cSorry, just\u2026 thinking about something.\u201d She hand-waved; Atzi shrugged, and got back to work, helping herself to a bowl of mixed sugared fruit as she passed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the bowl, Olga wondered if she should take some as well. If getting fat here was supposed to be good for your health in the long run\u2026 perhaps she should? Ugh, but her instants told her that she shouldn\u2019t indulge, this whole concept and attitude towards obesity was so\u2026 foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga jumped again as the python-like Quetzalli slithered up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Olga replied, but then thought. Quetzalli had experienced nothing but Naga life and culture, perhaps she might be able to help her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026 Quetzalli.\u201d Olga began, getting the snake princess\u2019 attention. \u201cThe whole, getting fat for the dry season thing, what do you think about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it is normal.\u201d The young serpent replied, \u201cIs it not normal where you come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga then remembered how fat her former employer was getting before she left. Well, perhaps there were\u2026 some exceptions. \u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s not.\u201d Olga answered. \u201cI have just, never done this sort of thing before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she had opened up a little too much to the girl, but Quetzalli seemed to honestly want to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the first time I remember it, it was fun. You get to eat anything you want, and you don\u2019t have to worry about eating too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head chef was rather surprised by that answer, fun? Quetzalli then continued, spurred on by happy memories. \u201cOne time, I ate a whole buffalo in one sitting!\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd nobody judged you for it?\u201d Olga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuetzalli looked confused. \u201cWhy would someone do that?\u201d She replied in her high pitched voice, \u201cChantico ate two that very meal. Everyone is trying to get fat in rainy season; nobody will look harshly on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to cheer Olga up a bit, \u201cThank you Quetzalli.\u201d Happy to have helped, a blush overtook the huge snake-woman\u2019s face as she struck a great beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she should eat a bit more, Olga thought to herself, at least not too much.</span></div></div>",

Where the snakes could slither over and under, Olga was trudging along and stepping over this root and under that branch. The hot, muggy temperature meant that she was forced to dress light, and the terrain meant that she had to stay mobile. The long, flowy tunics that she'd gotten used to wearing in the Dry Season were unfeasible in this climate as it once again became strange to the unfortunate chef. The tan she'd been left with between sunburns had darkened her skin a bit, but her soft stomach was still every inch the Racovanian shade of snow-white. She'd dressed in a half shirt that left her ivory-white underbelly exposed for all to see and scoff at, and a short skirt with boots. It <i>should</i> have been shorts, but... well, snakes didn't have much use for those lying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small team of scouts had come along to protect the kitchen's hands as they gathered the ingredients for the season. Though the Queens had not yet returned, no one was going to let the royal staff slack off. And besides, there was an outsider among them. If Olga was ever to cook for the Queen in any season, it was important that she familiarize herself with the ingredients of their culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, the Marshes provide everything that we need to survive.\" Atzli continued, one hand rubbing a steadily rounding stomach that pooched into a pot-belly, \"Today we'll be gathering Rainberries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound so hard.\" Olga panted, happy to hear that her excursion into this damp damnation might go smoothly, \"So is that why we brought the sacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking, White Belly.\" Atzli snorted as she tossed the Legger a burlap bag, big enough for Olga to crouch down in, marked with something in Naga, \"Guess you're the head chef for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Olga's confusion and surprise, she handed each of the accompanying guards a sack. The fit, toned bodies of Coatlzintli's guards were slowly being buried underneath the excessive consumption that had gripped the Marshes. Abs bulged underneath brown naga chub as arms swelled fit to burst under the golden armbands that denoted their rank. They were no less fast or strong, but it was strange to see the women she'd seen as protectors slowly growing so plump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven stranger that they would be helping. They were just picking berries. How many could they possibly need?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay.\" Olga blinked, \"So where are the berries? Let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't agree with you more.\" Atzli laughed, \"I'll show you what we're looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending herself upwards on her long black tail, Atzli disappeared into the canopy of trees. Some rustling followed, as well as the distinct sound of branches snapping. Accumulated dewdrops and stilled rainfall poured down on top of the gathering party. After a moment, Atzli returned to the ground level of the marshes with a piece of fruit the size of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, this's a good one.\" Atzli laughed tossing it up and down a bit, \"Nice and ripe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed it into Olga's sack, which sent her backward by a few steps. It was deceptively heavy! Olga thought that they were just going to be picking berries, like... <i>berries</i>. Snowberries back home could fit between your fingers! These weren't berries! These were <i>fruit</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainberries soak up all the nutrients of the marsh and store 'em all year round.\" Atzli slapped her belly proudly, comparatively small to some of the soldier's fleshy brown tummies that bulged beneath their armor.   \"We Naga eat them during the rainy season to help make sure we put on lots of weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this fruit... makes you fat?\" Olga gulped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of them might, but you can't just eat fruit all season long. Gotta have <i>meat</i>.\" Atzli said with a smile, \"But that'll make putting on weight easier, and it'll help you shed your skin when you get to outgrowin' it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... my species\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies, get to climbin'!\" Atzli clapped her two upper hands together, \"We've only got a few hours before the rain starts again so let's make it snappy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that?\" Amoxtli whispered, \"That's a gigantopithecus\u2014you ever had one of those before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never <i>seen</i> one of those before.\" Olga grimaced, \"Let alone eaten one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, you're both monkeys.\" the red snake apologized, \"Sorry, forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marshes supported a wide variety of life. Olga was learning that. From the great lizards to the gigantic fish to the hairless mammoths and also apparently giant monkeys. Over the past few days, Olga had been invited out on hunting trips with the Queen's Guard. Atzli had recommended it, but Amoxtli had been the most adamant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We risk our lives every day in the Marshes. Sometimes we don't all make it back.\"</i> she'd said in a surprisingly stern voice, <i>\"I would really appreciate it if you came along and watched what we do so this kingdom can eat.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure, she knew that it was hard. She'd watched a few of them take down the Tyranto-thingy on her way from Racovania. But these beasts in the Marshes were <i>enormous</i>. And seeing the great monkey, this giganto-whatsit, really helped put it in perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Rainy Season, <i>everything</i> knows to get nice and fat.\" Amoxtli kept her voice low, \"The Marshes provide us and our food with everything we need to make it through the Dry Season, and that includes our friend there\u2014looks like he's already overdone it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga watched as the great monkey, gorged so full and fat that it could barely move, continued to feast on some of the very same kinds of foliage that she'd gathered with Atzli over the past week. Seeing it stuff itself so fervently, so <i>easily</i> made Olga realize just how ill-equipped humanity was for the Marshes. She'd worked for <i>hours</i> to get what that Monkey ate in minutes. But at the same time, he'd loaded himself with enough of the same nutrients that the Naga required to make it through the season and then some. He must be filled with everything the Naga needed to survive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might not be sporting, but we're gonna wait until he's gone and fallen asleep.\" Amoxtli continued, \"Then we'll take him back to the capital and Atzli will show you how to cook him up good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting <i>better</i>.\" Nochtli's face scrunched up in displeasure, \"But I've also <i>had</i> better. So make of that what you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga and the blue-tailed Naga had been in the kitchen since the morning, with Olga attempting to familiarize herself with the strange inner workings of what was to be her kitchen. While the other staff worked tirelessly to feed the guards and the Queen's many children, Olga had been put on a sort of probational assignment. Until she learned the Rainy Season recipes\u2014rather than simply grilling and cooking the various meats of the Dry Season\u2014she was to do nothing else but gather ingredients and cook them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to throw this one out too?\" Olga sighed despondently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't exactly afford to go hungry now can I?\" Nochtli snorted, snatching the bowl of stew with one set of thick arms while the other caressed her further fattened form, \"I have a figure to maintain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all of seemingly everyone, Nochtli had begun putting on weight the second that water fell from the sky. However, she took to it with much more fervor than the others. Already quite large, she had quite the head start. Her position in the castle was an important one, and she had the diet (and appetite) of any royal hatchling. The Queen and her mate still predisposed in Adinah, she had taken to tasting food for the hatchlings so as to \"ensure that her Highness's lineage remains safe\" but, in all honesty, it was an open secret that it was just an excuse for her to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNochtli hadn't moved from her spot since the morning while Olga puttered around the kitchen, content to be fed and provide as much feedback as possible. All she'd done all day is eat, without any of the exercise that the other staff members had managed to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming along quite nicely, don't you think?\" Nochtli purred as she lifted up her big brown belly, letting it collapse back into place as it hung low over her skirt. She hefted it in her two lower hands, brown flesh bulging heavily between her thick clawed digits as it sloshed from side to side. \"The Queen might mistake me for one of her own if I'm to keep going at his pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga simply rolled her eyes. She'd never understood this culture's fascination with fat. Their Queen was massive and had hired her with the explicit intent of being slimmed down. Everyone stuffed their faces for half of a year and encouraged her to do the same. But Nochtli was the most open and adamant about how much she loved her own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely getting fat faster than anyone else.\" Olga said, deadpan, \"That much is for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'd better start packing on weight as fast as you can, Olga.\" Nochtli stroked her gut lovingly, \"Before the Season's over and you wither away into nothing!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olga didn't receive much of an education working as a barmaid. As a smith's daughter, she had very little access to book learning. Or books, for that matter. Everything she knew how to read came from order slips and things that Helga and Somaria had written down, back at the Tavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't take a fancy city-girl education to know that Humans and Naga were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs friendly as the Naga had been to her, they clearly didn't know what was best for her biology. Half the time, they forgot what the word for \"legs\" was. She had to explain, at length, that she did not shed her skin and could not ingest barely-cooked meat. <i>Nor</i> could her throat stretch <i>and</i> she didn't lay eggs. Also, they kept calling blood \"cold\"? Olga was pretty sure that wasn't right. With all of that in mind, she took this whole \"get fat for the Dry Season\" thing with a grain of salt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga imagined toddling around at Helga's size, and it would have made it almost impossible to keep up with the heavy workload she'd been placed under. Feeding an entire Queen's den of servants was not an easy job, and she needed to use her feet as much as possible. With the great spaces between cooking slabs and the general distance between most destinations to be reached, Olga didn't see herself being <i>able</i> to put on weight during her tenure here, let alone <i>wanting</i> to. She'd been getting plenty of exercise since she'd started her position at the palace and it had helped to keep her slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, a little bit of belly bulged out from underneath her ripened breasts. In a land of plentiful food, her figure was allowed to flourish as the Gods had intended in a way that would have never been possible in the scarce snowy landscape of Racovania. But Olga was just filling out a bit. Some muscle was underneath those ivory-white legs that carried her back and forth, back and forth across the stone floors of the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might have been hired by the Queen to feed the den of snakes, but only because she didn't <i>think</i> like them. She was hired because she was new, and provided a fresh outlook on things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why do things the way that the Naga had always done them? Why not bring a little bit of Racovania into the Marshes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You absolute fucking madwoman.\" Amoxtli gasped, \"You can't... Olga, I don't think that you can do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can. It's just a plant.\" Olga snorted as she picked a Rainberry from the vine, \"When Aztli said that they grow on vines, I had an idea on how to keep them ready year-round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo especially tubby guards stood on thick meaty tails, brown bellies smooshed against the stone as they looped the long green vine from one end of the kitchen wall to the other. Resting them on the uneven stones that extended from the wall, they drooped lazily from a safe distance to the heat of the stone slab below them. On one end, Olga had it potted and set to the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olga these berries are sacred to us.\" Amoxtli said in a hushed voice, hunkering down and bunching her belly rolls, \"You can't take them out of the Marshes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're still in the Marshes.\" Olga said matter of factly, \"And we take them back to the palace to eat them, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but Olga.\" Amoxtli pursed her lips, \"I don't think you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's still soil from the Marshes. They might not get as <i>big</i> as they do out there, but this way we can keep them all year 'round!\" Olga beamed proudly, hands on her hips as she gestured to the other guards performing similar tasks, \"As long as we keep them watered, they'll keep getting bigger and bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as...\" Amoxtli grimaced, \"I don't know, Olga, I still don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it'll all be okay.\" Olga pat her friend on the meaty back, \"It's called <i>farming</i>, Amoxtli. We do it where I'm from all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Olga?\" Quetzalli hefted a potato in her hands, \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a vegetable, Quetzalli. And if we save the rain in containers or pools, we can keep them alive and healthy even in the Dry Season!\" Olga smiled, plucking it from her big brown hands and beginning to peel it, \"I know how to cook these very well. Everyone where I'm from puts these in almost everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it... is it meat?\" the great snake asked, genuinely confused, \"It doesn't smell like meat. It's very, um... cold. And hard. And a little joyless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga laughed a little tossed the now naked potato into the bucket with the rest. She, and some of the chef hands, had shucked plenty of them in not a lot of time at all. A lot of things, Olga balked at. But the \"four arms\" thing easily had to be the most useful part about having Naga assistance. She and Ms. Somaria would have had to have worked all day to get this much done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe now, but you can do <i>anything</i> with potatoes.\" Olga smiled, feeling at home for the first time since she'd come to this temperamental place as she peeled the brown skin from the starch of her homeland, \"Cook them, bake them, boil them... and they grow right in the ground, so no need to climb any trees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they... <i>taste</i> good?\" Quetzalli made a face, sniffing an unpeeled one from the bag<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they ever!\" Olga answered with no small amount of pride, \"They're full of good stuff and they take on the flavor of whatever you put next to them. You put them in stew, you chop them up, you put cheese on them... Ms. Helga used to love them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kay...\" Quetzalli smiled nervously, \"I-If you say so... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">are you sure you can't just cook meat?</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Rainy Season progressed, Olga did her best to acquiesce to her new position. Having suitably made herself at home in the kitchen and gotten more used to the ingredients she'd be working with (and a few of her own!) Olga finally started to feel like she'd found her niche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure there were still some hiccups. Naga culture was still so strange to her, and the constant raining made it very hard to go out and explore the kingdom! With little to do other than cook and cook and cook, Olga had plenty of time to experiment when she wasn't managing to scrounge out a social life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I <i>love</i> it~\" Nochtli gushed, kneading both sides of her boulder-big belly as it swelled out in front of her, \"Olga, sweetie, your cooking is <i>soooo</i> good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga couldn't help but feel the pride welling up in her chest. Nochtli's whole job was to eat. It was literally almost all she did. So if this fat snake liked her cooking, she must have been doing something right! For a species so obsessed with bulking up for the Dry Season, they could be surprisingly picky! And at the size that her blue-tailed taste tester was, Olga would have hardly believed that she'd have been anyone to turn down food. Thankfully, ever since she really found her routine in the kitchen, there hadn't been much of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too kind, thank you.\" Olga said with a polite little bow, feeling her head swell, \"It's just... I added a little something from where I come from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care <i>what</i> it is, I just want <i>more</i>!\" Nochtli's quivering gut, folding into an apron of two sagging folds of brown blubber, rippled as she tittered in appreciation, \"The queen is going to <i>love</i> what you've done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have more?\" Nochtli clasped her fleshy hands together over her blooming bosom, \"Oh please oh <i>please</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to wait until dinner time.\" Olga whipped out another Racovanian delicacy that she'd brought to the Marshes \"But you can have a sweet roll!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, things were going well for Olga. She'd finally settled into her own! In a whole kingdom where everyone was clamoring to get fat, her food was becoming more and more appreciated. As bellies swelled and appetites grew, figures fattened and flesh bulged, the Naga ladies got less and less peculiar about the \"Legger food\" that had been decried when she'd first taken the position. Now, there were hardly any complaints about anything that Olga managed to whip up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe improvements she'd made would, hopefully, mean that she could sustain these recipes in the Dry Season. Not to this volume, of course, but there would be much less moping about the lackluster food options available during the former part of the year...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least as long as I'm around.\" Olga said proudly, stirring her stew, \"Maybe the Queen was right about hiring me...\"</span></div></div>",

Not just by the Queen who had hired her, and was still absentia with her wife in the Captial, but by a majority of the staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of what anything that anyone had to say about her mostly amounted to good things. Sure she was an outsider, but she could cook well! \"For a Legger\" was usually added as a sort of a cultural afterthought. She was still seen as something of a small, defenseless creature that needed protecting. But with the way that she cooked, no one <i>minded</i> protecting her really. She was one of them now! Even if she had those weird wiggly leg things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga took to her newfound passion for introducing Racovanian flavors and styles into the Naga diet with gusto. Even the things she wasn't <i>sure</i> about, she was willing to try. She would spend hours in the kitchen, whipping up recipes for no reason other than experimentation. She was introducing new items into the menu whenever she found a combination that worked. With plenty of herbs, spices, fruits, and rich fatty meats to choose from, there were plenty of options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoreover, with everyone still trying to bulk up for the Dry Season, there were plenty of contenders waiting with open mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, she tended to show favorites to those closest to her. While her newfound fame around the Palace had meant that there were a lot of people who were beginning to warm up to her\u2014like snakes to a rock in the sun\u2014Olga stayed loyal to those who had helped her acclimate in the first place. She made sure that her friends were treated well! After all, it was the least she could do. Showing a little favoritism wasn't exactly uncalled for in this situation, was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Nochtli was her \"official\" taste tester, Olga was happy to provide her friends with extra portions. It was how she showed affection, after all. So, when they'd visit her in the kitchen, Olga would sneak them extra helpings. At the dinner table, Olga had them served more. And when off the clock, Olga was happy to bring treats from her homeland back to their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that meant that a few key players in Olga's story were getting fat\u2014even for the Rainy Season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut among the quickest and most startling gains was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone in the Marshes overindulged during the Rainy Season, obviously. Olga knew that by now. She'd spent more time with the snakes stuffing themselves than she had when they were skrimping by. Something about their biologies allowed them to pile on weight quickly and efficiently and, presumably, lose it just as quickly. It had only been a few months and some women were twice the size that they had started out as. Bellies every shade of brown bulged happily out of tunics, bras, and dresses as they flopped lazily over the base of their tails. Arms swelled, and some even started to jiggle as cheeks chubbed and chins bunched. Olga had never seen so much indulgence, not in any of the Racovanian Festivals, or even all of them put together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>love</i> the Rainy Season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli tipped her head back and opened her fanged mouth wide as an angry belch ripped through the air of the cantina. All four hands resting on her stomach, pressing deep into the squishy brown blubber so as to squeeze that last bit of burp out, Amoxtli sighed contentedly as she poured back another pint, and leaned into the stone table for another morsel. The warrior grunted as her belly rolled onto the stone slab, grabbing at the pot of skewered meats with two chubby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look forward to it every year\" Amoxtli continued drunkenly, rubbing her exposed apron of a stomach with one lower hand, \"I get to eat whatever I want, and <i>damn</i> the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Naga pulled pieces of meat from the skewer with her teeth, audible scraping against her fangs as she yanked the iron stick from one end of her mouth to the other. Six or seven chunks were left in her mouth, chewed and swished between chubby brown cheeks as her forked tongue lathered the bites. She swallowed with a happy sigh, took another drink, and went back to the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between you coming here an' giving me an excuse to stay off the front lines,\" Amoxtli pulled Olga close, pressing her into her sloshing stomach, \"And getting to fill my belly on all that Legger food, this might be the best year of my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli tilted her head back again, letting the ale flow down her throat and cheeks. She wiped the excess away with one jiggly brown arm, patting her gut contentedly as it distended out in front of her. Full of lunch, a hearty dinner with an extra portion from Olga, and the appetizers she'd just wolfed down as they awaited dinner from the Cantina, Amoxtli's belly was drawn taut. Shiny with sweat and humidity, she rested her hands on it proudly, stroking it for good measure as it burbled in digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to slow down, Moxxy.\" Atzli stirred her drink\u2014a fruity liquor from the Bay\u2014across from the two, \"The Rainy Season can't last forever, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a\u2014\" here, Amoxtli cursed in Naga dismissively, \"Don't lecture me on our night out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying, <i>eventually</i> the rain is going to dry up.\" Atzli said in her pretty voice, taking a sip of her small but potent bourbon, \"And they're going to have to roll you out onto the front lines for exercises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli wasn't listening. A particularly buxom snake the overall shape and size of a caramel dollop had caught her eye behind the bar. Judging by the flirtatious wink of her heavily made-up face, Amoxtli's affections were not at all unmutual. The swollen soldier pulled the remaining meat from her skewer, tipped Olga's drink behind her head, and snatched Atzli's from her clawed fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only place I'm gonna be rollin',\" Amoxtli purred huskily as she struggled to unwedge herself from their seat, \"Is around the slab tonight, ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finally free, taut belly wobbling back into place as it hung over her lap, Amoxtli slammed ten pieces down on the table and slithered drunkenly towards the bar. Olga and Atzli watched as she sauntered up to the barmaid, belly pouring onto the bar, and struggled to prop her elbows up flirtatiously on the carved countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she seems to be having a good time.\" Olga said in a pleasant tone, sliding her glass to the end of the table, \"So... what's the protocol here? Do we ask for another barmaid, orrr...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtzli put her glass at the end of the table and said...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't entirely unlike the Amoxtli she'd known since before she arrived to have casual sex with heavyset barmaids. In fact, that was (unfortunately) how they met. Since they'd spent some time together, Olga liked to think that she knew a bit more about her red-scaled bodyguard by now, and she couldn't quite get what Atzli was driving at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Olga asked as another waitress slithered up and filled her cup, \"She seems happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your people have fables?\" Atzli asked, leaning onto the table boredly, \"Stories you tell to children so that they can learn lessons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do, but... most of them are about Vampires.\" Olga clicked her tongue, \"Don't think that's very applicable here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have a story about the Sisters and the Seasons.\" Atzli said, taking a sip of her newly refilled drink before continuing, \"A long time ago there are two sisters; Mara and Amara. They both endure the hardships of the Dry Season and go hungry. When the Rainy Season comes around, Mara is mindful and only stockpiles only what is necessary to make it through the next Season. She grows fat, but only out of necessity. Meanwhile, Amara, her sister, eats everything she can get her hands on. By the time the Seasons change, Amara has gotten too fat to hunt for herself and has to rely on her sister to feed her. Because Mara has to hunt twice as much, and Amara is too soft to properly defend herself\u2014they both die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a beat as Atzli's story hung heavily in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow my fables about Vampires are less depressing.\" Olga said with a drink, \"I thought Naga were <i>supposed</i> to get fat during the Rainy Season?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The story has many meanings, but it's more about mindfulness.\" Atzli took another sip, \"We're all trying to stockpile, yes, but within reason. Amoxtli still has a job to do\u2014what would you do if she was too out of shape to properly defend you, should war happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga looked over to her friend at the bar, having coerced some sweet bread from the waitress as the two of them flirted. No doubt, Amoxtli was getting heavy. Heavier than most of the other Naga by this point, for sure. But she was her friend! And as her friend, shouldn't she want her to be happy? Amoxtli <i>seemed</i> happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food for thought, as it were. Sorry to get so heady during what was supposed to be a fun night out.\" Atzli said with a sudden, forced change of subject, \"You work entirely too hard to have to put up with me being so hard-nosed on <i>and</i> off the clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even as the mood lightened and alcohol began to fog their minds, Olga felt a bit troubled by Atzli's frank discussion of Amoxtli. She had always known the Naga to be a very direct, forward people. It came with the culture, she supposed. So why, all of a sudden, go behind her back to discuss her attitude? And with Olga of all people\u2014was it because she was genuinely worried about her friend? Was it because she blamed Olga for showing her friend favoritism? Was that it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as it got easier to justify, with alcohol, that this was just some deep-seeded desire to gossip that was everpresent in all species in Yndyre, Olga found herself troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

She had become such a dab hand at cooking in her new environment that she didn\u2019t require the assistance of any of the other Naga all the time, so she was alone for the first hour or so of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blonde woman finished up the first batch of stew, she heard the tell-tale slithering sound of an approaching snake woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Olga!\u201d Amoxtli greeted as she appeared in the servant\u2019s doorway and slithered through it. Or at least, she tried to. Amoxtli only got to her waist before suddenly stopping. The extra-plush Naga had become jammed in the frame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh really?\u201d The red-tailed woman grunted as she placed each of her palms against the frame, pushing with her considerable might until her whole serpentine length slithered through. \u201cThat was\u2026 annoying\u2026\u201d Amoxtli grumbled in a snotty tone, turning her nose up at the door before turning back to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Moxxi\u2026 what are you doing up so early?\u201d Olga asked with a slight air of hesitation. She remembered the conversations from last night, and was worried about what answer her friend would give. Olga was also struggling to look straight at Amoxtli; it seemed that even the market stalls rainy-season wear had its limits... either that or the humidity and her swaddling blubber were getting to Amoxtli... because the overweight serpent was topless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Amoxtli was wearing a skirt around her waist, obscuring her crotch from Olga's sight. But her big brown breasts were fully on display! Huge orbs that were kept somewhat perky, as they rested upon her shelf of a stomach, with fat dark-brown teats tipping them. Still, gravity could not be fully denied, as the great sphere were leaning to either side of her colossal stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli slithered back and forth innocently, clawed fingers drumming her belly. \u201cOh just\u2026 woke up early and wondered what that ravishing smell was\u2026\u201d The Naga replied, her eyes flickering to the pot greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my stew\u2026 the same one I cooked before\u2026\u201d Olga replied, trying to subtly ward Amoxtli away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Amoxtli replied with faux innocence. \u201cIt smells different though\u2026 can I have a taste to be sure?\u201d She wasn\u2019t really asking. Amoxtli slithered closer to the pot, her size still hadn\u2019t impeded the speed at which her snake half could cross the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? It\u2019s just stew.\u201d Olga replied, literally having to waft one of Amoxtli\u2019s wandering hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you make such good stew!\u201d Amoxtli teased with a grin, another arm trying to get around the smaller woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not finished!\u201d Olga added, turning around and holding two of Amoxtli\u2019s wrists to try and stop her. This was of course, futile; Amoxtli\u2019s additional appendages instantly tried to snake around so she could help herself to the broth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on!\u201d Her guard replied, leaning closer and causing her big brown belly to envelop the diminutive human slightly. \u201cWe both know it\u2019s going to be good anyway\u2026 can\u2019t I have just a taste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>NO!</b>\u201d Olga snapped. The noise startled Amoxtli, causing her to back off, she had never heard her human friend be so loud before. \u201cMoxxi\u2026 you\u2019re my best friend\u2026 and I didn\u2019t want to say this\u2026 but I have to\u2026\u201d Olga continued, her bottom lip trembling. \u201cYou\u2019re getting too fat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Naga scoffed, the air blowing a loose lock of black her out of her face. \u201cDuh, all Naga get fat in the rainy season.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026 but look at Aztli, you are way bigger than her.\u201d Olga pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she does not have to eat a soldier\u2019s rations.\u201d Amoxtli huffed, crossing both sets of arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga sighed. \u201cThere are guards all around the palace, and I have passed the barracks every time I go to market\u2026 none of them are as big as you\u2026 I\u2019m worried that you are going to get too big to do your job\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli still wasn\u2019t happy with how this conversation was going. \u201cBut the rainy season has barely started!\u201d She argued, \u201cI have so many more months of eating to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how big will you be by the end of it?\u201d Olga asked rhetorically. \u201cAs big as the queen? Too big to move?! You are already so much bigger than anyone else\u2026 what\u2019s going to happen during the dry season?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese Naga didn\u2019t have a response; she had a lot of thinking to do. In the past she had responsibilities during the rainy season, even with the go ahead to eat like a pre-hibernation bear she had never gone flat-out like this before. But now, with Olga coming into the picture things had changed. Had she gone too far? Or was this what she really wanted all along?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply, her big brown breasts heaving across her rotund stomach, Amoxtli answered\u2026</span></div></div>",

Months of eating to her heart's content was a cultural matter, one that everyone did every year. Olga's innovations, recipes, and blending of Racovanian cuisine with that of the Naga sensibilities were just new and exciting. Plenty of the guards had gotten fat with nothing to do, and Olga found it very hard to take criticism from the same snake who she'd caught licking the bowl of her porridge one morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli just liked Olga's food, and she wasn't alone in that respect. Everyone liked her food. Her cooking was good, and it had taken her from an orphaned, sisterless Smith's daughter working in a tavern as a waitress to serving royalty in the Moatee Marshes clear across the continent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga saw no reason to punish or reprimand her friend and bodyguard for enjoying her <i>amazing</i> cooking\u2014she'd have to punish the whole palace, princesses and all, for such a crime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Olga was going to keep doing what she had been doing.

After all, she might not have understood it, but Naga <i>wanted</i> to eat, drink and be merry during the Rainy Season. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight as well give them all the best time that they could ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Olga, I still don't understand why we're not eating the Rainberries.\" Quetzalli folded her hands behind her meaty back, distended potbelly surging forward as she stood at attention, \"Is it because they're not very big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because we need to make sure that we have plenty of them.\" Olga pinched an overripened, squishy one, and plucked it from the vine that hung over her stove, \"So we're taking the bad ones and we're going to plant new ones in other parts of the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ms. Olga, the Rainy Season is gonna be over in a few months.\" Quetzalli's thick body slithered across the stone floor as she followed Olga around the kitchen, \"Rainberries won't grow during the Dry Season...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there's no water.\" Atzli said affirmatively, her lower rung of arms folded tight across her fleshy belly, \"Which is what I've been <i>trying</i> to tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Day One, Olga had thought that she was just a dumb girl from the mountains, coming into a foreign and strange land where everyone was smarter than her, worldlier than her, and more experienced than her. But living here, with these snake women, made her realize that they were just as sheltered in the damp mucky swamps as she had been living high up in the mountains! Even as the berries grew thick and lush on the walls of their kitchen, rather than high up in the trees in the forest, they doubted her. Even as their bellies grew fat, they doubted her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason they only grow in the Marshes in the Rainy Season is that there's no rain in the Dry Season.\" Olga fought off Atzli's skepticism with a roll of her eyes, \"So that's why I've been having the guards saving water all season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why all those pots are in those rooms in the West Hall?\" Quetzalli scratched her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have them in the West Hall too?\" Atzli huffed, \"Olga, I think you're overestimating your abilities here. You can't make Rainy Season appear just by saving the water. Even our Shamans\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just... trust me, okay?\" Olga huffed, \"I know I'm not a Naga and I know I have legs and all, but eventually you're going to have to start believing I know what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't even been here a season.\" Atzli snapped, \"And lately you're far more concerned with <i>praise</i> than you are with <i>practicality</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence hung in the kitchen, Quetalli's yellow eyes darting back and forth between the two chef hands. She smiled awkwardly, in hopes of breaking the tension. But unfortunately, the two of them simply parted. Olga went back to work plucking the overripened berries from the lowhanging vines while Atzli exited the kitchen entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you had to see that, Quetzalli.\" Olga shook her head, \"She's been such a thorn lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No problem.\" Quetzalli quickly answered and even more quickly rushed to change the subject, \"Um... what are you going to do with the berries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to take the seeds out of them and plant them in other pots along the palace.\" Olga said with a sigh, \"And the berries that are leftover, I think maybe I'll make them into a jam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jam?\" Quetzalli repeated, \"I've never had that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like a fruit paste. You put it on bread or biscuits.\" Olga smiled, \"I'll need a couple more to make a good sized jar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple more... Rainberries?\" Quetzalli looked quizically at the mushy fruit in Olga's hands, \"Just one is\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fine, I guess you don't want to try any jam.\" Olga sniffed playfully, turning away from the massive snake woman, \"Your loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" Quetzalli relented, \"Of course I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga chuckled. It was good to know that <i>some</i> people were loyal. Not like Atzli. Maybe once the Queen returned she'd ask for another hand in the kitchen. She'd been fussy lately. Maybe she wasn't getting enough to eat. Everyone else around her seemed happy enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Olga said with a playful pat on Quetzalli's belly, hanging at eye-level to the blonde Legger, \"We'll split Atzli's share between you and Amoxtli's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli panted as she wriggled her thickening body down the stone sidewalks of the kingdom. Her long, coiling tail had grown thick and heavy this season. It shone slick with moisture in the air, her mouth hung agape as her breath ran ragged. Her belly, turgid and taut, distended low over her lap and sloshed from side to side at every awkward wriggling motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for walking me home Amoxtli.\" Olga no longer had to extend her legs for a wide gait when walking alongside her friend, \"I don't normally stay out this late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the one... huff... who was cookin'...\" the swollen soldier gasped, two hands pressed tight against the arch of her back while her gut billowed outwards, \"I'm just happy you convinced them to invite me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn light of the Queens' extended stay in Adinah, many of the Naga aristocracy had taken to inviting Olga over to cook for them. Sometimes in exchange for money, but often just as an extension of good favor. They were high-ranking women, after all, and Olga should have been honored to feast with them. However, as Olga's reputation continued to grow and swell with the Rainy Season, it was becoming very much the opposite. Nobles would sometimes fight each other over the honor of having the chef cook for them for the night. Sometimes literally. Or at least, by proxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe the size of that one though?\" Amoxtli burped, \"I woulda thought she was the Queen herself a few years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're one to talk.\" Olga snickered as she poked Amoxtli's big brown belly, \"You're less a snake and more of a slug these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll work it off...huff... come the Dry Season.\" Amoxtli sleepily dismissed Olga losing her finger knuckle-deep in her apron of brown belly with a half-hearted swat, \"Not too much longer now before everything and everyone starts drying up\u2014me included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think you'll survive.\" Olga said knowingly, \"I wouldn't be surprised if you find it a little hard to pass up what I have cooking for everyone next season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting fat off of jerky and salted meats? Ha.\" Amoxtli snorted, her round cheeks rippling, \"That'll be the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Olga teased, \"You'll see.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olga had never seen anything like it\u2014all of the sudden, the rain just stopped coming. It went from clockwork, six times a day, to three times, then once, and then just... never again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in just as much time, everyone went to complaining about having to get back to normal. Rationing, baking in the sun, and enduring the sweltering heat and sweat that plagued everyone's fattened figures. Going outside to run their shops, do their chores, and hunt for food was still just as necessary as it was when things were wet and fun, but now they had seemingly become unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those who had to go outside and do such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the heat was still the worst part about the Dry Season, for those with more insular positions in the palace, they were not put under nearly as harsh circumstances as the villagers down below. While everyone else sweated and toiled, keeping their homes and businesses afloat, those who were privileged enough to not have to do much of anything in the Queen's absence found themsleves living a much easier life. As they days crawled by, slowly becoming what were the first weeks of the Dry Season, they found themselves adjusting poorly to the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With how much we ate, how do we still have Rainy Season food?\" Quetzalli whined, cradling her paunch as it lapped over onto her scaly crotch, \"Ms. Olga must have been holding out on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a scary thought.\" one of Quetzalli's sisters, of a similar size but slightly more round than her older and taller sister, said as she lounged in the sunlight on a dais, \"Considering Chantico can't even slither around anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Ms. Olga has been holding out on us, I we ought to <i>demand</i> that she relinquish whatever she's cooked!\" Chantico growled from her position, dolloped on a dais further down into the long room as her puddling face grew bright red,\"All she has done since the Dry Season is scrimp and save, and I am not pleased!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the brown-tailed blob's suppositions, Olga had done anything but \"scrimp and save\" the portions that she'd been feeding everyone on the Palace. If anything, she'd continued with the Rainy Season fervor now a full month into the Dry Season, with no signs of stopping. She hadn't addressed it, the word \"rations\" hadn't even left her mouth. Unlike Atzli, their old head chef, who would have been barking at them about slimming down halfway through the season...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuetzalli was beginning to become concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lunch time your highnesses!\" Olga's voice echoed through the stone room like a bell as a legion of significantly slimmer guards slithered into the princesses' royal chambers, bearing the load of what their Queen's heirs would wolf down today, \"I've worked long and hard on today's menu\u2014who here has had <i>fried</i> monkey before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she'd taken over the kitchen, Olga had been feeding the princesses more than they'd ever been fed before. Not that many of them minded it, given the connotation between royalty and rotundity in their culture. Their mother was enormous, and continuing to grow. According to her letters, that was the main reason she hadn't come home already\u2014she'd grown so fat that getting her through the Adinahn gates proved to be a logistic and financial concern on the foreign kingdom. Maybe it was just, without their mother around to eat everything, there was more food to go around, but something about eating so well into the Dry Season rubbed Quetzalli the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quetzalli, would you like to try some of my special fried Gigantopithicus?\" Olga asked pleasantly in a sing-song voice, a large slab of the stuff being presented to the heir apparant of the marshes, \"I know it's your favorite, and I think you'll <i>really</i> enjoy it cooked this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she <i>was</i> Coatlzintli's daughter. As her mouth started to water and her mind started to imagine the succulent taste of fried monkey meat, she wasn't exactly concerned with rationing or the lackthereof in her kingdom...</span></div></div>",

She hadn't eaten anything this good in what felt like weeks, \"You didn't go with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, gotta stay here.\" Amoxtli smacked her lips as juice rolled down her cheeks, \"Protect ol' Blue Eyes and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli snorted as she ripped a hearty mouthful off of her slab, hammy arms trembling with the effort. Swollen to the size of Pok-ta-Pok balls with none of the firmness, Amoxtli's once impressive biceps, triceps and deltoids were buried deep under inches of brown blubber. Her four flabby grabbers hung at an angle at her sides, propped up by fluffy arm fat nestled beneath and around them. With two hands, she wrestled with dinner, and with the other two, she caressed the great gut she'd been nursing since the Rainy Season. Grown large enough to fill the distinct fold that divided it before, Amoxtli's great belly poured outwards into a singular expanse of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what, all the food she cooks?\" Nochtli laughed, \"She barely leaves the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like your tone, you noble twat.\" Amoxtli bit back, \"My job is <i>very</i> important, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNochtli tittered to herself in a pleased sort of way, having decadently enjoyed watching the soldier that had teased her so go soft. Not that she had any room to judge her; but the difference between them was status. Nochtli was <i>supposed</i> to be large. She was a member of the upper echelon of society here in the Marshes. She wasn't expected to go out onto the battlefield like the Soldier was. Her size was a badge of <i>honor</i>. Amoxtli was just lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-tailed naga had only grown increasingly <i>honorable</i> since the Dry Season, much to her susprise. She was bigger than she'd ever been before the Human came around and started feeding them. Doing her little Farming thing and taking half of the soldiers and servants to get their livestock up and running. Why in Yndyre that woman felt the need to keep beasts so close to the palace was anyone's guess, but she was far from a position to question how she got her job done. After all, Olga's job was to <i>feed</i>\u2014Nochtli's was to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you please hand me a biscuit?\" Nochtli purred, rap-tap-tapping on her avalanche of belly blubber. She couldn't <i>taste</i> them without an extreme amount of what Olga called butter, but she was definitely a fan. They helped sop up the juices well. \"I'm a bit full.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fullness was not the reason Nochtli wouldn't get the biscuit herself. She had grown far too fat to move easily. Even with the size and strength of her tail, Nochtli's lazy habits and incredibly appetite for Olga's rich, fattening foods had left her weak and limp. Buried underneath blubber like everyone else and thensome. Due to her larger size in stature, she could contain quite a lot of food. But her metabolism wasn't checked by exercise in the fields or chores around the palace. She was en route to being pinned down on a giant dais like the Queen before her, and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wouldn't dissuade her from having another biscuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli grunted in response, tearing herself away from her own meal for a moment to palm two lumpy piles of cooked dough. One for Nochtli, and one for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heading out to the bar tonight?\" Nochtli chuckled behind one chubby ball-like hand as she caressed the acres of her own belly, pouring onto the dinnertable like high tide at the rivers, \"I know that's where you <i>usually</i> go to work off a <i>hard</i> day at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. The barmaids are slimmin' down\u2014got no use for a skinny limptail in my den.\" Amoxtli snarfed, completely missing Nochtli's tone with one cheek bulging full of biscuit, \"I'll be staying in the Palace tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm happy to hear it!\" Olga entered the conversation happily, \"I'll make sure you have a table set at dinner tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came bearing extra helpings, setting down a platter of various meats meant to tantalize any Naga's tongue. Rainberries, plucked early from the vine so they were small and managable, rolled around on the plate as appetizers. Rubbing her hands together, Amoxtli smacked her lips appreciatively as she tucked into her latest morself. Her earlier helping set to the side, though, it would ultimately be eaten within the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a rightful wizard in the kitchen.\" Amoxtli salivated as she popped juicy rainberries into her mouth, letting their juiciness wash away the dryness of her mouth, \"How you get these things to grow in the Dry Season I'll never know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Racovanian witchcraft.\" Olga winked, patting her friend on the shoulder. Her back meat wobbled at the impact. \"Or at least, that's what I'm going with since no one here seems to believe me when I say it's farming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is, I'm on board.\" Nochtli wriggled her chubby little fingers in a flirty noblewoman's wave until Olga slid her her own extra portion, \"You Leggers are surprisingly capable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We keep the magic in our legs.\" Olga snorted, \"Now eat up. Dinner isn't for another few hours and I'll be entirely too busy to deal with you two begging for snacks.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By this point during the year, most Naga would have shed their with wet season poundage and would have started to look slim and elegant again. Unless it was your job to eat; Nochtli\u2019s bubble butt, which Olga had thought excessively large at first, would be considered small compared to her wet season figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the human head chef had turned things on their heads; at least for those inside the palace walls, everyone in the working classes was carrying on as normal. But in the palace grounds, things had begun to get out of control. The Naga ability to put on weight lightning fast was counter-measured by the reverse, and so even at the height of the wet season waistlines inside the grand palace never hit a critical mass. But right now, that was exactly what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove your butt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI can\u2019t! Your tail is taking up all the space!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had been greeted in the morning to a recurring problem. Two of Coatlzintli\u2019s daughters had tried to pass through a doorway at the same time, and ultimately become stuck. A pair of brown and green tails thrashing around as the two overweight princesses both tried to force their bulk through at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re stuck!\u201d Came the unified whine as both girls sobbed in that something-has-slightly-inconvenienced-my-royal-highness way. Olga sighed, looks like her services were required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, the blonde woman picked up the slightly smaller Naga\u2019s tail and held it under her armpit. \u201cOk, I am going to pull, when you feel me tugging, try to push yourself backwards, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk!\u201d Came the high pitched voice, signalling Olga to pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged and strained, sweat pouring from her brow and dripping onto her poncho. The dry season was really not the best time to over-exert herself, everything just ended up\u2026 sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully though, her struggles were soon over, as the smaller daughter popped out, with the other falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoof! Finally!\u201d The bigger sister proclaimed. Now they were free, Olga could take a look at both girls and see who it was that had to adjust to their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking for so long in the palace, Olga found she had adjusted quite well to her new charges. Even with over one hundred children, the only human for miles had managed to remember their names\u2026 well most of them. The more reclusive ones she still had trouble with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two were not the case though; it was Zeltzin and Xoco. Zeltzin was one of the \u201cmiddle-children\u201d, (as no one middle child could be determined, that was the best Olga could call her) she was also exceptionally beautiful. Her bone structure gave her a real classical beauty that any painter would have killed to work with; she had long flowing hair that always had a beautiful sheen to it, and was the daughter most likely to be spotted wearing make-up. Meanwhile Xoco was one of the younger broods, and was hence a little shorter than her sisters. Olga had taken a bit of a shine to her, but that might have been because the two were about the same size (when Olga arrived anyway), and was thus less intimidating than the other Naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth however had succumbed to the rampant obesity that had swept the palace occupants. Zeltzin\u2019s weight had mostly stuck to her chest and butt, leaving her face untouched, while Zoco was fat just about everywhere evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you two need to be more careful\u2026 one at a time through the doors.\u201d Olga stated, trying not to sound like a scolding parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiiine\u2026\u201d Zeltzin huffed, before slithering away through the door, one wide hip still bumping the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga rolled her eyes, before turning to the remaining princess, \u201cAre you ok?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Xoco replied, \u201cjust not really used to this\u2026 I have never been this big.\u201d She emphasized her point by picking up her big dollop of a belly and dropping it, letting the large brown sack of fat hit her lap with a slapping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga guessed the stout Naga was right, she must have been about as big as her old boss before she left for the marshes. \u201cWell, just watch out from now on. I\u2019m not going to stop cooking any time soon.\u201d Olga added a wink at the end to try and cheer the princess up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Well I guess I don\u2019t mind being a bit careful if I can eat more of your legger food!\u201d The snake-woman replied, her forked tongue lapping her lips as she thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Well, speaking of that, I need to get to the kitchen. See you for first breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that morning escapade, Olga set back off on her route to the kitchens, following roughly the route Zeltzin had slithered off to, but taking a right at the end of the hall. She was thankful that the rest of the Naga were less active in the mornings, Zeltzin and Xoco had been probably the thinnest of the princesses when she first arrived, so they were a bit behind the rest of their siblings. However, they were an exception, most had taken too her new rainy-season-all-year diet very well. Space, had become a premium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga encountered the first problems in her kitchens. While her staff were a mix of low and high birth, none could resist snacking at work. While none had grown to the almost unimaginable girths of others in the palace, they had certainly not shrunk down as the rainy season ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head chef had had to deal with a lot of pots, pans and other kitchen items being knocked around by wide rears, thickened tails, wobbling arms, bulging breasts and oversized guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome days Olga wanted to clear them out and work in peace. But she needed the extra arms, which the Nagas had in spades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one thing Olga could appreciate, the extra arms. It really let the Naga multi-task like nothing she had ever seen. Certainly a feature she could admit to being jealous of, rather than put off by\u2026 like the scales or forked tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also glad her workforce was still mobile, something that could not be said throughout the rest of the palace\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst breakfast!\u201d Olga called out loudly as she entered the hatchlings quarters. Entering the room lately plucked a thread of nostalgia in Olga; the multitude of massive mounds almost looked like the mountains of home in Racovania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these were no natural land-formations, but the colossal forms of the most gluttonous and sedentary of Coatlzintli\u2019s brood. Each girl was bigger and heavier than ever; some lay on their sides, letting a tidal wave of belly fat flow over the edge of their dais and onto the stone floor. Others lay on their backs, their breasts and stomachs rising like mountains. Many of the brood were completely immobile, or approaching it, so food always had to be brought to them. In on case though, a little extra help was required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Chantico, I\u2019m coming up!\u201d Olga called as she approached the side of the most mountainous of Naga. With the aid of one of her helpers, Olga was hoisted up the side of Chantico\u2019s stomach until she was perched atop the massive girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Chantico greeted, wiggling her fingers in greeting. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the menu today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh what DON\u2019T I have!\u201d Olga replied gleefully, motioning for the Naga below to start handing things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was obvious Chantico had lost the ability to feed herself. Her arms had grown too fat and heavy to use, and her pampered youth meant she lacked the udder-arm strength of an adult Naga. Not to mention a smaller frame than her royal mother. Speaking of which, Chantico\u2019s size was reminding Olga of her royal highness more and more by the day. But by now, how big was Coatlzintli?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga fed the gleeful princess, Quetzalli (situated not far from Chantico) and her chatted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe hoped Chantico would stop growing so fast now her arms have stopped the working.\u201d Quetzalli chuckled, poking fun at her vast sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa\u2026 *oomph* Ha\u2026\u201d Chantico replied. \u201cNot like you have moved lately, when did you last leave your dais? A week ago?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shut Quetzalli up. She wasn\u2019t as fat as her sibling, and was much bigger and stronger\u2026 but she had been so lazy of late. Perhaps she should go out and roam the palace a bit more? After second breakfast that is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after what felt like hours, Olga and her team finished feeding the princesses. The former barmaid was tired and sweaty from the task, but she still had one more person to see to. Amoxtli and Olga\u2019s relationship over time had really progressed. While they had gotten off to a rocky start (Olga could certainly say she had never started a friendship by seeing the other person\u2019s tits the first time they met); Olga could happily say that Amoxtli was her best friend in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as best friend to the head chef, Amoxtli had been privy to certain perks\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had become clear to everyone in the kingdom that Olga Forgedotter, the scrappy little legger from the Cold Country up north, wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Who would have wanted her to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had singlehandedly revolutionized the culinary customs for the upper echelon of the Naga people. No longer dependent on hunting and gathering their food and stockpiling it for the season, the Naga were now free to laze around and let their food basically grow itself. Now that their precious fruits could be plucked from the vine during any season, wet or dry, and crops could be grown to both help feed livestock and themselves, the once active and noble race of snake women were quickly beginning to resemble slugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Olga was an important woman in the Marshes, and she wasn\u2019t so entirely na\u00efve that she hadn\u2019t used her newfound prominence to her advantage at least once or twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli had been her best friend since the Queens had hired her and whisked her away from her homelands of the north. She\u2019d been with them threw thick and thin (though there wasn\u2019t much of the latter going on around the marshes anymore) and had been a steadfast companion throughout her transition into a strange new world with such creatures in it. Upon her ascent into prominence, and whereupon it could not be disputed, it was only natural that Olga would want to repay the immense favor that was being her first friend in her new homeland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli had been named Captain of the Culinary Guard, and assigned by the Council of Scales, who ruled in-absentia while Queen Coatlzintli continued her extended stay in Adinah, to be Olga\u2019s personal guard after some <i>coaxing</i> and a night of Olga\u2019s services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time it would have been a death knell forthe proud warrior, Amoxtli the Red Tailed, to retire from the battlefield. To shed all but her traditional armor and lay down many of the weapons she\u2019d trained since hatching to use would have been to Amoxtli the Red Tailed of dinners past, an insult and a waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had changed just as much as any of the other Naga in the marshes\u2014perhaps more than any of them, truly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving taken keenly to Olga\u2019s preferential treatment, Amoxtli was in no shape to guard anything. Once lithe and muscular, all of the warrior woman\u2019s bulk had simply melted into heft. Woefully out of shape, amply out of practice, and <i>incredibly</i> sluggish after seasons of shirking responsibility in order to stuff herself to her heart\u2019s content\u2014becoming more and more insatiable as Olga\u2019s preferential treatment began to take its toll on the once disciplined warrior\u2019s body and mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli, Captain of the Culinary Guard, had become spoiled, greedy, and <i>immensely</i> fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlue Eyes!\u201d Amoxtli puffed, struggling to slither herself into a half-risen state, \u201cY\u2019r late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amoxtli resituated, her heavy swinging tail landing with dull THUD THUDs against the stone, her great brown stomach drooped ever closer to the floor. On her side, it pooled like a great ocean of malleable mush\u2014stroked by two arms rapidly growing too big around the top to do much of anything else. She had been busting out of customary arm-bands left and right, practically popping out of rings as her once nimble fingers grew more large and unwieldy after every meal\u2019s wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not.\u201d Olga said in a friendly, teasing sort of tone as she watched her pile of protector struggle to write, \u201cYou\u2019re just a little extra grumpy today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga laughed as Amoxtli puffed her spherical cheeks in displeasure. To someone so coddled as she, after a lifetime of hardship, even an extra minute felt like torture. With two hands, she ran concentric circles into her sagging stomach while the other struggled to even fold underneath her massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u2026 *huff puff*\u2026 just lay it on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli required the assistances of three smaller house naga to help roll her onto her side so that she might be able to feed herself. Though for how much longer, nobody really cared to say. It was an open secret among the two of them\u2014plus the rotating staff of small chubby naga\u2014that the once great warrior had already grown too wide around to slither out from her newly appointed chambers. Her tree-wide tail end was bad enough, but the great weight of her stomach as it bulged mightily from all sides. It hung low, <i>low</i> over her lap now, her great brown belly growing closer to the stone floors by the day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, she was happy to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t Captain of the\u2026\u201d she sputtered and wheezed, wrestling her title with her mouthfuls, before giving up, \u201cWhatever\u2026 shouldn\u2019t I get first pick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get to eat right after all the Queen\u2019s daughters!\u201d Olga laughed a little as she rubbed her friend\u2019s stomach, billowing closer to her these days than Amoxtli\u2019s mouth, \u201cYou literally get second pick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI work harder than any of those lazy brats.\u201d Amoxtli said gruffly as a servant hand-fed her a marsh berry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you do.\u201d Olga pat Amoxtli\u2019s tremendous tummy approvingly, \u201cNow open wide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there in her resplendent gluttony, Amoxtli was happy to be pampered as if she were one of the queen\u2019s own brood. Being hand-fed various feasts until she was too full to move, and perhaps eventually even too <i>fat</i> to move, weighed only as heavy on her conscience as her drive to get back out on the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, Amoxtli represented the dangers of what Olga\u2019s rapid change to the food chain meant for the Naga. A warrior race of people, gone to seed in the wake of their own rampant gluttony\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was inevitable; after many delays, problems, solutions, further problems and further solutions, the great queen of the Naga was on her way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetters had been sent announcing her return to her own kind beforehand, alerting the staff to ready themselves for her majesty\u2019s arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was plentiful chatter around the palace; daughters happy to hear their mother was coming home, nobles worrying that their new favourite guest would have her time preoccupied by the queen, and staff worried if they had enough food to feed her. The last concern was a serious one, for within the letter had been a warning that queen Coatlzintli had only grown \u201cmore majestic\u201d during her stay in Adinah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the day arrived, and Olga was stationed inside the kitchen as usual. She was preparing the welcome feast; her royal highness could start her diet tomorrow, besides\u2026 her daughters would probably clear most of the plates themselves these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga carried a large pot (or more like a vat) of jam across the threshold, a voice called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChef! I think you should see this!\u201d It was one of Olga\u2019s cooks, beckoning her over with her lower set of arms, while the top ones propped her up on the kitchen windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the tub down, Olga came over, careful to avoid tripping over the long orange tail of her staff. As Olga peered over the edge of the window, she saw the familiar majesty of the Naga city. But as she scanned the horizon, Olga noticed something. Every so often, to the left of her vision, something shook the rainforest, causing a flood of brightly colored birds to fly into the air. Eventually whatever it was reached the edge of the treeline and the greenery parted to make way for a colossal shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Olga muttered under her breath, as she watched a very familiar brown and green silhouette emerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was queen Coatlzintli for sure, but yet how could it be\u2026 the sheer size of her, it was unbelievable. How could any one person become this <b><i>big</i></b>!? The topmost part of the queen was towering over the battlements that surrounded the city; how was she even supposed to get through the gate!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga watched, a thought cropped into her head. \u201cWas her mother ever that\u2026 big?\u201d Olga asked the Naga next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever\u2026\u201d she replied, neither woman taking their eyes off of the mountain-sized woman as they spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cooking was done, Olga practically threw her apron away as she left. She and Coatlzintli had become friends on their trip to the marshes; initially she had just planned on catching up with her\u2026 but after catching a glimpse at the monstrous size the queen had reached, her first instinct was to make sure she was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Olga did not have to go far to reach her, as the queen\u2019s dais had just reached the palace courtyard. It seemed a new one had been constructed in Adinah, made of some sort of stone most likely, and outfitted with wheels and yokes to be pulled by some beasts of burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid beasts of burden were a pair of Triceratops. Their tri-horned visages normally a bit off-putting to the young woman. But Olga was on a mission, and rushed past the animals as they were unhooked from the yokes and escorted away to the stables, Olga ducking under one of their feathery tails as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoatlzintli!\u201d Olga called out, waving her arms. The blonde woman was worried that Coatlzintli\u2019s ears might be covered in flab at this point, but a slight twitching of the pointy tips told her that was not the case. Now able to stop and catch her breath, Olga was able to take in just how big her old friend had become\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatlzintli was sitting on her front, so her face was in full view, and how it had changed. The titanic Naga\u2019s second chin drooped down her face by several feet, flowing across the top of her breasts like icing. Her cheeks were each the size of a platter, rippling like pools with each breath the queen took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow was Coatlzintli\u2019s breasts. Olga had started to grow used to reptilian nudity; a good time to start, as nothing could contain the avalanche of breast-flesh that flowed forth. If they were water, Olga could easily have swum lengths across them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut underneath was the queen\u2019s largest part, a belly so large that it was enough to prop Coatlzintli up on its own, Olga estimated that it was as big as the tavern she used to work in Racovania. The sack of fat was larger at the base, allowing Olga from even her low position to see the top of the queen\u2019s royal rump, each cheek looking big enough to be used as an entire bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Olga to spot them, but she eventually saw the queen\u2019s arms. Each of her four limbs was so utterly buried in flab that Olga couldn\u2019t see any of Coatlzintli\u2019s fingers. They were just puddles with another puddle on top, tipped with a divot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga couldn\u2019t see any of the queen\u2019s black, brown and green tail; but assumed from the lack of twitching that it too was simply too large to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Olga had first met Coatlzintli, the obese Naga had been the fattest person she had ever met by a miles, and even now, whilst Olga\u2019s expectations of humongous obesity became normalized, Coatlzintli still managed to impress her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Olga.\u201d Coatlzintli greeted with a smile. \u201cI hope you have been learning well here, it looks like your job may need you to stay a bit longer than planned\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had moved herself back indoors while the logistical nightmare to get Coatlzintli up the first set of stairs and into the palace was underway. So instead she got to work laying out the palace feast, helped organise the positions everyone would sit at the table, and then went back to Amoxtli\u2019s corners to chat and snack (well, Amoxtli did the vast majority of the snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, a guard came to escort Olga to the dinning hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was surprised when the guard led her to sit next to the queen herself. She knew that the position of head chef was high, but not <i>this</i> high!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga sat down, next to the monolithic form of her friend and queen, she felt a surge of pride swell in her chest as she tucked into the finger-food that she had helped create. But as she took her share of nibbles, the queen spoke, and Olga\u2019s heart dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I may have made a mistake bringing you here Olga\u2026\u201d Coatlzintli stated slowly in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman stopped a jam tart half-way to her mouth and looked up at Coatlzintli, speechless. Meanwhile, the queen continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I hired you, I hoped that you might bring healthier foods to my palace\u2026 but that is not the case it seems. I fear that should you cook for me as you have my daughters, I will only grow ever larger; and if I don\u2019t slim down, this may have been my last visit to other kingdoms\u2026 coming home was a nightmare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I see\u2026\u201d Olga replied, putting the tart down dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have listened to Patli\u2026 I am sorry for dragging you out here, so far from home.\u201d Coatlzintli added. She was not angry, just sad and a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Olga added, before trying to change the topic a little, \u201cWhere is Patli?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy wife is currently helping my eldest daughter feed herself\u2026\u201d Coatzintli answered. Olga looked where the queen\u2019s eyes were drawn, watching as the much smaller Naga helped Quetzalli reach food that was situated out of the reach of her tubby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga began to pick at her abandoned tart. \u201cSo\u2026 what will happen to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen sighed.</span></div></div>",

Coatlzintli had thought, all those seasons ago, that a chef of her talent would have been able to concoct a menu capable of at least stalling (if not halting and reversing) the weight gain that had plagued the corners of her mind back when she had merely been massive. Coming home at more than twice the size she had been when she left, seeing what damage that Olga's unchecked culinary appetites had wrought on her kingdom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that if Coatlizintli had kept Olga around in any capacity as a chef, there would be no slimming down. Of course, now that she had lost the ability to feed herself autonomously, there was no chance of that happening anyway - not with Patli around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, keeping Olga in the Marshes would only do more harm than good - she'd already irreparably damaged the Naga culture by introducing strange new ideas. The class division between the Elite and the Townspeople meant that some women were so fat that they could barely slither around, while others were Dry Season slender - her people had become lazy and decadent, and consumed by a distinctly Human sort of obsession with more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Olga was allowed to stay in the Marshes, perhaps as a chef or a taverner, it would only delay the inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no hard feelings in the matter of the separation\u2014but Olga was to leave the Kingdom as soon as was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good to have you back with us, Olga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's arrival had meant a lot of publicity for the Bleakfrost Tavern\u2014she'd become quite famous in the North for her pilgrimage to \"culture\" the Snakes of the South (or at least, that's how it had become framed over the course of her stay). Once it had become widespread that one of the best chefs in all of Adinah had returned to her rightul place behind the bar, customers came pouring in from across the land in hopes of getting to taste the \"Steak that Saved the Snakes\" or \"Recipes fit for Royalty\"... really, Olga didn't have any idea where it all came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aplomb with which she had been welcomed back was a welcome surprise, and helped ease the feeling of despair that ached in her belly for all the weeks she had been on the road. When the envoy had dropped her off, Olga had never felt so low...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to see all of these hungry smiles waiting for her with bells on back in her home of Racovania was enough to wipe away the ennui most days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course... you don't <i>have</i> to keep cooking every night.\" Somaria's dark face dimpled slightly at the cheeks now as Olga served her another bowl of stew, \"<i>We're</i> the ones happy to have <i>you</i> back, dear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just\u2014here, taste this\u2014I'm so used to cooking for so many people, Ms. Somaria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really think that you've earned a\u2014mmph!\u2014break though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense\u2014ooh, here, try this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Somaria swallowed, her full stomach pressing hard against her apron as she sat squat on the bench seating at the firepit, a distinct sense of deja vu began to overwhelm her as Olga kept feeding her various bits and bites of whatever was in arm's reach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there was some merit as to the reason <i>why</i> Her Majesty had sent Olga back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmmm~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut really... who was she to complain?</span></div></div>",

Helga had a well-known penchant for eating well into unbridled roundness, a habit that had taken quite some time to stall and had only been made possible by lack of Olga's talent in the kitchen. Now that it was back, there was certainly <i>some</i> danger to her former heft returning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Helgaaaa</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli's four fleshy arms strained in impotence as Helga lowered a thick slice of bacon into her own mouth. The four cinnamon brown sausages were so doughy and soft that they couldn't reach past their own arm wings, let alone contend with her decadent middle roll as it sagged and swelled between them. Her stomach hung low, pooling on the bed in front of her and groaned in confused agony, demanding both rest and more. Her fat face creased at the second and third chins, frowning on all accounts as she struggled to reach past her own immensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hufff...m'<i>hungryyyyy</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slitted eyes watched in petulant horror as the smaller woman nibbled freely on what had been promised to <i>her</i>! Her mouth hung agape, panting hotly as she wriggled and wobbled on the bed in hopes of repositioning herself closer towards the food. She had no such luck. Even her tail, grown to the width of several many trunks at its biggest, was too fat to use against Helga and her teasing ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a spoiled one, aren't ya Pet?\" Helga batted her eyelashes as she leaned back against Amoxtli's vast belly, \"You see anyone with somethin' t'eat and you want it for yourself\u2014what a greedy snake, y'are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli panted and whined like a kitten, a far cry from the fierce and brave warrior that had once shared a bed with Helga.

She was soft to the touch, without an ounce of muscle on her after only some time as Olga's personal taste-tester. Naga physiology was so strange\u2014but so delightful to explore. Not long ago, Amoxtli was a tight, muscular snake who cut an impressive figure in Coatlzintli's armor. Now... she looked more like the queen herself with every passing day! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a lot of work to do if we want to slim you down and make a proper barmaid outta you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli grumbled cutely; the prospect of missing even one meal was enough to bring her to petulant, welled eyes these days. The cold temperature had made her less active than ever, meaning that all she had effectively done since their arrival in Racovania was sit and eat in one of the rooms of the bar. Considering that she had arrived at a bed-busting size and weight... they had wisely moved her to the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch less attention that way, but strategically close to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... b-but...\" she kneaded her stomach rolls with four clawed hands nervously. All those smells she'd be smelling all day, the food she'd see! The thought of dieting now, after so long of being able to eat whatever she want, made her want to cry! \"H-Helga\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no one stays in my inn for free.\" Helga cocked a thick brown eyebrow as she prepared a biscuit, \"So it's either you slim down until y'can slither around my bar or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped the biscuit into Amoxtli's awaiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find other ways of y'earnin' your keep around here.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Olga grew better and better at adapting the recipes she was given, a certain heir to the throne grew in sheer mass alongside her. Quetzalli wasn\u2019t exactly a waif when Olga first met her, but she was nothing like her mother\u2026 that had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiiiiii!\u201d Quetzalli greeted in her high pitched voice, greeting her new friend as she worked in the kitchens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Quetzalli, here to watch me work again?\u201d Olga replied, turning around to greet the interloping serpent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess\u2019 expression shifted to downcast though. \u201cAwwww! I was hoping to make you jump\u2026\u201d She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga chuckled; \u201cWell I did hear you coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Quetzalli huffed. \u201cI thought I was being so quiet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way the royal heir was going anywhere stealthily in her current condition. As Olga sneakily fed Quetzalli more than her siblings (even gluttonous Chantico), Quetzalli had fattened up far more than her peers. Her gut hung low over her scaly lap, big boulder-like and free of any dominating fold. It was like a big pregnant belly, just with way more give and jiggle to it. Atop it were some truly colossal breasts, big sandbag-like things that swelled outwards and over the supporting frame of Quetzalli\u2019s belly. Resting upon those breasts, were some ham-shaped arms, four brown appendages that wobbled when she so much as breathed. Quetzalli\u2019s tail was filling out in due course as well; her widening scales scraped noisily across the stone floor wherever she went. The princess\u2019 face hadn\u2019t fattened up quite as much though; a second chin was all she had so far gained from Olga\u2019s influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201d Olga replied, taking in all of Quetzalli\u2019s vastness. Her instincts told her not to call out the girls obesity, even though there was literally not a single skinny Naga in the city right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green-scaled girl seemed to sense this unease written on Olga\u2019s face though; \u201cIt\u2019s ok. I know I am getting really fat,\u201d Quetzalli stated flatly, hands patting the flanks of her big swollen stomach, \u201cIt\u2019s expected of me. Someday I am going to need to nurture my own clutch of eggs, than I am going to get <i>really</i> big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga turned back to her cooking, the Naga\u2019s words bringing to mind what her mother had said. How Coatlzintli was so against how big she was, and wanted to slim down to something, Olga thought at least, would be more reasonable. \u201cHave you thought about it much?\u201d The blonde farm-girl asked, still concentrating on her cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout what? Being queen?\u201d Quetzalli replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like\u2026 thought about how big you will get.\u201d Olga pried. This was a good opportunity to find out more about the Naga mindset on this matter. She couldn\u2019t really ask Amoxtli, Nochtli or Atzli about it, as they were so devoted to their duty that they would only give the same answer, that the queen should be the size of a small mountain. And asking Coatlzintli about it had yielded a different answer than she had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight Naga paused, slithering around the pot and stove Olga was working at as one of her clawed fingers scratched at her double chin. \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about it\u2026 I would need to be married for all that to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you thought about that then?\u201d Olga asked, before adding with a sly grin, \u201cAnyone you have a crush on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sent the obese snake into a fluster. \u201cNobody!\u201d She squeaked, gesticulating with all of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just pulling your leg\u2026 I mean tail.\u201d Olga replied, before picking up a large nearby ladle and spooning a great dollop of the mixture she was cooking into it. \u201cHere, have some stew.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuetzalli leaned in gratefully accepting the offer, before rising back to her full height. \u201cI\u2026 I guess I have imagined what my future bride might be like\u2026 but I haven\u2019t actually <i>met</i> anyone I would want to marry yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was somewhat comforting to Olga that despite all the differences between herself and the Naga, their views on love still seemed the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you? Do you have a wife?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Olga replied, honestly but hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Perhaps you will find one here\u2026\u201d Quetzalli replied with a big grin, thinking she was helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga however tried to let her down gently. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t really like girls\u2026\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t like\u2026 girls?\u201d Quetzalli replied quizzically. It suddenly occurred to Olga that despite talking at length with the inquisitive Naga about human culture, this topic had not come up before. \u201cThen\u2026 do you not want to mate?\u201d She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do\u2026 I just like men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuetzalli still looked confused, \u201cMen?\u201d The Naga was so naive of the world; she hadn\u2019t even seen the envoys that passed through the palace walls; so had never actually seen a man before. \u201cWhat do you do with a men?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga didn\u2019t really feel like explaining something this\u2026 explicit with her employer\u2019s daughter. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that you can marry them and leave the details alone today.\u201d She finished, offering the Naga another spoonful of stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then.\u201d Quetzalli replied, her mind seemingly completely off the topic as soon as food was presented to her. Leaning down again, she took another mouthful of the stuff, cooed happily and rose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Gulp* Well there are no men here, what do you plan to do?\u201d It seemed Quetzalli wasn\u2019t quite done with the topic after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Olga replied honestly. She had always dreamed of getting married someday, but at the same time, she had no idea how long she would be working in this city. It had been the opportunity of a lifetime, but clearly there were downsides. Unless somehow she started seeing women with four arms and a scaly tail as sexy one morning\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuetzalli was twigging that the topic was making Olga uneasy. She had been a bit too nosey and pushed it too far. \u201cSo\u2026 I was told that my mothers are returning this week.\u201d She added, changing the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Olga replied, her optimism at seeing Coatlzintli again was stronger than she initially thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! There was a letter that arrived this morning!\u201d The blubbery girl explained with a big beaming grin. \u201cBut you better make sure you cook plenty before she gets hear, the letter said\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, Olga relented\u2014over the course of the Rainy Season, she'd try to fatten up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnimals did something similar in Racovania during the Winter. A lot of the native wildlife would bulk up for hibernation, storing fat to keep them warm while they slept in their burrows and nests. Olga had remembered asking the question plenty of times when she was a little girl, and had probably had the concept explained to her every year when she would ask why all of the squirrels were getting so cute and chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen looking at the Rainy Season as the closest thing that the Marshes got to Winter (in the same way that \"less snow\" was the closest thing she'd ever gotten to a true \"Summer\") it wasn't that hard to understand why the chiseled warriors' bodies of the Naga women suddenly started to soften. This was their chance to put on weight that would sustain them during the Dry Season, when food wasn't as plentiful. Her father had told her once that the cute little squirrels and bunnies and bears who didn't get enough to eat during the rest of the year died in their sleep come Winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had sounded horrible at the time, but she supposed that it was far more preferable to leaving an agonized, shriveled husk on the dry stone walkways of the city. Going out and hunting such dangerous game like the Tyrannosaurus and the Giganto...giganta... those big monkeys, the Naga would need all of the energy that they could spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had only been in the Marshes for a little while during the Dry Season and it had already seemed like a barren hellscape outside of the civilization of the Palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there was some merit into what Nochtli and Amoxtli were saying\u2014if there wasn't going to be a lot of game to hunt after the Rainy Season, then she might need a little extra padding to burn through during the Dry season...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, Olga did her best to go with the flow and indulge in not only Naga customs, but Naga food, drink, and merriment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese people, being warrior folk with a relatively high mortality rate, had celebrations for just about everything. Even with their queens in Adinah, they were happy to set the torches aflame and blast the horns in favor of a hunt's large bounty, <i>every single time.</i> There were nightly raucous feasts and parties with Naga roaring in the stone streets as the bars stayed open well into the morning. Amoxtli was happy to sherpa Olga into their culture but was rather surprised when the farm girl took so well to <i>this</i> particular part of life in the Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl could pound back a pint of ale like she had been born with four arms, scales, and a tail; eagerly and expertly getting pink-faced and tipsy while the rest of the naga cheered her on. Drinking was in the blood after all\u2014Racovanians had just as pervasive a survival-based celebratory culture as any Naga after generations of hiding from vampires up in the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightly outings to the bars and taverns became customary as Olga began to truly adjust to life in the Marshes, with Amoxtli happy to tag along and explain any of the strangeness that she might have found in what was to be their day to day life in the Rainy Season. Olga was slowly learning that much of what she considered to be odd or unappealing at first had very simple explanations; namely in that the Naga were just boisterous, hardy people who liked to celebrate as much as they liked to eat and drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy did they like to eat and drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was already beginning to put on weight as early as a month into the Dry Season. Not just learning and acclimating to, but <i>basking</i> in the high-calorie, over-seasoned cuisine of the Naga people by day and indulging in hearty boozing with nightly binges had left her with a small tummy that persisted even on an empty stomach. Never quite flattening out, Olga's cute little belly was the subject of much cooing and crowing by the palace staff as it rounded out from underneath her tunic and bobbed with her dainty little steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Awwww</i>, look at the widdle belly~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga winced as she felt Atzli's clawed hand poke gingerly into her exposed tum, the pale white flesh that lapped over her trousers marred with an angry pink mark. She ran her hands over her fleshy middle, turning away from the snake lady's strike zone; a learned habit from living in a place where everyone wanted to pinch her with calipers built into their fingertips. This culture's obsession with food and drink were fine, but its <i>openness</i> was going to be the death of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't poke me so hard, Atzli!\" Olga whimpered, \"I don't go around pinching and poking your fat, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtzli chuckled, her thick brown belly trembling with her laughter. Even as one of the more <i>reserved</i> Naga, sensible and very Western in her beliefs, she had thickened up nicely. Her stomach now folded over into her lap in two neat little folds of chocolate brown flesh. Her tail had widened and grown in time with her half-human hips, sliding lazily across the palace floor and kitchen tile where once it flicked and swished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a soft little thing, aren't you Legger?\" Atzli purred, \"Well, you've got time\u2014by the end of the Season, you'll probably have so much Rain Weight you won't even feel a little pinch~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga whimpered and whined as Atzli continued to poke and prod the porky barmaid belly-first, unable to match the four-headed charge that Atzli launched against her creamy white belly. The poor little farm girl had been getting this everywhere she went lately; what was so special about <i>her</i> getting fat in a whole kingdom full of snake people with four arms who were <i>also</i> getting fat! And faster! The Naga metabolism meant that everyone in the kingdom was bigger around than her, but no one would stop picking on the poor little farm girl for her tummy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stooooop!\" Olga whined, \"It's not funnyyyyyy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time wears on, and the Rainy Season continues...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In Racovania, Olga had never really been allowed to indulge herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven during the most bountiful times of the year, the splendor that came with a successful season in her homeland wasn't particularly boastful. After the crops traveled down the mountain and into the lands below, the farmers would divvy up what they could afford to donate (lest it go bad) to the town's celebrations. People would give what they could afford to lose, which wasn't much\u2014plenty a festival had been cut short because the beer had run dry and the food had run out. And almost every year since she was but a child, Olga had been working at the Bleakfrost Tavern. She had never been able to truly enjoy herself and celebrate the season and perhaps had been making up for lost time while in the Marshes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another rack of ribs for ya then, Blue Eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga let out a monstrous belch as she slumped back into the stone seating of their booth at the tavern, a stupid satisfied smile on her ruddy pink face. She panted breathlessly, overseasoned sauce speckling the corners of her mouth as she looked with lilted eyes over to Amoxtli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just wanna see me pop out of another pair of trousers again, don't you?\" she purred drunkenly, \"I'm onto\u2014RRRURP\u2014nto you, youuuuuu <i>snake</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli chuckled huskily as she leaned back into the table, her brown belly smothering the edge as she leaned in hard to place one hand on Olga's distended gut. Gurgling and squelching with Gods-knew how many courses past, Olga's gut sent another burp up the pipe at the sensation of Amoxtli's touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, Blue Eyes\u2014the longer the Rainy Season runs, the more I start to like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoxtli palmed Olga's supple white gut and squeezed it for good measure, gaze fixed tightly on the pudgy dome that rose high to touch the lip of the carved stone table. Her chubby little fingers spread over the surface of her stomach, pressing slightly into the fleshy mass of fat that was her tummy. Olga, emboldened by far too much alcohol, gave her a saucy little wink and blew her a kiss. The more the season had gone on and the bigger Olga had gotten, Amoxtli had taken to being very open about how she appreciated the changes that had undergone in the once little barmaid. Olga had more or less gotten used to it\u2014the daily pinchings, pokings, squeezes and gropes... not to mention all of the free food that Amoxtli would treat her to at the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a tease, y'filthy Legger.\" Amoxtli rolled her eyes, a smile on her face as she slithered towards the bar, \"Flirtin' with me for more food in your belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like boyyyyyyyys, Moxxy.\" Olga tittered, resting her hands on her jiggling jelly belly, \"And ribs. Lots and lots of ribs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing into work, still full and hungover from the night before was apparently a Rainy Season tradition among the Naga; one that Olga could claim to have adopted in recent weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuided, vaguely, by the notion that she was <i>supposed</i> to be putting on weight for the Rainy Season, it made it easier for Olga to ignore her rather rapid weight gain and the toll that it was taking on her ability to actually get around the palace. The tunics that she wore always bore her midriff, and the trousers were supposed to be baggy. The humidity of the season left <i>everyone</i> with some shortness of breath after a while, and everyone would sweat\u2014the corpulent cook waddled in bigger and rounder than ever, and she only had a foggy notion that perhaps she should cut back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was hard for her to keep a sense of scale with everyone around her plumping up so quickly, and with such proficiency. Amoxtli had put on another sixty pounds in just two months, and she had been Olga's closest companion in the Marshes. Atzli, Chantico, all of the guards and Coatlizintli's royal clutch, <i>everyone</i> was putting on weight, so why should she be concerned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut walking on her two chubby little legs, bouncing and bobbing with every waddling step, was a uniquely human thing in the palace. As Olga ripened and swelled like a rainberry, growing ever larger by the day as she gorged herself on Naga meals that were designed to put on weight as fast as possible, she just jiggled and wobbled more while moving less\u2014one could often hear her huffing and puffing as she trudged through the muggy stone hallways of the palace keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne being the royal clutch, as they continued to watch in amazement of this scaleless, tailless <i>thing</i> that continued to astound them with her every belabored step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's so <i>cute</i>~!\" a particularly small naga by the name of Nenetl squeaked, \"Look at her little beans! They're all round and chubby like the rest of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're called <i>feet</i> Nen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Beeeeans~</i>\" the little garden snake gushed, \"She almost even looks like a bean, don't you think Quetzalli? With her cute little tummy sticking out like that? Don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNenetl's tail slithered approvingly against the stone floor as she hid with her sisters. A small group of royal children had taken to watching their chef's expansion intently. Most of them thought that Olga adorable; her tiny size, her little walkie-sticks, and her only two little arms. She had blonde hair and ivory white skin, which gave her this exotic look to these sheltered little snakes, they were <i>fascinated</i> by her\u2014even moreso now that she was getting so round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know that humans could <i>get</i> fat.\" another sister chimed in, \"I mean, what with the legs and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they burn a lot of energy walking around all day.\" yet another said, \"She must be eating a <i>lot</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks tired.\" Quetzalli frowned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's <i>all tuckered out</i>~!\" Nenetl squealed, \"So cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oldest and largest of the three (comically hidden behind a large pillar, and just barely at that) Quetzalli couldn't quite explain why <i>she</i> was so interested in watching Miss Olga. Sure, she thought that she was cute. Who didn't? But there was something more, something... <i>else</i> that she couldn't quite explain. A fascination with the human who had come into their lives so suddenly. There was an interest in human culture for sure, but now that attention had shifted onto Miss Olga herself...</span></div></div>",

Being hefted around was just something that Olga had gotten used to as she continued to live in the palace\u2014the larger Naga like Quetzalli could pick her up without any issues, even as her weight had continued to climb. The act had still left her breathless though, toddling on her feet back in her bedroom. Quetzalli's grip was still evident in the pink angry marks that had flared up while she struggled to heave Olga down the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Miss Olga!\" Quetzalli chirped excitedly, \"You looked like you were having some trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've said.\" Olga frowned, running her hands over the circumference of her stomach, \"Several times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Quetzalli smiled sheepishly, \"I'm sorry, I didn't... mean to <i>offend</i> you or anything, I just\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's my fault...\" Olga sighed deeply, her stomach sagging lower, almost as if it shared her dejection, \"I think that it might be time for me to start cutting back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga drummed her chubby little fingers along the surface of her stomach as it drooped low and heavy over her trousers.

Her double chin creased into a tight little frown as she looked upon her body in concern, marvelling at what only a few months on a Rainy Season diet could do to her poor little farm girl's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cutting back?\" Quetzalli gulped, minding the lower ceiling as she stood hunched in Olga's chambers, \"B-But Miss Olga, the Rainy Season isn't over yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the suggestion that the corpulent little cook start to skip meals personally affected the Queen's eldest daughter, as if she had some sort of stake in Olga's Rainy Season figure. But... of course she did! If her chef was in low spirits, or worse, grew ill when the Dry Season came again, the food that she prepared might not be as good. Yes, that was it\u2014Quetzalli was the prima of her clutchmates after all! She had to start thinking of these... <i>queenly</i> matters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, Olga would look so sad and skinny again, like a raisin in the sun. The thought of her cute little belly going away made Quetzalli... not quite <i>sad</i>, but somehow disappointed seemed like the more appropriate word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga hefted up her belly with both hands, letting it slap against her thighs. The pale ivory chub, only lightly browned since moving, glistened with the humidity that had accumulated over the course of the day. Her stomach was a wobbling, smooth thing that folded neatly into two meaty rolls that quivered and jiggled and shook with her every step...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuetzalli gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me\u2014\" Olga said with a slap of her stomach, \"I'm huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuetzalli made a small mewling noise as she watched Olga examine herself in the mirror of her chambers. Running her hands up and down the tank-like middle that had sprung up over the course of the Rainy Season. Smooth and soft to the touch, yielding to her chubby little fingers.... even her fingers were fat! She was so domesticated and curvy, her body was a thing of beauty! And the more of Olga that there was, the more that Quetzalli found that she couldn't stop thinking, <i>wishing</i> that there were more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Olga, I don't think that you should take risks with your health!\" Quetzalli piped up suddenly and rather loudly, \"What if you aren't fit to serve us when the Dry Season comes? Or when Mother and Patli return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga made a face, scrunching her lips to the side in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right...\" she relented, rolling her tunic back down over what it covered of her drooping gut, \"...Besides, the Dry Season is gonna start soon, right? That's when everyone loses weight and goes back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yes! In a few more weeks, the rain should stop.\" Quetzalli felt her heart sink at the realization, \"B-But, um... you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Great</i>\u2014\" Olga laughed, patting her belly with both hands, \"Because any longer and you guys are gonna have to roll me into the kitchens every morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga laughed, her great gut trembled in amusement. Resting her hands on either side of her stomach had become a staple of hers as it had only gotten larger and doughier, a more reliable place to set her hands when they weren't busy cooking. Or drinking. Or eating. Quetzalli wasn't alone in thinking that it was the cutest thing for their little Legger chef to do. She had seen her once or twice, basking on a slab so much like the snakes that she serviced with her belly pouring between her legs. Such strange parts of her anatomy, spreading wider and wider into two little bony tails that looked less and less bony by the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuetzalli was... <i>invested</i> in watching Miss Olga's continued growth, continually and perpetually perplexed in the growing human's anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't... <i>so</i> strange that she was fascinated by this human's fattening figure... right?</span></div></div>",

She hadn't really considered what she was doing in the Tavern after hours working \"towards\" anything, especially not becoming an honest-to-the-Gods chef. That was what Somaria did; why would Olga need to step on her toes? So it was no surprise that Olga knew <i>nothing</i> about a school for aspiring chefs was out there somewhere in Yndyre. A place where folks who wanted to cook better went to learn how to cook better\u2014studying in one subject and <i>that's all</i>? How odd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Plains?\" Olga repeated, \"Like... the plains below the mountains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga laughed her bellowing laugh, her swaddling chins rippling and her huge belly quivering beneath her tight dress. She threw her head back and howled at Olga's seeming ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, child! The Plains of Grobland.\" Helga held her belly, still recoiling from her bout of laughter, \"I'd imagine if there were a school for chefs that close to us, I wouldn't have had to look so hard to find a chef of Somaria's caliber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... this is the school that Ms. Somaria went to?\" Olga asked, confused. That was an awful long way away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, scratch that. She was terrified\u2014Olga had never been that far from home before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, you sheltered little waif.\" Helga was still chuckling, \"Somaria studied there when she was about your age and had about half your talent. She mentioned that the new semester was starting soon, and that you'd be best to take a shot at enrolling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was silent as Helga explained everything to her. Her blonde brow furrowed as she opened the pantry door and slid the tray of sweetrolls inside, gently shutting it behind her. Had she done something? Could Helga just be trying to get rid of her? How could the only family she had now try and turn her out into the snow, away from everything she'd ever known? Surely that wasn't what this was... was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again; getting out of Racovania. Away from vampires. Away from the memory of her sister, looming over her like the fog and clouds that hung so drearily overhead. There was an element of enticement to it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what would you and Ms. Somaria do, then?\" Olga asked, equal parts nervous, excited and somber, \"If I were to... you know... go there? And stop helping out at the Tavern?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh blue eyes, I think we would manage.\" Helga laughed again, \"Without all your delicious food around, I might manage to lose one of my extra chins, and Somaria could get off her lazy arse and stop shunting all the prep work on you for a change.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga was laughing, but it didn't make Olga feel any better. And it must have been plainly obvious, because even a woman as thick-headed as Helga managed to see the conflict behind her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a thought, love. Not a suggestion.\" Helga recounted, a bit more softly, \"Somaria and I love having you around. And not just because you spoil me so, either. You're a delightful girl, Olga. It's just... there aren't a lot of callings for people with your talent in Racovania. If you ever wanted to get out and make something of yourself other than a barmaid, this might be the way to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga leaned against the wall, still silent. Tears welled up in her big blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a thought.\" Helga said again, stepping forward and wrapping her ward in a big fleshy hug, \"Don't even bother yourself thinking about it until after the festival. I need you at your best tomorrow, so you best hurry on to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts, Olga couldn't sleep a wink that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could think about was leaving. Or, rather, whether or not she should leave. And whether or not she wanted to leave. And whether or not <i>Helga</i> wanted her to leave. Had she done something wrong? Had she messed up one too many times? Why did she feel like she was being politely ushered out the door? Was she that much of a burden on Helga and Somaria? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot tears streamed down her face. She wasn't well to deal with this. The town festival was coming up in just a few short hours, and she hadn't slept at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart weighed so heavily\u2014did she want to go? But why would she want to leave the only home she'd ever known? Racovania was the only place she'd ever lived, and this Tavern had been like a second home to her ever since she'd lost her sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a poor barmaid to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ultimately, Olga wasn't thrilled to go. In fact, she hated the idea altogether. But, there were some benefits to going off on this adventure that she couldn't deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomaria was a big influence in that decision. All throughout the festival, when she wasn't running the kitchen like the king's generals, she spoke fondly of her time at the school, mentioning all the friends she had made. She was also quite adamant that the strong farmer's sons that worked the fields there weren't too bad on the eyes either. But more importantly, Somaria described the friends she had made as family. It had been a long time since Olga had anyone to call family. With her father gone, and her sister...she still wasn't ready to think about that, only Somaria and Helga had come anywhere close to being a place she could call \"home.\" Maybe this was just what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the fact that she did indeed love to cook. She loved how happy it made people. She loved seeing their smiles when they took that first bite of a new dish. It was a look that one only got when they were warm by the fire in their own cozy home. Perhaps she would be happy continuing to share that joy outside her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, most importantly, it was the fact that danger lurked around every corner that finally put the nail in the coffin for Olga. The big festival in Racovania brought in many guests, and Somaria and Olga had their work cut out for them trying to keep up with all the incoming customers. But large gatherings of people brought other uninvited guests. Krusva Stranken made sure to make an appearance after the third night of the festival. While not actually related to her by blood, Krusva was recognized as Eviana's \"son,\" hand-selected and directly turned by the mother of vampires herself. And he lived up to his title as \"mama's boy,\" always fetching his mother's collections to please her, hence why only a handful of Racovanians could say they had seen Eviana in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a tall, lanky, and incredibly handsome. They always were, the vampires, and Olga often wondered if Eviana selected her brood based on looks alone. Krusva always stuck out in her mind because of the way he selected the maids. It was that look in his eye, like he was already tasting you that sent shivers up her spine ever since she was a girl, too young to have been chosen. When he spotted one he was fond of, he would lean in, close his eyes, and smell her, nearly bringing the poor girl to fainting. He really was a connoisseur, probably a trait he picked up from his \"mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, he had whisked away some poor, plump, round-faced girl, who wasn't even a Racovanian native. She was just someone who had wandered in for the festival, only to have it end for her so abruptly. That did it for Olga. She couldn't take anymore of this savagery, and told Helga she would go to the school once the festival was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was nearly three days ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Helga was happy for her, and did want her to go to this school in the first place, she was awfully sad to see her go. \"You...you write to us everyday, you hear, blue eyes?\" she said, getting misty-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe buried the barmaid in a gargantuan hug. Hm, she had gotten even softer since the festival, Olga thought. \"I promise,\" she said, coming up for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomaria clapped her on the shoulder. \"Just take care of yourself, have fun, and don't worry about us. We somehow managed before you came along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Olga could feel the cart finally slowing down. \"We're nearly there,\" the man said, flicking his reigns to turn the horse slightly to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around her there were fields upon fields upon fields. She had always heard that the plains were the breadbasket of the central kingdom, but she had never imagined it so vast. Men, women, children...and a few creatures she didn't recognize were all tending the fields. She recognized satyrs. As a child, she had seen several small bands of these creatures wander as far north as Racovania, escaping elven armies. She had never seen elves before, only heard the stories the satyrs told. Elves very rarely left the verge, she knew, and they didn't seem all that nice, but the satyrs were fine, a bit rowdy, but fine. Though, these days, if rumors were true, the wars between the two had finally come to an end. Now, it seemed that satyrs were finding new places to call home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was some other creature here that she had never seen before. They were kind of like satyrs, but they were bigger, way, way bigger, she thought. Their horns were huge, and not nearly as pretty looking. Their faces were different too, almost like a cow's. This was definitely going to be an adventure, she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart driver deposited her in front of a stone building, almost the size of one of the churches to the various gods, Olga realized. It might have been that before it became a school. Upon opening the door, she was hit with all manner of heavenly smells. Spices and herbs, some of which she didn't know, and it smelled like everything she expected out of a place like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see where all the smells were coming from since she only stood in the main hall, but she had a feeling it was upstairs, and made her way towards those. A hand tapped her shoulder, stopping her. \"You must be the new girl,\" a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Olga spun on her heels, she saw who she assumed to be the headmaster. She was an older woman, perhaps only a few years older than Helga, with a cheery smile complimented by rosy red cheeks, matched only with her lustrous red hair, kept neatly in a bun. She was tall, and slightly imposing, but her overall demeanor put Olga at ease. \"Yes,\" she said, bowing slightly. \"Olga Forgedotter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded. \"Yes, I was told that you had been training a bit under Ms. Somaria, one of our favored daughters here. I expect you'll find yourself right at home here, and we can expect great things from you. I'm Ms. Wadham, headmistress, and chief instructor here. Allow me to show you to the dormitories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved briskly, beckoning Olga to follow her. \"This place is magnificent,\" Olga said, still in awe at the impressive architecture. \"Was this once a church?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Wadham nodded. \"Indeed, this was once a monastery to Araris. In fact, the great library where the monks copied many Yndyrian epics is still in the west wing. You are more than welcome to visit it when you are not in classes. Now, you'll notice that the arches...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she droned on about the history of the monastery, Olga was still trying to process just where she was. She really was here, a place far, far away from Racovania and all its horrors, but also all her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'll let you settle in, and we'll see you in the kitchens in the east wing first thing in the morning. Be sure to ask one of the other girls where that is. They'll be happy to help. Is there anything else you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga shook her head. \"No, I just...I can't get over how wonderful this place is. Racovania was always so...dangerous. Thank you for accepting me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Wadham smiled tightly. \"I'm glad you like it, though I will say the plains aren't without their own troubles. You'll have to be careful for...</span></div></div>",

You'll have to be careful for those Minotaurs.\u201d Mrs. Wadham smiled tightly, \u201cThey come to our halls with more than just healthy appetites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been raised in the sheltering snow of Racovania, at the hip of her mother and father, Olga had never been officially schooled in many matters. This included the non-human inhabitants of Yndyre. The strange creatures that loomed overhead Racovania in the Overvektige Peaks, harpies her father had called them, were as non-human as Olga had ever experienced. The Orc that lived outside their village back home, and even those wretched vampires were at least human in shape\u2014if not oddly colored. The most experience she had with satyrs was through her father\u2019s smithing business, and seeing those odd half-animals in the plains\u2026 Olga didn\u2019t have any doubt that they could cause some damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to watch out for them.\u201d Olga noted politely, \u201cErm\u2026 which ones were they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in due time, girl.\u201d Ms. Wadham touched Olga\u2019s back and guided her deeper into the stone building, \u201cI assure you there is much more to concern you <i>in here</i> than there is <i>out there</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so began Olga\u2019s grand tour of her newest home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis school is formally known as the College of Grobland, the foremost learning center for all those looking to further their knowledge of culinary preparation and execution.\u201d Ms. Wadham began as she lead Olga deeper into the old building, \u201cThe legend goes that our forebearers were taught by Jynera herself, when the world was young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJynera?\u201d Olga made a face, struggling to keep up with the surprisingly swift woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a rather complicated story in and of itself.\u201d Ms. Wadham said stoically as she rushed through the stone hallways, \u201cWhether or not you choose to believe in some\u2026 <i>pagan</i> God is of no concern to me\u2014it just helps provide the framework for our first lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside the halls of the College, Olga could see out into the plains. Through the high windows, the fluffy white clouds gave way to the bright sun. Such a foreign sight\u2014even in the daytime, Racovania was at least partially illuminated by candlelight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga picked up her pace when she\u2019d seen that she\u2019d fallen behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is our dining hall, where meals are provided for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\u201d Ms. Wadham waved a hand into the bustling hall, \u201cWhile most of what we provide goes to the Capital, we provide what we can to our eager minds. After all, how could one expect to learn on an empty stomach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t an inordinate amount of students at the tables, Olga supposed. Twenty, maybe thirty characters. Still more than any school in Racovania could ever claim. The majority of them were young women, all of various age. Olga supposed that it was smart in this day and age for a woman to learn a trade to make her valuable\u2026 after all, that\u2019s why she was here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they weren\u2019t <i>all</i> human, were they? That was definitely a tail, peeking out from underneath the Academy\u2019s tunic\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks to the resurgence in Jynera\u2019s popularity, we\u2019ve had something of an influx of students recently.\u201d Ms. Wadham said with a slight distaste to her tone, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that had you come even a fortnight later, we would have had to turn you away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga\u2019s head turned from side to side as she absorbed the collegiate setting of her new home. She sure was a far cry away from Racovania, wasn\u2019t she? The architecture was different. It was <i>warm</i>. The air even smelled strange. Even as she got further into the building, that was the one thing she couldn\u2019t seem to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are our culinary labs.\u201d Ms. Wadham said proudly, \u201cYndyre\u2019s finest chefs have all rolled up their sleeves and bumped elbows with one another in these very rooms\u2014soon, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to say the same of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive or so stragglers fiddled with various recipes and tools. One was kneading dough, another mixing stew. In the center of the room there was a great fireplace, with many copper pots and cooking animals roasting over an open fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have four of them, and you may use them at any time you\u2019d like.\u201d Ms. Wadham said, \u201cSo long as you have permission from myself or one of your instructors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Olga knew it, she was being rushed along yet again! Mrs. Wadham sure was a quick woman\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd these\u2014\u201c she waved her hand down an odd hallway, \u201c\u2014are the dormitories. One of which will be yours for the remainder of your time here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman paused, looked to the doorway on her immediate right, and turned back to Olga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one seems nice.\u201d She sniffed, \u201cNow then, are there any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Olga blinked. She had <i>a lot</i> of questions. \u201cWhen do\u2026 classes start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow morning, after breakfast.\u201d Ms. Wadham said with an officious smile, \u201cNow be sure to get your rest. You\u2019ve got a big day ahead of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the older woman turned on her heels and left, leaving Olga to her own devices...</span></div></div>",

Complete strangers on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should've seen it,\" one of the voices bellowed. \"Once the pot boiled over, you never saw her dance so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Olga was greeted with the site of three people she had never seen before. The first was an ordinary woman, not all that much older than herself. She was a chubby, but quite attractive girl. Her brown, curly hair seemed to bounce on her shoulders with every step. She flashed a charming smile, and her green eyes shone warmly. \"Oh, you have to be the new student, right?\" she said, eagerly going to shake Olga's hand. \"I heard you're all the way from up north, in the country. That's just fascinating. You'll have to tell me all about it when I can take you into town to start looking for proper clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga looked down at her own dress, which was a plain brown, not like the vibrant colors the girl wore. \"Rhoslyn, be nice. She's just fine the way she is,\" another voice said, nudging the talkative city girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second woman was actually a satyr, though she sure didn't look like the ones Olga was used to seeing in the north. Satyrs were usually lithe and nimble looking creatures, but this one was practically a boulder of a woman. She was incredibly round, near spherical really, but maybe that was because she was just a tad short. Olga didn't think they could get that big, and she wondered how the poor thing could totter on her hooves at that size. She was an adorable ball of fuzzy black fur, and short, thick, rounded horns. In short, while not being the most typical-looking satyr, she was at least the most friendly looking Olga had scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind her,\" the satyr woman continued. \"We just thank the gods you're here. It's always nice to get a new face. I'm Agapo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olga,\" she said nodding. \"So, you're my new classmates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" Agapo said. \"We'll be in a few more advanced classes than you when you start out, but we'll see each other in due time. After all, each of us is gifted, and we should appreciate each other's different gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, quit all the free love junk,\" the final member of the three said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga wasn't sure what she was looking at exactly. True, she had seen these creatures in the fields earlier, but she didn't get a chance to see one up close. They were similar to satyrs in that they had hooves and horns, but they were far taller, stockier, and had the heads of cows. This one in particular was quite husky, but had all the curves to indicate she was female. Her hair and fur was a deep roan color with little flecks of black. She stood in the back corner, leaning against the wall, her massive horns nearly scraping the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I respect your strong feelings, Mageiras. You are a bold and honest person,\" Agapo said, clearly not looking offended at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the new meat?\" Mageiras said, looking Olga over. \"Not bad. Nothing special, but not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga nervously shook her hand. \"Um, nice to meet you too.\" She wasn't so sure she liked her. She wasn't necessarily mean, but just so intimidating, it was all Olga could do not to shrink back into a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll have to see what you got come tomorrow. I'm one of the best in the class, and I could sure use some better competition these days.\" She gave a hearty laugh as she said this, which put Olga somewhat at ease. True, she was bold, loud, and a bit of a boaster, but she seemed okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want us to help you unpack?\" Agapo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga nodded. \"That would be helpful, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for the next hour or so, the other women helped Olga get settled in, chitchatting all the while. Rhoslyn would comment on how adorable or quaint Olga's items were, not realizing that she was being a tad obnoxious. She didn't seem to mind. Must be a city thing, she reasoned. Mageiras was good for a few funny stories about all the mishaps that were known to happen in the kitchens. While Olga giggled at the thought, she secretly hoped that none of that would happen to her during her first few days. She would've been mortified. Agapo was the most helpful of the three, telling Olga where rooms were, what kinds of things to expect in class, and other such useful tidbits. She just hoped she could remember it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, she was far too excited to sleep, that and Mageiras' snoring made that difficult. She couldn't wait for classes to start, though at the same time, she was very nervous.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn\u2019t that Olga didn\u2019t see herself as talented. In the short time that she\u2019d taken up the culinary arts as her hobby, it\u2019d been made quite known to her that she was a quick and natural study for the craft. She had a keen pallet and knew which herbs went best with which meat. She knew how long to steep the stews and how pink was too pink for those tricky exotic meats. What\u2019s more, she\u2019d been learning how to bake all by herself now. Ms. Somaria had been teaching her the finer aspects of the craft for only a little while now, and there\u2019d been plenty of progress made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t her progress in the kitchen that had made her feel so at ease. In light of losing her sister just a bit more than a year ago and her father not long before that, the constant companionship of Ms. Helga and Ms. Somaria had helped her enormously. She\u2019d come to view them as extensions of her family\u2014the closest thing that she had anymore after Tora had\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking the tears out of her big blue eyes, Olga rolled over in her bed and gripped her pillow tightly. She didn\u2019t want to go. She <i>couldn\u2019t</i> go. Helga might have thought that she was helping by suggesting that she go off, but what did that old woman know anyway? How could she possibly know what living here in Bleakfrost Tavern had meant to her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking up saliva and the run from her nose, Olga made her decision:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wanted to keep her new family intact, she would have to show Helga and Ms. Somaria just how valuable she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacovania\u2019s annual festival was founded in celebration of a bountiful harvest. Given their relative isolation and the harshness of the land, Racovanian citizens had to find just about any reason to celebrate that they could think of. It was always as grand a time as any\u2014the townsfolk made plenty of food and hosted a sort of potluck between them, the prettiest girls put on their finest dresses to impress the stout farmer boys who slicked their fair heads of hair back, and wandering minstrels made pilgrimages up this way every year for the signature Mountain Mead that was home brewed by the Ridgeclimber kin. The whole town seemed to come alive for one night\u2014and that meant that the Bleakfrost Tavern was bustling now more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreta, get these dumplings to table four.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrigitte, a leg of lamb and a hen breast for the fellas at two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna, I need you to take <i>all</i> this mead and get it into those bellies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Olga Forgedotter behind the counter and not toiling away in the kitchen was a strange one, at least for the regulars at the Tavern. The curvy kitchen wench was usually just that\u2014Somaria\u2019s student to do the hard work while Helga slung the orders around. But tonight she seemed to have stepped up her game. She\u2019d been going back and forth from kitchen to counter, taking orders and dishing them out. All while a certain tavernkeeper made merry and drank her weight in adult beverage\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d Somaria rolled her dark eyes as she eyeballed all of her business partner, \u201cOur biggest day of the year and she goes and gets drunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d Olga smiled as she wiped down the counter, \u201cI mean\u2026 don\u2019t you think she\u2019s happier? Yesterday she was so stressed\u2014but look at her now! Happy as a\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPig in slop. And twice as greedy.\u201d Somaria couldn\u2019t help but crack a smile at her own joke, \u201cAye Helga, move your fat arse off of that poor bench before you break it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT\u2019Damus with ya ye\u2026 big nosed somethin\u2019 or other!\u201d Helga sloshed stupidly in her seat, meaty arms wobbling with her wild drunken movements, \u201cTake it up with the bottom o\u2019this keg\u2014I\u2019ll help ye get to \u2018er!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty mature threw her head back, long brown hair flowing like a chocolate river down her rolling hillside of backfat, as she killed whatever remained in her goblet. The crowd cheered as Helga let loose a roaring belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, gimme summathat!\u201d she toddled uneasily as she snatched a leg of lamb off of Brigitte\u2019s serving platter, \u201cLooks good\u2014<i>damn</i> good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer round cheeks parted as her teeth sunk greedily into the meaty limb. Juices poured down her face, catching in her swaddled chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve outdone yerself withisone blue eyes!\u201d Helga held up the leg triumphantly, \u201cA whole lot of \u2018em fer everyone\u2014on the house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole bar cheered as Somaria\u2019s jaw fell slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelga you fat wad, you can\u2019t be serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am I am I am!\u201d Helga burped, \u201cGo an\u2019 be a good little cook and cook us all up some of that yummy lamb!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga watched as Somaria grumbled defeatedly, trudging off into the kitchen to fetch what was surely a humongous order. No doubt that would keep her busy for a while. She would have to make sure to put Greta at the counter so that she could help her culinary teacher and fellow tavernmate out. But first\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPst!\u201d Olga whispered, \u201cMs. Helga!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching underneath the counter, Olga pulled out an entire platter of sweet rolls, cooked in secret for just such an occasion. She knew that they were her boss\u2019 favorites\u2014what was a little positive reinforcement going to hurt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYer kiddin\u2019 me\u2014blue eyes y\u2019might just be a saint afferall!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga\u2019s meaty arms pumped roll after roll into her waiting maw, plucking them up like sugar-coated berries from a bush outside. Her appetite for food fueled by her appetite for booze, Helga could eat on and on; <i>especially</i> when it was Olga\u2019s sweet rolls in the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019sure y\u2019don\u2019t mind me lazin\u2019 around like this?\u201d Helga puffed, her stomach full and round enough to make her lean uneasily in her seat, \u201cI feel a little bad, sittin\u2019 on my arse while you an\u2019 the girls do all the hard work\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Ms. Helga, of course not! It\u2019s a festival!\u201d Olga smiled pleasantly as she handed the tray off to her overfed boss, \u201cLike I said this morning, you deserve it\u2014you work far too hard for your own good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat much is true.\u201d Helga said with an appreciative slosh of her stomach with one hand as she stuffed another sweet roll past her inflated cheeks, \u201cAye, what would I do without you blue eyes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga smiled a little wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, I think I saw a few more crab cakes stashed away at the counter.\u201d Olga touched Helga\u2019s shoulder appreciatively, \u201cI\u2019ll go grab them for you and then go help Ms. Somaria in the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga washed down her mouthful of meat, dough and glaze with a hearty swig of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d Helga called after her, \u201cIf Somaria goes and passes out back there, I might have to actually start doin\u2019 something around here!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There are many legends in the land of Yndyre\u2014many of which have some basis in reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though the harsh snowy mountains were home to legends of things such as harpies and vampires, soon they became subject of another rumor that made its way down to the valleys below. One no stranger than the tall tales of some mystical beasts or of the strange inhabitants of certain parts of the land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tale of the fattest Taverner in Yndyre was somewhat far-fetched in a land such as this one. Supposedly so wide that she could naught enter anything short of a barn, and so heavy that her footsteps quaked the ground below her. Ne\u2019er before had something so relatively plain tickled the tongues of those who gossiped about the sleepy town of Racovania, but as weeks past first-hand accounts of Helga the Hungry inched their way further down the mountainside and towards the plains\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all means, the stories weren\u2019t incorrect. Perhaps they had embellished a bit, as storytellers do to their party around a campfire, but the owner of the Bleakfrost Tavern had undergone an incredible transformation in a comparatively short amount of time. Almost no one could remember the Helga that had been\u2014the sturdy but feminine bar wench who would flirt with every handsome out-of-towner. The stern but soft matriarch of the small mountain village. She filled a certain niche within the quiet community that she lived in with her barkeep\u2019s wisdom and a keen listening ear for rumors. That wasn\u2019t to say that she didn\u2019t fill just as many spaces now\u2014in fact, she filled a lot <i>more</i> spaces than she used to, pardon the pun\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is getting ridiculous, Helga.\u201d Ms. Somaria put her hands on her hips distastefully, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to bribe you into coming to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga lumbered into the quiet tavern like a tree falling in the morning. She was huffing and gasping for breath like she\u2019d never gotten her first wind, let alone her second. She was sweating like a hog, and as pink as one too. Her fleshy cheeks were bright red with the struggle it had taken to keep her great girth moving the full ten meters that separated the entrance from her home to the back end of the tavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little bit further, Ms. Helga!\u201d Olga cheered her elephantine employer on with a smile on her face, \u201cYou know you want one of these yummy apple tarts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye\u2026\u201d Helga huffed weakly, her eyes glazed and stupid as she struggled to lift one meaty pillar of leg in front of the other, \u201cI want it so bad~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pink tongue lolled to the side as she took deep, open-mouth breaths, Helga held her hands out as far as they could reach in front of her, as if she stood a chance of catching the much smaller girl or the delicious pastries she was quite literally waving in front of her. All of the tenacious taverner jiggled fiercely with her movements, her footsteps thundering throughout the bar like a one-woman earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the walking mountain of mass reached her destination\u2014the log that they\u2019d rolled into the area by the fireplace so that she could have a place to sit when she got winded\u2014which was often. Helga collapsed onto the mighty trunk, her great gut sagging to the floor as she gasped pathetically in her seat. True to her word, Olga placed the tray of apple tarts on top of Helga\u2019s barely-dressed midsection. Her piggish brown eyes lit up with delight as she wiggled her chunky fingers before stuffing tart after tart into her awaiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the gods, Helga, you\u2019d think that we starve you.\u201d Somaria rolled her eyes, \u201cI dunno where you got the idea that you could just sit around and eat all day, but you\u2019ve become a fat lump of a woman\u2014y\u2019know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga\u2019s cheeks bulged with pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have not.\u201d Helga huffed, her voice thick and husky, \u201cM\u2019just\u2026 a little preoccupied is all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith how <i>fat</i> you\u2019re getting?\u201d Somaria sauntered over and lifted Helga\u2019s great gut with both hands, allowing it to come back to the floor with a wet SMACK! Helga swatted her longtime companion away. \u201cYe gods, Helga, are you going to eat us out of house and home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may, if ye keep up as you are.\u201d Helga gasped, \u201cAye, Blue Eyes, unlock the sweets. Mama needs to take a look at what we can afford to lose today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlga, don\u2019t.\u201d Somaria cut her eyes at the ever-obedient barmaid, \u201cShe\u2019s just going to have you empty them directly into that gut of hers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be goin\u2019 through my mouth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisregarding Somaria, who had developed a reputation as something of a wet blanket around the tavern now that Helga was all about living it up, Olga happily did as she was told. Inside the cubbard were sweets of all sorts\u2014and it looked like Helga couldn\u2019t have been happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the ticket.\u201d Helga smacked her lips stupidly, rubbing her vast gut with both hands, \u201cLet\u2019s start with the sweet rolls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga\u2019s heaving breaths caused her vast ocean of chest to flow like tides. In and out, in and out. Milky masses of fat hung in her dress, stretching it to the point of implausibility. How long until another one of Helga\u2019s famous wardrobe malfunctions, where the whole town chipped in to buy her something new to wear? They were good for business at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, blue eyes, what would I do without you?\u201d Helga smacked her lips proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeigh less.\u201d Olga said as she smacked her boss\u2019s belly proudly\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, she wouldn\u2019t have had Helga any other way. There was certainly no way that she could run the bar without her. It helped Olga feel\u2026 needed! It may have been a little underhanded to exploit her boss\u2019s appetite like this, but she seemed happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did anyone, least of all Olga, know that\u2026</span></div></div>",

The clip-clop of shadowy horses as they descended the worn mountain road seemed to echo throughout Racovania menacingly. A brass bell began to ring as the first spotting of the Stranken Clan in almost three years loomed heavily over everyone\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it really been so long since the vampires that watched over their town descended upon them? Two festivals ago, Tora Forgedotter had been the sole casualty of their culling\u2014leaving Olga effectively orphaned to the two tavern wenches. It had been an annual tradition before\u2014or whenever one of their clan felt like it. But as lives carried on and suspicion died\u2026 perhaps they\u2019d gotten forgotten what true fear had felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brass bell ringing overhead was enough to make Olga freeze in place. The last time she had heard that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlga?\u201d Ms. Somaria touched the barmaid\u2019s shoulder tentatively, causing the icy blonde to tense, \u201cOlga, are you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she answered curtly, \u201cF\u2026 I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Somaria nodded affirmatively, \u201cLook, I know it must be hard for you, but we all knew this time was coming. We\u2019ve had it good for a while now, and\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get Ms. Helga standing up.\u201d Olga insisted as she grabbed the massive mature by one of her pillowy arms, \u201cGods help us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting Helga to a standing position was almost as hard as getting her into the tavern these days. She was a wide woman, and didn\u2019t lift easily. Her bottom was heavier than Olga alone, and her vast swinging stomach that folded and bunched onto her legs in front of her didn\u2019t make things easy either. Combined with her endless appetite, she was practically immobile when she wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of her idle crunching on sweets was drowned out by the footsteps and general clamor of the crowd.

What they did with their captors was unknown and, frankly, a source of extreme terror for those who were unlucky enough to live under their thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by all means, no one would have ever figured that they could get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true\u2014Cameena Stranken, a monster that Olga had known to look more or less the same her entire life, had undergone a rather dramatic change in appearance\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It lapped over the leg and quivered with the thumping impact of whatever was trying to get out. The Stranken coach\u2019s passenger bucked against the sides of her carriage. Olga couldn\u2019t help but notice that the wheels were warped\u2014bent out to all sides. And the frame was bent too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a rip that seemed to sound throughout all of Racovania, Cameena Stranken\u2019s corpulence had made itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga could barely believe it\u2014all of her anxiety over the occasion melted away for just one moment as she drank in the sight. The lady who loomed overhead, the woman who had personally plucked her sister from the village almost three years ago, leaving her with nothing other than her employers at the Bleakfrost Tavern, had become incredibly, <i>enormously</i> fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena Stanken was so large, so vast, that she wasn\u2019t able to remove herself from the carriage. At least not entirely. Her great gut was wedged between the comparatively narrow wooden opening. Small imp-like creatures rushed to her aide, pulling at her cankles and steadying her stomping as the elephantine immortal struggled to so much as stand under her own power. Her big, billowing belly hung low over her knees and swung far out in front of her, certainly further than either of her pathetic meaty arms could reach. The source of the rip was made clear\u2014inches of dimpled, cellulite-ridden grey flesh made itself known through a gash just over the right thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we are\u2026\u201d Cameena huffed, her jowls rippling with the effort it took to so much as speak, \u201cNow then\u2026 Racovanians\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steadied herself by placing both of her fluffy hands along the circumference of her massive midsection as it raised up, and down, up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you all just look so <i>tasty</i>~\u201d she squealed, \u201cI could just eat up every single one of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused a chill to run up everyone\u2019s spine at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I jest.\u201d Cameena chuckled, \u201cEven I\u2014<i>voluminous</i> as I am\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted the vastness of her stomach for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan settle for one, <i>maaaaybe</i> two of you dirty, delicious poor people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena licked her blue lips lovingly, her eyes dazed as she rubbed her belly in concentric circles. Larger, then smaller. Larger, then smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga could hardly believe that this was the same monster as what seemed like a lifetime ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can probably guess, I\u2019ve been spoiling myself a bit.\u201d Cameena said cheekily, lifting her belly ever so slightly for emphasis, \u201cI\u2019ve been awfully greedy. And I require only the <i>richest</i>, <i>tastiest</i> blood, comparable to anyone else in my stable\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in Racovania\u2014not nearly as well-versed in her Majesty\u2019s taste in blood as they ought to have been\u2014clenched simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt needs to be rich.\u201d Cameena sighed dreamily, stroking her jiggling flank, \u201c<i>Decadent</i> even. Why my latest feast, her blood alone is enough for me to\u2026 well, I best not say too much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming her slow, ponderous waddle in front of the stilled and stunned denizens of Racovania, Cameena began making her choice, eventually coming to settle on\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cameena's movements were slow, and non-deliberate. It was clearly a struggle just for her to kick one meaty gray leg in front of the other one. Her stomach swayed slowly and pendulously in front of her, fleshy knees colliding with quivering ashen mass as she hefted herself further and further away from her carriage. She could clearly barely be bothered to move her muscles, let alone strategize just where her bigness was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red eyes flicked over the crowd, her nostrils flared wide. A hunger came across her face, her blue tongue moist in her mouth as her breathing hastened. This greedy undead goddess was absolutely ecstatic at everything these poor pitiful Racovanians had to offer, and she was clearly getting the most out of her imagination. All that blood, everyone's fear as they quivered in their boots at the mere sight of her--not that there was anything particularly \"mere\" about her anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clearly pondered over abducting quite a few citizens. Her lusty gaze travelled over one, two, three, four of the mountain folk. Greta the barmaid, Jackson the axe-grinder. People that no one would have particularly missed, but still not ones that anyone felt particularly deserved whatever fate awaited them in the Stranken castles higher up the mountain trails...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Olga was having a fit. Her mind paced a thousand miles for every half-step the blobby blood-sucker took. The last time she had seen her, Cameena had abducted her sister, Tora. It had been so long since the vampiress had descended upon her village. What more did she have to lose? What else could possibly have been taken away from her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the answer came with a girlish squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye <i>gods</i>!\" Cameena absolutely screeched as she laid eyes upon the fatted tavern wench propped up on a log, \"<i>Look</i> at you darling~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga, who hadn't so much as had to think for herself lately, snorted in response. It wasn't until she remembered the very real danger that the vampires above posed to those below that the super-sized server began to worry. Sweat rolled down her fat face, cresting over the folds of her chins and down into the valley of her cleavage. Her hoggish breathing quickened as she looked to Olga for condolence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde apprentice could only stare with watery eyes at her boss's big bovine gaze, wide with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collision of two such enormous women was inevidable. Cameena and Helga looked to be about the same size, actually. Their bellies brushed against one another, pressing lightly at the mounts and then more harshly as they collided. Cameena's great sea of gray flab was cold to the touch, and made goosepimples run across Helga's fatted, gasping form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muh... me?\" Helga whimpered like a small child, \"You want... you want me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I <i>not</i>?\" Cameena purred as she placed two hands on the still-seated barmaid's fleshy flab, \"You look so scrumptuous! You're so fat you can barely stand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga's beady brown eyes watered as Somara and Olga began to feel their hearts pound within their chests. This didn't look like it was going to fare well. Helga may not have been much help around the tavern lately, but she was still their boss and close friend. But Olga specifically felt a particular strand of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She wants her...Because she's so fat!\"</i> Olga realized in pain, <i>\"And I... I helped make her this way!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had already lost her sister. And her parents. And now, it looked like she was going to lose her surrogate mother too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quite the little heiffer, aren't you barmaid?\" Cameena flexed her stomach, pressing it more tightly against Helga's distended gut as a sign of intimidation. She reached over and tickled underneath her chins, \"You weren't nearly this big and scrumptious when I came to visit you all last time, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\" Helga gasped, \"I... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got good and fat is what you did.\" Cameena chuckled, her belly wobbling in delight, \"Too fat for you and me to fit in my carriage, for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Cameena Stranken herself was obviously too big to ride in that awful horse-drawn thing. The black wood was bent and warped, the horses were clearly overworked. The wheels and suspension were bent as well. There was no way that Helga was going to fit in there, given her vastly belly-centric shape over Cameena's more rounded one. The big blobby barmaid was safe... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't you worry, you little cutie pie.\" Cameena said with a pinch of Helga's hearty gut, \"I've commissioned another carriage. One that can carry <i>twice</i> my weight, easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameena rubbed her exposed gray stomach with a chubby hand. She lifted the upper tier of her terrible tummy slightly and let it fall back into place as she idled. Clearly she was enjoying herself with her size, if her mannerisms and confidence weren't enough of a giveaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect to find such a <i>prize</i> when I made my descent, or I would have just waited until it was finished.\" Cameena purred, patting Helga's gut, \"But don't you worry. By the season's end, I'll have something about your size to carry us both up the mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever times were tough, Helga ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a habit that she'd formed well before Olga had helped blow her up into the useless lout that she was now. But at her current size, Helga's need for comfort eating was intensified. She was practically emptying the larder all by herself while her barmaids watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd closed up shop after Cameena's carriage wobbled off. Everyone had. No one felt much like celebrating, even if no one was taken this time. It only meant that Cameena would come back. And if she changed her mind about wanting Helga, she could just as easily fit four or five of the villagers, should she wish to fill up her new carriage to the brim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't let her take her.\" Somaria said definitively, \"I've worked with Helga for years, and I'm not letting that fat leech get my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What choice do we have?\" Greta whined, \"She may be fat now, but it could be a trick! Or she could be just as powerful as before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Or she could be more powerful than ever</i>\" Sandra, the other barmaid, wailed, \"Nobody knows how vampires work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hysterics overcame the Bleakfrost Tavern, it was Olga who remained quietly. She had already lost everything she'd ever known to these undead lunatics. And she wasn't about to let her life fall to shambles again. She'd helped put Helga in this situation, so it was her responsibility to help keep her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was in that moment that Olga felt she knew exactly what to do...</span></div></div>",

No one would have ever pegged the blacksmith's daughter for a scholar, especially if they'd ever listened to her try and calculate tip percentages. But even by her corn-haired standards, Olga's idea for saving Helga's skin was rather... insane. No, insane was definitely the right word. But at the same time, they were dealing with a vampire, so all logic was more or less thrown out the window there. No one knew anything about the race of night stalking ne'erdowells, so Olga's ridiculous ideas were just as sound as any of the more \"logical\" ones that anyone else in the tavern could come up with... not that there were any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in time, everyone came around. It just sort've became the norm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nServe customers, work the back, feed Helga. Make the stew, cook the lamb, feed Helga. Check the ale, mind the mead, feed Helga. Passing through the hallway? Feed Helga. Find yourself without a table to wait on? Feed Helga. Extra scraps went to Helga, anything that someone refused to pay for went to Helga, the overcooked meat went to Helga, the uglies from the biscuits went to Helga. It took an entire Tavern's staff to manage it, but the girls of the Bleakfrost Tavern managed to keep their Innkeeper fed literally every waking hour of the day\u2014and if you would have asked that fat blob, it still wouldn't have been enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye! Keep it up ye... ye lollygaggers...\" Helga's jowls came in waves as she bellowed throughout the Inn, \"M'wastin' away here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have never known that the very fate of her life was at stake by the way she took the preparation for the next season in stride. She was a hog in heaven, stuffing herself day in and day out without a care in the world! Barking around her employees and going on and on about how she wasn't getting enough to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I s'pose ye <i>want</i> to get rid of me!\" Helga would bellow drunkenly as she shook whatever she could reach of her always-growing gut, \"Make sure ye feed the next Taverner more than ye do my skinny arse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revelation that came with Helga's hoggishness was unprecedented. Her jovial laughter and drunken bleating of demands for more, more, <i>more</i> was unlike anything anyone had ever experienced. And as she grew larger and larger, her mobility failing her more and more, she became incredibly dependent on her staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. Look at you.\" Somaria tugged her lips to the side as she placed a dark palm on Helga's exposed gullet, \"I can't help but think we're just fattening you up for that bloodsucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, then what's your excuse?\" Helga's ruddy red cheeks were flush with alcohol, \"C'mere Somaria an' lemme give those hips a jiggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pig.\" Somaria clicked her tongue as she sashayed over, her (admittedly widening) hips swaying severely, \"You're enjoying every moment of this aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More 'n I ever thought possible.\" Helga gasped, \"Be a good lass an' hand me summa those... those delicious... mm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga, the formerly demure and responsible innkeeper, had indulged so deeply in the carnal pleasures of gluttony that there was no coming back. She was a stomach now, with brown hair and useless little arms and legs that used to get her places. She'd plop down and gorge herself til she was good and fat for the day, take a nap, and wake up ready and raring for more. All in the name of her own survival, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye Blue Eyes.\" Helga's voice had gotten deep and husky once her neck began to disappear beneath the rings of her chins, \"C'mere an' give Mama a belly rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good. For Helga, anyway. And admittedly, the staff of the Tavern. \"Helping\" Helga by turning her into the largest woman this side of the land had given them something to strive for. Bond over, even. Helga had gone from their boss to something like a mascot. How much could she eat today? How much did anyone think she weighed? All in the name of her own safety, it had become something of a game. The next season passed faster than anyone would have liked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one problem.</span></div></div>",

Given that vampires could just swoop in and snatch up whomever they pleased, whenever they felt the need to do so. Harpies loomed further up the mountains and there was an Ogress setting up camp right outside of town, \"normal\" was a very loose term here when looked at objectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Helga was sucking down enough food to feed a family... a large family... <i>several</i> large families a day, it got a little difficult to tell what constituted as what one person needed to eat in a singular day. Was it a plate of food per meal? Three plates? Four? How often should barmaids snack? What about if you were <i>really</i> hungry, was that okay? The problem with cultivating the Bleakfrost Tavern's atmosphere into the most fattening one imaginable was that Helga wasn't the only one who lived there, and she wasn't the only one affected. Greta the barmaid was getting to be pretty grabby when it came to leftovers from the customers plates, and Sandra was just as easily tempted by food left unclaimed. Poor Olga was surrounded by food all the time now, and even the level-headed Somaria wasn't immune to the gluttonous spirit that had taken over the place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was eating all of the time, and naturally... well, they were getting pretty big themselves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone were the tight waistlines of the pretty girls that Helga and Somaria had specifically picked out to draw a crowd. Hourglass figures and flat waists were quickly buried under lots of extra helpings, plentiful portions, and ample inches of supple, grabable chub that hung out of every dress, blouse and corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome... didn't quite take to it as well as others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never gonna get married now.\" Greta whined as she grabbed her belly by both flanks, \"M'fatter than a Yule Hog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pretty black haired barmaid had once been the envy of everyone around her! Natural good looks with a slender waist, a bit willowy and mysterious with her exotic looks. She was the stuff of portraits to be hung in a galleria once upon a time. Now that she'd gone and gotten good and fat, those good looks were hidden under lots of soft, jiggly blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately, she didn't wear it as well as she might have hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'all buttocks!\" She groaned, bemoaning her barrel-built physique, \"What's the point'a havin' all this girth if annae of it di'nt go to my chest?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the poor thing was as big as a kettledrum in the britches. Wherever she went, her big butt lagged behind her, bumping up and down, up and down, with every increasingly slow step. What's worse, she'd grown a gut to match! Her legs were all doughy and her calves had started sagging over her knees. She felt like such a freak of nature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that.\" the redheaded Sandra said, kicking her chubby legs up in the air while she laid on her billowing belly, \"Maybe you can find one of those boys who likes their women chunky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra's gain had been much more top-heavy. She'd gotten every inch of breasts that poor Greta had longed for and thensome, growing a troublesomely round upper half. Her belly, her bust, even her face and arms were chubby. No one would have ever guessed that she had once been a prime pick of the Racovanian girls to be married. She'd taken to her gain quite well, if only that it meant her breasts were the talk of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about me <i>hips</i>?!\" Greta grabbed a handful of her copious booty blubber and gave her rump a good shake, \"It won't be long now before I start crushin' furniture with this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Greta, no one's that big.\" a moment of clarity hit the barmaid that made her grimace, \"Well, almost nobody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the hall was Olga, who'd perhaps adjusted to her newfound girth the best between the lot of them. She had never particularly been enthralled by her looks before (she'd never had much reason to be, with Tora as an older sister) but between the shame she felt for helping make Helga into such an easy target for that awful vampire, she figured she deserved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... I'm getting <i>pre-</i>tty big these days...\" she said with a cursory pat of her bloated stomach, watching the ripples spread throughout her pale pallets of flesh, \"Need to stop making so much extra for me and the girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a round little thing these days; her belly had finally caught up to the head start that her breasts had had since puberty struck. Her lovehandles were thick and her pale skin had remained as perfectly smooth and porcelain even as it ballooned outwards in all directions. Her belly drooped low beneath her crotch, eclipsing her furry blonde sex with squishy, sensual flab. She supposed it came with the territory. Helga had been a little thickset even <i>before</i> this all started, and now that she was basically running the place, Olga seemed to be following suit. Was she <i>happy</i> about her new girth? By all means no. But at least she wasn't as large as <i>some</i> people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven further down the hall, in the extension that had been built specifically to house her, Helga sat in the middle of what was large enough to serve as her living quarters. Pillows, blankets, and rugs kept her enormity warm in the chilly winter area as she sat mostly in the big fat buff. Her great gut pooled on the floorboards in front of her, creaking and taxed despite being newly placed. Her mammoth legs squirmed, shimmying their encasing fat as she wriggled in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon...\" Helga panted hotly, kneading the uppermost subsection of her exquisitely enormous stomach as her libido burned somewhere beneath all that belly, \"I cannae wait... any longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomaria's wide hips and dark flesh sloshed lazily as she sauntered over to the half ton taverner, carrying a platter of her favorite sweets, treats and salted meats. Her belly, hanging loose and topless, brushed against the naked pile of Helga's gut first. Then she brought her hands to the surface of her stomach, cupping an especially tantalizing fold of Helga's great stomach. She hefted it in her free palm, weighing it between her long ebony fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you can wait a little longer.\" Somaria purred, \"You're not exactly starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taverner could only pant helplessly, crazed by hunger and lust, as her oldest friend began to lower the venison into her mouth sensually. Her ruddy face grew flustered and her eyes grew glassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I <i>need</i> it...\" Helga whined, the rings of fat around her face creasing in displeasure, \"Fuh... <i>feed</i> meee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Somaria teased her boss, resting the tray at the crest of Helga's stomach while she climbed on top of her mountainous mass, \"Are you sure you wouldn't rather have something... <i>else</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraddling Helga's great stomach, her fat pink tongue lolled out in hoggish anticipation, Somaria could only smile deviously as she watched her overfed, undersex employer gape at her physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'been eatin' good Somaria.\" Helga gasped stupidly, \"Y'got some... <i>hrmmm</i> some meat on yer bones...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomaria cupped her sizeable stomach lovingly, drinking in Helga's lust for her flesh. Her heavy black hips spread wide, Somaria's satisfaction began to show as it dampened Helga's stomach rolls. She reached behind her and grabbed the platter, plucking a sweet roll from the tray and biting into it slowly. The glazing, still hot from the oven, rolled down her perfectly browned skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...\" Somaria felt Helga quake beneath her, \"That's not fair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do about it?\" she chuckled, \"You pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...\" Helga's nostrils flared and her mind sputtered, \"Ye... ye really know how tae get me goin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful. I've developed <i>quite</i> a taste for Olga's cooking.\" Somaria winked, \"I might just eat this whole tray by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ohh</i>... I'd fuckin' hate that...\" Helga was smoking like an old chimney now, her fat puddle of a face beet red, \"Keep... keep eatin' yae lousy bitch. I wanna watch you get as fat as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomaria simply giggled, taking another sweetroll from the tray and hand-feeding it to Helga. The poor cow couldn't tell if she was horny or hungry anymore! She ate from the palm of Somaria's hand softmouthed, never biting too hard on her perfect brown fingers. Fingers that would hopefully go to serve many other purposes before the night was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Somaria slid off of Helga's stomach and sauntered over to her side. She pressed into the side of Helga's tank of a gut, sloshing the meaty mass with some effort, \"We've still got a ways to go before you're <i>too</i> big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never... never such a thing.\" Helga was playing with the only part of herself that she could reach, cupping and fondling her sensitive stomach was the closest thing she could do to herself anymore to playing with herself, \"Just get tae feedin' me... oh <i>fuck</i> I want ya tae feed me til I <i>pop</i>... or feed yaerself... just fuckin' pick one and <i>fuck me while yae're doin' it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, making the Bleakfrost Tavern Helga's imminent domain for the fattening lifestyle had certainly changed things around here. However, some things couldn't be changed. The most important one being Cameena Stranken's encroaching deadline...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olga's wish would be granted, in an odd sort of way, by way of the Racovanian Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened every year, so it seemed somewhat strange that <i>this</i> particular festival would be the answer to her prayers. From sunrise to sunset, to celebrate the Harvest Season coming in, townsfolk took the day off from their jobs and enjoyed themselves by way of drinking, dancing, and gorging themselves into a stupor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga had always looked forward to the festival, ever since she was a little girl. Tora too\u2014and it was one of the very few things she allowed herself to look forward to even now. The forge was ringing til after sundown so that Tora could get her order finished in time so that she didn't have to work through the festival and miss out on the festivities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and the festivities to be had! Neighbors would bake special treats like ceremonial cakes or pies made from whatever they could spare from their larders. Racks of ribs were thrown over the fire and marinated with special sauces (there was a contest every year for the best entry!) and the Bobbings would sell their fish at a discount. Beer and mead were sloshed around, practically <i>given</i> away while bards and minstrels were hired to serenade the whole town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Olga was so eager to offer a helping hand to her new employer. Helga no doubt had a lot on her plate, considering she was always in charge of providing the drinks for the whole village. Not only was it a way for her to spice up her life, but the extra coin was much appreciated around the Forgedotter home. Olga had offered to stay for a few extra hours in the back after her shift at the Tavern to help Somaria, an offer that was eagerly taken upon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd promptly regretted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olga!\" Helga bellowed as she stormed into the kitchen, \"I'm still waiting on those meat pies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry Ms. Helga...\" Olga ran her hands through her long blonde hair as she waited for the pies to cool, \"Th-They should be done any minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got hungry farmers out here waitin' for supper, you try tellin' them to wait a minute!\" the taverner bit back, \"The point of havin' you back here is so that Somaria can focus on the festival\u2014for all that's good and holy in the world, pick up the pace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy oaken door slammed shut, rattling the kitchenware and leaving Olga alone with her thoughts. The poor barmaid sighed, feeling about two inches tall. She had never been talked to like that by anyone other than her own parents\u2014she'd never even guessed that Ms. Helga of all people would scold her so. Olga dropped plates all the time, and she was staying over to help out! What had she done <i>this</i> time that was so unique and scoldable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it too hard.\" Somaria's voice came from behind her as she fanned the cooling pies, \"Helga's just stressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomaria was a plainsman from the central region, who had moved up north to find work when she was younger than Olga. Now she was about Helga's age, perhaps a little younger, with dark skin and black hair. Her voice was smooth and calming, not at all like any of the hardy accents in Racovania. No one saw much of Somaria\u2014Olga had thought Helga did all the cooking herself until she started working at the tavern, honestly!\u2014but she and the other tavern wenches were on a good report. They talked frequently about goings-on in the town, family situations and, just recently, how at odds Helga seemed to be with everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would know. She's had me make her enough sweet rolls to fill a field this week\u2014that poor woman's so transparent sometimes.\" Somaria said with a little chuckle, \"I'll talk to her about it tonight. Tell her to ease off you a bit, huh blue-eyes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish she wouldn't take it out on me...\" Olga said with a little huff, \"I'm just trying to help her out. I know she's stressing herself out over the festival but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ohh</i>... Somaria said with a little cock of her eyebrow, slouching onto the prep table, \"So Helga hasn't told you? I'm not surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told me what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Somaria looked to the side coyly, \"I mean, far be it from me to spread any <i>rumors</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please do!\" Olga's misery was all but forgotten as she leaned in close<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could the reason for Helga's stress possibly have been? Was she going to lose the tavern? Was there a new man in her life? Were things not going well with the new man in her life? As brow-beaten as Olga had been lately, she deserved a reason as to why her kindly taverner had turned into such a slave driver! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... don't tell anyone (especially not Helga) that I told you, but...\" Somaria looked back to Olga, her lips cut sharply into a mischievous smile, \"...we're going to have a very special guest at this year's Racovanian Festival. We're expecting a princess\u2014one of King Roland's daughters\u2014to grace us with her presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Olga gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoyalty? In her little home town? That was even better than whatever piddly drama that Helga's love life could have offered! Olga had never met any royalty before! For that matter, Somaria and that Orc woman were about as exotic as things got around Racovania. Sure a stray Harpy would come fluttering in every now and again, but that was so rare it barely required mentioning. Few adventurers wandered through these parts. Royalty coming into town... now <i>that</i> was exciting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently the girl's vacationing in one of their homes nearby. Her highness heard about our piddly little festival and one of her servants helpfully stopped by to give poor Helga a running start.\" Somaria plucked the pies from their place on the table, \"She's pulling out all the stops to ensure that the first Racovanian Festival that royalty attends will be the finest one\u2014at least on her end. Whether or not everyone else lives up to her expectations, well... more gold for us I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was starry-eyed. This had to have been a dream. Royalty coming through? How exciting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't even know that there was a royal vacation home this far out into the country?\" Olga leaned in excitedly, forgetting the cooled pies in her hands, \"W-Which of his daughters do you think will attend Somaria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomaria made a small amused sound. Clearly Olga was more impressed with the possibility than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, I couldn't care less. The sooner they're gone and this festival's over, the sooner Helga stops eating herself into a stupor.\" she chuckled, \"But I want to say that it's...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was daybreak in Racovania when the caravan arrived. Most of the tiny shops were just opening, and the Stranken family had just finished their business in the town and had returned to their castle. Not many people paid mind to the horse drawn wagon arriving near the small inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only possibly odd thing was that it seemed to be slightly lower to the ground then most wagons. Other then that, it was just a plain looking covered wagon being led by a white horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wagon's driver jumped off the bench in the front. He was a tall, stocky Northman with a thick dark-grey beard and black eyes. He looped around the wagon to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we've arrived. Best start unloading so we can get our room.\" He called into the wagon. The wagon itself started to rock, and after a few seconds, three people stepped out, two of them supporting the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left was a medium height, somewhat athletic looking human male with tan skin, green eyes, and brown hair. He was dressed in a black tunic. On the right was a tall, fairly buff Kitsune with orange hair and tails, yellow eyes, and wearing what looked like leather armor. But the one who drew quite a bit of attention once she was seen was the elf in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about the same height as the human, with long golden hair, bright green eyes, and very pale skin. She was dressed in what could charitably be called a blue tunic. Despite being otherwise faily slim, it barely seemed to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was due to her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts rivaled prized pumpkins in sheer size. They didn't seem to be supported, so the elf was holding them up with her own arms, and based on the straining look on her face, they were quite heavy. The slightest movement from the elf made them wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm quite glad the trip is over.\" The elf said to the Northman. \"All those bumps in the road made the trip quite uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine.\" The Northman replied. \"Alright, Vincent, you help me unload the wagon. Vyna, help Zyra here get into the inn and get us some rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune, Vyna, nodded as the human, Vincent, let go of Zyra. Vyra staggered a bit at the change in weight, and slowly began guiding the over-burdened Zyra to the in, Zyra's immense bust wobbling the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we continue, perhaps we should step back a bit to explain how dear Zyra came to be with this group.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nZyra originally lived in a small village in the Pyknos Verge. For much of her life, she lived like any other elf, albeit taking an interest in health and medicine at an early age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after her 21st birthday, however, things changed drastically. For some reason, her previously tiny bust had begun to grow. She went from nearly flat to a healthy bust in just a few days. Zyra was confused, especially when her bust continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, the village elder got it into his head that Zyra growing bust meant she had been blessed by Yva, goddess of fertility, nature, and herbivores. To this end, the entire village began treating Zyra almost like a queen, in hopes that \"Yva's blessing\" would help the village prosper. Zyra was amused, and decided to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time of Zyra's 25th birthday, the novelty had worn off. Zyra had been pampered near daily, and the village had become far too protective of her, fearing that any harm to hear would ruin the \"blessing\". And on the subject of the \"blessing\", Zyra's bust had grown so large and heavy that walking unassisted became a thing of the past. Zyra had finally had enough, so in the dead of night, she convinced a particularly strong elf to help her escape the Verge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out, she lucked upon a caravan. It consisted of Ivan, a Northman who traveled Yndyre selling his goods; Vincent, a human looking for adventure; and Vyna, a Kitsune who grew bored and fled from a temple in search of fun. Explaining her issue, they took her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, here we are.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nBack in the present, Vyna and Zyra entered the inn. Everyone turned to look at the newcomers, and most were shocked by Zyra's immense bust. Vyna took Zyra over to a nearby bench, and set her down, making the poor bench creak under Zyra's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get our rooms. I'll see if I can get you an extra-wide bed.\" Vyna said. Then she had a cheeky grin. \"Don't be running off now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And exactly where would I run off too?\" Zyra replied, an equally cheeky grin on her face. Though she was frustrated with her breasts at times, she wasn't above joking about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVyra went off to locate the inn's owner, while Zyra leaned back on the bench. She thought to why she had asked the caravan to come to Racovania in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd heard of a brilliant healer in Racovania who's knowledge of the body was unmatched. Zyra had hoped that this healer would possibly know what was wrong with her breasts, and maybe also take her on as an apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone sitting on the bench next to her. Turning her head, Zyra saw...</span></div></div>",

Zyra groaned a little, her bust strained her body. It could be forgiven of her,do to the fact a <i>succubus</i> was sitting right beside her. Zyra may have left her village, but she as still an elf at her core. Elves at their youngest age were taught of the succubi; spawn of the demons and mortal races, enemies to all mortal kind! And one was sitting right beside her, sipping casually from a mug. Zyra did her best not to be obvious, she slowly scooted to the furthest edge of the bench. A small portion of the tavern were still focused on her, they were lucky enough to receive a small show of Zyra's bust moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon reaching the farthest edge of the bench,Zyra crossed her arms across her bust trying to be casual.

The only person who could match her in size was Zyra's Northman companion. Zyra was told that succubi had wings on them, but for some reason the one she saw didn't have them. The succubus wore something that resembled a blacksmith's apron. It left her forearms bared and from the side Zyra could see the bandage wrapping for the succubus's support. She had clearly defined muscles on her; this ironically seemed unreal on from a being that belonged to a hedonistic species known for excess. The same could be said of Zyra and her bust however.Her skin was a purplish-black hue, with the current lighting turning the skin into ebony. Her hair was comparatively short to Zyra's long locks. With it only stopping at the base of her neck. It was colored stark white, contrasting with her skin. The succubus's horns were goat-like and-for reason- intricately carved.It almost seemed artistically crafted and made;the designs on it were of waves, abstract animals, and elements.Almost blocked by her bust, Zyra looked down towards the bottom of the succubus.Instead of feet, the succubus's possessed hooves, which came out from the bottom her apron.Cloven hooves as black as midnight and were like those of a horse. If one took away the height and skin tone, one could mistake the succubus as a satyr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The demonspawn didn't seem to notice Zyra at first,still drinking from her mug. Finally,she glanced at Zyra and widened her eyes.  Zyra took to note that they were cat-like slits compared to a satyr's human ones. The succubus swallowed whatever drink was in her mug and turned to smile at the elf. Said elf seemed to be trying to sink into herself, scared of what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Opening her mouth, the succubus wanted to start a conversation...</span></div></div>",

The barmaiden droned on about what they had, and Zyra said she'd take a soup and a table to eat at. The barmaiden, initially attempting to lead her to one, had to help her to one, and, despite Zyra's visible, if not verbal, protest, the succubus sat down right across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured we could continue our... <i>beautiful</i>... conversation here. Oh, miss, may I have what she is having?\" The succubus asked, the barmaiden giving a thumbs-up of confirmation.

The barmaiden brought them their food, and they began to eat. Zyra hadn't realized how hungry she was, but the succubus was making her feel uncomfortable.</span></div></div>",

When she was with the elves back at the verge, she would eat only small portions despite the others insisting she eat more. The soup was about how much she ate in a meal, but for some reason she still felt hungry, her stomach feeling like it was going to implode if she did not order more food. The barmaid traveled from table to table, taking orders and delivering food and drink. It was a cheery place Zyra had found herself in. <i>Why is Vyra not back yet?</i> she wondered. Despite everything, she could feel herself calming down. That is untill she was startled by her stomach growling, still not satisfied with the rather small meal she had just had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry, are we?\" The succubus said with a chuckle. \"Don't worry, I can help. More of the same?\" The succubus asked, leaning in towards Zyra, eyes giving her a hungry stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- what?\" Zyra manages. \"I... thank you.\" Zyra says. \"If... if it wouldn't be a problem, could you...</span></div></div>",

The Kitsune was coming down the stairs of the tavern, a huge grin plastered on her face. The succubus looked towards the Kitsune, turned to look at Zyra and got up.Heading towards the barkeep to refill her mug. Zyra smiled in relief, thankful that she dodged whatever conversation that was about to come up. Who knows what perverted thing would the succubus say? Whatever it was, Zyra didn't need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Who was your friend melon?\" Vyna said. \"Melon\" was affectionate nickname that Vyna called Zyra, do to an obvious fact. Vyna sat down right next to Zyra and glared at any remaining patrons leering at the girl. Between being buff as a bull and a kitsune, Vyna cut an impressive figure;all of those patrons now seemed to have other things on their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody V, just a succubus trying to do something weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if she comes around again. I'll just come and give her a talking to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Zyra smiled at the thought and straighten herself out. Feeling just how tense she was do to the succubus, thankful to what she considered her friend. \"Vyna, is it okay for to get me juice from the bar. They do sell curated fruit juice here right\" Zyra smiled at Vyna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just ask for some water,melon. Oh, something from your knapsack\" with that Vyna got up from the bench and headed towards the bar. The thing she left with Zyra was a book, which was also Zyra's favorite. Zyra looked down at it,\"The New Book of Medicine by Professor Uotwain\", loaned to her by her village.Those elves taking it from the ruins of some caravan. Zyra ate it up,keeping all the information in her head. She read it religiously, hoping that something in it would reveal what was wrong with her.She wanted to meet this \"Professor Uotwain\" and ask him for his knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The problem was that what little news her people received ,and/or told her, was that Uotwain was in Racovania. . A land that was both north of her people and full of demon worshipers and undead. Enemies to most of the continent, or so Zyra was being raised was told. Still,she was going to make the trek determined to meet the professor, but by then her breasts grew too big for her to move. Which caused Zyra to resigned herself to her fate in the village. However,on the day she met the caravan crew, she begged them to head towards Racovania. Hoping for a chance at meeting the man.The gods seemed to smile on her however, as the caravan that found her was going that way already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This part of Racovania was just the outskirts of the \"city\".If it even could be called a \"city\", being more or less a collection of one hundred villages converging around the villas, palaces, and manors of the vampires. However, it did seem to support itself, with a collective populace of over one million and who knows how many others \"living\" in the vampire district.. Nobody seemed to be starving, nor was there rampant raids or destruction.And even the outskirts seemed tempered and controlled.That is besides the point, the caravan crew stopped at this tavern to rest, before going towards the inner \"city\" of Racovania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before opening the book, Zyra looked towards her friend heading towards the counter.The succubus was still talking to the barkeep, before stopping and eyeing Vyna. She in turn eyed right back, almost daring for something to happen. The contest of will lasted for a little, right before the succubus shrugged and left the counter. She headed towards the nearest open table and sat down on a chair, idly drinking to herself. With that, Vyna began to converse with the barkeep. Zyra took the scene in and went to her book going through it top and bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Vyna came back holding two mugs, handing one to Zyra. Zyra in turn absently took the mug, took a sip and went back to reading. Vyna sat down and listened to the background noise of the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melon, come on let's go. Vincent and Ivan got all our stuff secured and in our rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zyra looked upwards, the tavern already empty of patrons. Groggily, she took the shoulder Vyna offered her and wrapped her arm around her. Vyna momentarily grunted and  steadied herself and Zyra,both slowly headed towards the stairs. Getting ready to sleep off their fatigue and head towards a new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The succubus was still at the single table,getting up and leaving the tavern.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, her thrashing threw her blanket onto the floor. Taking away the only warming thing in the entire bedroom, or at least the one Zyra could feasibly get. Elves,as a tradition, slept mostly in the nude. Making them \"closer to the Yva\" as the elders put it. In a mostly temperament environment, combined with whatever special properties an elf village has, that statement was easy to say. In the north, in an unenchanted tavern, the statement didn't hold much water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Zyra looked at her mountainous breasts and saw that her nipples were pointing straight upwards. Already the breezing air and chill covered her, causing more of Zyra to cringe more into herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vyna, can you please wake up. I got a problem.\" Zyra said, maybe a little more forceful than she wanted, to the sleeping kitsune. Lazily, opening her eyes and then sighing the kitsune got up. Zyra mentally yelling at her to go faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zyra, Ivan told you how cold it is up north; Vincent told you how cold it is up north; <i>I</i> told you how cold it is up north. Now, why didn't you listen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't do this in the caravan because of room and this is a tradition amongst my people! Not just in my little village, Vyna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Said kitsune took one look at the naked form of her elf friend, bent over and placed the blanket back on her. Stretching a little, the kitsune swished her tails back and forth and went towards the other room. Leaving Zyra hugging herself naked against the blanket. her bosom rubbing harshly against the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this morning doesn't look good.\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vyna helped Zyra with her daily grooming, which was as difficult as many would suspect. After her dress was helped on by Vyna-who then helped her down the stairs again-Vyna and  Zyra met the others.By the time it took the two to come down, Ivan and Vincent already were seated at table,even though they woke up later. Both men had plates of food on the table. Which in Ivan's case meant three plates and two sides. Both men smiled as their companions took a seat across from them. Vyna took one plate, while Zyra took two. For some reason the little elf could consume a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now to give an in-depth look into the caravan, one would see: a gigantic, northman as wide as he was tall. A diminutive, central plainer who seemed to be going for a classic \"adventure\" look. A muscled, kitsune who was far from home. And finally, a ridiculously busty elf maiden, wearing only a blue tunic in an early morning cold sweep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thankfully, the tavern wasn't that full of occupants. So nobody battered an eye at such a weird motley, or at least did it openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" Morning, companions! Fill up all you can, because the sudden snow storm is causing the roads to be filled.\" proclaimed Ivan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" Ca't wait to set up sh'p.\" Vincent said between mouthfuls of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Zyra had to place her food at the side, do to not being able to reach it past her bust. Vyna had her hand on the plate, so that whenever Zyra speared a fruit piece it didn't slide the plate. Unfortunately, Zyra was so busy trying to eat, that she forgot her nipples were still hard. Giving both Ivan and Vincent an eyeful, although Ivan didn't seem at all interested. Their peaceful silence broken when a thought came across Zyra's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" This snow. It happens a lot around here?\" said Zyra. \"Yes\" replied Ivan. Zyra grimaced and said \"Can our horses make it through? it seems quite dangerous to put them through such weather.\" Vincent, Ivan and Vyna both looked at Zyra and then each other, followed by various pitches of laughter. Zyra face turned red going all the way to her cleavage, did she say something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fortunately, it Vyna was the one to break the silence. \"Zyra, melon, those horses are northern bred. They're made, hell, born to go through this weather. They have a higher chance of going through the snow than we do on foot.\" Vyna assured<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me\" Ivan said. Taking something out of his knapsack,he handed two things over to Zyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A large cloak and some earmuffs. Clothing of the locals, I bought them when you were getting dressed.\"  Vyna calmly took the cloak and swished it outwards. It was larger than even Zyra! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivan, that's too big for me! Why would I need such a thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one: so you can wrap it around you for warmth, like a blanket. I care about you <i>dear</i>, unless you're  Ivan, you can't go around half-dressed. Two: the name of the problems on your chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but the earmuffs?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"The outskirts of Racovania are more accepting of outsiders. When one gets closer to the inner city-those folk aren't so comforting. Many of them probably haven't traveled past their own borders. People like:kitsune, elves, and the like are considered strange beings. The only reason Vincent isn't hated to that degree is because he is human. And the reason I'm accepted is because Racovania regularly deals with northman, such as I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah melon, that is why I am getting that \"cloak of concealment\" for myself. I don't want a brick flying towards my head.\" Zyra huffed in defeat and looked at the cloak that Vyna was holding and the earmuffs in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right lets finish up. Vincent and I will go get the horses and get our stock. Vyna; when your done with Zyra, I want you to scroll in our contact and tell them we will being there soon. Zyra; try to practice human body language and try not to show discomfort around anybody you meet. Not all inner Racovanians are demon worshipers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everything was set up, Vincent and Ivan were already packing in the last of their wares. Vyna was holding the now cloaked Zyra, who do to her bust in the cloak, gave the illusion of being chunkier than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vyna, Zyra, great. We got everything in and we can finally head out. Its going to take us an hour or two to reach what is considered the inner city. So better deal with the boredom in anyway you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Ivan. I don't Vyna and me ever traveled with you towards Racovania before. Why are we doing this now?,asked Vincent from the front, also why didn't we hire more people to help? Even when Vyna wasn't looking after Z, we were still struggling to get the boxes onto the carriage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My contact said the gentry of the land don't like too many foreigners coming in. Taking money from the citizen who need it, he tells me. However, a festival is going on right now and the gentry become lenient towards foreign goods.So does the populace of the place.The smell of profit is churning the waters. And many merchants, and salary men, and others are trying to come, or going to arrive here. And my contact gave me a heads up. I want to be there before any of them. I also didn't want to alert the other rivals at the caravan guild of what was happening, so I picked the most loyal people I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ivan walked to Zyra and gently lifted her up. Cradling her like a babe, which was a testament to his strength that he could easily do that. Even the buff Vyna struggled with the busty, elf maiden. Putting her into the back, which caused the caravan to creak a little, Ivan walked towards the front. Vyna followed closely behind and hopped right besides Zyra in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Vyna. Before we go, the contact knows we're coming right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, alright let's head forth. Vyna, don't worry about us, we'll set up shop. Just help Zyra with her search for Uowtain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the caravan moved forward to its destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This ride has been <i>leagues</i> more pleasant than the other trip\" Zyra looked to her kitsune friend. It had already been two hours and midday sun was high in the sky.The snow covered roads were not such a hindrance as the roads to Racovania were, at the very least Zyra's bust wasn't jumping like a dog for a snack.Soon, the caravan would reach the inner city and be ready too set up shop. Which gave Zyra and Vyna the chance to head in the city and look for Professor Uotwain.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What? You thankful your jiggly bits didn't flop around melon?\" Vyna said with a grin. Zyra hugged her large bosom to her chest, which acted as her support on such long trips. A sudden stopped made Zyra lurch in her position, her bosom briefly swinging in her large cloak. Vyna,meanwhile, was making sure any of the wares with them weren't going to fall out. Vincent suddenly appeared in the opening of the caravan, looking to say something to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two, keep quiet the border patrol is just stopped our caravan and the boss is talking with them. If they come back here,give them a cheeky wave and be polite.\"  With that, Vincent ran back to the front of the caravan, leaving the two girls waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while after he said that, two well-dressed officers appeared at the back. The Stracken \"coat-of-arms\" proudly engraved on their torso armor and each one had thick leggings. Large, extravagant hats topped their heads. Each one were equipped with pikes and holstered at their sides were daggers. One of the officers appeared to be the senior, his face possessed a large mustache;it wasn't only do to facial features, but his body language. The other officer was most likely the cadet or fresh from the rack. He seemed to hard at trying to have an air of authoritarian power, that it came off as trying to throw around unreal \"weight\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning ladies, I'm Officer Ulrick\" said the senior officer. \"Officer Ricktoffen\" said the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we already got the pass from your Northman boss. He already informed us of this occupation and his intentions for hip foray into the inner city. We just wanted to confirm his story. If you would please just let us inspect a few of your lighter crates that would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course. There is no problem at all, I forgot to introduce my friend and I: Valeria and Zia. Eastern names, not common up here.\" Vyna gave the officer a toothy grin and hopped off the caravan. Which slightly creaked up, loosing a little of its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mind helping me with this, you would be a dear to me\" Vyna said to Officer Ricktoffen. Quickly, but stiffly, he complied with her and helped bring down two crates from the back. Zyra was sitting there, watching as they worked bringing them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't your friend help Miss Valeria\" Officer Ulrick conversed with her, Ricktoffen  gently opening the crates to not ruin them. \"Her? Oh, sorry sales girl, she wouldn't be too much help. She is just there to look pretty.Another she has is a pretty terrible back problem right now.\" Valeria nonchalantly answered as she stood by one of the crates Ricktoffen opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement hurt Zyra a little more than Vyna meant to. Zyra, in her more mobile years, was one of the village's best climbers and trackers. Which were now days long past for her. Huffing a little, Zyra casually watched the officers overlook some examples of the Ivan's wares. Which was all well, until Zyra felt a familiar sensation that was a friend for the past few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes it would linger for a few days or other times it would come it slow,but relatively quick, bursts. This was one of the latter cases, Zyra felt her breasts expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please, Yva, no.</i>\"  Zyra worried internally. Her breasts rose like dough in her tunic and even slowly stretched out some of her cloak. The jiggling masses were rounding hemispheres of supple flesh. Zyra's face grew red do to the sensation of her breasts against the cloth of  her cloak. Her award,sized pumpkins getting even <i>bigger</i> than before. Zyra struggled in her seat, which must of been very noticeable because Officer Ulrick looked over to Zyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Miss Zia, is there a problem?\" Ulrick sincerely asked. Zyra couldn't wave him off because she was using her forelimbs to playoff her growth and her mouth was closed to not moan outward. Officer Ulrick blinked for a moment and started to walk towards her. Zyra mentally screamed to herself, fearing hr cover would be blown. Thankfully,Vyna was there to save face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't mind her officer. Its just her back problem, a trip to the East went bad. We're taking her over to Professor Uotwain for a check up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrick and Ricktoffen looked at Valeria answer and then back at Zyra. Who by then was thanking the gods, her breasts stopped growing. However, who knows how big she was now? Thank the gods however;taking one last glance at Zyra, the officers went back at inspecting the crates. After a few more minutes, the officers gave them the clear. Already the caravan passed them,moving forward the it rode past another two officers. Each were riding horses, intently watching two riderless equines. No doubt belonging to the other two officers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZyra's belly rumbled a little bit, a faint aura of hunger filled her. It always happened after a growth spurt and Zyra hated that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened melon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grew again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, a little scared to look right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gals okay back there?\" Vincent called from the front. \"No worries, just a little problem with Zyra's boobies!\" Vyna replied back.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long of a remaining ride towards the inner city. Already,the two in the back could see some of the \"city's\" buildings.Taking a few more minutes of riding, the caravan stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're getting out to unpack. Meet back in about three hours on the clock.\" Ivan announced and with that, Vyna jumped from the back. Zyra scooted towards the edge and sat there for a few seconds. Ivan finally came around and helped Zyra down. Right before giving her to Vyna, who didn't try to make it obvious that her companion wasn't of <i>normal</i> weight. Even with the very few citizens out now, who knew who was watching? After being caught by Vyna, Zyra turned around to get a better look at their stay of residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current place Ivan's caravan was parked at appeared to be a <i>huge</i> building, only the elf king was known to possess such a grand building. A stable could be seen at its side. A barn could be faintly seen in the distance. Two smaller buildings were split off from the larger structure, each almost as large as their previous residence!Zyra was craning her neck so far up and moving backwards, that she almost brought Vyna down into the snow. The kitsune steadied her companion and herself, before catastrophe struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, melon be careful\" Vyna admonished the buxom elf. \"What is this place?\" Zyra questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this place? Well, they call them a manor .This specific manor;I do not know. Hey, Ivan what is this manor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our contact said this was where a upper-crust middleman lives, he is temporarily hosting early travelers for the festival here. That is until a more, permanent, residence can be found.\"Ivan replied back already unpacking the caravan with Vincent's talking to a servant at the open doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll be off Ivan. See ya Vincent!\" with that Vyna and Zyra went around the inner city for directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the gods name, not even counting the Futtoa-Machi! \" Vyna announced.The various citizens on the street were following their life; children played on the street, men talked between each other, and women lay down clothes on lines.

Zyra snapped out of her weird enchantment of the castles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, got to give this place a point. Nowhere else are there castles that make Adinah look childlike in comparison.\" Vyna admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,they're just so...<i>big</i>!\" Zyra said. \"I have never seen castles like those before. Their snow capped spires, those windows everywhere, and  the shapes and size. Its just wonderful to see and experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Melon, but come, we need to see where this doctor is.\" Vyna said chastely.\" Come on, lets go find the local drinking hole in this the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crash alerted the two from a distant corner, a scream was heard and then was silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think I know where to go. Lets get going, Melon!\" Vyna hefted the busty girl with her and the duo stiffly walked their way to the destination.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nThe duo walked into the doors of, from what the sign read, Bleakfrost Tavern. They could see rowdy adventurers, miners, and people just trying to blow off their steam. Zyra and Vyna made their way to a corner table and waited for one of the many haggled barmaids to come and get their orders. Zyra diddled with her fingers as their orders, Vyna played with a board located next to them. It was probably for the entertainment of the guests and it was luck that Vyna could get it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten or twelve minutes did a barmaid get to them and take their orders. Zyra order a soup, while Vyna asked for roasted lamb. Vyna pulled herself from her spot and told Zyra: \"I'm going to find some info about the place, stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where would I go?\" Zyra cheekily replied, knowing this song and dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVyna made her way to an open seat, that was gracefully given to her by a punched out patron. Zyra saw Vyna sit down and began to speak.her challenge began: trying to eat the soup in front of her without reveling her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, Vyna came back Zyra. She seemed to have found the info that she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you got?\" Zyra asked Vyna as the kitsune consumed her now cold lamb. She dug into it voraciously; Zyra jokingly thought Vyna appeared to be like the larger women located in the tavern. Their rotund bodies seemed to jiggle as they ate their fill.She probably <i>could</i> get to those size, if she lazed about and didn't work off the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the locals told me the healer was west of this place. Her operations are in an alleyway; we have to say a code-phrase to get in. The phrase is 'Red Snow' and we have to knock twice. And another little factoid is that the healer is like a big-shot, she gets the local gentry in her shop.\" Vyna explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us make haste then.\" Zyra exclaimed,she finally found a lead to her cure. Vyna placed her money down on the table and made their way towards their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They stopped as they saw the street sides filled to the brim with various peasants, and workers, and shop owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on,Vyna?\" Zyla whispered,Vyna gently placed a finger in front of her mouth. Showing that she needed for Zyla to be quiet, all around the cold atmosphere became somehow...colder. Zyla heard it before she saw it, the clinking of wheels traveling over stone. Then, it appeared, a black carriage pulled by some of the blackest horses Zyla had ever seen before. She gaped with an open mouth, almost stumbling back in shock, thankfully being caught by Vyna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets move back a little bit.\" Vyna said under her breath, she gently guided Zyla far from the crowd. Even though Zyla knew Vyna was trying to do something for her good, she still wanted to watch what happened next. A faint voice called out to someone, which made Zyla turn her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olga!\" Zyla saw a peasant girl grab onto the shoulder of a noticeably busty barmaid, though, she was nowhere near the size of the elf at the moment. Zyla watched as the two argued, not loud enough for the peasants to hear, but it wasn't much of a problem for an elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak emanated from the carriage, bringing Zyla's attention to it far earlier than any of the peasants. When the sound reverberated again, the townsfolk caught on and watched with rapt curiosity. Out of the door came something that made Zyla open her mouth in pure shock. She appeared to be a human, but her skin was a light grey; she smiled at the crowd and Zyla could see the tips of ivory fangs.A part of Zyla made her flinched, as if the thing in the carriage was out to get her and her alone. The vampire's gown was extravagant and embroiled with symbols and finery, but in some areas it seemed to have grown quite..<i>tight.</i> The lady appeared to indulge herself greatly from whatever the town gave to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the hips, the fine gown seemed to be struggling a quite bit. Zyla's elven reflexes caught the lady adjusting her gown, as if was the gown's problem and not whatever blubber was located near here hips.\" <i>She needs to watch what she eats and accept whatever weight shes carrying now.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great display of cleavage was shown to the world, and the lady's bust greatly benefited from her fat,it jiggled with pure emphasis and sex appeal. However, Zyla noted again that her bust was still miles beyond what this thing had. In her mind, Zyla hoped for something to be bigger than her in a vain attempt to believe she was still normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere off in the crowd,Zyla heard someone mutter: \"Lady Cameena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So thats who this is</i>.\" Zyla mentally noted as she watched the vampire look dismissively over the crowd. And for one brief moment, Zyla's heart pounded in her chest as the vampire gazed at her. It may have been a moment, but Zyla felt Cammena knew that she was an elf. The moment stretched into eternity before Cammena brought her gaze somewhere else. Zyla shuddered and watched as the vampire began to finally speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening to you all.\" Cameena said, her voice hauntingly low and beautiful, \"I hope you are all having a pleasant evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't see anyone smiling.\"</i> Zyla joked in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come to the decision that I require another tribute. As my clan has already collected, I understand that this may come as... a sort of shock.\" The woman bit her ebony-black bottom lip, \"But whomsoever's family I rob of one of their delicious daughters will be handsomely rewarded. I am not a cruel mistress, nor is my lady Eviana, but our needs are... growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Like your stomach?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSobbing filled the air and Zyla wanted to come up to the vampire and give her a piece of her mind, although, she was weighed down by two things at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order to provide for you so that you may live out your pitiful...\" Cameena looked around distastefully, \"Existence. My clan must be well nourished and paid for our services\u2014those who would replace us would do much more than take one of your daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now girls...\" she said, checking her nails, \"Step forward then, would you? So that I might pick the prettiest among you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZyla watched as various girls come forward,like they were prized fowls and cattle. Seven girl walked up to the vampire and bowed gently; Zyla, like the crowd,held their breaths as they watched the scene. Cammena huffed in frustration and opened her mouth to vent her opinions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA conversation began between the lady and the girls;about the size of the quarry, and favorites that Cameena wanted to pick, and why they were missing. It soon ended when Cammena finally pointed at one of them. And Zyla noted sourly, it appeared to be the same girl who called out to her sister earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga,Zyla noted, cried and pleaded for her sister not to be taken, but Cameena dismissed all of that. After a heartfelt farewell, the lady and her choice traveled back to the black towers over the distance. Olga stood tall, before she collapsed and began crying in the snow, with only a few people patting her on the shoulders or speaking their condolences. The crowd soon dissipated, Zyla and Vyna watched as the girl just kneel. Zyla wanted to come over and comfort her, but she couldn't, if she still wanted to keep her cover that is.</span></div></div>",

The promise of finding a way to enrich the cattle's blood to be more enriching in smaller amounts is very intriguing, and something I hope has been most helpful in your own journey through these endless nights. I will gladly accept your invitation to sample this new stock, say in 6 months' time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just hope there are still some left when I arrive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith affection,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTovia Stracken</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill such a bitch...\u201d Lavena Olingrad muttered as she crumpled up the expensive parchment the letter was written on and tossed it into her fire. She would have the last laugh over Tovia and the entire Stracken brood, in the end; the entirety of the past 15 years had been dedicated to such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the window looking out over a mining village just outside Raconvania territory she took over quietly a year ago. Looking at the half constructed castle just visible up the mountain, Lavena knew it would not be finished in time for Tovia\u2019s visit, but she had waited so long for revenge, and Lavena would not wait another year and a half for her castle to be complete. All she needed was for Tovia to sample the blood of one of the village's cattle, and everything would be in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire trembled slightly at the thought of drinking blood, something she hadn\u2019t done in years. As annoying as Tovia\u2019s needling in the letter was, it wasn\u2019t entirely off base. Lavena had always had something of an acquaintance with gluttony (earning her the nickname<i> Lavena the Lamia</i> among her peers). She had been chubbier than almost any of her fellow nobles, always promising herself she\u2019d get under control one day, but that things weren\u2019t that bad yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat changed when she went on a bender that saw her drain dry dozens of people in her territory and nearly burst like an overfed tick. When her humans rioted in the aftermath, she could barely escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 years later when she looked in the mirror, gone was the bloated, out of control monster she had become. Standing nearly 2 meters tall, Lavena was imposing to say the least. Her skin was a stark, snow white and her long hair a deep crimson, worn up in intricate styles. Her eyes were a deep forest green, though a surprising amount of red could be seen mixed in in certain lighting. She wore a low cut black and red dress lined with fur, showing off her sizable chest. A diamond of material was cut out over her bellybutton to expose some of her mostly flat stomach to the cold evening's air, and a long slit up one side provided view of her shapely legs and naturally thick thighs. Sure, she supposed her hips flared out just a little bit more than they should, and her ass perhaps pushed the line of too big, and certainly nothing about her could be described as fit or toned but compared to the state she was in last time she was in the North, she was practically svelte.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all thanks to the secret weapon she came in possession of in her travels, who as it happened just entered the room as she was ruminating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure who arrived was a little shorter than Lavena, wearing robes of grey and a lacquered black wood mask covering their face. Lavena wasn't entirely sure where this man, introduced to her as a \u201cblood sorcerer,\u201d was from, nor did she particularly care. Fully loyal to whomever held his contract, she bought it from his previous employer and worked with him to develop a blood substitute for her. Able to fuel her vampiric body but without any of the euphoric feelings of feeding on actual blood, this artificial blood was unsatisfying, but it was precisely because of its tasteless nature Lavena could keep from overindulging.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress...\u201d the figure began, his voice barely more than a whisper, \u201cI am pleased to inform you that the additive to the cattle's food has fully taken hold in their blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavena's full lips curled into a smile, exposing her fangs. Her plan pivoted around Orin making the women of her little mining town's blood as euphoric and addictive as possible (not to mention ordering all the women of the town, even those not marked as cattle, to eat ridiculous proportions of food at every meal, which had nothing at all to do with Lavena wanting to look thinner in comparison). <i>Soon all those who mocked me will be more helpless than I was, gluttonous addicts craving stock only I posses</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as dreams of her revenge danced in her mind, another thought, insidiously quiet, sneaked into her brain, <i>I wonder what it taste like...</i></span></div></div>",

The underground space served as a laboratory for Orin and his apprentice, the latter of whom Lavena was delighted to notice was quickly trying to brush crumbs off her robes before anyone noticed. <i>I exempt her from the eating regimen and she's still a greedy pig. What a lack of self control.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire couldn't remember the apprentice's name, only that she was one of the few people in town who could actually read, and thus she had been the only choice really for assisting Orin. The blonde girl was short and little more than a twig when they first arrived, but looking at the belly stretching out her robes and straining against the sash tied around her waist, it was clear that she had taken to the limited luxury her position afford very nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lavena noticed that Orin's apprentice was fatter than the cattle currently asleep on a bed in the corner of the room, she couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrin followed Lavena's gaze to the sleeping woman, \u201cShe had her evening meal here as I tested her blood, she's simply sleeping it off.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavena approached the woman, licking her lips in anticipation. It had been so, so long since she'd actually fed on a human, she deserved a treat. And of course, to make sure Orin and the Pig had done their job correctly. Slowly she bent down towards the woman's neck, baring her fangs <i>You're in control now, you deserve this. What harm could one taste cause?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second blood flowed from the woman's neck into her mouth, Lavena was shocked numb, unable to process just what she was tasting. Everything around her dissolved, every thought gone, lost entirely to the most intensely pleasurable experience she's ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the vampire's own moaning that snapped Lavena back to herself; she just managed to pull herself away before killing the member of her stock.. Lavena barely felt like she could stay standing, her body pulsing with sensation. She opened her mouth to tell her sorcerer it worked, but all she managed was a whimper of residual euphoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrin gently slipped his arm under the vampire's and guided her to a chair, \u201cIngrid, check on the cattle there please, make sure she is still comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, Ingrid, that's the Pig's name...</i> Lavena thought slowly, coherent thought slowly returning to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are going to complete loose themselves...\u201d she mumbled satisfied.</span></div></div>",

The 19 year old blonde didn't know quite how she felt about living under a vampire's rule, or training to become a \u201cblood sorcerer.\u201d It had its perks, but so much of it didn't necessarily feel... <i>morally</i> good. What she did know was that the past year in this position had been awful for her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Mistress has requested some of our additive be mixed into her meal tonight,\u201d Orin said, leaning against the wall of the basement laboratory.

I mean, it was designed to be <i>addictive</i>, and I mean...surely you've heard the rumors of what made her leave the North over a decade ago?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrin lets out something Ingrid interpreted as a chuckle, \u201cYou speak too freely, apprentice. As far as we are concerned, the Mistress <i>only</i> has good ideas. Furthermore, be careful who you spread those rumors too, your position affords you some exemption when it comes to the Mistress's rules, but she will kill you if she hears you spreading them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid huffs in annoyance and a little fear, shoving the rest of her sweet roll into her mouth. <i>I wasn't spreading rumors...</i>She moves to one of the counters, concerned and slightly embarrassed that she had to press her robed belly against the counter a little to reach the back of it to grab the bowls to begin preparing the vampire's meal. She used to be so thin, before Lavena took over, but all the food she had access to was<i> too</i> good.<i> Maybe I should be more concerned about my own indulgences than Lavena's.</i>..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavena paced her bed room, twitching her fingers, picking up little knickknacks she'd picked up over her years of travel, only to put them down without even looking. <i>Where is Orin with my meal? </i>Once she had recovered from tasting the enhanced blood the other day, things had returned to normal. She was pleased by how little she craved it, impressed with her self control and congratulating herself for reaching the point in her relationship with indulgence that she could have a little treat without risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent the majority of her time awake since that day thinking about how little she<i> needed</i> more, how good she was, and while sure it tasted...indescribably delightful, it wasn't calling to her; the fact it was odd that it was always on her mind didn't strike her as odd at all. For just how well she was handling it, she decided she deserved a little treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like hours after requesting dinner, a knock came at the door, \u201cCome in!\u201d Lavena called out, perhaps more eager than she intended. Orin stepped into the room, holding out a plate with what looked like a loaf of bread soaked in blood. Lavena enjoyed consuming the blood substitute through mortal food, it was the only indulgence she allowed herself since switching to it... well other than now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the bread in her hand, the vampire took a quick bite. The euphoria wasm't quite as strong as it was straight from a human, but it still elicited a soft moan from her lips, her eyelids fluttering as she ate more. Breathing becoming heavy, she kept shoving more and more of the soft bread into her mouth. In a record time, the loaf was gone and Lavena had sat down on her bed, her breasts heaving in her revealing dress as she breathed heavily, letting the sensations of the additive run through her.<i> Its so... I just... I need..</i>. It takes Lavena a moment to figure out what she wants to say, and just before Orin can ask if she needs anything else, Lavena mumbles, voice husky, \u201cAnother... I need... another.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She grimaced as she took a deep breath and her belly pressed tightly against the belt around the waist of her robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday had been quite the annoying reminder that she was perhaps abusing her access to food a little too much. For awhile Ingrid's stomach had slapped against her thighs as she walked, it was seemingly the only part of her ever getting bigger. Her chest had always been rather modest, easily hidden by the grey robes she wore, and until now she thought her legs had remained relatively thin as well (she tried not to look down and be confronted with her gut as much as possible, and mirrors always were always to be avoided), but the chaffing along the inside of her thighs after her climb forced her to reevaluate that belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also realized she had spent the entirety of the past week in her and Orin's basement laboratory. It had a bed, it had a tub, servants would bring down food with the other supplies, there was no <i>reason</i> to leave. It was because Orin was actually having her perform small feats of magic which were exhausting, and it had absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with the fact that Ingrid hated stairs and always thought of some excuse or another not to go up them. (Okay, maybe if she thought about it, it had <i>a little</i> to do with her hatred of stairs, but after how winded the climb left her, she resolved to make sure to climb them at least once a day. She needed to do something to start trying to loose a little weight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving mostly caught her breath and hoping that her face wasn't quite as flushed from the climb as it felt, Ingrid picked up her tray, flipped her braid over her relatively thin shoulder, and approached the door to what served as Lavena Olingrad's \u201cthrone room.\u201d With a sigh and a quick straightening of her robes, Ingrid knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d Lavena's thick, husky voice called out almost immediately. As she did every time she entered the room, Ingrid had to appreciate the effort that went into making what once served as the former mayor of the village's office into a proper vampiric chamber. Strange skulls of monsters and beasts Lavena encountered on her travels lined the walls, bordered by black and red tapestries, the floor its self mostly covered by an expensive black and gold rugs that Ingrid was never entirely sure she was suppose to actually walk on. A large fireplace provided most of the light to the room, though much of it was cast in shadows, including the wide throne made of bestial bones Lavena herself was currently occupying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the vampire drew herself to her feet, and Ingrid's suspicions from the last time she saw her a week ago were confirmed, <i>Her ass definitely takes up more space on that throne than it used to. I can't really judge 'anyone' for gaining weight but...who knew vampires even could?</i> It wasn't much, but it was notable. Lavena's dresses were fitting just a tad tighter, her breasts overflowing their confines a little more than before. Her stomach was pressed tighter against the diamond cutout on the dress, causing it's new, light layer of pudge to jut out ever so slightly. The vampire's hips had always been a bit wider than average (even for her impressive height), but considering they looked proportionally the same as always, Ingrid figured they had expanded slightly as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, is my sorcerer too busy to answer my summons today?\u201d The vampire asked, stalking slowly towards Ingrid, whom gulped involuntarily even if Lavena's tone was playful more than angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Mistress! He...there was an incident at the mine... while you slept... it required magical attention to clear quickly... Orin hasn't been back yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire loomed in front of her, and Ingrid was reminded of the full nature of their height difference when she has to avert her gaze towards the floor or be staring directly at Lavena's impressive cleavage. \u201cAnd not only that... this does not look like the normal bread I have my meals soaked in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid sputters, \u201cWell... the cooks were just finishing feeding... feeding your livestock and they um, weren't prepared since this isn't a normal time... and well... all that was left that could easily absorb the artificial blood was... my dinner...:\u201d Ingrid sheepishly held the tray up to Lavena, letting her get a closer look at the 7 sweet rolls stained dark. A moment of silence passed and Ingrid dared to look up, only to lock her blue eyes briefly with the vampire's deadly green. <i>Was she...looking at my belly? Ingrid's face heated up with embarrassment, Of course she was you just admitted you were going to eat over half a dozen pastries for dinner! Not that she's any better, Gone are her days of of a single serving of bread and blood substitute being enough.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd is this the... special prepared blood?\u201d Lavena asked after letting Ingrid squirm for a few more seconds. Ingrid noticed that after about the fourth day of asking for the additive to be added to her meals (something Ingrid couldn't help but smile smugly about: calling Lavena becoming hooked on the stuff), the vampire had stopped referring to it with the same language she referred to it when she talked of her plans to make the other vampires in the region addicted to her cattle and fat... or something, it sounded a little silly to Ingrid but maybe when one was \u201cso far beyond mortal concerns\u201d like the vampires supposedly were, such dumbly petty plans were common place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I mean, yes of course Mistress!\u201d Ingrid said, Orin didn't care about her informality, but he always did remind her Lavena did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire took the tray from her hand and slowly stalked back towards her throne with it, calling out, \u201cYou're dismissed. Tell Orin to meet me as soon as he returns... and make sure you have the cooks make you a fresh batch of these for your own dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the sun might have been starting to rise on the mining village, but inside Lavena's bed chamber, she was just lying down to sleep, body still ecstatically sensitive to the touch thanks to her specially prepared meal. It was just a little indulgence, one the vampire felt she deserved every now and then for how good she was the rest of the time. She had switched out of her dress into a long, loose night gown a matching shade of red as her hair, which now hung free down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavena rubbed her stomach slowly, trying to ease the delightful pain of her evening meal and sooth the strange irretation her dress had stared to cause, for some reason it seemed like it rubbed her skin a little bit harder than normal around where it showed off her navel, but the silk texture of her nightgown was helping to relieve it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I will have all my meals in sweet rolls from now on... or perhaps other pastries... </i>The rubbing picked up pace as she thought about her next meal, a soft, genuine moan of want escaping her lips.<i> I can't believe the Pig was going to eat all those for dinner... she'd enjoy being cattle a great deal I bet,</i> Lavena thought, the hypocrisy of the fact she ate what she was criticizing Ingrid for planning to eat missing her completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the artificial blood... or maybe the special preparation, made it so she could taste the sugar of the pastries, a taste she really had no reason of ever seeking out in the decades since being turned into a creature of the night. Now that she had it again, the thought of having more was appealing indeed. As an immortal creature, what could a sweet now and then really hurt?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside her small hut on the edge of the mining village, Astrid sighed as she heard the summoning bell ring from the village square. Life since Lavena Olingrad had taken over their town had been...strange, and the woman had some questions. With her husband currently incapacitated from an incident at the mine, he couldn't hold her back from trying to get some answers this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomethings made sense of course; their vampiric overlord demanding a castle be built overlooking the village was what Astrid would expect, same with some of the women in the town being selected as cattle. As far as all the rumors around the town went though, the cattle were not fed upon... merely kept fat and happy in a temporary residence near the manor home Lavena used while her castle was constructed. Not only that, there was that bizarre order that all the women in the town needed to eat enough for three people. The vampire provided said food, money from the mines coupled with her own apparent personal fortune meant much more food than the village's population could reasonably need was brought in regularly as shipments from the mines were taken out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid did her best to avoid the clearly intended weight gain, splitting the food between her and her husband kept the inevitable rise in size slower than most of her peers, while her husband's mine work kept the effects at bay for him. In the early days, after her sister Ingrid had gotten employed in the manor (a position that she was always vague about), Astrid pawned most the extra food off on her when she would visit. Those visits were less and less now, in fact she hadn't seen her 'little' sister in three weeks. Astrid wasn't concerned though, the past few visit Ingrid had been sweaty and complaining about the quarter mile walk from the manor to Astrid's home, Astrid had no doubts Ingrid was fine, just lazy and not feeling up to the walk anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping on some furs to protect against the night cold, Astrid slipped out to answer the summons.<br>\r\n___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlluminated by the low hanging moon, Lavena Olingrad idly brushed a few leftover crumbs from her snack off the voluminous black fur coat she wore tied closed around her. It wasn't to protect against the cold, she had little concern over something as mundane as that. No, it served a much more important purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her servants had ruined ruined her dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavena had noticed they were getting tight the past few weeks, something her maid suggested might be because it had been exceptionally cold recently and the house staff weren't taking proper care to avoid shrinking the rich fabric. The vampire didn't remember such procedures being necessary for all the time she was in the North before leaving 15 years ago, but her servants must had been more capable back then. Her maid had insisted she would take care of the issue, but her dress splitting up the side and in the back while she ate that evening was indisputable proof that the issue hadn't been dealt with at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavena had been furious, her immediate thought being to drain her maid and the rest of the staff dry. She manged to keep from acting on said impulse, conceding to herself that doing so might not be very in control of her. When her blood sorcerer suggested leaving dealing with the staff up to him instead, she agreed. No need for her to waste her time on such a minor incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo to take her mind off things, Lavena decided to check in on her humans, among whom no doubt a few were having clothing mishaps of their own. A servant placed a chair on top of the small wooden platform built in the village square so Lavena could stand above the crowd when they gathered (not that she didn't already do that with her height). As she sat to wait for the village to gather, she frowned as her hips had some friction with the chairs arms, and how her ass forced her to set forward slightly. Lavena knew she was hippy, and that her ass was perhaps on the large side of normal, but this chair was ridiculous, Leave it to these idiots to find the North's tiniest chair, a waif would feel confined in this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gathering herd of humans instantly made her feel better. The women of the town were looking down right stuffed. Tight dresses, furs unable to be tied closed over jutting bellies, even some torn sleeves from upper arms swollen larger with fat than the muscled arms the men who worked the mines. Those women who lived further down in the village had sweaty foreheads and reddened cheeks despite the below freezing temperatures as they slowly made their way into the square. To Lavena's delight, one woman was brought in a cart pulled by her husband (the mine's foreman), and yet after pulling her and helping her down, she was the one short of breath and grumbling about being tired. Yes... this chair might be tight, but I am the only woman in miles who could possibly sit in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is wonderful to see my beautiful subjects again...\u201d Lavena called out to the crowd once most had gathered. Her husky voice with its slight rasp carried easily in the cold night air, \u201cI am pleased to see you all looking so positively healthy this night.\u201d She did genuinely have a soft spot for humans, the same way one might have a soft spot for pigs and keep a few as pets while still eating pork. Those who became the chosen cattle of Nobles tended to end up enjoying the lifestyle, and if she could let all the women in her town experiences that, well, it practically warmed her cold, dead heart. She would have extended it to the men too even, but, well, someone still had to work the mines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lying in her chair, Quixee was munching on a small strawberry as she was beginning to wake up for the morning. Since her body was only a few inches in height, she usually considered a berry to be a good meal for the morning, and she needed to be well-fed, since today was going to be the first day of her study on Harpies for her village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to eat, the little fairy continued to practice her human words, so that she could better understand the harpies. While most fairies preferred to just use their own language, Quixee wanted to be able to converse with the other races on the planet, so that she could better study their personalities and behaviors. Finishing the last of the strawberry, Quixee rubbed her stuffed belly, before beginning to fly north, to where she could finally reach the lands that the harpies call home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so this map says that they're halfway up this mountain, so it shouldn't be that hard to fly up there.\" While Quixee continued to fly upwards the mountain, in hopes that she would eventually reach the harpy village, she noticed that it was getting a lot colder than she was used to, probably due to the land around her starting to snow. Looking for the closest tree, Quixee used a leaf to make a makeshift cloak for herself, so that she could handle the colder climate for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after hours of flying, Quixee could see a house, and as she flew by it she could see a fat harpy, gorging herself with meat, through the window. Knocking on the door, Quixee waited for the harpy to come before saying \"Hey, excuse me, but I would like to ask if this is the harpy village that's on this mountain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh wait there you are. Didn't expect to see a small little fairy this far north.\" As the harpy was talking, she continued to munch on a big roast pork, which she held by her hands. \"Yeah, you are pretty close to that place, but you don't really wanna stay there during the night. I mean, I could barely notice you, and they may not notice you at all, or even accidentally crush you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then where should I stay?\" Quixee quickly asked. \"If I stay out here for the night, I'll freeze to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, you can stay here for the night. I'm pretty stocked up with food, so you should be okay for at least a single day of staying here. Name's Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thanks for your generosity.\" As Nicole held open the door for Quixee to enter, the fairy could quickly smell that there was a large variety of foods littered all around the place, some of them on plate while others were just lying on the ground. While Quixee mostly didn't mind about ground food, she could tell that some of the foods littered around were beginning to form mold, which probably meant that it was spoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could look around anymore, Quixee was quickly interrupted by Nicole, who insisted that she try a bit of the food since she was going to be staying for now. Grabbing a meatball, Nicole quickly shoved a small part of the meat into the fairy's mouth, which at her size, was around as big as her mouth could hold. As she swallowed the meat, Quixee was overcome with a strong, and pleasant taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this isn't half bad!\" Quixee exclaimed, after taking another bite from the meatball that Nicole was feeding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I found and cooked all these meats that you see around you. Sometimes I eat them, and sometimes I let them rot on the floor to attract more meaty animals, like pigs or cows.\" The two continued to talk through the night, and as Quixee continued to gorge herself on meat, she thought that it was gonna be a good time to stay with this harpy while she studied them.</span></div></div>",

It was cold up in the tundra, to be sure. Having to wear heavy furs all the time since she was a child was often cumbersome and uncomfortable. Plus, they didn't give her all that much range of motion when she went hunting with her older brothers. Still, this was no better, as she knew after this, she would be doing very little moving at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what never made sense to her was how much the other women in the village seemed to enjoy it, almost like they were brainwashed into believing this was truly something the gods wanted.

Men often beefed themselves up into strong, muscular beings with a layer of fat to keep warm. Women in the northern villages did something far more drastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had become ritual by now, an important sacred ceremony any woman underwent before being married.

None of these women ever had to wear furs because their body heat stayed pretty well maintained under all the blubber. However, in recent years, it had taken on new meaning. Now, it was considered a mark of beauty for a woman to be enormous, round, and plushy. Now, any many desired only the fattest women for their wives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica was now at the age where she was expected to undergo the ritual, and she hated every second of it. She wanted to be like her brothers: strong, proud hunters and warriors. She wanted to run free and live by  her own rules, not bound to a home to be some fat, breeding sow for some hairy boar of a husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, here she was, standing before the wood hut, watching the smoke waft from the opening in the roof, wondering what sort of fate awaited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you'll do fine,\" Batolir, one of her brothers said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"It's not that I'm worried about. I just don't want to do it. Why can't I be like you and Kluendr and just be myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall northman looked down at his sister. \"It's tradition, Astica. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you put yourself through that kind of a process?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you understand how I must feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and tried to reason with her. \"Look, no one said you have to get all that big. You just have to live there for the next two years, and whatever size you leave at is what you get. Just don't come crying to me when no man will take you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her tongue out at him. \"Like I'd want a man like that anyway,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes. \"You are as stubborn as an old yak sometimes, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled proudly at that. \"Why thank you,\" she said with a little bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just behave,\" he said. He began to walk away before turning back to his sister. \"I'll miss you. And I will come back to see you in two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica only waved back, swallowing hard. So this was really happening to her. There was no backing out, no making excuses, nothing standing in her way of this anymore. She sucked in a deep breath before entering the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, it was incredibly toasty and warm. She looked ahead of her and saw a long pit full of hot coals, which was helping to keep the place warm. Long tables lined the hall. They were almost as big as those found in the chief's great halls, she thought. She wondered just how many women came here at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the hall sat one of the biggest women Astica had ever seen in her entire life. She had her dark hair done up in a bun to keep it out of her eyes, and her skin was covered in various blue tattoos. It must've taken a lot of ink to cover a woman of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a mountain of flab, from her round flushed face with multiple chins, to her chubby toes on feet that looked like they had never walked in years. Most dominating of all were the rolls and rolls of her round belly cascading over her wide dimpled hips, surrounded by her jiggling, wobbly arms. She was fanning herself with her flabby palm, clearly far too warm from the heat in the room. But, all the same, she maintained her composure. She looked the picture of elegance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica approached her cautiously, not sure what to expect. The woman noted her presence and began to speak. \"Ah, yes, I was told a new one would be arriving. I am Olahvir, the fattening hut matron. Welcome.\" She gave an honest smile to the young woman. \"For the next two years, you shall live here, eating and learning the ways of being a northman's wife. You shall find this life both easy and challenging at the same time. So long as you put in effort, you will see results, and you will find this experience pleasant. Now, to begin...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A welcome feast\u2026 of course. What else should Astica have expected of such a place; the villages traditions clearly sought to make a fat pig of her as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpread in front of her were all sorts of dishes, mostly meats and large vegetables. The table was low to the ground, easily within the obese woman\u2019s reach, though she did not touch a crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she had mouthed off enough for one day (this old hag was getting a mouthful the following morning that was for sure), Astica sat down obediently\u2026 for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was not what the brunette had expected, there was no fatty richness or sweet butters here, the food was heavy and sat in her stomach like a lead weight. It filled Astica up quickly as well, prompting quiet tut-tuts from the older woman with disapproval. Never one to fear a challenge, Astica would pick up the pace each time. This food was heavy, not fatty, she could eat plenty of this and not put on the kind of weight her new tent-buddy had swaddled around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Astica had eaten all she could, most of the plates were close to empty, but their contents were obvious to see in their new home. Astica\u2019s belly had domed like a woman with child, her tough girl-abs bent and warped into a more well-rounded shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well done.\u201d Olahvir commented, \u201cYou showed more promise than I initially thought. Now we shall retire for the night, the light has gone and we have much work tomorrow\u2026\u201d The matron then pointed to a part of the tent that was covered by a set of drapes, indicating where Astica would sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica huffed as she pushed herself upright, her balance slightly offset by her food-baby. Waddling awkwardly, the defiant young woman picked up her things and dragged them off to her quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hut had looked rustic on the outside, but the insides had all the comforts of a typical Norse home. Well-constructed wooden walls that reached high into the air, windows situated at the very top of said walls to keep the biting wind away from the occupant, and wooden beds covered in multiple furs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little else to do that night, Astica set her belongings in the corner (of which most consisted of various hunting weapons and a few changes of clothes), and got into bed. As she lay there, her hands ran up and down the bump in her middle and she pondered. Astica knew what parts of an animal made someone fat, she had done enough hunting with her father and brothers to know what\u2019s what\u2026 so why was tonight\u2019s meal so thick and heavy? They weren\u2019t going to make a whale out of her that way. At least not quickly, and she could easily burn off small amounts of blubber she would acquire through exercise in her quarters while the old woman wasn\u2019t watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, looked like things were going to go her way here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was the same as the previous night. Astica ate heavy low-fat meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The matron didn\u2019t seem to mind what she did either, so long as she remained inside the hut. The dark-haired girl had no desire to talk to this purveyor of archaic ideas, so entertained herself throughout the day. Exploring the hut, making carvings with her favorite hunting knife, and practicing her archery and axe-throwing skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was pretty much the same, and the next and the next. For several weeks in fact the routine was pretty much the same, heavy meals regularly and with no snacking in between. With Astica sneakily exercising every night to burn anything off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month though, there was finally a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressing in her leather skirt and fur-edged cuirass Astica left her quarters to not be greeted with the usual meats and vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s breakfast?\u201d Astica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so she speaks? Here I thought I was teaching a mute.\u201d Olahvir commented with a wry smile. \u201cNo we are done with the first part of your training, you are now to get your tattoos today, a sign of adulthood in a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat still didn\u2019t really answer why there was no food, but Astica shrugged, the less this crone concentrated on trying to turn her into a fat blob with mobility of a walrus on the beachside the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit.\u201d Olahvir commanded, patting a patch of fur rug in front of her and reaching for another rolled-up scrap of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Astica approached, the older woman unfurled the fur to reveal many tools, clearly for marking her with Nordic runes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like blue or black?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours, and many painful pinpricks later, Astica had been fully inducted as a Norse woman. Resplendent with an electric-blue tattoo ringing her neck, another around her right bicep and a third on her left thigh. She quite liked them, they added a splash of color to her usually brown-haired and light-skinned look. The Norse woman flexed her bicep, watching the blue lines shrink then thicken as she moved her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure they looked to the rest of the world as just zig-zags, but she liked them. Perhaps this silly hut wasn\u2019t all bad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Grrrooooooo</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Astica screamed, doubling over, the pain was unbelievable! It was like her stomach had been hit by a spear! She pressed her arms around her stomach to sooth it, and a rumbling came from within like a thunderstorm. Thankfully the rumbling died down, long enough for her to get a sentence out. \u201cWhat was that!?\u201d Astica asked, more a rhetorical question than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the fruit of our labors.\u201d Olahvir replied, rising for her feet and waddling away to a room at the back of the hut. Eventually she returned with a wooden tray, piled high with food. Astica didn\u2019t ask first, she just dived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach felt like it was eating itself it was so hungry, gurgling like a ravenous animal until the first morsel dropped into the angry pit. Astica barely registered what she was grabbing, so long as it was edible, she ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the food ran out, and her stomach began to calm down. By then, her caretaker had returned with another wooden tray overloaded with food. Still hungry, Astica began picking at it, glaring at Olahvir as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis food was different, comprised mostly of sweet meats and treats. Astica had never had much taste for the latter, but she knew about the meat, fatty stuff that had always been removed to save for her rotund mother\u2019s plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see in your eyes that you have questions.\u201d Olahvir continued. \u201cThe first part of a woman\u2019s stay here is to change her, to make her body more suited to her new size. You must not just look like a fat wife, you must be a fat wife from the inside out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn common tongue.\u201d Astica snapped between bites, tired of the woman\u2019s ramblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlahvir\u2019s nose curled distastefully. \u201cWe had to stretch your stomach, get you used to big meals, and make you hungry enough that eating all day will become normal. Even with just twenty-three months of your stay left, you should easily re-emerge five times your current size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica\u2019s brown eyes went wide. Olahvir had changed her body drastically, and possibly permanently. Her mind whirled and her eating slowed (met with a gurgling of her now-demanding stomach). There had to be something she could do, she would up her exercise, do it at every spare moment away from this crazy woman. There was <i>no</i> way she was going to be turned into someone\u2019s fat housewife!</span></div></div>",

After a month of arrogantly thinking that she could somehow negate or escape the effects of this \u201cfattening hut\u201d Astica found herself now unable to control herself. Her appetite was out of control, and her weight was out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she had got her tattoos, the food in the hut had switched from oversized and heavy to rich and fattening. Food that barely would have filled Astica before she came here, and now barely felt like snacks. Not to mention, the blasted matron kept food everywhere now. Instead of strict meals, Astica was tempted to eat all day, never feeling full, but constantly being well fed; and it was having a serious effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica was getting fat; the once strong and lithe woman had really filled out. Most of her new excess weight was stored in her stomach and thighs. Her firm girl-abs had been replaced with a large round stomach that sagged over her lap and ringed her skirts with thick lovehandles. Her thighs meanwhile were colossal, still strong as redwood trees, but now trying to mirror them in thickness. They were still somewhat firm, but were just so cumbersome. The rest of her hadn\u2019t shied away from excess fat as well; her breasts were bigger, her calves looked like they were merging with her ankles, and her arms were even bigger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ballooning Norse woman had always had big arms, but that was due to the musculature she had built up carrying game back home. Thankfully she could still see her large proud biceps, triceps and deltoids, but they had been coated in a layer of insulating blubber. Overall, Astica looked less like her old self, but not like the round sows that women leaving the hut normally looked like, instead she looked like a Norseman, but with breasts and a pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Astica was not happy about it, each day her exercises grew shorter and shorter, as her increasing size cut into her stamina like a knife. Eventually she wouldn\u2019t be able to fight back at all, and would succumb to the same fate as all other woman in her village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time didn\u2019t feel all that far away either. Astica had put on weight so quickly, it felt like witchcraft (she wouldn\u2019t put it past the old woman). She needed to do something, and quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next evening, after a day of trying (and failing) to stop herself snacking the daylight away, Astica returned to her living quarters. But instead of settling into her bed to sleep, Astica sat on her bed, hearing the wooden frame creak a little under her bulk. Then she waited; heard Olahvir plod her way to her own room, heard the older woman\u2019s bed creak as well, and then listened carefully for the tell-tale sounds of her snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Zzzzz*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking her things, Astica tightened the drawstring of her bag, threw it over her shoulder and tip-toed for the door. Her larger size made her feel ever so cumbersome, but there were no falls or mishaps. Her weight did not creak the floor, and the door was silent as she opened it and slunk out into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her new insulation, the fell North wind bit like a viper. It didn\u2019t help that Astica had stubbornly refused a change of outfit, preferring to wear her hand-made fur garments until they split. This left her looking as well dressed for the snow as a courtesan for pitched battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica couldn\u2019t go home, in fact she couldn\u2019t stay in the village at all, she would be ostracized for not going through with the ritual. There was only one option, to flee South and strike up a new life. Leaving her family behind, tears trickled down her round cheeks, freezing the moment they dropped from her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulky woman thankfully knew her way around the hunting grounds of the northlands pretty well, even in the dark. Her sense of direction would take her where she wanted to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no need to hide her tracks in the snow; once she hit the more open tundra the snow would dissipate and give way to frozen-solid earth. There would be no way even her girthy form would be able to make bootprints in that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several days Astica travelled South, out of the snowy forests into the wide tundra, all the while sustaining herself on food she had stowed away from the old woman\u2019s hut. Thankfully the icy temperature kept it from going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Astica reached denser forests again, lined with tall deciduous trees, she had a problem. It seemed that she had vastly underestimated her increased appetite, and food supplies that she had estimated would last a month had been used up within a week. While Astica would have loved to use being out in the wild as an opportunity to drop this weight, that would have to come later. She was already tired from all her walking and running, so stomach pains were not on her to-do list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Norse woman was not familiar with the berries that hung from the low branches, and was sure that some were poisonous. Plus, she was from the North, and northerners were hunters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her bow from the drawstring bag, Astica began to lay out a trap. She started by gathering as many of the berries that she could reach, delicately plucking them with her plump fingers so as not to burst them. And then laid a pile of them out in a clearing. Next step was to find somewhere to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally this would have been easy, when she was a sly slip of a thing. But feeling and looking like a boulder with arms and legs, Astica struggled with finding a spot. Eventually she found a bush large enough to hide her bulk in; it was a bit further than she liked from the trap, but so be it. It was down-wind of the trap, and she could make out the top of the clearing at least, it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the hard part, waiting on an empty stomach. For a while Astica thought that the sounds of her growling stomach would drive away every living thing for miles. But as she started to give up hope, there was a sound that made her ears prick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA branch breaking, something of a decent size had approached. Looking at the clearing, her eyes locked in a predatory glare, Astica saw a\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its fur was a dusty chocolate brown in color, lighter on the bell and down the nose, curled horns that rose up from her head, with a big bloated udder wobbling betwixt their hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing the air a little, the cow wandered over to the berries and began to sniff them too. Astica couldn\u2019t tell if the beast could smell if they were poisonous or not, either way it wouldn\u2019t stay still for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotching an arrow to her bow, Astica pulled back and thought to herself, \u201cNot your day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thud*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire should have kept away most predators, so Astica allowed herself a brief moment to relax as she ate her meal. She had learned long ago how to make fire with little more than a pair of sticks, so well-done beef was on the menu tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still taking a while to get used to her new appetite. She had subconsciously eaten way more of her kill than she thought, and what remained had to last her until she could find civilisation. But Astica would be encountering familiarity sooner than she imagined\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the heavyset woman indulged, a snap pricked her ears up; someone was approaching. Astica slid her fingers over to her hunting bow, pulling it closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well\u2026 what do we have here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was soft and feminine, and its owner just the same. Astica watched a tall lithe woman emerge from the undergrowth, and approach. She was dressed very oddly; a long single dress covered most of her figure, with a low cut going all the way to her navel and just barely covering the middle of each breast, while a long piece of fabric tied up the dress at her slim waist. A necklace of small bones hung from her neck, the central being a bird\u2019s skull, but the rest were unidentifiable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore nothing more though, not even a set of shoes. Her bare feet touching the ground\u2026 but something was off. With each stride the grass seemed to almost bend away from her before she even took a step on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask you the same\u2026\u201d Astica replied to the woman, keeping one hand to her bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you have to do that, then you clearly are not from around here\u2026\u201d The woman replied. She had an expression like a hungry wolf, and it worried the north-woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where is here exactly?\u201d Astica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman paced back and forth, her eyes never leaving Astica for a second. \u201cI call this place home, but to others this is the Bristleback Woods, just on the edge of Racovania, the North and Grobland.\u201d She then raised her hand in the air, catching a falling leaf. \u201cSuch a wonderous place, so rich with magic\u2026 but you haven\u2019t answered my question\u2026\u201d The woman\u2019s voice became cold and icy before she uttered her next sentence, \u201cand why have you killed my cow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica\u2019s blood ran as cold as the snow from her homeland. \u201cI was starving\u2026\u201d She answered, gesturing to her empty bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed. It was a horrible uncomfortable laugh that would give nobody pleasure to hear it. \u201cHohoho! You? Starving? A likely story; you are nearly as fat as my cow was!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t normally look like this!\u201d Astica fired back, grabbing a handful of flab and shaking it to illustrate her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer accuser though didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cAre you trying to say you are cursed? My child I sense no ill magic upon you, trust me\u2026\u201d The woman\u2019s gaze darkened and the air seemed to chill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica wanted to flee, but the woman was too quick. Raising one hand, roots erupted from the ground and held Astica\u2019s feet fast. \u201cGoing somewhere my dear?\u201d She sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Norse woman\u2019s heart was beating a mile a minute; \u201cWhat are you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a witch.\u201d The woman replied bluntly, tossing a lock of long black hair over her shoulder with her free hand, as the other remained raised to hold the vines still. \u201cI used to be a druid, but left their circle to study magic in the world. I set up a cottage here and the locals began to come to me to for cures, sage advice, all those sorts of things I could provide that was beyond a simple peasant's understanding. Meanwhile I can study magic in this quite fascinating area in peace. My cow supplied me with milk, and occasionally ingredients\u2026 but now you took her from me, without my permission.\u201d The witches\u2019 eyes narrowed again and she strode closer; \u201cso what price shall you pay for stealing from me?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Getting up was not so easy however, her more roly-poly build forced the Nordic lass to kinda roll sideways and heave herself up, bending at the middle was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching her bow up as got to her feet, Astica turned towards the witch. However, things had taken a turn\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch was now levitating! Or rather it looked like it, what had happened was that a large root had picked her up as a kind-of platform, and more roots were ripping themselves out of the undergrowth to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica\u2019s fight or flight instincts had kicked in\u2026 and swiftly shifted gears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBranches and twigs snapped as Astica\u2019s bulky body hurtled through the forest, running directly away from her pursuer. Occasionally she swore that a vine out of the corner of her eye tried to grab her, and so Astica kept running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her body was betraying her, strong as the young woman was, she was very heavy. Now more resembling a wrestler who had gone to seed, rather than a lithe hunter, there was no way Astica could keep up that pace forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica lumbered into another clearing, sweat coating her fat body like the film over a newt. Her strong hands clapped her knees as she doubled over, wheezing to catch her breath. But as she tried to gather her strength back, Astica spotted something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her gaze was turned towards the ground, her vision was filled with her big belly and fattened cleavage. It was then that she spotted a hair on one of her breasts, light brown and much longer than any hair should be. Astica had never worried about waxing, she had never been a hairy woman. But now wasn\u2019t the time to worry about appearances\u2026 or was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hair caught her eye, then another and another. As Astica stared, little brown hairs began to appear like crazy, sprouting from her pallid Northern skin. They coated her breasts like a carpet, before her eyes spotted them racing across her belly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock the brunette pulled her hands from her knees to feel the hair, check if it was even real, but something was going on there as well. Her fingernails were growing dull, turning dark gray. Not only that, but her little finger was shrinking until it vanished into her hand! Not to mention that weird hair was growing on her arms now, creeping across the back of her hands but leaving her palms bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me!?\u201d Astica screamed into the woodland air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d A sultry voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica turned around, distracted from her predicament, to see the witch approaching. Quite lazily as well; still smirking, she was clearly enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a curse dear.\u201d The witch continued. \u201cYou killed my cow, so I\u2019m making you my replacement\u2026 such a shame it began before I could take a look. Never used this curse before, wanted to study it in detail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReplacement!? Curse!?\u201d Astica spat, gripping her sides as a powerful pain gripped her body. The forest seemed to grow a bit smaller in Astica\u2019s eyes, but it was actually the reverse, she was getting bigger. Her body enlarging slightly, giving her extra inches in every direction, and tightening her fur clothes around her like a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Astica hadn\u2019t already figured out what the curse was doing to her, then she was about to get the clearest sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain gripped her head, as Astica saw her nose press into her field of vision, then start to widen into more of a square shape. All the while her nasal passage grew shiny and moist, leaving her with a stout muzzle. Up top, a pair of dark gray horns emerged from her head of dark-brown hair, curling into more of a yoke shape before stopping at about six inches in length each. Her ears seemed happy to join them elongating out and running part of the length of the horns as they became more diamond-shaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Astica, she could feel something slapping the back of her legs, signalling that her spine had elongated into a tail. Thick hair sprouted at the tip, matching the colour of the hair on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her boots, already straining under her increased size, erupted. The leather rupturing completely as a pair of gray/black hooves emerged, leaving Astica with just the leather and fur straps covering her calves left. But the strangest sensation yet was about to happen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica felt a weird presence in front of her tunic. It was like her tubby belly was growing a lump, a very sensitive lump. The Nordic woman couldn\u2019t see what was going on, but the sensitivity of this new organ was all too familiar; normally she would have called it a breast\u2026 but in her current condition she knew it to be a fat udder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the witch seemed to be having the time of her life. \u201cHaha! Oh my, dear you look such a mess\u2026 well don\u2019t worry, we will have you munching grass on all fours in no time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Astica noticed that the witch seemed to still be controlling the curse. Her hand that originally cast the spell was outstretched and moving, like a puppeteer. She had to do something, or else the rest of her life would be spent as some fat farm animal having her tits yanked by this horrible hag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica was still in pain, but she could still double over. Leaning forward, the brunette took off like a rocket, her new hooves granting her superb purchase on the dry woodland ground; aiming for horns directly at the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither the witch was not as fast as she thought, she had overestimated Astica\u2019s state or she had gotten too close. Either way, she found herself with two spikes slamming straight into her stomach, propelled by over four hundred pounds of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch flew backwards, hit a tree and fell into a crumpled heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica the now cow-woman was shocked, she had no idea she had that kind of strength. She was also no longer in pain, so clearly the curse had stopped progressing. But one look at her malformed hands indicated that it wasn\u2019t reversing any time soon. Before Astica could contemplated her situation any further though, she decided to make sure her foe had been dealt with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch was lying on her side, hair covering her face, and a growing red stain in the middle of her dress. Was she dead or just knocked out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly neither, as Astica saw the fingers on one of the witch\u2019s hands start to twitch. The transformed woman didn\u2019t really want to go another round, she might not be nice enough to turn Astica into just a cow if given the chance, Astica decided to use the free moments she had and tried to flee again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Astica crashed through the undergrowth once more, she had a much easier time of it. Her increased size had come with more muscle and stronger bones. She felt like a mammoth from her tundra homeland, easily smashing apart anything in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually stronger light broke through the canopy, signalling to Astica that she was nearing the edge of the woods. Hopefully there would be farmers or some of human habitation, anywhere she could hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred on by the thought of safety, Astica increased her speed, running at full tilt towards the light and freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinding light obscured Astica\u2019s vision for a moment as the darkness of the woods peeled away, revealing not rolling farmland\u2026 but a cliff edge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica tried to stop, but she had gathered too much momentum. She dug her hooves in, but still her heavy body had too much force. She reached the edge of the cliff, stumbled and felt the ground buckle beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there Astica could barely see what was going on. Her world span in front of her eyes as she tumbled down the steep cliff. Before finally coming to a sudden stop as she hit a fallen log; there was a blinding pain in her right leg before she lost consciousness.</span></div></div>",

As her eyes opened, her vison was swimming and blurry, nothing made sense. She remembered a cow\u2026 a cliff\u2026 some woods\u2026 <i>the witch</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica tried her best to move, swinging her arms around, when a pair of soft hands landed on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok dear, you\u2019re safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words comforted the Norse woman, they were soft and motherly, drawing back memories of the family she had left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her vision started to clear up, and she could take stock of her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-awake girl was not resting at the bottom of a ravine where she last was conscious, but instead was inside a wooden room. There were cabinets and drawers around, with small charming carved dolls resting on top. Small paintings dotted the wall, lit by the dappled light that shone through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeeling a little better there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstica was caught off-guard as the voice spoke again. Next to her bed, sitting on a stool, was a woman. She had long silvery-blonde hair, slightly ruddy skin from a life of toil, was just past middle age and her figure was rather stout and plump. For sure this was not the witch that had pursued Astica so doggedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you talk?\u201d The woman asked, leaning in with a warm smile. \u201cWe don\u2019t get minotaurs up here, do you speak common?\u201d Minotaur? What did she mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resting woman moved one of her hands, and saw the brown fur covering her skin, and the tough callused fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuuh\u2026 yes\u2026 I do\u2026\u201d Astica answered slowly, before raising her own question to the mystery woman. \u201cWh\u2026 where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot breaking her warm smile, she answered. \u201cYou\u2019re in the Gilded Dragon, part tavern part hostel, it\u2019s also my home. We run this place to help weary travellers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, me and my daughter, plus we have some more staff here.\u201d The woman could read on Astica\u2019s face that she was still uneasy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can stay here free of charge, especially after what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happen\u2026 *ARGH!*\u201d Astica tried to turn slightly to face the woman better, but was met with incredible pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t move\u2026 I was going to explain. We found you at the bottom of a cliff, your leg was in bad shape. We fixed you up as best we could and got the village healer to look you over, but it will take some time to recover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankyou\u2026\u201d Astica stated as she tried to make herself comfortable again. \u201cYou\u2019ve helped me so much, I don\u2019t even know your name\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonia.\u201d Her rescuer answered. \u201cIf you want, the rest of my little family would like to meet you, they have all been very worried you were not going to make it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like she owed Sonia, Astica didn\u2019t really want to say no. \u201cYes, that would be nice.\u201d She half-lied; in reality Astica just wanted to go back to sleep, to hope that this had all been some weird fever dream in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman nodded. \u201cGirls she\u2019s up!\u201d She called, trying to keep her voice down around Astica. First to open the door was someone Astica presumed was Sonia\u2019s daughter that she had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Katya.\u201d Sonia introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatya looked every bit a younger version of her mother. From her silver-less blonde hair to her slight roundness in the middle, indicating where she would inherit her mother\u2019s middle-aged-spread someday. One difference between them was a healthy smattering of freckles on Katya\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is\u2026\u201d Sonia began, as someone very different walked in through the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was quite a thin figure, and as he unwound his scarf, he revealed a short, red beard and a pair of piercing blue eyes. \"Cicifus' mind numbing hells, it is cold out there! I thought winter had broken!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has. This is spring,\" the old inn keeper chuckled. He was not as tall as the traveller, but far broader. His arms were thick with muscle, and as he took his coat, the traveller noted the thick callouses on the man's hands. \"I'll admit I'm somewhat shocked to see a peddler wandering the roads in this weather. I should warn you, you'll probably be stuck here for a time. This blizzard is a freak, tis true, but it'll melt soon enough, then the roads will be impassable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I'm just glad I made it,\" he said, trying and failing to blow a little warmth back into his hands. \"Can you set me up with a room and meals for the duration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly. What name should I put you under?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael Kensington. And don't worry about payment. I have both pepper and true silver. What about stabling for my mount?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be included, though you have to pay for the feed, naturally. My name's Ivan, by the way,\" the old innkeeper said as he hung Michael's coat. Ivan poured a slug of ale into a copper warmer, placing it on the fire. \"So what brings you so far from Roiling Bay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potential business. How did you know I was from the South?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the name,\" the keep said as he tested the temperature of the warming beverage. Satisfied, he poured it into a pewter tankard, and offered it to his guest. \"This should get some warmth back into your bones. And I wasn't always an innkeeper. In my younger years, I saw a lot of the world as a carpenter on various trading vessels. I reckon I've set foot in every port in this land at least once, and quite a few more then that. And the only place I ever heard names like yours was down in Roiling Bay, usually Cluny or Tuxley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael laughed, and took a sip of his drink. \"Well, you're spot on, mate. My family's from Cluny, and I moved to Tuxley about five or six years ago. Joined up with the Merchant Guild there, and barely been home since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was, of course, giving Ivan the extreme cliff notes version of what had actually brought him here. The young merchant had proven very successful in his chosen profession, and had even convinced the council of masters to allow him to travel to the far north to establish trade with (what he assured them was) this rather rich and untapped realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been the new Prince, Anya, who had invited him, of course. The two had met in Adinah, her an academically poor foreign student with an atrocious accent, and him a new merchant apprentice who spent more time getting his superiors tea then doing anything constructive. The two had quickly become fast friends, and though their association was short, the two had kept in touch, frequently sending letters between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last several months, Anya's letters had all but dried up, Then, out of the blue, he'd received a heavily encoded and multi-page document, written in Anya's heavy handwriting. It had taken him almost three days to decode it, and was shocked upon its contents. She'd listed off the death of her father by an unknown assassin; the murder of her siblings by her brother, Sergei; her overthrow of Sergei in turn, and her struggles with her new court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd ended it by inviting Michael to come to Novograd, capital of the Meshcheri. Beyond being a good excuse to see each other again, she also promised a sizable business opportunity, one that would benefit both the guild and her realm, as well as making both of them quite wealthy. Michael had been quite intrigued, and sent back his own coded message stating he'd arrive in the spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this, of course, brought the tanned southerner to where he now sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your travels have certainly taken you far, then,\" the old man chuckled. \"Well, I have an early day tomorrow, so I shall leave you for the night. My wife and son are in the kitchen. They'll see to your room and food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much obliged, Ivan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's no need to thank me. You're paying for it, after all.\" And with that, the old keep wandered off, leaving Michael sipping his piping hot beer, wondering what tomorrow's meeting would bring. </span></div></div>",

She already hated being bartered off, why did she have to suffer this boredom on top of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dismissed this latest one with as much pleasantry as she could muster, and sure enough, her father came to her shortly.  King Orym was a tall, slight man with a great long, thin beard that trailed nearly to his waist. He was a kind and fair ruler, but sometimes he was a dense father if he couldn't see his only daughter's misery at the thought of having to marry so soon. In truth, he loved Dhasca more than anything. She was his oldest child, and his only daughter. She was beautiful and reminded him so much of his late wife. How could he not want the best for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my beautiful flower, surely today you found the right one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca had to play this just right. On the one hand, she couldn't outright tell him the truth, because then he would take her marriage into his own hands. On the other, she couldn't lie and commit herself to a life of misery. \"They were nice,\" she managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But just not the right one,\" her father finished, knowing his daughter better than that. For now, he had attributed all these rejections to his daughter just being picky. \"We'll find one soon. Don't you worry. By the next harvest festival, you'll have your wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" Dhasca said, lying between her teeth. \"I look forward to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was, she knew almost instantly who she would marry if she had the chance. But her father would never approve, and so she was stuck meeting them in secret, which was what she was planning on doing right now. She let out a fake yawn. \"Well, father, I'm quite tired. I think I'll go to sleep for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyebrows raised in surprise. \"Are you sure? Did you not want to at least eat dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not all that hungry.\" She just wanted to be alone to sneak away, and he was keeping her here with these silly questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, goodnight.\" He kissed the top of his daughter's forehead and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect. Dhasca waited until his footsteps could no longer be heard, and slipped away. She went to their usual meeting spot: the spring deep in the forest. While beautiful and a great source of water, it was quite out of the way and farther out than the other springs. This meant they would have their privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already nightfall when she arrived, but she saw no sign of them yet. She sat by the edge of the water, admiring the luminescent plants nearby. She started undoing her braids, letting her hair cascade down over her shoulders, and hummed. Not only was she the princess, she was known for having the most beautiful singing voice. Music could always heal her stresses, her mother had taught her when she was just a girl. That was true, though there was someone else who could also do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was starting to wonder when you would come,\" a voice said behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual,\" Dhasca replied, \"father had more suitors for me to meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you think of them?\" they asked, trying to feign worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but they're not nearly as wonderful as you.\" They sat down beside her, as she said this, looking deep into their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed. \"Good, because I don't know what I'd do if you found someone else more attractive than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never think such a thing,\" she said, leaning in to kiss them. \"I love only you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, Dhasca laid back on the grass, panting, but content. \"I needed this,\" she said. \"Father says he wants to marry me off before the next harvest festival. I just needed to be with you, to forget all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lay down beside her, enjoying the basking in the afterglow of their lovemaking. \"Really? That soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sighed. \"I don't want it to happen, but he's getting persistent. I fear I'll have no choice. What am I to do? If I tell him about us, I fear he will not only refuse, but do something horrible like banish you. I can't even bear to think about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey threw their arm around her waist, their hand rubbing her gently to sooth her nerves. They hated to see her worry. \"Well, I might have an idea of how to fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca was now very curious. She rolled over to look her lover in the eyes. Any idea would do at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is Dhasca's lover a man or a woman? You decide.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nilmini had her usual impish smile, the same smile that could make Dhasca melt instantly. Nilmini was the daughter of the royal healer, and they had known each other since childhood. In truth, she had been the princess' only friend as her father kept her fairly sheltered, and Dhasca didn't relate all that much to her younger brothers. Nilmini understood her in a way that others could not, and as they got older, their friendship became something more. At first, it was only the two of them experimenting with their feelings, but it had felt so right in that moment that they had never parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a tall, slightly taller than Dhasca, and broad-shouldered girl with a young and playful face. She was also a known trickster, who liked to play by her own rules. Unlike most elves, Nilmini had decided to chop off most of her hair when she was a young woman, much to the ire of her father. It had grown back, somewhat, into a messy pixie-cut. It gave her a boyish look that Dhasca loved very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca brushed the olive-colored skin of her lover's arm. \"Please, tell me,\" she said. \"I'm desperate at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini was perhaps the stronger of the two personalities. She had been the first to confess her love, and would have been willing to openly admit it, if it weren't for the begging of Dhasca to keep it a secret. Much as she did love her, her father would never approve. With Nilmini, there was no way of producing heirs; it was just simple biology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini only smiled again and straddled Dhasca, playfully pinning her down. She was not only the stronger personality, but the stronger one physically. As daughter to a healer, she had always been fairly strong and physically fit, not that Dhasca wasn't, but she was more on the thin and waif-like side. If there was one thing the princess loved the most, it was being held in those strong, protective arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these suitors only like you because of your rumored beauty and your singing voice,\" Nilmini began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumored?\" Dhasca scoffed, feigning anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, you're the most gorgeous creature I know, but these guys only get to hear about it. Look, let's say that maybe you didn't live up to their expectations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini nuzzled her neck as she said this, sending a tingle down Dhasca's spine. Still, her words did not make sense. \"What do you mean?\" she asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lover only shrugged, running her hands down Dhasca's sides and stopping at her hips. \"Well, if you weren't as attractive as they were expected to believe, then maybe it would be they who turn you down. There's nothing your father can do about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did make sense, she thought. If she was the one being rejected, rather than having to reject them, he would have to allow her to do as she pleased. It was tempting. \"And just how am I supposed to make myself unattractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"Well, while that is going to be pretty hard to do, it's not like you can just stop bathing or fixing your hair. Your father would make you change all that back in an instant. We need something that's more...permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca felt a little nervous. This didn't sound at all encouraging. \"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini rolled her eyes, realizing that hinting at it was getting nowhere. She sat up, and let her hands gently graze Dhasca's thin stomach. \"Perhaps if you were a little...well, larger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sat up, and the two elves were looking directly into each other's eyes. Was she hearing what she thought she heard. \"You mean...get fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, these conceited losers only want a thin and beautiful princess they can parade around like a trophy. Once they see that that's off the table, they'd have to reject you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess let Nilmini get off of her, and then bunched her knees to her chest. Something about this didn't feel right. She wanted to make herself smaller in this moment, and almost laughed realizing the irony, given what had been said. \"Something wrong with that?\" Nilmini asked, feeling like she had offended her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it just feels like such an odd thing to do. It's not exactly, normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, it's not, but then, these aren't normal circumstances,\" Nilmini said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you still love me?\" She asked that so suddenly, and covered her mouth as soon as it escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca took a deep breath. \"I mean, you're talking about making me unattractive. Would you still find me attractive if I was...well, fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini scooted up closer and put her arms around her partner. \"You kidding? I would always love you, no matter what you looked like or what size you were. I'm just talking about what these other guys would think. To me, you could never be anything less than beautiful, inside and out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tears in her eyes as she wrapped herself around her lover. \"Thank you,\" was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini held her for a moment, but then laughed again. \"Besides, I think you could use a little more meat on your bones.\" She playfully, and unsuccessfully, tried to grab at any body fat the girl might have. The princess really was a twig of a girl. \"I can never say no to having more of you to love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Dhasca feel better and she laughed too. \"So, how is this supposed to work?\" she asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini waved her off. \"Easy,\" she said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll still eat normally around your father and the elders, and just eat extra when you\u2019re with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis still felt odd, and a bit frightening to Dhasca. She was about to agree to a life-altering idea, and it just didn't feel right. \u201cI suppose,\u201d she said tentatively. \u201cAre you sure this will work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini stood, starting to put her clothes back on. She shrugged. \u201cDunno. I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure it will, but can\u2019t know for sure. If it doesn\u2019t, at least we tried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca also stood up, meeting her at eye level. \u201cEasy for you to say. I\u2019m the one who will have consequences if it doesn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lover smiled, and pulled her in for a kiss. As she stood back, she said with a laugh, \u201cYou\u2019ll have consequences even if it does, but I\u2019ll still be in love with you all the same. So, tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes, crossing her arms. She hated how much Nilmini spoke so dismissively about it all. Dhasca was also trying to hide her nerves. \u201cSo soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers fidgeted nervously, looking to Nilmini. She only turned around and grinned with a seductive smile. \u201cThat\u2019s never stopped you from sneaking out to meet me almost every night before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca nodded, silently agreeing. This wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as Nilmini was making it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout the next day Dhasca could hardly concentrate. She was too busy thinking about seeing Nilmini again that night. There had often been days where her thoughts of her secret lover prevented her from going about her day, but this time it was for entirely different reasons. Her hand rested on her flat stomach as she thought about what was to transpire very soon. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, my beautiful little flower?\u201d her father asked, as he stood before her. \u201cYou have hardly eaten breakfast. Are you unwell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hadn\u2019t really noticed the plate of food before her, nor had she really been paying attention to the conversation around the table as her father had been speaking with the elders. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026there\u2019s just a lot I\u2019ve been thinking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father nodded, seeming to understand. \u201cI just hope I haven\u2019t been pressuring you too much about this wedding,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that what\u2019s troubling you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Dhasca wanted desperately to tell him the truth, and was just about to. Maybe she could avoid this whole situation all together. Now was her chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, I don\u2019t want you to feel that you have to pick the \u2018perfect\u2019 mate,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cAny one of the men who has attempted for your hand would be just fine. They are all quite suitable, and I would not mind any one over the other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still forcing her into it, and there was no letting up, Dhasca realized. She would have no choice; Nilmini was right. \u201cAnyway, we can\u2019t have you wasting away like this over worry,\u201d her father continued. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to be in good health if you intend to have children with your new mate soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas everyone in a conspiracy to see her waistline expand, she wondered? She inwardly groaned. \"Thank you, father,\" she said through gritted teeth. \"I won't trouble myself too much over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it did not seem like it, Nilmini worried too. She had always prided herself on being forthright and honest with Dhasca almost all the time, but there was one thing that she hadn't been honest about. Nilmini had always known she was different from an early age. She figured out pretty soon that she liked girls over boys, long before Dhasca figured out what she liked herself. More importantly, she knew she had peculiar \"tastes\" in girls. It was therefore ironic when she had fallen for the small and thin Dhasca, and that irony was not lost on her one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the challenge of it that thrilled her. Nilmini had never once shared her secret desire with Dhasca, for fear of what she might say, and her reaction last night validated some of those fears. When the opportunity presented itself, Nilmini thought she was a genius. She had introduced the idea in a natural, logical, and subtle way, she thought. But Dhasca's own fears, brought out some of Nilmini's with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be worth it, if Dhasca didn't love herself as she was, and that was the main fear in the back of Nilmini's mind. Dhasca didn't see the same beauty she did. She wouldn't see how much Nilmini still appreciated and loved her. If she hated herself, Dhasca would never understand, and quite possibly, never forgive Nilmini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what if it didn't work? What if that didn't stop this marriage her father was planning? What if it was all for nothing? Then what? Oh, sure, Nilmini would have had her fun, but then poor Dhasca would still wind up miserable not only with someone she didn't love but in a body she couldn't love either. Plus, she would hate to lose the woman she loved, and after they had tried so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she hurt Dhasca? That thought crossed her mind several times. Nilmini had never done this before, had never lived even one second of her own fantasy. She didn't know what she was doing. What if she made Dhasca sick forcing her to eat too much? What if she got sick from these sudden changes? What if...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she had to stay on the positive side. She would do everything to make sure Dhasca was fine. She knew how to be cautious, contrary to what others thought of her usual impulsiveness. She would make sure Dhasca felt loved every second of every day, no matter the size. She could do this. And maybe, just maybe, she could reveal how she secretly desired this all along to Dhasca, but only when the time was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loaded up the last of her supplies, and ran off to the woods.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This isn\u2019t a typical night for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini laughed, sitting down on a nearby rock. Dhasca sat beside her nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I suppose not,\u201d Nilmini said. \u201cBut look, if you go into this with a bad attitude, then yeah, it\u2019s going to be bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sighed and nodded, and Nilmini smiled back, grabbing the sack. \u201cNow, I wasn\u2019t sure what sort of things you like most, so I brought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes nearly bugged out. She had never seen so much food in one place. \u201cGods, Nilmini, where did you get all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \u201cI have my ways.\" A look from the princess told her she had better explain herself. \"Okay, so I may have gone on a few scouting raids. You'll never believe what sort of stuff humans eat. And hey, I\u2019m not expecting you to eat it all tonight. You tell me when you hit your limit, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose. Hey, is that an annoricot?\u201d Dhasca said, pointing at a round, red fruit in the bag. \"Wait, you said this was human food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini pulled it out. \u201cMost of it is anyway. Some stuff I just grabbed, like this. Didn\u2019t know you liked them. This is kinda nice. I feel like I\u2019m getting to know different things about you.\u201d She hoped that by making small talk and flirting with her lover, that would help put her at ease, and perhaps distract her from the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca took the fruit and bit into it. She always did love the sweet, ripe taste. \u201cYeah, they were always one of my favorites. When I was little, I could never reach them on the trees. I always had to beg one of my brothers to climb up and get one. Wasn\u2019t too hard, since I was older and could kinda boss them around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a big climber?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, too scared of heights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini continued to converse with Dhasca as she ate. And Dhasca ate pretty well, taking the different things her lover offered. A few time, she didn\u2019t even need coaxing. For a little bit, they discussed the oddities of food found from the raids. Humans sure liked to eat meat, they learned; not exactly a comfortable situation for them. Still, there were some good things to be found. Their version of bread was much softer and fluffier than the hard crust they could come up with. And despite the odd feeling of seeing so much slaughtered animal meat in there, they had to admit that humans did have a good way of flavoring venison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you sure did come with an appetite tonight,\u201d Nilmini commented, after they had been there for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of,\u201d Dhasca replied. \u201cI was so nervous about coming here tonight, I didn't really eat all that much today. Besides, I think my father isn\u2019t going to be too opposed to your plan either. He seems to want me putting on weight, at least for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Nilmini\u2019s eyebrows raised, thinking their plan was already going to be bust. \u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, something about me needing to be ready to have kids and everything. I\u2019m too skinny for that apparently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini smiled. As a healer\u2019s daughter, she had done a fair share of midwifery, which may or may not have helped \u201cawaken\u201d her interests. \u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t hurt for that,\u201d she answered. \u201cCourse I don\u2019t think he means for you to get all that big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca laughed. \u201cNot like what we\u2019re planning, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad the princess was starting to take a more light-hearted view of the situation. \u201cYeah.\u201d She then sighed, feeling a little down. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m always going to regret about our relationship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca\u2019s hand touched her shoulder. \u201cWhat is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only gave her a half-smile. \u201cIf this all works out, and your dad finally lets me marry you, I\u2019ll never be able to give you children. Look, I don\u2019t know if you would\u2019ve wanted any, but you would\u2019ve been a great mother, and I feel bad taking that opportunity away from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca wrapped her in an embrace, and Nilmini could no longer hold back tears. She was never one for big shows of emotion, but when it came to Dhasca, she was much more willing to open up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she answered. \u201cSure, it would\u2019ve been nice at some point in my life, but there are more important things, like you. Nilmini, if that were ever a problem, I wouldn\u2019t be here with you right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini wiped her tears. \u201cThanks. It really is too bad though, you would\u2019ve looked cute with a little baby bump.\u201d She poked Dhasca\u2019s middle, which looked a tad swollen and full. Nilmini resisted the urge to outright start touching it. She didn't want to also talk about her big secret, not yet, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed it gently. \u201cI\u2019m actually feeling pretty full,\u201d she answered with a grimace. \u201cStarting to hurt. Can we call it a night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot, just yet,\u201d Nilmini said, leaning them both back onto the ground. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, there\u2019s another reason we come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca giggled as she slowly got her cloak off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dhasca found herself enjoying her nights with Nilmini more since they had started this little scheme. Sure, at first it had been pretty awkward, and neither was sure what to do, but it had gotten better, and felt more like a normal routine to them. Nilmini was incredibly attentive to Dhasca during this time, and she rather liked the extra special attention. She also enjoyed it when Nilmini would rub and caress her stomach after she was full. She never realized that her lover could be even more sensual to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was nothing compared to their other intimate exchanges. Dhasca couldn\u2019t figure it out, but she felt as though Nilmini had become more passionate and vigorous since they had started this experiment. Not that she was complaining, but it was\u2026odd, she thought. Here she was getting fatter on purpose, and Nilmini seemed to love her more. Either her girlfriend was very good at lying to her and telling her how much she loved her, or it was something else. She did not pay it too much mind though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s getting softer,\u201d her lover said, bringing her out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini gently pinched at Dhasca\u2019s sides as they lay in the grass together after their latest session. Indeed, their plan was somewhat working. The elven princess was starting to get a little bigger. She had once inspected herself in the mirror back at home to see the damages. Sure enough, her dress clung a little tighter to her, though it would take much longer before that loose-fitting dress would become too snug for her. Her high cheekbones had become rounder, and she did have a certain glow about her, but most of her new weight was settling in her lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t much, but she could see her thighs had widened a bit, and her sides were starting to show. Most prominent of all was the taut, rounder belly she was sporting. She had poked and played with it some, having a hard time believing this was what she really looked like now. Nilmini had described her as pear-shaped, or something like that, and that was becoming more apparent. She probably would never have known this about herself, had none of this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini pulled Dhasca closer as she spoke again. \u201cAnd are these soon-to-be love-handles I\u2019m going to get to enjoy?\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe playfully swatted her away, her face turning a light shade of red. \u201cStop, I\u2019m already a little self-conscious about it anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be. You\u2019re still the most beautiful creature I know.\u201d She started rubbing Dhasca\u2019s full stomach that way she always liked. The princess stretched and turned around so that Nilmini had a better reach. \u201cBesides, not like it\u2019s much for anyone to take notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, then we\u2019d better get busy before my father picks a suitor for me,\u201d Dhasca said in a sleepy yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini sat up, a wicked grin on her face. \u201cI was thinking the same thing. Look, I gotta be at the palace tomorrow anyway. Dad\u2019s trying to deal with that epidemic and needs to be out among the tribe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re still getting sick?\u201d Dhasca had heard about the other elves starting to contract human diseases and suffering horribly without immunity to those diseases. It did worry her very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not seem to worry Nilmini. That was one of the things Dhasca liked about her most: she could always put her mind at ease. \u201cDad\u2019s the best healer; he can handle it. Anyway, that means I\u2019ll be taking over his duties over at the palace for a couple days\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to have you around,\u201d Dhasca said, not catching on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that you\u2019ll be \u2018sick\u2019 tomorrow. Not too sick, but ill enough that maybe you need to stay in bed for a couple days to rest, and get plenty to eat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNilmini, give it a rest,\u201d Dhasca sighed in frustration. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just have a couple days to enjoy having each other around? Why does it always have to be about this? Besides, it\u2019s too risky. What if someone catches us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \u201cNo one is going to catch us. You worry too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini rested her hands on Dhasca\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLook, it\u2019s no different than what we do here. You said it yourself, we kind of are on a schedule here, and we could use a little bit of a boost. No one will catch us. And besides, I think a little risk makes it all the more interesting.\u201d Her fingers were tickling Dhasca up and down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had also said all this in her seductive voice, which Dhasca knew she couldn\u2019t resist for long. She rolled her eyes and sighed, \u201cFine, but this had better not be the whole of how I spend these couple of days with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll treat you like the princess you are. So, let's see if we can get you good and fat before next harvest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini gasped, mortified that she had said that out loud. Dhasca blushed. \"I'm sorry,\" Nilmini started to say. \"I didn't mean that... I was just trying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I know what you mean. I just hope this plan works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini settled back down beside her. That had been a close call, she thought. She still wasn't ready to tell the princess her secret desires just yet. After all, she was only starting to get used to these changes herself. Still, the young elf couldn't resist. It was like a dream coming true. She let her hands explore Dhasca's new softness tenderly, and she desired the day when she would get even softer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had certainly been sleeping so much better since her and Nilmini\u2019s \u201cexperiment.\u201d Going to bed with a full stomach probably played no small part in that. It therefore took a few minutes for her to get fully woken up. Sitting up, she already saw Nilmini. \u201cReally? You couldn\u2019t wait that long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini shrugged. \u201cSorry, just wanted to see you that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess only shook her head, giving her a look. \u201cUh huh, and it has nothing to do with all this?\u201d She was gesturing to the large tray of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only gave a sheepish look. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t enjoy the day on an empty stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca shook her head. \u201cOf course, silly me. Nilmini, I don\u2019t think I can eat all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been paying attention these past few nights. Your appetite has grown since we started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, knowing that there was a purpose to all of this, even if she didn\u2019t like it. And if it wasn't enough, her stomach betrayed her by letting out a growl. \u201cWell, it does smell good, and I am kind of hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca couldn\u2019t complain too much when she knew that the food was good. And Nilmini always had a way of making her feel comfortable, whether it was with conversation to take her mind off of things, or her romantic advances. Her lover only left a few times during the morning to tend to a few requests at the palace, but stayed with her almost the entire day. It took several hours, but unbelievably to Dhasca, she had somehow managed to eat the entire breakfast prepared for her. However, her stomach did feel painfully stuffed as a result. She wanted to stand up for just a minute after having spent the whole morning in bed, but found herself pinned down by the sudden change to her center of balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how to fix that,\u201d Nilmini said, leaning Dhasca back onto her bed so that she could be more comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca practically purred when Nilmini\u2019s hands set to rubbing her belly. At first, it felt a little rough, and made it hurt only more, but strangely, it was a good pain. It soon turned very sensual, as Nilmini would be kissing her all the while. She hated to admit it, but this was the best part of this whole experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, feels pretty warm,\u201d Nilmini commented, massaging near her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cItches too,\u201d Dhasca added, moving Nilmini\u2019s hands closer to the sides of her stomach. She moaned a little when Nilmini's hands started rubbing the right spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I actually didn\u2019t think you would eat it all. So, not bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca almost didn\u2019t realize she had fallen asleep. It was only as she groggily stirred in the afternoon that she became aware of it. Nilmini was gone, and probably off on another call for a while. She would be back soon, she reasoned. Meanwhile, Dhasca took to exploring the new inches that had been added to her. Her stomach was still quite full, but it didn\u2019t feel as bad as when she had just finished eating. Her belly was still somewhat bulging and tight, but there was a certain softness to it. She liked the way her hand gently glided across the curve of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if she ate like this every day, it would certainly not go unnoticed by her suitors, and most likely her father. What was he going to say once he realized something was up? What if he figured it out and found some way to make her stop, or prevent her from seeing Nilmini again? She didn't want to think of that possibility. She had to focus on their plan now. It had to work, it just had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and there was Nilmini with\u2026even more food. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Dhasca groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini shrugged. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s just to tide you over for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNilmini, I\u2019m still pretty full from earlier. I don\u2019t think-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, you can probably get a little in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held a steaming flavored bread in front of Dhasca. This didn\u2019t feel right, but Dhasca had to trust that Nilmini knew what she was doing. She tried eating what she could, but found that she was going at a much slower rate than before. It was a lot harder to eat when she was already full. The pain was starting to get worse. The itch on her stomach almost felt like her skin would tear at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think I can eat anymore,\u201d Dhasca said, struggling between words to breathe. She had to lay back to give her stomach room as it stuck straight up, moving heavily with each labored breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmin didn\u2019t seem to hear her, she was so lost in her own fantasy. \u201cOh, come on, one more bite? Maybe another rub will help while you eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca finally had to take charge. She pushed Nilmini\u2019s hand away. \u201cI said no!\u201d she said shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini was a little taken aback. \u201cDhasca\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dhasca said again, even more forcefully. Her belly quivered, stuffed far beyond her limits. She clutched at it and turned away from Nilmini. \u201cJust, go away right now, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nilmini felt horrible. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d she said in a hoarse whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, go away. You haven\u2019t been listening at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and turned around to leave. Nilmini had gone and done the one thing she had feared she would do during this whole experience: she had hurt the woman she loved.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nilmini sucked in a breath. She was standing in front of Dhasca\u2019s door the very next morning, trying to work up the courage to knock. She hadn\u2019t slept at all last night, and she had a pretty good feeling that Dhasca probably didn\u2019t sleep well either. All night, Nilmini had been going over the day before over and over again, and no matter how she tried to see it, she had been to blame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had pushed the woman she loved too much, and now Dhasca probably hated her. She had hoped that what they were doing would have started out of necessity, but that it would have eventually become something to bond them closer together. She had hoped that she would have come to love it, even welcome it. Instead, she had thrown that out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting her teeth, Nilmini finally tapped on the door. Several heartbeats, which felt like hours to her, she finally heard Dhasca\u2019s voice call out in a frustrated sigh, \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, she already knew who it was, and she was still mad. It was going to have to take everything she had to speak without breaking down. Dhasca was still getting dressed, and upset as she was, Nilmini couldn\u2019t help stealing a glance at her lover\u2019s soft belly, which was now really starting to round out. She also couldn\u2019t help but notice the two new, red, angry-looking stretch marks that had formed just to the left of Dhasca\u2019s belly button. <i>I did that</i>, Nilmini thought, <i>I\u2019m such a monster</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca noticed Nilmini\u2019s look and curtly nodded to her, acknowledging that they both knew. She let the rest of the dress fall into place, covering the evidence of what had happened yesterday. Finally, Dhasca looked at Nilmini, crossing her arms. \u201cWell, are you going to speak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini only mouthed a few syllables before finding her voice. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Dhasca, really sorry. I never meant to hurt you, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you promised that I had control in this. You promised I could decide my limits. You promised me that I would not be harmed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini was practically in tears. So much for trying to hold it together. \u201cI know, and I can understand if you don\u2019t forgive me for it, but Dhasca, please understand, I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen. I just\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lost control,\u201d Dhasca said, sitting beside her. \u201cThe fact that you thought you had control is what scares me, Nilmini. What do you see me as in all of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stung, but she deserved it, Nilmini knew. She had stopped seeing Dhasca as a person, a person she loved, and she hated herself for it. \u201cDhasca, you\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ll ever love, and I should\u2019ve treated you better. I love you more than anything, and I should have treated you like I do. And I promise it won\u2019t happen again. Heck, I\u2019d understand if you want to stop altogether.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sat silent for a few minutes, as if mulling over what she was going to say. Nilmini continued to sob softly. Biting her lip, wondering if she\u2019d regret it, Dhasca finally spoke. \u201cThis is something you like, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis.\u201d She gestured to her larger frame. \u201cYou find this sort of thing arousing, don\u2019t you? I guess I should\u2019ve figured it out sooner. The way you\u2019d look at me, rub my stomach, I should\u2019ve seen it. Yesterday, in your eyes, I finally saw it though. You\u2019re attracted to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not going at all how Nilmini had planned. Her heart was slamming against her chest. \u201cUm, yeah, I wanted to tell you, but I didn\u2019t know how you\u2019d take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, when you suggested this idea\u2026was it because of this excitement you get from it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini knew where this was going. \u201cWell, sort of. I mean, I wanted to help out, of course, and I still think this plan would. But, you know, it had a few added perks for me.\u201d Dhasca gave her a cross look. \u201cBut I should have told you sooner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca ran a hand over the curve of her stomach, letting her hand squeeze its softness for a moment, and sighed. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve wanted me bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed the princess\u2019 hands, becoming reassuring almost immediately. \u201cDhasca, don\u2019t think I would love you any less if you weren\u2019t. What I said that night, that I\u2019d love you no matter what size\u2026I meant it, I really did. I won\u2019t love you any more if you get bigger, and I won\u2019t love you any less if you\u2019re smaller. I love you more than the world itself, and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca smiled and rested her head against her lover\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said decisively, \u201cbut promise me I won\u2019t get hurt again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Nilmini said, holding her close. \u201cAbsolutely. So\u2026you mean you\u2019re still up for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elven princess took a few deep breaths, as if thinking over her final answer. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, I think knowing now that you like it, I\u2019ve got a new motivation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini pulled Dhasca off her shoulder and made sure they were eye to eye. \u201cYou sure? Remember, you don\u2019t have to do this. I\u2019ll still love you no matter what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but if I know that it means I\u2019m going to have a more\u2026intimate relationship with you, then I think I can learn to enjoy it.\u201d She took Nilmini\u2019s hands and pressed them onto her wider sides. \u201cBesides, I think it\u2019s made me a lot softer to cuddle, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini flashed her a wicked grin. \u201cYou bet it has.

She rather liked the thrill of climbing in through her lover\u2019s window. It put a new \u201cforbidden\u201d element to their romance. \u201cMmm, I like the feel of those hips right now,\u201d Nilmini muttered, \u201cand am I mistaken, or does your chest feel softer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca had taken a more positive attitude to putting on weight, and rather liked coyly tempting her lover with it. She would occasionally tease her by telling her how her clothes were starting to feel tighter. Or she would guide Nilmini's hands to explore her new padding. It hadn\u2019t been terribly long since they had started this plan, but she was starting to look a little plump already. While most of the weight was settling to her lower half, some other areas were starting to catch up. \u201cMaybe a little,\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini took a pinch near her ribs. \u201cPretty soon, I\u2019m not going to be feeling these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swatted her hand away. \u201cOne step at a time. I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door. Dhasca bolted up. \u201cQuick, hide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already pushing Nilmini off the bed before she could offer protest. \u201cBut-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time!\u201d Dhasca said, shoving her under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, her father entered her room. Dhasca desperately hoped her father wouldn\u2019t see the flush to her cheeks, or notice the edge of Nilmini\u2019s boot sticking out from under the bed. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, bowing. \u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king kissed his daughter\u2019s cheek. \u201cWonderful news, my beautiful little flower, but that can wait. Were you talking to someone just now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart thundered in her chest. \u201cN-no. I was just\u2026practicing my singing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, approving. \u201cA wonderful idea. You do have a marvelous voice.\u201d As he embraced her, though, he stopped when he noticed something was different. \u201cIs that a new dress?\u201d he asked, trying to figure it out. \u201cIt feels different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca was tempted to chuckle, knowing what probably felt different. \u201cFather, you said you had news,\u201d she said, trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, and looked rather pleased. \u201cYou\u2019ll never believe it. There are several new suitors who have traveled far to ask for your hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca became alarmed. \u201cNew? From where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it, far from the Verge. I don\u2019t know how, but they\u2019ve all come, having heard of your incredible beauty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started thinking on this. This was not at all how their plan was supposed to go. \u201cFar from the Verge, but that would mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d her father said ecstatically. \u201cThey\u2019re not elves. Now, I\u2019ll admit, my dear, I was a little unsure of the idea myself. Humans are a very fickle bunch, you know. But after some important discussions, I'm willing to give them a try. You should have seen Elder Lorsan's face when I said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey must think he's crazy, Dhasca thought. Until now, they had been pretty wary of the humans. Elder Lorsan had even disowned his own daughter when he found out she had married one. This couldn't be going over too well. Then again, her father did have the crazy notion to marry her off, so maybe he was losing his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father continued, \"They are very similar to us. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d have a great deal of trouble conceiving with them, especially the humans. The thing is, some of these men, are some of the most illustrious among humankind. Imagine it! They want to forge an alliance with our people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to babble on, but Dhasca ceased to hear him. Humans! And gods know what else! They were seeking her hand, but how? Why? Her mind was still reeling when she heard her father said. \u201cNow, I want no argument about it. Take a few minutes to get ready, and I expect you in the great hall to greet them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left, leaving Dhasca to try and process what was going on. Nilmini scrambled out from under the bed. \u201cOh, Nilmini, this is terrible,\u201d Dhasca said, fretting nervously. \u201cHow could this have happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was grateful to have Nilmini to give her a reality check. \u201cLook, this is fine. It changes nothing. I hear humans are more conceited than us. They start to see how large you\u2019re getting, and they\u2019ll take away those offers pretty quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca looked at her frame. True, she was starting to round out more. \u201cNilmini, yes, I have grown, but I\u2019m not really all that big. Healthy, and possibly plump, but not really something that would automatically be rejected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, you\u2019re what\u2026weighing eleven stone now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little under that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini looked her over, thinking about it. \u201cOkay, so not exactly huge, but trust me, they\u2019ll be a little less interested when they see the appetite you\u2019ve developed. No lord or king or whatever\u2019s going to want a wife that\u2019ll eat him out of house and home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re making this sound so wonderful,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t eat all that much, more than I used to, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, we have nothing to worry about.\u201d Nilmini started leading her to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering into her father\u2019s hall, she was actually surprised to find that there were more than just a few new guests she would be entertaining. Just how had all these people found them, and even stranger, desired her? She could easily recognize the humans. From what she had heard from the scouting parties, they differed very little from elves in appearance. There were one or two satyrs, former enemies of her people. She could tell by the size and intricacy of their horns that they were some of the more dominant males. And there were a few other species she didn\u2019t recognize. There were some oddly colored creatures with smooth, sharp faces. From the looks of their attire, they were important scholars. Another group looked similar to the satyrs, yet they were much larger, and only had two horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca swallowed her pride and took a seat at the table.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dhasca promised herself she'd at least be fair. Still, she wasn't in a comfortable position to be seated next to the satyrs. She'd always grown up with tales of their treachery and blood-thirsty nature. The blue-skinned beings she was still...unsure of. She didn't know what they were, let alone what they were like. For now, she would make her first diplomatic actions with the humans, and took a seat between what she thought were two lords. Her father nodded his approval, and commenced to keeping the other guests entertained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew little of human culture, and tried to steer the conversation towards asking them about it. If it kept them talking, then maybe she could hide just how nervous she was. She felt like a huge rock had settled in her stomach. This was the worst thing that could possibly happen. Nilmini had promised that suitors would be dropping like flies. Instead, they were coming out of the wood works. The man to her left was fairly dense, and she could keep him at bay with tales of his war days. He was quite old to be seeking out a young wife, at least old by human standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man, seated to her right, was another matter entirely. He was a strong, well-built man, perhaps a tad portly who gazed at her with piercing green eyes. He rarely said much, and when she asked him questions, he would only give short answers, always going back to gazing at her. It was rather unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night wore on, she tried to find some excuse to leave, any excuse. A great opportunity came when the older man to her left had let his drink get the best of him. By now he was slurring his words and his motor skills were more than just lacking. When he had spilled some of his wine on her, it was a perfect opportunity to leave. Unfortunately, someone else insisted on coming with her. \"Here, princess,\" the younger of the two men said, \"let me at least escort you back to your room. Your guests have become quite rowdy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded over in the direction of the satyrs who clearly let the drink make them bolder and more aggressive. Her father was busy trying to calm them. The man took her arm and led her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the great hall, Dhasca again tried to take her leave of the man. \"I think I shall be fine from here Thank you...\" She paused, realizing in all this time she did not know his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roland, your majesty, King Roland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Dhasca stop in her tracks. She had heard that there was a king in the central regions, outside of the Verge, but never would've guessed he would bother to come here for an elf. \"You're...\" she started to say, still surprised by it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a kind smile. \"Yes, I am the king. Now that we have a moment alone, perhaps we can actually talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat her down on a bench and gave himself a little distance from her so as not to seem too forward. \"Now, what do you know about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment. Their scouting parties had only come back with scant information, provided they came back alive at all. \"I only know you are a king and you rule in a city called Adinah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king nodded. \"So it is true, that elves have had very little contact with our world. Very well, princess, I shall tell you my motives for coming here. I will keep no secrets from you, and I hope that by the end of tonight, I may just convince you to leave with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was certainly bold, she would give him that. Still, Dhasca was fascinated by the bluntness of this man. She sat up straight, feigning disinterest. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he smiled with his teeth and looked at her with those eyes, she felt like she was being eyed by some wild beast. \"I've come here really for two reasons, princess. The first is merely a matter of politics. You see, my men have discovered gold deposits in your land, but unfortunately, your tenacious people have prevented any mining in the area. I must say, your people are quite fascinating, and deadly too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, elves could be quite fierce when defending their homes. Dhasca felt a swell of pride as he said this, but she was still confused. \"Why does gold matter to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"And that's why I think we can reach a peaceful agreement. We both need resources, just different materials. And your people don't value gold the same way we do. I like that. It means if I can strike up an alliance with your father, it will be one based on trust. I can be sure your father isn't going to lie to me to keep things for himself. When I found out he had a daughter he sought to marry off, well, that just sweetened the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed him suspiciously. So far, nothing he was saying would win any woman over. \"And the second reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right to the point, aren't you, princess? Yes, well the fact of the matter is I am looking for a queen. More importantly, I'm looking for heirs to my throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical, she thought. He and her father would get along quite well. He continued. \"I do have children, it's true, but they've all been through the women of my harem. None of them can stand to rule when I am gone, according to the old ways. And my former queen, Damus rest her soul, died in childbirth some years ago. She was a rather thin and frail sort, unfortunately. You on the other hand...\" He glided his fingers over the side of her belly, gently squeezing. \"Seem quite healthy for the task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face reddened and she swatted his hand away from her. He smiled wickedly. \"Playing coy, are we? Oh, don't deny it, my dear. I saw the way you ate tonight. Got quite an appetite, don't you? You enjoy indulging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice purred as if he had her caught in a trap. Dhasca really hadn't realized that she had eaten all that much. Gods curse Nilmini right now, she thought. If it wasn't for this stupid plan... \"Course, you're nowhere near the biggest in my harem,\" he continued. Her eyes widened in surprise. \"Oh, would you like to know a little secret about my women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward and whispered in her ear, and her shock could not be concealed. \"You wicked man!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And devilishly handsome,\" he said, running a hand through his red-orange hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me all this? What in your right mind makes you think I'm going to agree to marry you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want there to be no secrets, just like I promised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrowed. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"So, just what is supposed to be so appealing that I'd want to marry you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered his voice, resuming that calm, kind tone. \"I'm a man who knows what he wants, and is willing to do whatever it takes to get it, princess. Sometimes that means I'm willing to pay any price. Let me start by saying that, as promised, you would be my queen, not my concubine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca rolled her eyes. \"And just what's so different about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile widened. \"Freedom, my dear. As my queen, you will have complete free will. You may go as you please in and out of the castle, with guards of course when you go out. I don't think I could stand the thought of losing another queen. You will have free reign over my servants, as they will be yours. And you wouldn't be subjected to the same...standards as my other women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Meaning, if it is truly something you don't like, which I doubt...\" He rested his hand again on her side, feeling its softness. \"You will not gain an ounce unless you will it. You will not be some trophy like my other women. You will be my equal. You will not parade around for my many guests. No, instead you will have a place of honor beside me to converse with the lords and ladies of other lands. I think your people's wisdom is what some of them need to be hearing these days anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sat back, crossing her arms, thinking about it. \"You seem pretty set on this,\" she said. \"And you seem to want to offer quite a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed his head. \"As I said, princess, I'm willing to pay any price. Any desire you may have shall be granted. I'm quite taken with you. To be honest, I never expected the elven princess to be quite as beautiful. Now, what do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As if on cue, a door slightly creaked and she saw Nilmini out of the corner of her eye. Had she been listening in this entire time? She looked back at the eager expression of the king, debating her next move. On the one hand, this arrangement did not seem appealing at all. This man was a disgusting creature with vulgar tastes despite his rather charming visage. Then again, she hadn't complained too much when she learned Nilmini had similar interests. And if this king did truly intend to give her anything she desired...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some conditions of my own,\" she said, trying not to let her nerves betray her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes gleamed. \"Now, you, my dear, know how to play this game right. I knew I found a suitable match in you. Very well, let's hear it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned for Nilmini to come closer. \"This is my personal healer and friend,\" she began. \"If I am to stay at your castle, your human physicians will not know how to deal with elven diseases. She is also a proven midwife. If I am to bear you heirs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king chuckled and tutted, \"Now, princess, I've been completely honest and forthright with you. I had hoped you would do me the same honor. We both know she's not just your healer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow, rather surprised by this. How could he possibly know? He seemed to read her expression. \"You must think me quite daft. I'm no fool. I see the way you both look at each other. That seems to make sense now, and unfortunately it is a bit of a blow to my ego. I saw you as someone I could grow to love, and I had hoped I could be the same to you, but I see now you are taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca couldn't help but smirk just a little. Yet another suitor she had driven off. But, he continued, \"Still, fair is fair, and I did promise you anything you desired. And I suppose if I still come out of this with the two goals I have come for, then it'll do. Consider it granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth elves stuttered to find words. He was being serious. The king really was desperate to get what he wanted. He nodded. \"Yes, feel free to bring her with you, along with any other servants...or lovers you may require. Gods, if you even wanted, I'd let you take your fill of my women if you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini coughed/gagged at this, rather shocked by his bluntness. She hadn't quite gotten as used to it as Dhasca had. He looked rather amused that he had caught them off guard like that. He then looked at Nilmini again. \"Or perhaps I have it all wrong,\" he mused. He pointed at Nilmini. \"I should've seen it before. I recognize a person with similar tastes to my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a gentle pat to Dhasca's stomach, which elicited a glare from the princess. Nilmini, on the other hand, looked like she was going to rip his arm off. \"Just admiring your handiwork here,\" he chuckled. Her jaw nearly dropped. \"Oh yes, I see it now. Quite frankly, that makes me feel better about letting you come along. I know you'll take good care of my future queen. And should you ever get bored, or should her majesty decide not to engage in our common interest, you may have your fun with some of my harem.\" He winked. \"No rides, of course. Those are for me, but there are plenty of other activities you may enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini opened and closed her mouth several times, rather shocked with all that had been said. Dhasca was starting to feel rather warm, the conversation quickly becoming uncomfortable. The king stood. \"Yes, I think we have an arrangement. I'll get my alliance with your father, and you'll at least tolerate me for the sake of continuing our bloodlines, and I'll let you have the freedom to be with your partner here. I'll let you two talk it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strode away, looking rather confident, and thinking he had won. Dhasca took in a deep breath, trying to think. \"This is insane, right?\" Nilmini said. \"He can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he is,\" Dhasca replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he mean by his harem? What shared interests do I have with <i>him</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca leaned over and whispered in her ear, afraid other servants might be listening. Nilmini's eyes widened, and she suspected that was what she looked like when the king first told her. \"That...that bastard!\" Nilmini shouted, though with a hint of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't act so excited about it,\" Dhasca scolded, catching her smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini still had a glazed look in her eye as she pictured it. \"He has a whole castle with that going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to bring her lover back to reality. \"Yes, and quit drooling over the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's what he expects to do to you?\" Nilmini asked worriedly. She remembered how much she had hurt Dhasca not too long ago, and was already angry at the possibility that someone else could do it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sat quietly, bunching her knees to her chest, at least as far as they would go, thinking deeply. \"No, he said as queen, I have complete freedom. I can go and do as I please, and apparently love whomever I please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked out in the direction where the king had walked away. \"And, so long as you marry him and live in his castle, you'd have all this freedom?\" Nilmini asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess nodded. \"And I would have to have his children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini nodded absent-mindedly. \"Right, there's that. But...we could finally be together this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I should take this offer?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini shrugged. \"Well, what do you think of it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Dhasca wasn't sure herself. Like Nilmini had said, it was pretty much an open opportunity for them to be together...mostly. She would have her freedom from her father. Then again, there was the nature of life at the palace, at least what the king described. Sure, she didn't have to subject herself to it, and Nilmini could still have an outlet for her interests even if Dhasca didn't, but it felt...strange. She felt like this was all too easy, like it was a trap of some sort. \"I want to hear what you think first,\" Dhasca said, \"and then I shall decide.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nilmini sighed, wondering if this was the right decision. Gods knew Araris didn't bless her with the gift of wisdom. She just hoped she wouldn't regret it. \"I think you should take him up on the offer,\" she blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca raised an eyebrow, but said nothing else, waiting to hear the rationale behind the decision. Nilmini tried gathering her thoughts and continued. \"I mean, this way we'd get to be together, and your father would never have to know. We'd get to have a family...sort of. And the guy's pretty much offering total freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess listened carefully, and Nilmini knew a few times that there were some objections she was ready to voice. Still, she pondered herself, knowing that even with her lover's advice, this wasn't going to be easy. \"Is that what you want to do,\" Dhasca asked hesitantly, \"just settle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini reached for her hands, clasping them in hers. \"Think of it as settling down, with you. That's all we've ever wanted, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Ever since that first time she had kissed Nilmini, she knew that all she wanted was to be with her, happy and on their own. She wouldn't have cared if they were living together in a hut in the middle of the forest so long as she was with the woman she loved. And yes, somewhere in the back of her mind she knew that no matter what they would've done, there were still the old ways, and her father would've kept with tradition. They never would've had that dream here. Still... \"But, it wouldn't be, at least not completely,\" Dhasca said. \"I'd still have to share you with...him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you're going to fall in love with him, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess shook her head at such a ridiculous notion. Nilmini continued. \"See, then there's nothing to worry about. Besides, he's just using you as a means to an end, so I say why not do him the same courtesy? How else are we going to have a family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was resting a hand on Dhasca's middle, as if she were already with child. Dhasca wasn't going to lie, she really had thought about something like this. Ever since they were young, Nilmini always told Dhasca she would make a great mother, and she had thought she would like the idea. Nilmini could already read her. \"And, of course, who's going to take care of you and make sure you are absolutely comfortable through your pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca rolled her eyes. \"I can already see where this is going. I suppose that won't be all bad. And I suppose I had better get used to that. I have a feeling the food at the castle is going to be quite filling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was pushing all the right buttons with Nilmini right now, and was enjoying every minute of making her squirm, wanting to undress her right there in the halls. Nilmini tried to stay focused. \"Um...yeah, yeah, I guess so. So, you'll do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess nodded. \"It could be our best chance. If he really means what he says and is willing to do anything to have me, I think we can make this work in our favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca had played her hand well, and kept from giving an official answer until her guests' stay neared its end. No point in angering some of the other suitors, especially the raucous satyrs. Still, that entire time, the king had a look on his face as if he knew he had won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still wasn't sure what to make of him. On one hand, there was something kind in him, a part of him that made him so charismatic and charming. He genuinely wanted to see people happy. On the other hand, there was something, not dark necessarily, but wild. It was like looking at a ferocious jungle cat; beautiful and elegant on the surface, but wild and hungry in its true nature. It was something she considered both exciting, and frightening at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet she could put it off no longer. The king's party were getting close to leaving, and she had to tell her father of her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found him in his chambers. \"Ah, Dhasca, my beautiful little flower, come in,\" he greeted jovially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath, knowing that there was no turning back now. \"Father, I wanted to talk to you about our guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"An odd bunch, I assure you, but it was nice to have some open communication with them. I hope we can form some stronger alliances with some of them in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is sort of what I wanted to talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father's eyebrows raised in surprise, but also in excitement. Was he about to hear what he had been waiting to hear for so long? Heart thundering in her chest, she just said it. \"I think I have found a future husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king let out a whoop of pure joy, and picked her up gleefully, soon realizing that his daughter was a tad heavier than he remembered. \"This is fantastic! Who is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Roland,\" she said softly, surprised she was voicing it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes lit up even more. \"Oh, that is just wonderful, Dhasca! You know, he is a shrewd man, but he certainly is determined. I rather liked him myself. You are sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca nodded. \"Yes, he has been nothing but kind, and truly wants me to be happy with him at his palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when her father's face fell a little. \"Oh...\" was all he said at first. \"Yes, that would mean you would have to go there, now wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart broke a little hearing his disappointment at that realization. \"Oh, daddy, it won't be all that bad. He tells me that the palace is quite wonderful, and he will see to it that I'm comfortable there. I doubt I will want for anything.\" She knew that was more than true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you are to be the future queen here. What will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged him fiercely. \"You're not going to die all that soon,\" she said. \"You're still young, father. If anything else perhaps one of my brothers could, or maybe the king already has plans for one of our children to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"Well, not yet anyway, but he is eager to start a family. He has no heirs of his own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father scratched his beard. While this was something he had wanted greatly for his daughter, he had never expected how hard it would be, especially now that he knew he was going to lose her. \"Is this what you truly want, my beautiful little flower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" he said. \"I shall speak with him at once to start making arrangements.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dhasca had, of course, been invited to sit in on her father's discussions with King Roland about her upcoming marriage. On the whole, she found it a rather dull affair. It was mostly the two of them hammering out the details of what their alliance would entail. As he had desired, the king was getting his chance to mine for some gold in the verge unmolested by the elves, provided he still maintained some effort to not disrupt the natural order in the area. The marriage also united their territory in the east with his kingdom, meaning future heirs could rule the Verge as lords and vassals to the future king, as Roland hoped she would soon produce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn exchange, the elves would be receiving a steady supply of crops from Adinah as well as the aid of human healers to aid them in the disease epidemic. Dhasca was thankful for that. If anything, this marriage was actually helping her people. \"And have you considered where to conduct the ceremony?\" her father asked, finishing the discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Roland looked to Dhasca and smiled. She had to give him credit; he played the part pretty well. They had both agreed to faking some element of happiness and harboring feelings for each other. Through this entire meeting, he had been holding her hand. \"What did you have in mind, your grace?\" he asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am to understand that you will be leaving with her for your palace soon. I was hoping that we might conduct a more 'traditional' ceremony, or at least traditional for us, here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king was still getting used to elven customs. \"Could you elaborate. I'm most certain I do not know what an elven wedding is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca chose to answer. \"It's really a small, intimate affair,\" she said. \"A priest performs a small binding ceremony and then the couple are sent to the woods alone to plant a birch tree to ask Yva to bless the marriage, and...\" She blushed, remembering the last and most important part of this ceremony. \"And, well, the couple consummate their union there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened in delight and curiosity at the thought of it. Thinking for a moment, he finally said. \"I rather like this idea myself, more symbolic than anything we have. I would be honored to participate in such a ceremony. We will perhaps have a small welcoming feast back at the palace, but nothing too grand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winked at the princess. It was just as well, she thought, and the king probably knew it too. Neither of them had told her father about the king's other interests or the women that inhabited the palace. It was probably best that they did not have the wedding in Adinah. \"Wonderful,\" her father said. \"Since that is the case, we can arrange things as soon as tomorrow evening at sunset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reality of all this was starting to set in for Dhasca. She was really about to do it. She was really going to marry this man. She took a deep breath, reminding herself why she was doing this: to be with Nilmini. \"Terrific,\" King Roland said. \"I don't know if I could spend another day apart from my beautiful bride, isn't that right, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Dhasca said through clenched teeth. All for Nilmini, she had to keep reminding herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is actually rather peaceful,\" King Roland said, listening to the quiet sounds of the night's wildlife in the forest. They had just finished planting the tree sapling and he had chosen to rest on a nearby rock. Dhasca had remained incredibly silent, both through the ceremony, and this. The whole time, all she could think about was what was coming next. \"Yes, it is always very nice out here in the evenings,\" she said absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cocked his head, studying her intently. \"You know, we don't have to do this,\" he said, startling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have to do what?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"You know, consummate the marriage out here. Don't get me wrong, the idea of being in the outdoors for this sort of thing is rather exciting, I know this is something that makes you uncomfortable. You've never been with a man before, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, only with Nilmini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I respect that,\" he said. \"You are very true to your lover. So, let us just enjoy a peaceful night here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back against the rock, his hands resting behind his head. Dhasca had been undoing her braids, letting herbrown hair cascade over her shoulders. She was rather surprised by this. \"You mean, you're just willing to sleep out here, and that's all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, but how are we to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up, looking her square in the eyes. \"Yes, all in due time, those things will happen. But, I'd like you to come to it in your own way. I'm not going to force you. Take all the time you need, though try to come around to it before I get too old.\" He chuckled at the last bit, that gleam coming to his eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought, knowing that if not now, then she would never get comfortable with the idea. \"It is still a tradition, and I'd hate to waste a good night like this. If this is to be my future, I would rather start now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooted closer to her. \"I am a man of my word, princess, or perhaps I should get used to calling you my queen. Anything you desire, I shall gladly oblige.\" He slowly began to reach for her dress to begin removing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a couple days later, the king had gathered his party, and had Dhasca's things packed to head back to the palace. Her father had agreed when she explained the need to have Nilmini around for a healer. Besides, he would rather trust a midwife he knew to care for his daughter than just any random human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king rode in the carriage with the two elves, passing the time by describing human customs and mannerisms, trying to get his new queen used to her new life at the palace. \"You will find a great many things to suit any need you might have, my queen,\" he explained. \"As I have mentioned, the food itself is quite exquisite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sighed, rather bored with the idea now. \"Still, there are several other things that may interest you. There is a hot springs located just below the castle. There are several warm pools just in the cellar, and I have quite a collection of scented oils which may be added to the waters. You will also find that Bosch Keep has a rich history, and the temples in Adinah are quite an architectural delight. My castle is now yours, my queen. Feel free to take in any and all of these pleasures offered to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the edges of the city in the distance. She couldn't believe it. This was to be her new home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dhasca traipsed down the stone stairs of the castle to take a dip in the hot springs below. After a long few days of travel all the way to Adinah, she needed to relax and rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city was something else, and she had Nilmini had been impressed with the sheer size of it. There were buildings everywhere. They couldn't believe so many humans could live so close to each other. Back in the Verge, elves lived fairly spread out from each other, ensuring everyone had their necessary space. Here, everyone was jam-packed into the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the buildings were incredibly beautiful, such as the various temples the king pointed out. Some of the areas were a bit more unsavory. The streets there were grimy and filled with some frightening looking figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess, now queen, made it all the way down and let out a gasp when she saw the springs. They were simply gorgeous. The pools of water were large and inviting looking. The waters bubbled with warmth, and there seemed to be a certain luminescence of the water that gave the area a blue-green glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca disrobed and stepped into one of the warm pools. She sighed contently and leaned back to enjoy the bathing session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest surprise of all was the palace itself. It was bigger than she had imagined. Upon entering, the first thing she noticed was the immense great hall with its large tables, perfect for holding feasts with many guests. There were rooms upon rooms as they walked past the hall. Dhasca couldn't even begin to count them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Nilmini who spotted one first. She came to a halt in the middle of the hall and stared with her mouth agape into one of the rooms. When Dhasca caught up to her, she saw her too. It was a woman, covered in shimmering blue scales, laying in a water tank in the middle of the floor. But seeing a merfolk for the first time wasn't what surprised them. It was the sheer size of the woman. She was a huge blob of pillowy fat, laying in her tank, content and blissful, as a line of servants brought her endless helpings of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Roland only winked at the two of them, and guided them on. That was when they finally got to see her own quarters. It was bigger than her father's wooden halls, and was built as if it were a separate home onto itself. There were cozy sleeping quarters, an ornate living quarters with a warm stove burning in the corner, and even a sort of dining area where the queen could take her meals if she did not wish to dine in the great hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope everything is to you liking,\" the king had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's wonderful,\" Dhasca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing!\" Nilmini said ecstatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Roland smiled. \"I'm glad you are comfortable here. I'll let you two get settled in, and please, call for one of my servants if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been earlier that evening. Dhasca was now glad to get a chance to just enjoy it all. The warm water felt so good against her skin, and helped to relax any sore muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard someone approaching from behind her, and she tried to cover herself before they could see. Though she knew she would have to get used to the idea of having servants, she wasn't exactly ready for them to know her that intimately just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, a familiar body splashed into the water with her. \"Great idea,\" Nilmini said. \"This place is amazing. It's got everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I'd almost think you were in love,\" Dhasca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's going to take some getting used to, but I think I really could like all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, and you're sure it doesn't have to do with some of the women you've seen around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lover shrugged her off. \"Oh, come on. You know I love only you. It's just...different, you know? I mean, I never realized that there were other people who...you know, liked the same kind of thing I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca only gave her a bit of a half smile. Nilmini scooted closer to her. \"I guess, since we don't have to worry about your dad trying to marry you off, we don't have to go through with that plan anymore, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, and eventually met her lover's eyes. \"Well, we don't have to put a stop to it,\" she said, smiling coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini became excited. \"Really? You want to? Look, don't get me wrong, I'd love that, but I don't want to make you feel like we have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I...I want to. I'm still getting used to it, but I want to try. It's something special to you, and it's made things interesting for us. And, I don't know, I'm starting to kind of...like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca nodded. \"Yeah, it's kind of nice getting to eat what I want without having to worry. You really spoil me when we're doing it. And, some days...\" She took Nilmini's hands in hers and put them to her rounded hips. \"It feels nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lover got even closer to her, wrapping her in a passionate embrace and kissing her. \"Well, alright then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed before getting Nilmini under control. \"But...I have a few rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to still be able to walk. I'm not getting that big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini nodded eagerly. \"Of course. I'm not going to put you in that kind of situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And second, let's take this nice and easy. I want to enjoy this with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two elves bobbed in the water for several more minutes, just enjoying each other's company. Eventually, Nilmini had her own issues to voice. \"So...what was it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca looked at her confused. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini gave her a coy look. \"You know...being with the king? Look, I know it's kinda something you have to do as part of this deal and all, but I know you two have already been trying for heirs. What's it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"It's different, that's for sure. I guess it's one of those things where my body knows that that's what it's supposed to do, but it's not as nice as when I'm with you. With you, it's like it was meant to be. You're not jealous are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini tried to laugh it off. \"Me? Jealous? No way! I mean, yeah, it's frustrating that we have to put up with that to have all this, but it's a necessary evil and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, there are going to be some nights where he's going to be coming to my chambers. Are you going to be alright with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"Sure, I'll find something else to do. It's a big castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca looked down, looking as uncomfortable as possible. \"Are you...are you going to take up the king's offer to...you know...with some of his women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Dhasca, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath before saying her next sentence. \"Because, it's okay if you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I shouldn't expect you to not want to. I mean, I have to conceive heirs with the king. It isn't fair for me to expect you to have to endure that completely alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini held her close. \"You're sure you're okay with that? Don't get me wrong, I've thought about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's not like you're doing anything too intimate with them. You deserve a little companionship while I attend to...queenly matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini kissed her. \"You are the best thing ever. Dhasca, I love you and only you. You have nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her eyebrows. \"So...how about we make this bath a little more intimate,\" Nilmini said, reaching for Dhasca.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You have the cutest little tummy,\" Nilmini murmured as the two elves lay cuddling in bed. \"I'm thinking about asking for something sweet from the kitchens. I know you like your sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past several weeks, the two had settled into their new life in the palace. For most of the time, they had Dhasca's living quarters to themselves and could do as they pleased. Dhasca was the one who had settled in the most. Ever since deciding to share in her lover's interest, she had gotten considerably bigger. She had widened out a bit and was starting to look rather plump. Course, by this point, every part of her had a little extra padding to it. She loved it the most when Nilmini would cuddle with her, feeling all those extra inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Dhasca started to say, rather pleased with the prospect of having something sweet to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door interrupted them. \"Gods daminit!\" Nilmini said in a frustrated sigh. \"Not again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new queen gave her lover an apologetic look and sighed before getting up to answer it. As usual, there was the king waiting with his casual grin. \"Really? Again? Tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped into the room and kissed her cheek. \"Yes, tonight. I intend to put an heir in you before the year's up. That is part of our arrangement, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't forgotten.\" She huffed and went to Nilmini, kissing her forehead. \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I promise I'll make it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lover tried to pretend not to care and shrugged it off. \"Yeah, I understand. I'll just go explore for a few. I haven't checked out the west wing yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped out of the room, letting her eyes linger on Dhasca for as long as she could before the door shut behind her. She hated this! She hated having to share her with the king. She knew it wasn't Dhasca's fault, and that they had agreed to this to have their wonderful life here, but she hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, sure, Dhasca would find a way to make it up to her, but usually after one of those nights, she was too tired to do much of anything. Slowly, the king was taking her away one night at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Nilmini had to find something to do. She hated that the most: finding something to occupy her time and keep her mind off of what was going on in their own bed. At least this way, Nilmini had gotten familiar with the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the temptation was there. The king had offered, Dhasca had said she wouldn't mind it, and she was feeling pretty down. Maybe she would just see what was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini turned down the hall where she knew the concubines lived. She had heard several of the rumors among the servants. She knew which women were finicky and needy, and therefore best to avoid. She peeked into one room, and gasped when she saw the woman within who gave her a charming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a human woman wearing a blue lady-in-waiting's dress, but most shocking of all was how immense she was. The woman's gargantuan gut bulged out and rested on her monstrous thighs, quivering and shaking with every one of her labored breaths. Labored breaths? All she was doing was just sitting there on a gigantic couch. Just how big was she, Nilmini wondered. Her pillowy arms rested on her belly, massaging it with pudgy sausage fingers. Her face was full and round with many chins, giving her a pouty, yet pleasant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed, her round cheeks and many chins shaking with mirth. \"Are you lost?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'm...I was just wondering if maybe you were hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini grimaced as she realized how stupid she must've sounded. All it took was one massive woman who only reached sizes in her fantasies, and she was reduced to a babbling idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman only smiled. \"Oh, yes, you must be the new queen's paramour. The king mentioned you. He said you might be by to visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned for Nilmini to sit across from her, and she nodded to one of the servants to bring them refreshments. The elf wasn't sure what to say next. She found herself suddenly at a loss for words. The woman seemed to take control of the conversation. \"I'm Margery by the way,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Nilmini,\" she answered, finding her voice. \"He...mentioned me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, the queen has been the talk of the castle recently. Not all of it's good though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think about it. She married the king, making her the official queen. She gets all the benefits of such a title. And any of her children will be legitimate heirs. Any children we have with him will get nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense, Nilmini thought. She hadn't realized how this would affect the rest of the people in the palace. Then another thought occurred to her. \"Wait, you have children with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again. \"Me, no. I mean, I have two of my own, but they weren't through him. Ever since I became one of his women, though, he's seen to it that they are well taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, how did you end up here, if I may ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargery's face turned to blissful nostalgia. \"Well, believe it or not, I used to be a servant here in the castle. I actually used to serve the former queen. Anyway, the king always sees to it that all of his castle is well-fed, and well, certain results happen because of it, some of us more than others.\" She patted her massive gut for emphasis. \"Anyway, after a while, I just got too big to get around like I used to. Thankfully, I was one of the pretty ones. So, the king let me stay here, and he's seen to everything I would need ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants had brought several trays laden with food in that time. Nilmini was still unsure about what she should be doing right now. This was her first time trying to do this with anyone other than Dhasca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I've gone on about myself too much. Why are you here so late at night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, hating to admit it. \"Dhasca is with the king. They're...they're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargery nodded as much as her fat neck would allow. \"I understand, and you're probably incredibly lonely right now. You don't want to have to spend the night alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded with a guilty look on her face. Margery tried to put her at ease. \"So, tell me a little about yourself. We've never had elves here before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...there's not much too tell. We're really a lot like you. I mean, we look the same and everything, kinda.\" Maybe that was why she was so drawn to Margery and not one of the other concubines like the merfolk. It was something familiar that she could get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargery could tell she was struggling for conversation, and tried to change the subject. \"Well, tell me about this new queen we have. What's she like? I know some of the other women already hate her. Vuko's on a rampage about it. I want to give her a chance, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini smiled, thinking about her. Thinking about Dhasca always put her in a good mood. \"She's the most wonderful woman I know. She's sweet and kind. She's funny. And she's incredibly cute, even when she's angry with me. She's shy sometimes, but once Dhasca opens up, she's the most amazing person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled knowingly. \"She sounds wonderful,\" she said. \"You must be really lucky to have her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargery then smiled seductively. \"Well, let's not just sit here. You're here to feed me, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini had almost forgotten. Margery was just so easy to talk to. Still, she didn't feel that sure about what she was about to do. Was she really about to do this to someone other than Dhasca? Even though it wasn't cheating, it still felt like it. But, then again, the king was taking Dhasca away from her more and more. She needed companionship of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf took a forkful of food in her hand, taking a deep breath. Was she really about to commit to this?</span></div></div>",

Just as she had suspected, Dhasca was fast asleep on the bed, too tired after having entertained the king for an evening. She actually felt sorry for her lover. She was just the poor soul being used in all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid into bed quietly, snuggling close to Dhasca, and wrapping one of her arms around her rounded waist. The queen stirred a bit. \"You're back late,\" she said groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled weakly. Nilmini wasn't exactly proud of herself right now. \"Yeah...\" she said. \"I, uh...went exploring and you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sighed. \"I told you I wouldn't be mad. If that was something you wanted to do, I wasn't going to stop you. So, who did you find?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name was Margery. I guess she was a former servant here before she got too big. But look, I didn't go through with it, okay? I wanted to. I mean, it's not like I was in love with her or anything. But, I don't know...I just couldn't. It just doesn't feel the same with someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow in surprise. \"Feeding? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini shrugged. \"I don't know. It's something special, to me, to us, you know? It just didn't feel right with anyone else. I love you, Dhasca. And this is something I like doing with you. It would just be cheating if it was with anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca chuckled and kissed her. \"You're silly. But, I love you for it. I actually kind of appreciate you not doing it. I don't know why, but I kind of think of this as something special between us too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're starting to like this. You're actually starting to get pretty big. I love how soft you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Well, I did promise you I'd make it up. Maybe I'll have a nice breakfast prepared for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best!\" Nilmini kissed her neck and went back to snuggling with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca however, still seemed to have a lot on her mind. \"You know he'll leave us alone once I can get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I don't blame you for this. I mean, I'm kinda the one who said we should do this. I promise, I'll be more understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several weeks, the two elves found ways to cope with their situation. Nilmini tried to be patient, and Dhasca had to keep hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the queen continued to grow rounder. She wanted to make her time with Nilmini count, and that often came in the form of their meals, where her lover would encourage her to eat more each time, and to try new dishes, which the kitchen staff told her was especially fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king had taken a liking to these changes as well, and even had his new queen weighed, much like he did with his other concubines. She was nearing close to thirteen stone now, and her rounded belly and bottom were clearly where most of these changes were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Nilmini was starting to notice other changes in her lover. Today, she kept noticing Dhasca nodding off during the king's latest meeting with a lord from the north. As queen, she occasionally had to attend to these meetings between nobles to provide a good image for the king. However, Dhasca also proved helpful during these moments as well. She was insightful and wise, and often could make good suggestions when the king and his guest would sometimes come near to blows. That came with her training to be future leader of the elves, making her a suitable choice for queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was different. Dhasca seemed incredibly out of it, and several times, she had actually drifted into a deep sleep. Nilmini was worried about her. She knew she and the king had had some late nights, but this didn't look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the king and the lord had finally departed, Nilmini had to shake Dhasca awake. \"Huh, what?\" she said sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fell asleep again,\" Nilmini said with a worried look. \"Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca yawned. \"Yes, I've just been incredibly tired lately. But, I don't understand; I've been sleeping just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini tried to call on as much of her healing abilities as she thought about the cause. But one set of alarm bells went off for her. \"Anything else wrong? Have you been feeling sick at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a second. \"A little, but nothing too terrible. Some of the human dishes haven't been agreeing with my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a wide, ear to ear grin. \"I don't think that's it at all,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Dhasca was confused, but eventually, she was able to read Nilmini's reaction. \"You don't think...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Let's take a listen, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong one of the best attributes of the elves were their ears. They could hear wild game miles away, but it was also useful in another way. Elves knew of their pregnancies far sooner than other races because they could hear the child's heartbeat at the first suspicion that something might be up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca smiled too, and opened her outer robe to the loose dress below. Nilmini knelt down, pressing her ear to her lover's stomach. For several anxious breaths, the two of them waited,  Dhasca waiting for an answer, Nilmini listening for results. At last, Nilmini let out a small gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Dhasca asked with a mix of worry and excitement. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n\"I hear two heartbeats!\" commented Nilmini with a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two? Are you sure you heard well?\" asked Dhasca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I know what I heard. There were two heartbeats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, you're having twins,\" replied Nilmini, stroking gently the princess', now queen\u2019s, belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini was sad and happy at the same time; happy because she was glad that her loving Dhasca was becoming a mother, but was sad because these were Dhasca and the king's children. As she stroked the belly with one hand, she closed the other one in a fist as a little fit of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini took a deep breath and asked, \"Aren't you happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca nodded with a small smile but wasn't quite sure of that. Now what would she do? Was it better to inform the king immediately, as sooner or later he would find out anyway, or wait some more? She wasn't quite sure of how he would react. He still hadn't had a son, therefore an heir, right? At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but already feel love for the two little lives she carried within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long. That evening, Dhasca and Roland had a walk in the large garden of the castle.<br>\r\nDhasca liked that garden a lot. It reminded her of the Verge, with large trees and bushes that formed a large path. During that walk, the King noticed that something was strange about his wife, and when he asked, Dhasca immediately let it slip that she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing these words, a large smile appeared on King Roland's face, and he hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is wonderful news,\" yelled Roland while pinching Dhasca's love handles, making the elf even more uncomfortable. \"We have to inform all the kingdom and make a big feast to celebrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" said Dhasca. \"Don't you think it's a bit too early to tell everyone?\" True, elves could know that much sooner, but that always made it harder when things did go wrong in the early stages. The loss only hurt worse when an elven woman discovered there was no longer that steady heartbeat in her womb. Dhasca didn\u2019t want to make it worse by telling many people, and wanted to be sure everything was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoland thought about it for a moment. \"That's fine, but we shall still have a feast. You don't look very well, and I'm sure that a great lunch will help you,\" said the king while stroking Dhasca's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, a pregnant woman must be well-fed for the welfare of the baby,\" added Roland patting Dhasca's belly before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there was a large feast for the queen. A large banquet was held and Dhasca was encouraged to eat by the king, while Nilmini looked on at a distance, waiting for the feast to end so she could have some time with her lover. She didn't like how Roland was looking at Dhasca; she was too jealous, and feared that with the pregnancy she would receive even more attention from him, meaning less time for her to be with Dhasca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, no one at court knew the exact reason of the feast. The cooks simply received the orders to immediately prepare a very large lunch worthy of the greatest ruler, while the servants speculated among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome thought was a way to make the queen fatter faster (which was partially true), others that the king was sick and wanted to enjoy his last days, others that the queen was envious of the concubines and King Roland was trying to make her forgive him. Still, there was someone at court who guessed the truth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of the fanciest room of the castle, Kimiko was enjoying her own little feast. She was a half-kitsune, with orange hair, and a very prominent gut that she got from her father. The teenaged hybrid was eating some of the pastries that laid on a large tray in front of her, while she was leaned on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hadrik,\" started the half-kitsune toward the nice-looking servant, \"don't you think this dress suits me?\" She put another pastry in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor servant gave a quick glance at the orange dress, which was highlighting all her curves, and simply nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimiko tried to toy with him. \"What is it? Cat's got your tongue?\" But this was suddenly interrupted by the slam of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room, came a very fat Kitsune with fiery red hair, and tails that moved behind her large rump. She was Vuko, one of the first concubines of the King, who certainly thought she was practically the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I was having fun,\" protested the girl as the servant scurried out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now is not the time to be playing childish games. There a huge problem,\" replied Vuko, sitting next to the table, eyeing with greed the delicious pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitsune began to eat with terrible table matters, leaving stains of creams all around her. Kimiko managed to save a couple of pastries and stand back in a corner to not be stained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile devouring the goods, Vuko said, \"Do you know that there's a feast for the queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimiko, with her mouth full, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you know why they're suddenly having one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimiko shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's because that bitch it's pregnant,\" said Vuko while slamming her fist on the table. \"It just has to be. I've never liked her; how could she steal the position of the king's favorite woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't like her, but why is her being pregnant a problem?\" asked Kimiko before shoving her last pastry in her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, use your brain for once. What is the difference between a concubine and a queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer came from Kimiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVuko sighed. \"The queen is officially married. Therefore, any child she'll have will be the future prince or princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Kimiko's eyes widened. \"Does this mean that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" replied Vuko bluntly, \"you're not the future princess anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm the king's oldest daughter,\" protested the girl, beginning to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter; the queen's child comes first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, does this mean I'm not a princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, unless we make the king change his mind about his queen, and I've got an idea,\" replied Vuko with a grin full of cream.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Needless to say, it was not an easy pregnancy for Dhasca. The sickness hit her hard. There wasn't a day that went by where she didn't end up in bed, too weakened by illness. Nilmini did her best to try and comfort her through all of it, but it proved hard. True, she was skilled in healing arts, but there were a lot of unknowns in this situation, since she had never dealt with a half-elf pregnancy before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to eat something,\" Nilmini said, sitting beside Dhasca on the bed. She tried to find some humor in the situation. \"And I'm not saying that to make you fatter.\" She rubbed her hand up and down her lover's hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled weakly. \"I know, but I'm still not feeling well right now. The two of you are really not making this easy.\" She put a hand on her lower belly. She tried to sit up. \"I can try, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Nilmini could bring her the meager meal, the doors to their chambers burst open, and the king strode in. \"And how is the mother of my future heirs today?\" he asked with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was perhaps the most annoying part of it all. The two elves had been convinced that King Roland would leave them alone once Dhasca had gotten pregnant. Instead, it seemed to be his invitation to never leave the queen alone. He was constantly checking on her, having royal physicians measure her progress, and just being around almost all the time. It irritated the both of them to no end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sighed, not feeling up to trying to fight him off right now. \"Fine,\" she said, \"just a bit ill is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing,\" he said, stroking her hair. Dhasca pulled away, but he seemed to take no notice. \"I'm sure you will be well again soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini couldn't understand it. She knew the king was fully aware where her lover's heart lay. Yet, here he was, giving them no peace. She often wondered that even if he knew Dhasca couldn't love him, he had still developed feelings for her. Then again, as she had learned from the gossip among the servants and concubines, the king had lost his first wife and child in childbirth. Perhaps it did have him on edge, making him worry so. Still, it was annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't change the fact that it still felt incredibly isolating. Dhasca tried her best to get him to leave or to ignore him, but he was persistent, and always hovered close by. This left both of them feeling pretty lonely. Nilmini would often disappear, mostly to keep herself from getting angry. She was afraid of what would happen the day she couldn't hold her tongue with the king...or Dhasca. She knew it wasn't her fault, but sometimes, she did take the frustration out on her, and Nilmini knew that now especially was not the time for that. Dhasca was in a very fragile place right now. She was dealing with a pregnancy for the first time, trying to balance her relationship with the king and her, and her emotions were probably all over the place right now. If anything, she was probably scared, most of all, and Nilmini had to try her best to be supportive, but the king's advances toward her lover made that extremely difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it was Dhasca who spoke up to defend herself. \"I think all I need is plenty of rest,\" she said, \"without you watching all the time. It doesn't put me at ease at all, and I don't think such stress is good for the little ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's face fell a little. \"Oh...I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in good hands,\" she said, nodding over to where Nilmini was standing. \"Nilmini will see to it that I'm well cared for, I promise. But, you promised me something as well. You said that I will have the freedom to be with her as the woman I love. And right now, I require that love, but I can't with you always around. These are your heirs, I guarantee you that, but you have to let me handle it my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was polite, but firm in her words. The king gave her a tight but earnest smile. \"Of course, my queen,\" he said. \"Indeed, I have promised you anything, and you shall have it. I worry is all.\" He kissed her forehead and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two elves let out relieved sighs. \"I don't think that's the last we'll see of him,\" Dhasca said, \"but at least, he knows his boundaries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" said Nilimini. \"This...this whole thing isn't what I expected it to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"I know, it hasn't worked out the way I thought it would either. We just have to keep hoping it will all balance out. I want you to be as much a part of my children's lives as he is. This is our family too. But, we're just going to have to keep playing this back and forth until some kind of a resolution can be reached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that too. So...you still ready to try and eat something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca nodded eagerly. \"Yes, when these two aren't making me sick to my stomach, they're making me feel as if I haven't eaten in weeks. Isn't that right?\" She stroked the ever-so-slight curve of her stomach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things didn't get any easier from there. It seemed that as the weeks passed, new challenges always presented themselves. As Dhasca got progressively rounder, she often had trouble judging her own size. Several times she had misjudged her bearings and bumped into a few things. Once, she had almost knocked over an expensive artifact balanced precariously on a podium. Of course, by the time she had figured out how to maneuver at her current size, she had grown another couple, repeating the process all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was nothing compared to the pummeling her insides took. With twins came twice the activity, and often, the two fought each other for space. This left Dhasca feeling sore and exhausted after dealing with it all night. Though, that did result in one benefit. Constantly tired, Dhasca had resorted to little else other than trying to get some rest and eating to keep her strength up. Really, she was only halfway along, but she looked nearly due, between carrying two children and how much extra weight she had put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had known this would have helped you gain weight, I would have been trying to find ways to get you pregnant sooner,\" Nilmini said jokingly as she took a loving pinch at her sides, which were significantly softer than from only a few weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem so amused. \"Glad you're enjoying it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really, you look beautiful. I don't think I've ever seen you eat so much before, and it's really starting to show.\" She began letting her hands explore her lover's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, that does feel good,\" Dhasca purred, \"but maybe try a little more here. They're starting to get especially restless.\" She placed Nilmini's hands on her belly, just as another sharp kick hit her. \"Easy on your mother, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed as she helped Dhasca quiet the little ones. \"Well, you do have to realize, they are half the king's. They're probably going to be a bit...assertive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope they don't turn out too much like him. He can be nice, most of the time, but then he can be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but they're also half you. I think that's going to outweigh anything he brings to this. Plus, you know I'm going to help too, so hopefully, some of my good habits rub off on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Right now, I just might be able to outweigh the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really driving me crazy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Nilmini did her best to keep Dhasca comfortable, there was no denying the fact that she was in a very uncomfortable place. She wondered what she could do to try and make things easier for her. She also knew that Dhasca was feeling pretty isolated in the castle. Very few of the other women wanted anything to do with her, and to their relief, the king had started to leave them alone. But, it still felt lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea came to her a few weeks later. She was just finishing what was probably her second lunch for the day. Nilmini had to admit, the little ones did have their mother's appetite. \"Everything okay?\" she asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen sighed. \"It just feels so...I don't know, suffocating here. Don't get me wrong. This palace is incredible. I wouldn't trade any of this for anything, but it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the fresh air of home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini beamed. \"I've got it! Maybe we can visit the Verge. I'm sure your father would like to see you once before you become a mother, and I'm sure he'd be excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought it over. \"Well, it would be nice. But, it is kind of a long trip, and I don't know how long I can last like this. And, what do you think he's going to say about me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe not the most comfortable experience, but better to do it now than later. And, I don't think he'll mind either way. You look like you've been well taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little too well, but yes, I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a perfect idea, Nilmini thought. Dhasca needed time away from the palace, needed to see her family. It would maybe take her mind off of all the unpleasant aspects of pregnancy, and it'd be just in time before she got so far along it would be impossible to travel. She quickly made the arrangements, though King Roland wasn't exactly thrilled with the idea. In fact, he hadn't really been in all that great of a mood since his queen told him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the same, the two elves were able to arrange a small visit to the Verge, though they did have to take a few guards at the king's insistence. True, the ride wasn't exactly smooth, which succeeded in upsetting the twins into fits of kicking off and on, but they made it with no major issues.</span></div></div>",

My beautiful flower!\" her father exclaimed when she first saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't realize that she would be so overcome with emotion when she entered the old halls for the first time since being married. Then again, that could've just been the hormones. She eagerly embraced her father, who clearly struggled to get his arms around her. He beamed when he first saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness, just look at you. My little girl is now about to become a mother. Are you sure it was okay for you to come here? You look like you could be due any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen shook her head. \"No, not for a while. It's actually twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile got even wider. \"Yva bless you! That's wonderful news. Your husband must be thrilled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, he's excited for his future heirs. I've missed you all so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll see your brothers soon enough. You know, your mother would be so proud of you right now.\" He gave her belly a pat. \"Now, come, sit. You must be exhausted after that trip. I trust Nilmini has been seeing to your health during all of this. You are looking well, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca snickered to herself. \"Yes, she has been taking good care of me. And yes, Adinah is a city of plenty. I've never seen so many people in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to tell him of all the things she had seen in the capital city and the palace. She did neglect to mention the king's concubines, and how little she had really seen of the king. But he didn't seem to notice, and rather, he was fascinated by all that he heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, how have things been here?\" Dhasca inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father nodded. \"Very well, in fact. Our alliance with the humans has proven to be beneficial. The disease epidemic has dropped dramatically. And, for the most part, they have been somewhat respectful. There may still be a few trust issues with the locals, but it's improving. But, we've got all of your visit to discuss these things. I had a welcome feast prepared when Nilmini sent word that you were coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis proved to be trickier than Dhasca had anticipated. True, she could get away with eating more than usual because of her pregnancy, but she didn't want to show the full extent of how much her appetite had increased, thanks to Nilmini. And, if she was being totally honest, compared to the feasts back at the palace, she was pretty sure she couldn't get away with even coming close to what she usually ate without drawing attention. What would have been a grand meal a couple of years ago, was now a rather quaint and simple dinner. She struggled to restrain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo further add insult to injury, Dhasca had to once more, pretend she wasn't as close as she was with Nilmini. Her partner actually ended up having to go back to her own family in the village to sleep. Thus, as she lay in her bed that night, she felt empty inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was short lived. She heard a rustling outside her window, and before long, Nilmini was clambering through the window, a bag of extra food in hand. \"Just like old times,\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca laughed. \"I kind of miss those, you know.\" She pulled her closer for a kiss. \"Now, where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini rummaged through the bag for a particularly sweet treat. \"I think I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, that was how it went for her entire visit. Dhasca enjoyed spending time with her family once more. Her four brothers were eager to see her once more, and were overjoyed knowing they were soon to be uncles. And, it seemed that the visit did help take Dhasca's mind off of the minor inconveniences of her pregnancy. True, the little ones jostled and fought all the more as they needed more space, but at least she was able to take it in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sad to go back, but she knew that the palace was where she belonged, and where she had the freedom to do as she pleased. \"Thank you for this,\" she said to Nilmini as the carriage followed along the bumpy trails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured it would make you happy. Besides, you needed a little you-time before the little ones arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca rubbed at the curve of her belly. \"I hope I'm ready for this. Twins? I don't know if I can even handle one. Nilmini, what if I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hands over Dhasca's. \"Look, I know it's just new-mother worries, and I'm not going to tell you it's going to be perfect. But, I do know one thing. You're going to be a good mother. These two are lucky to have you. Trust me, I've seen some of the king's other children. Their mothers hardly bother with them, and believe me when I say they didn't turn out the better for it. You're better than that because you're going to give those children all the love you could ever give.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dhasca could answer, she heard a faint sound coming closer. An arrow shot through the carriage, piercing the seat behind Dhasca, only inches from her head. She ducked down as far as her body would allow her. Nilmini was beside her in an instant. \"You okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she gasped, her stomach heaving up and down with rapid breathing. \"I...what was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay down. I'll go check on it.\" She helped Dhasca get laid down on the floor of the carriage to avoid further injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and the rest of the guards, who had noticed the commotion fanned out, searching the forests nearby. They found no sign of the assailant. She returned back to Dhasca. \"We're going to get back as soon as we can. Just stay down.\" She tried to stay calm, but her own heart was racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon their return, they told King Roland of the incident. He was busy examining the arrow. \"I'm so sorry,\" Nilmini said. \"I never meant for anything bad to happen like this. I don't even know where it came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dhasca's fine, but a bit shaken up. The twins are still alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" He then muttered to himself. \"This steel was forged in the royal smith...Vuko.\" He wouldn't put it past his high-strung concubine to hire an assassin to take back what she believed to be hers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The solid wooden door shut behind them. Dhasca and Nilmini both grimaced with worry as they looked at the small, darkened room the king had ordered them to be moved to. It wasn't much: just a large, comfortable bed, a few sitting areas, and everything was dark. Even the windows had been covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it have to be so dark?\" Dhasca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini shrugged. \"Don't know. It's kind of a tradition for this sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sighed and sat down on the bed. \"We're prisoners now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, nothing like that. Look, he's just worried about your safety and all. Trust me, I've learned a little about this 'confinement' thing. It's just a chance for you to get plenty of rest and to stay comfortable just before you give birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms. \"But we can't leave. I'm pretty sure that's the definition of prisoners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini sat beside her. \"But we'll get to leave this room after you have the twins. It's not as bad as you think. Besides, where exactly did you have big plans on going right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca rubbed her large, swollen middle. The twins were getting quite big...and heavy she thought. \"Well, I don't want to go much of anywhere right now. Rolling over in bed is a chore anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, it's perfectly fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fine! Nilmini, if he knew it was one of his concubines who tried to kill me, why hasn't he gotten rid of her? That would have been the sensible thing to do instead of locking me up in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You know him. He doesn't like giving up the things he likes. But look, we can make this work. Men aren't allowed in a woman's confinement chambers. It'll just be you and me for the next few weeks.\" She helped ease the elven queen onto the bed, stroking her middle all the while. \"Just the two of us, no interruptions. How about something to eat? That usually makes you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Nilmini helped push the last bit of their meal past Dhasca's lips. She swallowed. \"I don't think I could eat another bite,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because that was all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini laughed. \"Nope. You're really getting to where you can pack it away. I just can't get over how well you're growing.\" She took a handful of Dhasca's flabby lovehandles and squeezed. She couldn't get over how plush and soft the queen had become ever since moving into the palace. She still kept her delightfully plump pear shape, most of the weight settling into her round belly and hips, though her face was starting to look a little rounder these days. \"Besides, you're what, nearly fifteen stone now. That's got to require quite an appetite to keep that figure up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca laughed, letting her own hands run over her soft body. She was starting to enjoy the feel of it herself. It felt so wonderful to be loved and pampered in such a way. And she had to admit, she carried the weight well, she thought. It actually made her look more womanly, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lover was tracing circles on her side. \"You know, we've never really talked about how far we want to go with this...how big you want to be that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say I wanted to still be able to walk,\" Dhasca answered. \"That gives us quite a bit of room to work with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini smiled, an idea already coming to mind. \"I think we could get away with maybe thirty-two, thirty-three stone, that is if you're up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness, that's nearly twice my size now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll lose some of that when you have the twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, do you think he's going to have me have more children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly, is that something you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"I wouldn't mind it. But, I am worried about their safety.\" An odd thought came to her mind, but she decided not to talk about it just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Dhasca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini had finished her morning routine of checking on her lover's progress. Dhasca was getting to that point where she was very uncomfortable in her pregnancy. Moving was such a chore, and it seemed there was no comfortable position for her to rest. She was looking pretty weary by now. She shook her head. \"Same as always. At this point, it's just waiting.\" She patted Dhasca's belly, which had gotten tight and firm as a drum in the last few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca sighed. \"I know you don't want to rush,\" she said to the little ones, \"but you really need to get here soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful what you wish for,\" Nilmini said with a laugh. \"You just might get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat beside her and Dhasca leaned her head on her shoulder. \"I wouldn't mind that. I'm kind of ready to see them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get there soon enough. Just be patient.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had happened in the middle of the night a few weeks later. Nilmini had seen to it that Dhasca had stayed as comfortable as possible in her little nest in the confinement room. She was actually surprised that she had lasted this long. Twins usually came early, and it seemed that she would make it to full term with the two. But as they had just settled in to sleep for the night, Dhasca had jostled her awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's happening!\" she said breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Nilmini grumbled, still half-asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really think I'm starting to feel the contractions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been having those for the past week. It's a sign you're getting close, but you don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're more intense than the last few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini had agreed to get up and check on her just to put her at ease. But, she had to admit, it was a possibility. A few hours later, and Dhasca was really starting to go into labor. While true, the queen wasn't in any danger of complications (Nilmini saw to that), it certainly wasn't easy either. But nonetheless, the two were brought into the world safely: a boy and a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhasca, worn but overjoyed, held the two of them as they began to settle, nuzzling close to her. The boy was very quiet after the initial squalls after birth, and preferred snuggling as close as he could get to his mother. His ears were closed, and it was apparent they would turn into elven ones once he was older, but he had his father's face and eyes. A few strands of dark hair could be seen on the top of his head. The girl was a tad more restless, moving about and never settling for one position as she rested against her mother. Her face was more elven, but with human ears, and she already had a decent amount of red hair on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're beautiful,\" Dhasca said, truly content in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did great,\" Nilmini said, sitting beside her. \"Do you need me to hold one while you feed them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that. After all, they really should know you. I want you to a part of their lives too.\" She handed her the boy, as the girl was the one whimpering and seemed more eager to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini took the little future king in her arms, admiring his sweet, kind eyes. \"Have you thought of names yet?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen looked over at her, stroking the top of the girl's head. \"Roland said that if I had a son, he wanted him to have a more traditional name, as future heir and all. I've been reading some of the old histories in the libraries of the palace. I like Godfrey.\" She looked back at her daughter. \"And I think I'd like to name her Sylmae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's fitting.\" While Dhasca's mother had died young, she had been very close to her for how short a time they had together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first couple of hours, Dhasca took as much time as she could to enjoy the bond she had with her children, but even in all her excitement, she was still very exhausted from the ordeal. Nilmini helped her get the two laid down in the little cribs that had been brought into the room. She would get to leave the confinement room after she had rested a couple of days. In the meantime, she tried to get some sleep. Nilmini cuddled close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already miss the belly?\" Dhasca asked coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, now you're all soft and cuddly again.\" She said this while gently letting her hands squeeze around Dhasca's middle, careful not to make her feel sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm going to have to work at it to gain their combined weight again,\" she said, nodding over to the two sleeping babes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini hugged her even closer. \"I love you so much right now,\" she said. \"You know you're perfect, right? So, you're starting to like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little. I've really gotten used to eating this well. And, I have to admit, I do feel happier like this. Besides, I now know how easy it is to get you in the mood.\" She placed her lover's hands over her widened hips, letting her explore their softness. She could practically feel Nilmini's blush. She laughed. \"Just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe after a little rest, we'll get started on that, and I'll send for something to eat. I'm sure the king will more than likely provide a nice feast to his queen who just gave him a couple of heirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm worried about them, Nilmini. What happened with his concubine; that isn't going to just go away, and I'm sure she's not the only one who holds resentment. I'm actually scared, truly scared. How are we going to keep them protected?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilmini drew a long breath and then said, \"I have one idea, but...</span></div></div>",

Towering trees of various types, the soft echoing of birds deep in the woods, and there was even a small creek leading into the forest. It was true: this place was like a fairy tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Varehl Diamond-Fist wasn't here to admire the beauty of the forest. No, the Orc had something else in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling her long, onyx-black braid in her hand, Varehl took out a large piece of parchment from her bag and looked at it. On it were the names of all the locations in Yndyre. Adinah, Roiling Bay, and the Overvektige Peaks had been crossed off. Pyknos Verge was next on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, third's time the charm. I hope,\" Varehl said to herself. \"Just show them you mean no harm, and you might get some info on Zela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZela. It had been 2 years and Varehl still hasn't found anything that could even hint as to where she disappeared too. But elves were supposed to be attuned to nature. Maybe somehow, that could give Varehl a hint as to what happened to her only friend. If not, well, she could always see if they would need her alchemy skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplacing the parchment, Varehl sighed before entering the Verge. As she entered, she thought back to the last time she saw Zela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>2 years ago</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the guy who sold me the map said it was true,\" Zela said as she and Varehl sat at their camp a few miles away from the Overvektige Peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZela had heard about cave near the Peaks that was supposed to contain some sort of naturally occuring spring with healing water. She had the idea to put some in several flasks and sell it at the nearest market. Convincing Varehl to come along, the two found the cave. Unfortunately, not only had the story been a complete lie, but a large nest of Harpies had taken the cave as their home, and they weren't quite welcoming to intruders. Varehl had to pay them in food as an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because of that, we're short on food, and I'm pretty sure the harpies aren't going to welcome us back anytime soon,\" Varehl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZela frowned. \"Sorry,\" she said. She looked up at the moon. \"Ah well. Maybe it's a good thing. Less food means less weight in my butt. And I never liked the Peaks anyway. Too cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl stared at the naga, watching the moon bounce off her green scales. Zela's 6-foot tail was curled up under her, not even hiding her pear figure. Varehl looked back at her own rear. It was nowhere near as big, but Zela's eating habits were rubbing off on her a bit. Shaking her head, Varehl looked back at Zela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, I want to head back to Adinah. Maybe we can get some jobs and replace the food we-\" Varehl started to say, before seeing her friend had fallen asleep. Chuckling, Varehl laid back. \"Never mind, we'll talk in the morning.\" On that, she nodded off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been the last time Varehl ever saw her friend. When she had woken up, Zela was gone. Varehl thought she had gone off to scout ahead, but she never returned. She thought maybe she went back up to apologize to the harpies again, but they said she never came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, for 2 years, Varehl searched for her friend. Sometime during that, she had taken a liking, then an obsession, with a pear-shaped figure, and her own figure became one. If she wasn't looking for Zela, she was taking odd jobs, or just hanging around taverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Present Day</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been walking for about a half-hour, Varehl stopped remembering and starting thinking on how to introduce herself to the elves. They had only just started to get used to humans, so she wasn't sure how they'd react to a 7 foot, green-skinned Orc with big muscles and a bigger butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she thought of her butt, her mind wandered a bit. Maybe there were some elven girls with pear-shapes. She had heard the elves were willowy, so she wondered how a pear shape would look on them. But she immediately shook those thoughts away. She had to stay focused. She needed any sort of clue on Zela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she finally saw something. It was a person. And from the looks of it, it was indeed an elf. Smiling, Varehl began to approach the elf. As she got closer, she noticed it was a female elf, probably around her age, and was gathering... something, Varhel couldn't tell. And as she got closer still, Varehl noticed the elf did indeed have a slight but noticable pear shape to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl cleared her throat, and the elf turned to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Varehl began. \"My name is Varehl. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf looked at Varehl in...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsarra had been sent by her brother to go and collect some berries out on the edges of the village. At least that would be something for her to do and to stay out of his hair. True, Arlen loved his sweet twin sister, but she was sometimes a handful in his eyes. He just hoped that someday soon, a husband who could tolerate her would come along. Until then, she was just a lazy good-for-nothing who ate more than she should, in his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was considered rather plump, at least by elven standards. She couldn't help it. If they were meant to be thin, then why would the gods have made food taste so good? Arlen had clapped her ear for that response one day when she gave that as an answer when he chastised her excessive eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't like she genuinely was lazy. There was just so little to do these days, she thought, what with the wars over and everything. Plus, half the time, Arlen didn't like the way she did one thing and would instead do it himself, and then proceeded to call her lazy when she had nothing she was allowed to do by his standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, she was more than happy to be out and about. She actually liked being helpful. Course, her brother wouldn't be too happy with her if he saw her now. She perhaps ate half the berries she was collecting. They were hard to resist. They were just that sweet and ripe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra would have been content to continue just this way, but that was when she saw the hulking orc standing before her. At first, fear gripped her heart, and she could hear it thundering in her ears. She stood stock still, perhaps hoping that maybe she hadn't seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the creature spoke to her. \"Hello, my name is Varehl. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Tsarra had neveeer seen anything like her. She knew it wasn't a human, was it? She had heard stories about what humans were like, even if she hadn't seen one herself, and she didn't think this fit the description of what a human was. So what was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps what got her into trouble so much was her natural curiosity about the world. She always asked the questions others dared not to ask. She went to the places others feared to go. And in this case, this was someone she had never met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, the orc was unarmed, and hadn't threatened her, so that seemed safe. And, she looked lost. She felt bad for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded her head in a sort of bow. \"I am Tsarra. Are you lost?\" she asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc smiled as though she was glad for just this little bit of kindness in the world. \"Yes, actually. I've been on a long journey, looking for a friend. I'm not even sure where the first place to look would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. Arlen would not be pleased about this, but she felt the need to try and help her out. \"Why don't you come with me? At the very least, we can give you a good hot meal before you have to be on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would help a lot, thank you. What is it you were picking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if she remembered why she had been there in the first place. \"Oh, berries. My brother sent me to get them for dinner. I live with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl smiled coyly at her. \"They must've been good then, huh? You have a little berry juice on your lips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra hastily wiped it off. \"Oh, goodness! Thank you. Arlen would have my head if he knew I was eating all the stuff I was supposed to be getting. I'm getting much too fat as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl let out a hearty laugh, that was more like a snort. \"You, fat? I'd hardly call it that. You're such a tiny twig of a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back. \"I suppose I am small to your kind. What...what are you anyway?\" She blushed, realizing she had asked a rude question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem to mind. \"I'm an orc. I guess you guys don't get a lot of people like me around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, definitely not, Tsarra thought. And she wondered how the village would handle having an orc in their midst. By now, they had reached her home, and she could see Arlen waiting at the door impatiently. His impatience soon turned to fear very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you have an excuse for being so late,\" he had started to say. \"Sometimes I wonder if you just pretend to be lazy on purpose, you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped mid-sentence when he saw her guest. \"Tsarra, what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed, ready for a good lecture from him. \"This is Varehl. She's an orc, whatever that is, and she's lost. I said we could maybe help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to make him regain his senses. Arlen wasn't always intentionally mean. He loved her, and she knew it, but he was a bit of a perfectionist, and expected the same out of her. She never could understand how they shared a womb together all those years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane?\" he began. \"What were you thinking bringing her here? She's...she's...she could be dangerous. What if she had hurt you? What if she's planning on hurting us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up, realizing that Varehl was listening to them. \"You will stay for one night. We will give you directions, and you will leave, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl didn't exactly look too keen on being anywhere near him, but nodded her agreement.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About an hour later, Varehl was sitting at the table with Tsarra. Arlen had just finished making a soup, and set the berries in a bowl on the table, and sat with the two. From the looks he was shooting Varehl, he still wasn't happy with their impromptu guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Tsarra began. \"Why have you come to our home? We mostly only see other elves and satyrs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl frowned. \"I was actually hoping to speak with whoever is in charge. I've lost someone. A friend. Her name is Zela.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" Tsarra said. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Varehl replied. \"She just up and vanished one night. I've been searching for two years now. I've already checked several other place, but had no luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps your friend was kidnapped.\" Arlen finally spoke up. \"We've had that happen a few times here in the Verge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thought scares me more than any other.\" Varehl said. \"All I want is to find Zela, safe. Once I talk to your... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elders.\" Arlen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Once I speak to your elders, I'll be on my way.\" Varehl finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Arlen muttered, before turning to his soup. At this point, Varehl got the hint that he didn't want to talk anymore, and simply started to eat her own soup.<br>\r\nIn the corner of her vision, Varehl could see Tsarra digging into her soup with a surprising amount of vigor. It actually reminded Varehl of Zela a bit, with how much the naga adored pies. Put a pie in front of Zela, and it would be gone in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl chuckled at that memory, and looked at Tsarra again. The elf hadn't shown much fear when she saw Varehl, and seemed quite curious about her. She showed sadness when Varehl talked about her lost friend. This made Varehl wonder two things: how Tsarra and Arlen could be siblings, and if Tsarra would like to see more outside the Verge. She'd have to ask after supper.<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\nA little while after supper, Varehl was following Arlen. He opened a door, and led her into a small bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you'll be staying for the night. But only tonight.\" Arlen said curtly. \"Once you've spoken with the elders in the morning, you're leaving, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl nodded. Then she pursed her lips. \"Actually, I have a question. I've heard that the elves are slowly building relations with other races, so I was wondering: could Tsarra come with me?\" She asked. \"If she brought back good stories about other races, it might help you guys. Plus, I heard you call her lazy. This might get her more active.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArlen briefly looked at Varehl like she was completely mad, but then considered the last part. Tsarra was a rather care-free elf, and she did laze off and eat too much. Perhaps if she did this, it would teach her more responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd have to speak with the elders on that.\" He said. \"But I will say this: if it actually gets her to be responsible, I'd send her off. But if she gets hurt, I will hold you responsible.\" On that, he left the room and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl stood there for a moment, before sighing and walking over to the bed. The thing was obviously not built for someone nearly seven feet tall, so Varehl simply decided to sleep on the floor. She pulled the pillow and blanket from the bed, set them on the floor, and laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drifted off to sleep, she began dreaming about past times with her friend. Those had been the only dreams she had for 2 years, but they were still some of the best dreams ever, at least to her.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nSometime during the night, Varehl was woken up by the door opening. Looking up, she saw Tsarra, holding a candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to wake you, but I wanted to talk to you for a minute.\" Tsarra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl sat up, as Tsarra walked over to the bed and sat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overheard you talking to my brother. About letting me go with you.\" Tsarra said. \"It's the elder's choice, but I would love to go with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would?\" Varehl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra nodded. \"I've been rather curious about the other races. I haven't heard all that much about them. Only humans really.\" Tsarra said. \"There was one human who visited a while ago who ended up marrying an elder's daughter, Glesheri. The other elves didn't know, but the two were found out eventually. The elder disowned Glesheri, and the couple were being harrased so badly they had to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl frowned. \"Sounds awful.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. As did at least one other elder. While he didn't approve of the union either, even he thought this was too far. He's a bit more trusting to other races.\" Tsarra said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, he's the elder I get to talk to tomorrow.\" Varehl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra smiled. \"He is.\" She said. Then she thought for a moment. \"What's it like being so... big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl was confused for a moment, but then smiled. \"Well, the muscles are very helpful. Means I can fight really tough opponents, and most of the time win. I can also break stones with my bare hands.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Tsarra said. \"Incredible. But what about...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl got the hint. \"My butt? That's mostly from eating.\" She said. \"It's not much help. But Zela was fine with it. She had a similar build, only not as muscular. Actually, her butt ended up helping us escape once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How?\" Tsarra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how the rest of the night was spent: Varehl telling stories of her and Zela's adventures, as Tsarra listened. That night, a connection was formed.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nThe next morning, Arlen and Tsarra had taken Varehl to one of the elder's homes. Varehl obviously got some odd and sometimes worried looks from other elves, but they mostly just kept their distance from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the home, Arlen introduced Varehl to the elder. After an inital moment of shock from seeing her, the elder agreed to speak with her on the issue of Zela. Varehl sat down with the elder at a table, and began explaining her story. During this, she also asked the elder about taking Tsarra with her, explaining that it could help with relations to other races, and it would help her become responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished, the elder rubbed his chin in thought, before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is certainly a sad tale.\" The elder said. \"I'm afraid to say that no naga ever passed through the Verge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl frowned at this. \"Oh.\" She said, sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" The elder began. \"About two months ago, one of our scouting parties saw a caravan pass the entrance to the Verge. They described several people in the caravan. One of them claimed to see a green tail, about 6 feet in length. It sounds like your friend. From what I was told, the caravan was heading for the Spekkfitu Tundra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl face lit up. This was it! The first lead she had in 2 years! She stood in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Varehl said. \"You have no idea how much hearing that means to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" The elder said. \"Now, regarding your request for brining Tsarra with you. I'll need a minute to think about it.\" He then got up and went into another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, he returned. \"I've decided.\" He said. \"Tsarra...\"</span></div></div>",

I do believe with you, she does have a chance of staying protected. I doubt you've had too much trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl shrugged. \"No more than the usual person, but I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Very good then. Provided she is willing to accompany you, she may go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra was practically bouncing on the balls of her feet when Varehl told her the good news. \"I can come? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you'll just have to be careful. This isn't some kind of game. There are a few dangers out there. But, if you stick with me and do what I say, you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eagerly rushed to pack a few necessities. Arlen was waiting by the door, eager to get rid of the orc. \"You had better know what you're doing,\" he said. \"I really do love my sister, and I don't want to see anything happen to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be safe with me. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Varehl wasn't entirely certain of that. True, she would do her best, but she had faced her fair share of scraps that had been close calls. Plus, Tsarra wasn't exactly warrior material here. She wouldn't be able to help all that much in a fight when it came right down to it. At least, she could maybe hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra was ready to leave fairly quickly, and she eagerly hugged her brother as he rattled off instructions like a nagging mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, be careful. Don't go anywhere without Varehl. Help her when she says to. And please, don't get in the way and follow directions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"I'll be fine. I think I'll be pretty safe with an orc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged her again, noticing that she felt even softer than usual. Hm, too much snacking between meals, he thought. Hopefully, all this travel would help her lose a little weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two set off on their own by midday, and were out of the range of the village within an hour. The Verge was still fairly big, and it would take them several days to get out of it. This was when Varehl was first made aware of how little Tsarra knew about the outside world. She hardly knew where they were once they were out of the village. So, the orc had to rely on her maps, hoping for the best, as she tried to head north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where is it we're going?\" Tsarra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The elder I spoke to said there may be a lead up near Spekkfitu Tundra. It's way up north. We'll have to pass through Racovania and Overvektige Peaks to get there, though. It'll be a long journey. But, hopefully, we can catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf thought for a moment. \"What's the north like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. I've never been there much myself. I expect it's cold though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl looked over at her traveling companion and realized that may be a problem. The orc was at least big and thick. At least she'd have some protection against the cold. A pale, thin thing like Tsarra wouldn't really do all that well up there. Hopefully, they'd find some fur traders to buy some cloaks from to stay warm. That, or they'd have to get creative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they could cross that bridge when they came to it. They were still a long ways off from getting anywhere near the north. When they had stopped to rest for the night, they made camp in a small clearing. Varehl went out hunting for their dinner, while Tsarra stayed back, setting up the camp and getting fresh water. When the orc came back with a large elk, the elf's eyes nearly bugged out. \"You got all that for dinner?\" she asked, looking over the massive creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not all of it,\" Varehl said. \"I mean, we can save some of the meat for a few days before it goes bad, but you do know that orcs need a lot of food to keep up our strength, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her friend's significantly larger frame. \"I suppose that does make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl took to skinning the animal and cooking a large portion of it over the fire. The skins would make a good blanket to help keep them warm as they got farther north, she thought. Once the meat warmed over their fire, she took to devouring her piece with great gusto, having missed having a good meal in a while. Tsarra only ate a bit, but Varehl could tell she was longing for a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you can have more if you want,\" she said. \"Your brother isn't around to tell you no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the meat cracking over the fire. \"I probably shouldn't,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl shrugged. \"You know, you're not really all that big. In all honesty, you probably could use a little more meat on your bones. Elves are incredibly frail looking, I've decided. I don't know how you guys do it. But, whatever. More for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made the elf laugh, and she was glad to have been able to put her at ease. \"Alright, I guess a little more couldn't hurt,\" she said, reaching for another piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit! Trust me, if there's one thing you're going to have to get used to with me, it's eating well whenever you can. Never know when you'll get another meal.\"</span></div></div>",

Usually, she would be interrupted by an angry animal she'd easily kill, or an angry person she'd manage to drive away. But tonight, she was finally able to get a full nights sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she was much more refreshed then usual when the sun rose. Varehl looked over at Tsarra, who was still fast asleep. Chuckling a little at just how adorable she looked, Varehl gently nuged the snoring elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, time to wake up. We've got to move.\" Varehl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra groaned, and slowly opened her eyes. \"What time is it?\" She asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on the position of the sun, I'd say somewhere between 10 and 11.\" Varehl answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that, Tsarra giggled a little. \"Arlen usually has me up around 7 in the morning. I don't really like waking up early.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't usually have a choice.\" Varehl said. \"To me, this is rare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra frowned. \"That's no good. You should be able to wake up whenever you want.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl just shrugged. \"Come on. We've got a few hours before we reach the tundra.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra nodded, and after the two cleaned up the tiny camp, they headed off.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nAbout two hours later, the two were walking down a large dirt road. Spekkfitu Tundra was still a few days walk away. The two would first have to pass through Racovania, then the Overvektige Peaks, which Varehl wasn't exactly looking forward too. There were some harpies there that still held a grudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that wouldn't be for a while. The first thing Varehl wanted to focus on was at least getting to Racovania. From there, they could hopefully catch a caravan for the rest of the trip and cut down on travel time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it going to be much longer?\" Tsarra asked. \"It's rather hot, and I'm getting rather hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl had to agree on that. The heat was becoming rather bothersome, and Varehl herself was growing famished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Varehl said to Tsarra. \"I've travelled this road before. There's a tavern a few miles ahead. Owned by a married couple. Zela and I helped them with a bandit problem sometime before she vanished, and they said I and any of my friends could eat free anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Zela must have travelled a lot.\" Tsarra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl nodded. \"That was mainly what we did. Got into scraps, helped out some people, made more people angry, and just wandered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Tsarra said, intrigued. \"You've had such a fascinating life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl chuckled. \"Tell you what. We get to that tavern and eat, and I'll tell you my life story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra smiled at that prospect.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nAnother 2 hours of walking and occasional stops to rest later, Varehl and Tsarra came up to a building. The sight made Varehl smile. This was the tavern she had mentioned to Tsarra. It was a two story building, simple in construction. A sign above the door read \"Homestead Tavern\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made their way to the building and entered. Much like the outside, the inside was simple, more resembling a cozy home then a tavern. The only way you could tell it was a tavern was the counter in the back and the numerous tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the bar were a human male and a Futakuchi-Onna. The man was tall and skinny with sandy-blonde hair and a small beard. He was wearing an apron. The Futakuchi-Onna was shorter with long, wild black hair. She was a very fat woman, her white gown strained over her wide frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked up and saw Varehl and Tsarra enter. With surprising speed, she left the counter and ran up to greet Varehl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Varehl! It's so good to see you again!\" The woman said. She then saw Tsarra. \"Oh! Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my current travelling companion, Tsarra.\" Varehl said. \"Tsarra, this is Aoi and her husband, Des.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDes smiled as he walked up to the two. \"Always nice to see you drop by, Varehl.\" He said. Then he frowned. \"Still nothing on Zela?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I got a lead from the Pyknos Verge. I'm heading for Spekkfitu Tundra. Thought we'd stop here for a bit.\" Varehl said. \"And I'm also kind of showing Tsarra around. She doesn't know the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm certain she'll love the area.\" Aoi said. \"So, take a seat anywhere, and we'll get you a hot meal. I'm guessing the usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl smiled. \"You know me so well.\" She said. On that, she and Tsarra went over to a table and sat down. Aoi and Des went through a nearby door to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem very nice.\" Tsarra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are.\" Varehl replied. \"Everytime I come down this road, I make a point to stop here. I've offered to help them out from time to time, but they always refuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Tsarra said. Then she thought of something. \"You said you were going to tell you're life story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much to tell.\" Varehl said. \"My parents were killed in a hunt when I was a kid, and I was adopted by an alchemist. Maria. She tought me alchemy and combat. Left home when I was 18, been travelling ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Tsarra said. \"When did you meet Zela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4 years ago. She was looking for some pirate treasure. The pirates weren't ready to give it up. I happened to be walking by and helped her escape. We instantly became friends after that. We adventured together for 2 years. Then she vanished, and... well, here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra was about to say something when Des came back into the room. He walked up to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, forgot to ask, what do you two want to drink?\" Des asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me. I'm taking ale.\" Varehl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just take a glass of water.\" Tsarra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, and it's going to be a while before the food's ready, just to let you know.\" Des said, before heading behind the counter.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nDes was right when he said it would be a while. About 3 hours later, Varehl and Tsarra were discussing some of Varehl and Zela's adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so now the poor succubus has a butt so big, it doesn't fit through her door. Guess she deserved it for conning Zela and that kitsune.\" Varehl finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra giggled a little. She was about to say something when Des and Aoi finally entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner is served!\" Aoi said, as she and Des revealed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dinner is served!\" Aoi siad, as she and Des revealed a huge feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl couldn't believe it. There had to be some kind of mistake. Even she and Zela couldn't have eaten that much on their best days. Plate upon plate was set at their table, and she was having trouble taking it all in. Did they get the wrong order? Tsarra also looked surprised, her eyes barely contained in her skull as she saw all the delicious foods set before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Aoi,\" Varehl started to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her off. \"Oh, I know it's more than the usual. No charge, I promise. I just saw this adorable little one you've got with you and couldn't resist. She looks like she hasn't seen a good meal in ages. Are elves always that scrawny? And if you're heading out to the Tundra, the poor little thing is going to freeze to death without a few extra layers on her.\" She patted Tsarra on the shoulder and shook her head. \"See, much too thin. You two enjoy your meal now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the couple wandered off, Varehl looked back to Tsarra. \"I'm sorry about that. She means well and everything, but she can sometimes be a little 'too' helpful. I think it's something about her people's culture. Trust me, I think she's personally responsible for Zela and I adding a few inches to our frames. You really don't have to eat all that much if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf gave her a small smile. \"But, it does look good,\" she said. \"And, it's cute that she called me skinny. I've never been called that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Tsarra an odd look. \"But you are, if we're being totally honest. I've been all over the world. I mean, compared to what I've seen in Adinah, you'd be considered downright starving. Has your brother really made you feel like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf had already started to dig into the food, grabbing several different things to put on her plate. \"No, it's not just him,\" she said between bites. \"I mean, he doesn't do it to be mean. He just worries about me. It's been just the two of us since we were teenagers. Our father was killed in the wars with the satyrs and our mother got sick shortly after that. So, he's always trying to make sure we're able to make it on our own. I think sometimes he worries if I'll be okay by myself. We are twins after all. We've always had each other for longer than we can remember. I wonder if he's worried what he'll do without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl nodded and started getting some food herself. She didn't exactly see what Tsarra saw in her own brother. To her, he was cold and sometimes cruel to her, but if Tsarra saw the good in him, good for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued. \"But, it isn't just him. I know what other elves look like. I'm a little heavier than them. I'm not blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't want you to feel like you're unattractive because of it. A lot of guys would be lucky to have a girl like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. \"Oh, I don't mind it. Food is too good to want to pass up on. If I end up larger for it, so be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she certainly lived up to that mantra. Varehl hadn't seen anyone with an appetite like hers since Zela. Tsarra was eager to try at least one of everything, and still had room for seconds. The orc was impressed. Looking at the scrawny little elf, she would never have guessed she could put away as much as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, after a while, the two travelers' eating began to slow. Varehl was feeling pleasantly full, as she always did after a good meal from Des and Aoi. Tsarra, on the other hand, looked like a goose, stuffed just before a winter feast. Her thinner frame meant that her overly full stomach was much more noticeable. She rubbed at it gently, a small grimace of pain on her face. \"You didn't make yourself sick, did you?\" Varehl asked, genuinely worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hiccupped. \"No, but I may have eaten a little too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"No kidding. I think your eyes were bigger than your stomach this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra was about to speak when Aoi came over, setting a pie down, fresh from the oven. She looked the elf up and down. \"Well, now that's more like it,\" she said. \"You sure she's getting enough to eat, Varehl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she's just not used to all these different kinds of foods outside the Verge. She wanted to try everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe futakuchi-onna laughed heartily. \"Well, that's my kind of girl. I hope when you both come back from your trip, she's looking much healthier. Anyway, I thought I'd bring her a little something sweet to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All for me?\" Tsarra asked, her ears perking at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you haven't seen those women up north. You've got a lot of catching up to do. You both staying the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarehl looked outside. It was already dark out, and Tsarra looked too full to be traveling in her state. \"Yeah, looks like. You still got some empty rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked. \"For you, of course. I'll tell Des to make sure there's a hearty breakfast ready for you in the morning.\" She waddled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsarra looked at the pie, and groaned a little. Varehl laughed. \"I'll help you eat that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because I think I can only get a few bites in. I've never eaten so much in my life.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun was rising above the vast forest of Pyknos Verge. The light permeated through the branches of the trees and lighted up the Verge, which began to take life. The birds began singing different melodies, and some villagers left their huts to work in the gardens or to go about their daily lives. After not even an hour more elves spread into the village, and the natural sounds of the area reached every corner of the Verge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more than two hours since the sun brought light to the Verge, in a house on the outskirts, Glesheri opened her eyes and came out from under the blankets. Her long fawn-brown hair was all messy and covered her face. She stretched her skinny arms while making a big yawn and got up from bed. She was very tired from the night before, spent cuddling with Nessar, her new husband, whom she married secretly only a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed the hair from her face and washed it with the water in a basin. That was really necessary to help her wake up in the mornings...and realize that her willowy body was completely naked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed to the wardrobe (She thought she remembered that word right. Human devices and such were hard to remember sometimes.) and picked an emerald-colored dress with long and large sleeves and a gown that reached her ankles, she tied the ribbon around her waist, as the dress was large, and put on a pair of loafers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Glesheri was combing her hair, Nessar was in the kitchen, preparing the breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was a young 25 year-old man with shoulder-length, black, messy hair and a little beard under his chin. Due to his lean build, he decided to become a scholar and one day he went to study the elves. He would have never thought that this decision ended up being so meaningful in his life. But there he was, living in a little house in the Verge with the Glesheri, the elf he had fallen in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning he woke up earlier than usual (stupid cockatrice), so he had more time to check the vegetable garden, and boy, there was a lot to collect. They didn't have a large garden, but that day he could pick up half of the vegetables he planted, including all the potatoes. He collected enough stuff to fill two chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar moved a lock of his black hair from his forehead wet by the steam of the stew he was preparing. After the smell of rosemary was strong enough, he decided it was ready and could serve it. That day, he decided to make a special dish for Glesheri. The stew itself wasn't anything special, just a broth with some potatoes, carrots minced meat and spices, but it meant a lot for the couple, as it was the first dish Nessar made for Glesheri. Until now, they had lived off of the stores that had been sent to him by the scholars who had sent him on his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the stew in the bowl, but noticed a problem: he made a bit too much, and a single bowl was not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now what should I do?\" muttered Nessar, scratching his chin. He could've eaten some, but he already ate enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was thinking of the solution, Glesheri jumped in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, honey,\" said the elf, walking energically, with her long straight hair waving side to side at every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, dear,\" replied the man putting the bowl next to the chair, \"look at what I made today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, stew!\" said Glesheri with a big smile. \"Thank you! You know I how much I love it.\" She kissed her husband on the cheek and sat on the table, where she began eating the breakfast-lunch. It was delicious, the pork was especially good, and it was something the elves didn't eat very often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should make human cuisine more often. It has something that elven food doesn't,\" commented Glesheri, putting another spoon in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would, but the ingredients aren't so easy to get here,\" replied Nessar, watching with satisfaction how blissful Glesheri was in that moment. \u201cMy fellow scholars should be sending me a new shipment of supplies from Adinah fairly soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long time after, the bowl was already empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, there's still more. I've accidentally made too much,\" said Nessar, pointing at the pot in the middle of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, thank you! I feel I could eat it forever,\" said Glesheri, handing the bowl to him for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar served more and the elf began digging in. Since she met Nessar, Glesheri became more curious about the humans' customs, and there wasn't a day where she didn't ask him something about human life. It was sad that the others of her own kind didn't have the same interest she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" said Nessar, scratching his neck, \"do your parents know about us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" answered Glesheri. Her parents were very strict about this. She remembered their reactions when she told them she met a human. She wondered what they might say now that she asked for Yva's blessing... still, she'd been missing for a week; they'd find out soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to talk to them about it? I can come with you if you need support.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I can handle it alone. Is there more?\" asked Glesheri, looking inside the pot. There was still a little in the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri leaned back on the chair. She was full, maybe even more than full. But she couldn't resist. Nessar was an amazing cook, especially when he prepared meals using human ingredients, and was also very affectionate to her. This first week of marriage had been an amazing one, and she didn't bother about what the others might think; the two were happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri stood up. Her stomach was full and round at that moment, and felt heavy. Suddenly, Nessar hugged her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've enjoyed the meal,\" commented the man, gently patting Gleshira's belly. It was round, full of his stew, a different sensation compared to her usually flat belly\u2026 and he liked it, probably because it brought memories of the women of Adinah, which were much curvier than the elves. Still, he loved her much more than any woman from his birthplace, and would've done anything to satisfy her, but if she had some more curves, maybe... Or perhaps there would come the day when there would be their future child in that belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a kiss on the mouth, followed by, \"I'm tired, I think I'm going to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready?\u201d Nessar said with concern. \u201cBut, you just got up? Are you feeling well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just eating a big meal like that made me a bit sleepy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Glesheri left and went back to the bedroom. She collapsed on the mattress, with her long hair all around her. Glesheri closed the eyes, relaxed. She could use a little rest to digest all that stew.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there was one thing that Nessar worried about, it was that he feared he wouldn't be a good enough husband for Glesheri. He wasn't exactly like the typical male elves out there. He was a thin, scraggly scholar, not a strapping, muscular hunter, like what she was probably used to. He didn't even really hunt for their meat at all. Sure, he laid a few small traps for things like rabbit or squirrel, but mostly, he relied on the shipments of supplies his college of fellow scholars sent him for basic necessities, and even then, it was only enough stores for one person for a few weeks, not the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really wanted to do something special for the two of them. She really deserved better than him, he thought. He peaked into the door of their bedroom, watching her sleep peacefully, with that same smile she always had. He would do anything for that smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could still remember how they first met. He had been sent on a mission to document and study the elves of the Verge. The king was going to pay his college a fair amount to bring back information about this unknown species. Nessar thought he had a pretty good vantage point in the forest where he could observe them without being seen. That worked for a while, until he tripped and fell out of the bushes in a heap, right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she was terrified, and she screamed and ran away from him. He felt awful having frightened her like that. Still, that hadn't stopped her curiosity, because she was back again within a week. This time, he came prepared, and tried to tell her he meant no harm. It took several days, but eventually, she gained the bravery to approach him and speak. Slowly, they had become friends. She would tell him about life among the elves, and he would tell her stories about humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was always the brave one, he realized. Glesheri was the first to dare to kiss him. At first, it was just a quick peck, but they both knew it was something meant to be. Not long after that, they were seeing each other romantically, and before too long, he had proposed to her, wanting nothing more than to spend the rest of his life with the beautiful and brave elf. She eagerly accepted, but made him undergo an elven marriage ceremony in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar sighed to himself, thinking of fond memories. He walked to the small larder on the side of the house to grab the last of the flour. Today, he thought he might try his hand at baking some bread. Elves knew about that at least, when it came to food. They had had enough peace in their Verge recently to actually start growing some wild wheat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, Nessar wasn't much of a baker. He could cook, or at least his wife told him he could anyway, but this required just a little more finesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, he could hear Glesheri stirring. \"Hey,\" he said, sitting beside her, stroking her hair. \"I uh...tried making a little lunch, but it didn't quite come out right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out a plate of roasted rabbit and some incredibly flat bread. Glesheri laughed and kissed his cheek. \"Well, I think it's wonderful,\" she said. \"And I am a bit hungry. So, what are you working on today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe munched on the food while Nessar spoke. \"Well, I wanted to get started on the next chapter of my document on elves. You really helped a lot with that marriage ceremony. That was fascinating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope it wasn't only for your research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, but it was nice to learn about. Anyway, I was hoping you could explain to me about the elders and the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"I could try, though I don't get all that involved in politics. Besides, don't humans have a king?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's kind of different. Finished already? You sure you're not still hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessar, I'm fine, don't worry so much. You keep feeding me as good as this, and I'll start to get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and leaned forward to kiss her forehead. \"You know, back where I come from, a fat wife is a good sign a man is successful. It means he makes enough to keep his family fed and then some. In some cases, it's a good sign his wife has had many children as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Thinking of children already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Considering we've been going at it like rabbits these past few days, it's bound to happen eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got quiet and contemplative then. But eventually, whatever thought had gone through her mind passed on. \"You're joking about that fat wife thing, aren't you? I still don't understand human humor all that well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, heading for the door. \"You don't believe me? I'll have to take you to Adinah sometime to see for yourself. Now, come on, busy day ahead of us, and you've slept halfway through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri stood up, and grabbed Nessar's arm, pulling him back towards the bed. \"Oh, no you don't. In case you've forgotten, I've still got that newlywed glow about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught the seductive tone of her voice, and started reluctantly following her. \"Oh, do you now? Well, what are we to do about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of something.\"</span></div></div>",

She dressed up and combed her hair as usual and went to the kitchen, where she found her breakfast: a bowl with mashed potatoes and some minced meat, plus a piece of bread made with the last of the flour remaining. There wasn't much more because the food stock was almost empty. That made her remember where Nessar went: to pick up the new food shipment that had to come that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri smiled at the sight of that nice, if little, breakfast. She found sweet that her husband found the time to prepare her breakfast, and she made sure to enjoy it. It was still warm, with steam wafting from the meat. Nessar must have left not long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakfast was really good and Glesheri felt satisfied, too bad there wasn't more. She decided spend the morning working on the garden, but there wasn't much to do, so after not even an hour she dropped on the bed. She was getting into this habit of waking up early, eating breakfast, and going back to sleep. It was hard not to be tempted to do so. With a warm meal in her belly, finding very little to do in the mornings, and strangely feeling tired a lot, a good rest always felt nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after Nessar was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I'm home,\" said the man, opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri stood up and greeted her husband with a hug, and the tackle ended up knocking him on the ground. Nessar made a grumble of pain but Glesheri shut him up with a kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you,\" whispered Glesheri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only went to take the food shipment,\" replied Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but it felt like it lasted a century,\" she said back, tightening her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, I love you too,\" said Nessar gently pushing Glesheri. \"Were you still asleep? I left a breakfast for you,\" commented Nessar, scratching his head, and noticing she came from the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already eaten it,\" answered Glesheri patting her flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you went straight back to bed. You want to eat and laze around all day?\" said Nessar with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri crossed her arms and made a pout. \"Hey, I've also worked at the garden, but there wasn't much to do and I was getting bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, I have to plant some new... oh, speaking of food, help me with the shipment,\" said Nessar grabbing his wife by the arm and dragging her outside, where there was a little wooden cart with six large boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fellow said that since my research is doing well, they brought more food than usual,\" explained Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri placed an hand on Nessar's shoulder. \"Did you tell them about our marriage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man blushed and scratched the back of his head. \"No, I simply told them I needed more stocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" said the elf with a whistle and went to take one of the boxes to find out she couldn't lift them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me help you!\" yelled Nessar running to help his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're so heavy,\" commented Glesheri while taking the box to the free corner of the kitchen. \"What did they have? Boulders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but the food must last for a month.\" said Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dropped the first box and Glesheri was already heavily breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, after we finish loading these, I can make you a human lunch as a reward,\" said Nessar with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri gave him a little kiss on the cheek and felt suddenly full of energy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar had made lunch, and this time Glesheri observed so she could learn. Maybe one day she'd prepare lunch for her husband. She was interested in seeing how he was cooking the beef, a kind of meat that was almost unheard among the Elves, and was fascinated by how the grease poured out, making the meat reflect the light. She noticed how he handled the spices, tough she didn't remember them all, and could already smell a much better perfume that made her hungry. She also helped in the kitchen, peeling the remaining few potatoes and cutting a few carrots and boiling them all in a pot with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, lunch was ready. Nessar realized how he, again, made more than usual, maybe because seeing all that stock of food made him use more and didn't think that the food had to last for an entire month. But he decided to let it go, next time he'd be more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up!\" said Nessar serving Glesheri a slice of beef almost larger than the plate, he kept the smaller one for himself. Only the best for his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the elf didn't leave anything, and even ate all the vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" asked Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri nodded. \"But a piece of bread couldn't hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but we are out of flour. The shipment didn't give me any. Apparently, there's a famine of wheat and they had to keep them for the people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can go and ask to the neighbor down the way, he's got a nice wheat field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, we? You mean you and me?\" asked Nessar with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri nodded with a big smile. \"We can't keep this relationship secret forever. Sooner or later I want the other to see us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar patted her arm. He would like to make their relationship public, but remembered how the Elves watched Glesheri when the two interacted, and weren't even a thing yet. He didn't want his wife to become an outcast because of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's make it later...?\" he replied, still feeling unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri rolled her eyes. \"Fine, but I want a lot of bread for this evening then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? And who was the one worried about getting fat yesterday?\" joked Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a day off,\" replied Glesheri with a wink of her eye and sticking out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is, three sacks of flour,\" said a middle-aged elf, while a female elf of the same age, his wife, loaded the commodity on the little wooden handcart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's your salads,\" said Glesheri, passing the small green salad heads in exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you making bread?\" asked the elf. Bread was something still new for the elves, who had only recently discovered wheat, and not many tried it, as it was a human's recipe, but the few that did liked it, and Glesheri was one of them. Actually, she loved how crust was crispy and the crumbs were soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back home with the handcart behind her, whistling a happy melody, wondering what Nessar would make for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nessar just couldn't resist. Frequently, he was cooking more than necessary for the two of them. Perhaps it was because he wasn't used to cooking. Back at his college, they had their own cooks, who saw to all their meals. So, he never had to actually plan or make anything himself. Not that he didn't know how, but he wasn't used to thinking about portion sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other problem was that he couldn't help but feel the need to make sure Glesheri was well taken care of. He still worried about not being good enough for her, and often made up for it with plenty of extra food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that Glesheri had a pretty strong appetite. Mostly, it was because she was so fascinated by human foods and wanted to savor them all. For as much extra as Nessar could give her, she found herself eating what he gave, and more if she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis came with a particular added bonus, for Nessar anyway. It was hard not to notice that Glesheri had started to put on some weight. Given her routine of eating large meals and sleeping most of the day, it was bound to happen. She had developed an adorable little round belly, her hips had widened with a little extra padding, and her sweet round face had developed a beautiful plump glow. Nessar especially liked cuddling with her at night as soft as she was starting to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Glesheri had seemed to take notice. Either she hadn't realized it was happening, or it didn't particularly bother her. Nessar actually thought it was pretty good for her. She looked like a healthy, well-fed woman. He always did wonder how elves made it as thin as they were. It looked like they were barely surviving in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all this did come with one small problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" Nessar murmured to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had gone to the larder to grab the items needed in preparation for lunch that day, only to discover the inevitable. With all the extra portions he had been making, they had been going through their stores much faster than he had anticipated. Sure, he had expected that they would go faster than what he had planned. After all, the stocks were made for one person, not two. However, they had gone through it even faster. They weren't going to last another week like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have to think of something, and soon. They needed a plan to keep going. And he knew this was something they needed to think about. They couldn't keep relying on food shipments and would need to figure out how to make their own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, he'd have to tell Glesheri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bad,\" Glesheri said after he had explained it all to her. \"Maybe I shouldn't have eaten so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did nothing wrong,\" Nessar said, stroking her hand as they sat together, having this conversation. \"The truth is, we're still getting used to living with each other, and that means we have to make a few adjustments. We'll get it figured out. We'll get into a rhythm that works for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, thinking it over. \"I'm not sure exactly. Right now, we can go for about a week with what we have. And the next shipment wouldn't come in for another couple weeks, so we just got to figure out that last week, right? We'll come up with something. We always do work things out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tall ears drooped a little. Of all the things that had been a real eye opener to him was how elves used their ears like eyebrows: the movement of them conveyed a lot of elven emotions. At first it was really hard to read some of Glesheri's responses. He had to relearn communications all over again. But eventually, he had gotten the hang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he knew that his wife was still sort of blaming herself, and felt disappointed. He squeezed her hand. \"It's not your fault,\" he said. \"We would've had to figure out these things anyway. I'm afraid if I don't start showing my fellow scholars some results, they're going to start cutting my funding. So, we were going to need to know how to start making our own way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Okay, so what can I do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought. \"We might have to try several different things. I might have to try my hand at actually hunting, meaning that maybe you could help me with the garden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about our neighbors? Nessar, they will help us if we're really that in need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correction: they'd help you, not me. We just have to be careful about that. Now, how about a little something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, standing up. \"Yes, silly. I'm not going to have you starve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was more than happy to make another full meal for her, all the while wondering what they were going to do to obtain their food now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Glesheri with a little bow, making her long hair roll in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, I'm sorry I couldn\u2019t give you more,\" replied the old elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, two rabbits are more than enough,\" replied Glesheri, patting the elf's curved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went forward the next house, dragging the handcart behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri and Nessar decided to ask help from the other elves in the village, and many were so nice they gave her food without even asking for something back. Maybe it was because it was a very prolific period, or maybe because the festival was in a few days, and the atmosphere that generated around it's preparations made everyone more generous. One thing was sure, no one helped her because they thought she was starving. While her new curves weren't noticeable, she looked a bit more padded than the average lean elf. She hardly heard the few whispers and murmurs of her neighbors as they speculated on these changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would've liked to go asking with Nessar, but her husband was still afraid they wouldn't have trusted him, and maybe they'd have refused to give food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri didn't complain, as she still felt it was her fault. For every meal Nessar made, Glesheri couldn't leave any leftovers, partially because she didn't want to waste his husband's work, and partially because she really enjoyed his dishes. Sometimes she was even tempted to ask for more, but didn't want to aggravate the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Glesheri's appetite played a role in the fast consuming of the food, Nessar's caring nature played an as big of one if not bigger. The young man knew he should've reduced his portions, but wasn't willing to do so; his wife was so happy when she was eating, and couldn't dare to give her less food than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the elves' generosity, Glesheri came back with the handcart filled with food. This would last for a week, but considering her husband's portions, she wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar heard the sweet whistles of his wife while he was in the study, working on his research. As he needed more food for he and Glesheri to go on, he decided to work more; maybe this would convince the king to give him more stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already back?\" asked Nessar with a surprised expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" replied Glesheri, jumping in Nessar's arms. While true, she was still small, he couldn\u2019t help but notice that she was indeed heavier. \"The cart was becoming heavy, and I think the food is enough for a while\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchanged a long kiss. There wasn't a particular reason except that the two felt really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you seduce them to get so much food?\" joked Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot!\" said Glesheri giving a playful slap on his cheek. \"How could I seduce anyone but you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're natural beauty is enough to seduce anyone,\" replied Nessar, putting her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone wants more cuddles tonight?\" asked Glesheri in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be bad, but at the moment some help in bringing this stuff to the larder is enough\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar grabbed a little sack with flour (good, more bread, thought Nessar) and what must have been a deer's filet, only to quickly run inside the house as if a vulture was ready to assault. Glesheri was confused by this act, but then noticed the neighbor\u2019s head popping from the fence and realized everything. She sighed and grabbed the rabbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they brought all the stuff inside, Nessar noticed a sack of seeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who gave you this stuff?\" he asked to his wife, showing the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Romelia. I thought some seeds could have been useful for the future.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar hugged her. \"You're a genius! I'll plant them now, what are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're bumblebeans; they grow pretty fast and are easy to cultivate,\" explained Glesheri with a proud smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, show me how to plant them then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went to the garden, and planted the seeds in a remaining spot. New vegetables were definitely useful, as at the moment there wasn't anything that could've been harvested before the end of the month. Glesheri explained how cultivate them and how they could be cooked or used for medical purposes while Nessar took notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting, I'll write about them in my research,\" commented Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about a chapter about Yva's festival? It's gonna be in a few days,\" asked Glesheri leaning against her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" commented the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I guess you\u2019ll come with me, so you can see it with your own eyes,\" proposed Glesheri, now face to face with Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar became nervous. \"I'm not sure it can work...\" <br>\r\nBut Glesheri, with a frown, interrupted, \"We can't keep this a secret forever! You don't have to be afraid! I swear if they try to lay a hand on you, I'll kick them. Please, this festival is important to me, now more than ever. You have to come. It\u2019s tradition for married couples to go and ask for Yva to bless them with children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if they get angry at you? I don't care about what happen to me, I'm worried about you. Wait\u2026children?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri shut him up with a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter what the others think of us,\" said the elf. \"I love you, and if they can't understand our love, too bad for them. And, yes, children, silly. This will be our first festival like this together. I want to make it special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was astonished, and couldn't say anything except kissing her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" said Nessar, \"I'll come\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri smiled. \"Perfect! I bet it will be a beautiful festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got inside, Nessar thought at first to continue his research, but then changed his mind and picked up the flour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To having the great idea of taking the seeds, I'll give you extra bread, this time with oil,\" said Nessar mixing the food with the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, go easy, boy. I don't want to run out of food again,\" said Glesheri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, besides, I know you want it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri didn't reply but took a seat while watching with glee as her husband made their meal. She didn't want to admit it, but he was right, and couldn't wait to eat this \"bread with oil.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, explain this to me again,\" Nessar said as he walked her to the center of the village for the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, holding his hand all the way. \"Well, a couple goes and touches the statue of Yva, and they both make a wish for how many children they desire. If both man and wife asked for the same number of children, Yva will bless them with their wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so how many are you wanting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"That's not how it works. I can't tell you, or it won't come true. We have to know each other that well.\" She winked at him for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"Oh, all right. I'll do it your way. Glesheri, are you sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was still very worried about how the other villagers would take it knowing they were now a couple. It was one thing when they knew he was an academic observer to their culture. They allowed him to proceed, but otherwise gave him the cold shoulder. So long as he left them alone, they would leave him alone. Now, this was another matter entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Of course. We can't keep hiding forever. Nessar, I love you. I want to have a life together. I want to have a family with you. We can't do that if we're always in hiding. Now, come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led him into the main center of the village. There were elves everywhere, visiting, talking, enjoying the abundance of food. New mothers were showing off the children they had had as a gift from Yva last year to friends and family. Children ran through the villages, playing games. It was all rather peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there were murmurs and whispers as they began to take notice of him. They still didn't notice that he was married to her. For now, they assumed she was just showing him around. But, they would know soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past several weeks of their marriage, Glesheri had been enjoying the flavors and tastes of human foods, but now, she spent a lot of time showing Nessar all the delicious foods elves had to offer. He couldn't help but enjoy her childlike wonder at the whole thing. It even took away some of his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as they got closer to the center of the village that those nerves returned. He knew they were getting close to the main event of this festival. \"There,\" Glesheri said, pointing to the stone effigy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar had heard many tales about the goddess of fertility, yet he had never seen an artistic depiction of her until now. A few times, there were some statues or tapestries of gods like Araris or Ciros in Adinah, but Yva was a goddess of nature. She really had no place in a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue was of a beautiful elven woman, heavily pregnant, gently caressing her belly, awaiting the birth of the new life within her. He had always heard that Yva created the elves, and it never occurred to him that for that reason, she herself was depicted as an elf. That made sense now that he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as several couples approached the statue, touching the rounded stone belly of the goddess, sometimes leaving a small offering, and murmuring their prayers for the blessing of family. Glesheri nudged him. They were next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, but followed dutifully behind her. But before they could get there, one of the elders blocked their path. \"Glesheri?\" he asked. \"What is this? What are you doing here, with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath before speaking. \"Father, you remember Nessar: the man who wanted to learn about our ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather? Glesheri never told him that. She had never once mentioned that her father was one of the high elders. \"Um, Glesheri...\" Nessar started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. Now wasn't the time, she was trying to say. Her father, meanwhile, only raised an eyebrow in suspicion. \"Yes, and I'll ask again. What do you think you are doing with him right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri was ready for this moment. \"Nessar and I are married now. We intend to celebrate this festival to Yva. We wish to receive her blessing for children. Now, kindly step aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had said this all so evenly as if it were the most natural thing in the world. He was impressed. Nessar was still to afraid to say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father looked at both of them. \"There is no way that you two are married. Glesheri, you are not thinking straight. You are far too young to understand such things. Now, step away from the human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"No, he is my husband. I have undergone our marriage ceremony, honoring the gods. You cannot unbind us. Now, we are here peacefully to enjoy this festival. Step aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips pursed together in a frown. \"And what do you have to say for it all, human?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Nessar managed to find his voice. \"I...I love your daughter, sir, more than any other person on this earth. I would do anything for her. I will see to it that she is well-cared for. She has asked you nicely to let us through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stiffened, but stepped aside. \"Know this: you are no longer my daughter. You are no longer welcome in the village. Expect no support and no sympathy from us, for you have betrayed your own kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing that Glesheri had in common with her father, it was his stubborn nature. \"I wished you could've understood,\" she said. \"But if that is how you want it to be, very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Nessar walked on towards the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as the two of them lay in bed in their cozy little home on the outskirts of the village, Nessar was still worried. \"Glesheri, I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I never meant to be such a disturbance in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over in bed so that they were facing each other. \"I'm not made at you. I can never be mad at you. I just wish they could've understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's going to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're outcasts now, Nessar. I don't think they will disturb us here, but no one will help us anymore. We are on our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Nessar, we can make it. We can figure it out. We always find a way to make things work. I'm not worried, so you shouldn't worry either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward, nuzzling her forehead. \"You're always the brave one. But, I believe you. We can make this happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, embracing him closer. The truth was, she was very worried. Never before had she stood up to her people like that, to her father like that. And now, they were about to pay the price for it. But, she had to remain strong and sure that things would work out for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can you tell me now how many children you wished for?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled coyly. \"I could tell you, but I think I'll keep it a secret. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled back. \"I wished for however many you wanted. So, how about we start trying to help that along?\" He wrapped his arm around her waist, while she giggled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nGlesheri was on her bed, digesting the large breakfast Nessar made for her. It had become almost a routine, but sometimes she tried to break it, offering to help in the garden, but a few times Nessar refused, as he didn't want his wife to tire herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the festival, Nessar had been very caring to Glesheri. He was sad that his wife was an outcast among her kin, as whenever the couple were seen together in the Verge all the elves watched them with disrespect and avoided contact, and so took extra efforts in taking care of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he worked extra hard in the garden and on his research, but most of all, the portions of food he made for her became even more abundant, with Glesheri more often than not finding her plate overflowing with food. He had done this despite their precarious situation, but Nessar sometimes even secretly skipped meals to make sure his wife was well-fed. Thankfully their garden's fruits and vegetables matured earlier, so they got a good stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri didn't mind this life, and ate all the rich meals made by her loving husband. She would also try some new dishes, like the roast chicken, another animal that didn't live in the Verge, though she didn't know that usually a person didn\u2019t eat an entire one to themselves. And she was sure that her husband would've made her more once she told him the great news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, all of this care brought some developments in Glesheri's body. She was starting to get chubby; her belly was becoming more prominent and round, while her hips got wider, her sides had started to get soft and flabby, and even her previously flat chest had started to develop a couple of bouncy breasts. Even her face had become a bit softer and rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese changes were noticed by Glesheri, as she realized that needed to loosen the ribbon of her dress, but she didn't mind them, especially because they didn't seem a big deal. Nessar loved her the same as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, she wasn't the only one to notice it, as some of the other elves commented her chubbier form. She always felt a little down when she heard their rude whispers and murmurs about how plump she had started to become. Of course, Nessar couldn\u2019t hear all of these comments, as his ears weren\u2019t strong like an elf\u2019s, but those he did hear, he would always lean in, kiss her, and tell her how beautiful she was. It was also nice when Nessar could feel all her new curves when the two cuddled in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Nessar, Glesheri recognized the squeaking of the handcart. That meant Nessar was back with the food shipment. She got up, without even bothering to comb her long messy brown hair and ran toward her husband, wrapping him in a big hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey!\" yelled Glesheri as Nessar squeezed her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, dear, did you enjoy your breakfast?\" asked Nessar, picking her up gently. He could feel that she had gotten heavier. Thankfully she wasn't heavy enough to crush him, but she was also softer, as he could feel the cushion that was her stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but then I went straight back to sleep,\" replied the elf with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really lazy,\" commented Nessar kissing her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I\u2019ve just been tired a lot lately. Besides, it's you who works too much,\" groaned Glesheri. \"I think I need a hobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at the moment, you can help me with this stuff,\" said Nessar, slowly moving his wife away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, then I have to tell you big news,\" replied Glesheri with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious to see,\" said Nessar, though he already had an Idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple unloaded the cart and brought the food in the larder, it seemed that even this month they sent more food than usual. However, Nessar knew he had to moderate his portions, or he would be soon unable to feed his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri walked closer to Nessar, took his hands, pressed them gently to her belly and said, \"Yva bleseed us. I'm pregnant\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar expected that, and yet he couldn't contain his enthusiasm. A child. He was going to become father with the love of his life. When he was young he disliked the idea of having a family, and preferred be a rich scholar. But throughout his relationship with Glesheri, he changed his mind and actively desired to become the father of her children. Now that wish was becoming true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to scream with all the air in his lungs, but contained himself and simply jumped around his house in excitement, until Glesheri caught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure, are you happy with this?\" asked Glesheri sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am,\" replied Nessar before giving a long and passionate kiss. Then, Nessar's \"husband instinct\" kicked in, as he accompanied his wife to the bedroom. \"But this means you must not tire yourself, or the baby will suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, be quiet, it\u2019s still early. I\u2019m not an enormous, helpless, invalid just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" asked Nessar<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri answered dragging Nessar with the bed with her, \"Of course, but if you want, some company wouldn't be bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two embraced in a big hug, and Nessar looked at his wife's protruding middle, where their future child was resting. It had gotten larger in the last week, and it was definitely too soon to attribute that to the pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what it will look like,\" said Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it will have pointy ears like me?\" asked Glesheri, moving her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so; they're cute,\" replied Nessar, stroking them. Glesheri blushed and giggled, as the ears were a sensitive point for the elves and it tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I hope it will look like you; this way it will be beautiful,\" added Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, are you ugly?\" asked Glesheri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to you, I'm like a dirty toad.\" And he kissed her forehead before getting up. \"Well, if we want our child to grow happy and healthy, I have to work harder,\" he said before going to his study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't work too hard,\" said Glesheri from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same to you,\" replied Nessar from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri huffed. \"As if I'm working hard,\" she commented, looking her bed. \u201cBut, I suppose you won\u2019t mind a little rest, will you?\u201d she said, patting the spot where she imagined their little one lay, and then she closed her eyes. It was too comfortable, only a little rest and then she would've helped Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, Nessar was calling that the meal was ready. And she recognized the smell of pork stew from the bedroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next few weeks, Nessar and Glesheri began making plans and arrangements for their new little arrival. True, she was barely past the first trimester, but it gave her something to do, and helped Nessar keep his enthusiasm at bay, and more importantly, kept him from being an insufferable worrier. He was constantly making sure that his wife was comfortable and well-cared for, sometimes to the point of being a bit annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began building a crib and making space for the new baby. Normally, in a traditional elven family, it was customary for the immediate friends and family to help with such things, but Glesheri still remained shunned and was no longer recognized as an elf. Not that she minded this fact. She liked the idea of her and Nessar working together for all of this. It made the situation that much more intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to eat well, not quite hitting the appetite of eating for two just yet, but starting to come close. In truth, if she had experienced any growth from her condition, it was a slight roundness in her lower stomach, nothing more. Though, she did continue to grow rounder all the same. She would perhaps be properly showing in the next couple of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the couple did have minor success. Their own home-grown crops were doing well, and with the shipments coming in every month, it seemed like they would be able to make due just fine. There would still be the matter of figuring out how to provide for a family of three later on, but for now, it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the couple had gone out for a short walk in the Verge. There were still some plants that Nessar was unfamiliar with and wanted to study to add to his writings. Glesheri was more than happy to oblige. It was one of her favorite things to do with him, as that was how they first started conversing with each other. Plus, she liked how he treated her like such an expert on elven culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon returning home, they were met with a horrible sight. Their garden had been completely torn up. Their fledgling plants had been completely uprooted and strewn about the ground. Bags of seeds had been burst open and strewn about. Everything was in ruins. \"Oh, no,\" Glesheri said quietly, grasping onto Nessar's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was at a loss for words. True, he knew they were no longer welcome in the village, but this was taking it too far. How could they do this? They weren't hurting anyone. They had left everyone alone. They didn't deserve this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around  the area, hoping that there might be any clue about where they could have gone. He spotted their neighbor out working in his own field. His rage started to boil over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar started to march over to him. \"Nessar, please,\" Glesheri pleaded, knowing there might be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in front of their older neighbor, who was actively ignoring him. \"Hey!\" Nessar called. \"Did you see who did this?\" He pointed over towards their garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older elf answered him gruffly. \"Didn't see nothin'. Maybe that wouldn't happen if you and your whore went back to where you came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now see here,\" Nessar roared, \"we haven't hurt anyone. I know you saw them. I can understand you ignoring us, but now you've...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked you to be here. In case you haven't noticed, no one wants you around. Gods forbid you two start to breed like rats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was about to shout some more before Glesheri intervened. \"Please, there is no need for these hostilities. Come on Nessar, he isn't going to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked for your input, you traitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved her roughly on the shoulder, and she fell back into Nessar's arms. He caught her before she could fall, but he finally lost all control and lunged at the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was a lot stronger than he looked,\" Nessar said, as Glesheri started to apply a medicinal salve to his bruised eye. He was meanwhile, wrapping his bloodied hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't need to do that,\" she said. \"There was no need for violence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar looked up at her, his rage still not mollified. \"He hurt you,\" he answered shortly. \"He pushed you. He had no right to... If you had fallen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a hand on his shoulder. \"But, I didn't. You were there to catch me. I am fine. I thank you for standing up for me. But, Nessar, we can't keep giving them more reason to hate us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did nothing to deserve this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged him close. \"I know, but the more we fight back, the more they will continue to do this to us. We can't let them see that it bothers us. We have to just keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let them keep doing this to us? Glesheri, we can't just roll over and let them treat us like this.\" He placed his hands on her belly. \"I can't let our child grow up treated like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"I know, but we have to keep trying to make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"I suppose complaining about it isn't going to help. But, we're really going to be in a bind now. We were just making it on the food we had. this is going to set us back for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finished bandaging him up and kissed his forehead. \"We just have to keep working through these setbacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri hoped that was true. Right now, she wasn't sure, but she couldn't stand the thought of Nessar worrying about her even more.</span></div></div>",

That day, he decided to go hunting, but wasn't trained for it and he could only come back with such a little mammal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I'm home,\" said Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, honey, how did hunting go?\" asked Glesheri from the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. it went,\" was all Nessar could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped the rabbit on the table and joined his wife in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you?\" he asked her, patting her cheek. They had gotten a bit puffier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, thanks. I worked a bit in the garden. The bumblebean will be ready for harvest in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the baby?\" he asked, patting her round belly. It was starting to properly round out as the weeks were going by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine. This morning I didn't even feel sick,\" replied Glesheri, placing her hand over his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, \u2018she?\u2019 Do elves already know the baby's gender?\" asked Nessar, looking surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" replied Glesheri as she kissed his cheek, and then whispered, \"but I have this feeling she'll be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar laughed, and gently patted her round belly. He imagined a child-version of Glesheri calling him daddy. He would've told her stories, played with her, given dresses and toys, and taught her many things. Then that little half-elf would be joined by another, and another and another, until Nessar found himself submerged by babies. He shook his head thinking that maybe he went too far in his imagination, but regardless of how many children he and his wife would've had, he would've loved them all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief loving moment, Nessar left the bed. \"I'll go prepare lunch then,\" said Nessar while going to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting,\" said Glesheri yawning and patting her belly. \"I\u2019ll bet you want a nice rest, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Glesheri fell asleep, Nessar grabbed the rabbit and skinned it. He nearly cut himself a few times, as he wasn't used to it, but in the last few weeks he had to resort to hunting because the food wasn't enough. Or at least, it would've been enough if Nessar balanced the portions, but instead, he always gave Glesheri very rich portions and poor portions to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in the larder, but there wasn't much left. He grabbed just a pair of potatoes to use as side dish along with the rabbit. He sighed and gave a sad look at the garden. They managed to repair some of the damage, but there were only few plants left and nothing would be mature before they'd needed it.<br>\r\nHe decided to not think about it and kept on cooking. He knew that Glesheri wasn't happy being an outcast, but his food always did bring a smile on her face. And recently he found himself getting better at cooking. Too bad he couldn't use all the ingredients he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, their stock didn't last long, and they needed to ask to the other elves. They knew they would've never gave them anything, but were too desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the answer was always the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if I'd help a traitor like you,\" said the elf before slamming the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Nessar stopped it with his foot. Glesheri tried to calm him down but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, even some leftovers would be fine. We are really desperate. I understand you hate me, but at least have some pity my wife,\" begged the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you. She's a traitor,\" replied the elf sternly. Then he gave a look at Glesheri's body. \"And I think she can afford to go a few days without food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri looked at her own chubby body. She had indeed developed new curves during the last couple of months, and her dress wasn't large anymore; she didn't even need to tie the ribbon.<br>\r\nBut that comment about her size, made her ears fold and she started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard! Don't you dare insult my wife! For gods\u2019 sake, she\u2019s pregnant,\" yelled Nessar as he was about to punch him, but Glesheri stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessar, please,\" said the elf with tears flowing from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar calmed down and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my dear. Let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back at home, a bad surprise was waiting for them. Someone had invaded and broke many things, some pots, the garden (again) and, more importantly, the crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the crib she and Nessar had worked on completely destroyed was too much for Glesheri, who was on the point of collapsing. Nessar grabbed her and embraced her in a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could have they done this? Why?\" asked Glesheri between hiccups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but this is the last straw,\" replied Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri temporarily ceased her crying and looked Nessar in his eyes. \"We cannot stay here anymore\" she said, with not the slightest hint of fear or hesitation. \"We have to move somewhere else. I don't know where, you decide. Wherever you will go, I'll follow you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar kissed her and said, \"Of course, I'm not going anywhere without you. I think I know what to do.\"</span></div></div>",

He and Glesheri had packed everything they owned, which wasn't much given that they had lived a pretty simple life, into a cart and started making their way for the city in the dead of night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar knew it wasn't a good idea to be taking his wife through these rough roads and paths in her condition, but he knew they couldn't stay in the Verge until the baby was born. Between trying to make sure they had enough to eat, and worrying if someone may try to hurt them, there just wasn't time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe guided their horse along the path, trying to keep from hitting too many bumps while Glesheri sat at the head of the cart. \"We're almost there,\" he said. \"You doing okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was glad to be away from such a hostile environment, that didn't change the fact that she was being forced to leave her own home: the place of her birth. Despite how she had been treated, the Verge was still home to her, and she would miss it dearly. She let out a deep, homesick sigh, but smiled back at him. \"I'm fine,\" she said. \"So, what are you to do when you return to your college?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I still ended up with plenty of information to publish my tome on elven culture, though you'll be able to help me fill in the gaps. After that, I think they'll plan for me to do some translation work. That won't pay much, but it'll get food on the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I keep forgetting that it'll take a while for you to get used to some human customs. But, we're going to have to use money for food now. You'll be able to go to the markets for it. My home is just one street away from the best markets in the city. Anyway, I have a friend that'll stop by from time to time to help us. I'll have him check in with you and help you with understanding currency, at least until you get the hang of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, he knew that there were some crafty merchants in Adinah, and they would likely find ways to cheat Glesheri once they knew she had no concept of currency. He would send Abelard to help with the shopping, more to keep the merchants honest, if anything else. Also, since he would be spending days working at the college, having someone to check in on her in case something were to happen with her or the child was a good precaution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" she said, trying to process it all. Now she was the outsider having to learn about another culture. At least Nessar was seeing to it that she had plenty of help. \"So, tell me about this home you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued guiding the horse. \"It's not much,\" he said, \"but it is a little bigger than our home in the Verge. It's really more of an apartment I rent. The woman who owns the building is nice, but she can be a bit prickly sometimes. But you'll be comfortable, I'll see to that. Course, the first thing we'll see to is getting a proper meal in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout their trip, they had to live on whatever goods they still had. Their last crop of bumblebeans and a few odds and ends were all they had left. Glesheri hadn't complained, but Nessar knew it wasn't nearly enough. As the child grew, so too did his wife's appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri seemed to be reading his thoughts. \"I'm fine, really. Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" he asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was at her side in an instant. She nodded, smiled, and placed his hands on her belly. \"You feel that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned from ear to ear. He could feel a little fluttering motion under her skin. \"Is that... Is she...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's moving,\" Glesheri said. \"Hello, little one. Are you excited to see our new home too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore flutters. \"We'd better get moving then,\" Nessar said, going back to lead the horse the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty clear when they had entered the city. The usual sounds and hustle and bustle of the city was in full-swing as it was nearly midday. Their cart slowed down to a crawl as Nessar tried to lead them through the crowds. People were everywhere, haggling, arguing, and talking. Buildings were clustered together in the cobbled streets, really giving the city a claustrophobic feel. Right now, they were in the residential and market districts. Maybe someday, he'd take Glesheri to see the nicer buildings of the colleges and temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, eventually, they arrived at a tall stone building. It was really a shop, but there were a few apartments up above. He led Glesheri inside so that she could rest after their long journey while he unloaded the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't take long, and Nessar returned upstairs shortly after. Glesheri's ears had flattened and she looked a tad distressed. \"It's a lot louder than I had expected,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"Yeah, it's going to take some getting used to, living in a city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I heard your voice,\" a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar turned around to see a portly, middle-aged woman, who's face was wrinkled around the eyes, but she still wore a pleasant smile. He grinned. \"Sornna, it's good to see you again,\" he greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms, her tone teasing. \"So, they already call you back here. Or was it that you couldn't rough it out in those woods. I always knew you were too much of a city boy to... Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is Glesheri, one of the elves I met in the Verge. She's...well, she's my wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri stood to greet the older woman, who stared at her dumbstruck. \"I'm sorry, of course, welcome dear. Oh, goodness, Nessar, well you do work fast, now don't you? Poor thing, you really are a saint for putting up with this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri giggled. \"I'm happy to meet you. Thank you so much for letting us live here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I like her. She at least appreciates me, unlike others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar shrugged. \"I appreciate you enough, Sornna. Anyway, I'm back for good, and I was just getting her settled in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shook her head and smiled. \"Alright, well, I'll leave you to it. To think, an elf in the city. How fascinating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tottered off, leaving the couple alone once more. Glesheri's stomach started to growl. \"Well, we'd better see to getting the both you fed,\" Nessar said, leading her to the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nGlesheri found the human city very fascinating. For instance, they had apartments amassed together, and the buildings were really tall, or at least, much taller than an average elven one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was intrigued by the shops and the markets, places where you went to get stuff in exchange for money. Even the idea of using money was strange and complicated, as she still didn\u2019t understand it, despite Nessar's multiple explanations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed how the shops were of different kinds based on the commodities they sold (\u201csell,\u201d that was the right term, she remembered): weapons, decorations, and clothing. In the latter shop, Glesheri was thrilled to try some human clothes, but at the moment she was very hungry, and thankfully, humans had different stores for food of various kinds: the bakery, the butchery, the fruit shop and many others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri couldn't resist and wanted to try and taste all the human food: the bread, the meats, the cow milk, and some of the fruits she had never seen. Nessar was more than happy to oblige and didn't hesitate to spend a large sum of money to satisfy her. Even when she didn't say anything, (she didn't want Nessar to spend too much money) he could gather from her gaze that she really wanted it, and bought it. Glesheri kissed him to thank him and ate while Nessar showed her the rest of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the walk, Glesheri noticed that many eyes were on her. An elf was something unusual in Adinah, ad even more so an elf in a relationship with a human, as after seeing her very close to Nessar and her obviously pregnant belly it wasn't hard to put two and two together. She felt a bit embarrassed and her cheeks couldn't stop blushing, but at least those gazes weren't discriminatory like the ones in the Verge.<br>\r\nShe thought she could get used to living here, even if it was really noisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar noticed that Glesheri was smiling, and it was that serene smile she had at the beginning of their marriage, when they weren't harassed by the elves. He would've done everything to keep that smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple sat on a bench in a square. Glesheri needed to rest to digest all the food and the baby was starting to make her feel tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the square, there was a granite statue of a large man in armor, with a large crown on his head, holding a sword in the sky and watching the passersby with a penetrating gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your god?\" asked Glesheri pointing at the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's Goran, the king's great-grandfather. According to some stories, he once killed a chimera that attacked the city, all alone with his sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri gasped. \"Wow, and don't you have a statue of the current king?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here, and definitely not that big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said Glesheri, leaning on Nessar's side, \"I'd like to meet your king one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar stroked her hair and replied, \"I'd like to, but it's not that easy. You need to ask permission and stuff... He's an important and busy man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is the king so much more important than the others?\" asked Glesheri, patting Nessar's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's the king after all. But I think you elves have a much different idea of the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about the queen?\" asked Glesheri, getting more curious at every passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Nessar scratched the back of his head. \"\u2026She died some time before I went to the Verge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri gasped. \"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" replied Nessar giving a kiss on her cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t know all that much about her. Very few people here do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone interrupted the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessar? Is that really you?\" asked a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar looked around and saw a chubby man around his age with an unkept blonde beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raschal!\" said Nessar. \"What are you doing here? Weren't you at the marshes studying the tiger-people?\" And he stood up to greet the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the Rakshasa?\" replied Raschal, giving him a brotherly hug. \"Yes, but apparently they weren't the nicest guys.\" He showed him the scar on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar rolled the eyes and snorted. \"Tell me about it. I too had to leave the Verge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it seems you brought a little souvenir with you,\" whispered Raschal with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar blushed. \"Oh, right, how stupid of me! Raschal, this is Glesheri\u2026my wife. Glesheri, this is Raschal, a fellow scholar.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you,\" said Glesheri with a wave of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure\u2019s all mine, meeting such a beautiful creature,\" said Raschal before turning to Nessar. \"Wait, wife? You mean you married an elf? I know you had to study them, but you didn't need to work so closely with them.\" He noticed her belly. \u201cAnd you certainly wasted no time starting a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha,\" said Nessar, \"and now what are you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to meet the king and get a new assignment, but he's away on a 'diplomatic mission' so I don't have much to do for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the same boat,\" said Nessar, \"but I'll find a temporary job to keep me and my wife from starving; maybe I can check at the college. Plus, some of my research was fruitful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck then,\" said Raschal with a pat on Nessar's back. \"And if you need help, you can always ask at my brother's tavern. He'll definitely assist any friend of mine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Raschal left and Nessar and Glesheri spent some more time together, while some peasants noticed them with curiosity and interest; some even got closer to Glesheri as if she was a rare animal to pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the couple finished the tour with another trip through the food shops. Glesheri was just too curious to taste all that human's cuisine had to offer</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nessar had wasted no time, and the next day, he made it a point to go check in at his old college to inquire about future work. He made sure Glesheri was comfortable and had everything she needed before leaving. It was going to take some getting used to as he would be leaving her to work every day now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend, and former assistant, Abelard came by as it would be his job to make sure Glesheri got used to life in the city. Abelard was a short, balding man, who was as sweet as honey. He would be perfect to give his wife tours of the city and to help her understand human life. Plus, this way she'd always have someone around in case anything happened with the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar took a deep breath and made his way up the stairs of the college, realizing for the first time it had been several months, nearly a year really, since he had been in these hallowed halls. He needed to see Master Bartholomew to find out what his next step should be. He would need to be providing for a family of three soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the master in his study on the top floor of the building. Master Bartholomew had been the master of the college for an incredibly long time, since Nessar was a boy, really, if not longer. He was a hunched, old man, whose vision was starting to go bad. His hearing was no better some days. Still, his sense of smell was as keen as ever, and he always knew who was in the room with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessar, my boy!\" he greeted. \"I had heard you were back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar smiled and returned the greeting. \"Yes, unfortunately, things took a bit of an ugly turn in the Verge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartholomew seemed surprised by this. \"Really? With you? My goodness, you are one of the nicest people out there. If you managed to get the elves to hate you, then they must be nasty little creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed nervously. \"Well, it doesn't help that I may have gotten a little too involved with one of their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old master raised an eyebrow in surprise. \"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have...fallen in love with an elf, and when she married me, that didn't go over so well with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"Nessar, you know the first rule of field work: Never get too close to the subject material.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, but...I don't know. It was worth it. I really do love her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartholomew sighed. \"I can sense that in you boy; all the signs of a fool in love. Well, what's done is done. You said in your last note that you should still be able to publish something with all the research you did manage to obtain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar nodded. \"I think so. By the time I left, I was really only filling in a lot of small odds and ends. My wife should be able to help me fill in those gaps for the final edit. But, more importantly, I wanted to inquire what I could be doing here after that. I can't exactly leave on another field work mission at this time. My wife is now with child, and I don't want to leave her on her own here so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master agreed. \"No, that makes sense. We'll just have to make due. I have a lot of translation jobs for you to complete. We obtained some new texts from the Djinn scholars in the south, and I'm eager to have us start reading them. However, there is another matter we should discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped. This didn't sound good. Nessar tried to hide his nerves by playing it casual. \"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartholomew smiled. \"Relax, boy, it's all good news, I hope. You've shown a lot of good progress over the years. Your research is thorough and detailed. And while, your recent actions show you lacked some good judgment, I assume it was a minor slip. The point I'm trying to get to, my boy, is that I think it's time we consider you for a position of master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hardly contain himself. Nessar mouthed a few syllables, unsure where to begin. \"I...uh...master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"I think you've earned it. You have my and the college's full support. And your upcoming tome on the elves would prove a sufficient project to earn your spot. You're on the right track for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know what to say. Thank you!\" Nessar said, shaking the master's hand. \"But, what are you...where are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master waved him off. \"Relax, I'm not going anywhere. But, as you know, the king does keep a wise master on his council, and Master Theobald is considering retirement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it. Him, working for the king? Could this be real? It had to be a dream. \"Sir, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartholomew chuckled. \"All in good time, my boy. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. You first need to finish your work and have it edited and presentable. In the meantime, we'll pay you for your translations, and we shall work everything out from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar thanked the master again and again, before Bartholomew sent him on his way. He was eager to go home and tell his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning home, he found Glesheri sitting comfortably, humming to herself, and...knitting? Or rather, she was attempting to. She smiled and greeted him. \"What's all this?\" Nessar asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sornna tried to teach me knitting,\" she answered. \"I thought it would be nice, since our child will be born in winter. This way, she'll have a nice, warm blanket. I'm still getting the hang of it.\" She held up the knotted mess tangled around her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"You will. I know you will,\" he said. \"Abelard didn't already leave you, did he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded over toward the kitchen. \"He's in there. He's been very helpful. We went shopping in the market for things to make dinner with, and he insisted on cooking himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood ol' Abelard, he thought: helpful to a fault. \"That's terrific. We'll eat, and I'll tell you some wonderful news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar couldn't believe it, but things were starting to look up for them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nOnce Nessar told Glesheri the news that he would've become a Master in the college, and after explaining what it meant, the elf felt really happy and leaned closer to Nessar, promising him a good night of cuddles (naturally, once the couple was left alone).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbelard was happy too, upon hearing this, and Nessar told him to make a rich dinner to celebrate, something. And his friend was glad to oblige, and Glesheri even more so. She didn't know if it was the baby or simply she that loved human food too much, but she felt she could eat every day a bit more than the one before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Nessar and Glesheri were in the bed, embraced in a tight hug. The man could feel the curves of his wife getting softer and softer, and she was starting to have a bit of a double chin when she turned down her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted her belly. \"Finally, you will have all what you need. Are you happy?\" he said to the child in the womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri chuckled. \"She kicked. I think it's a yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time until she's born?\" asked Nessar, as he didn't exactly know how long an elf's pregnancy lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, in winter, so a couple of months, give or take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar gave a look around in the room. It wasn't the best so far, but he was sure to gain enough money to make it comfortable for the baby. Thankfully they had a couple of empty rooms. That combined with the money a Master earned, it meant they could afford many other children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear? What are you thinking?\" asked Glesheri, stroking his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar realized he was too lost in his thoughts. \"Uhm... nothing important,\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was a bit too early to think about having other children. Besides, he had to ask to his wife. Speaking of which, he glanced at his wife's chubby body another time. These days Glesheri was eating a lot, but thankfully he could afford to feed her whatever she wanted. He felt lucky to be able to pamper his wife without having to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he curled on his side and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few days, Nessar went to the college where he worked on the translation of the texts, while Glesheri explored the city with Abelard, until one day, she decided to go and explore it all by herself.<br>\r\nShe had done enough tours to remember the streets and the more important places. Besides, she would've soon reached the day when, with her pregnancy, it would be better to stay at home.<br>\r\nSo she put on her new dress, a gift from Sornna, and she was thankful of that, as with her pregnancy, her old ones were becoming too tight, tough the pregnancy wasn't the only cause, as the gown was a bit fierce on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf walked down the street, greeting all the people she met. In just a couple of weeks, she could already feel at home with the humans, even if most of their customs were still strange and unknown to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her daily pouch of money; after having (finally) learned somewhat how these work. Nessar gave her a small bag every day of these golden discs the humans use to take what they want. Her husband told her she could take whatever she wanted, but to be aware of the possible crooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this reason, Glesheri visited only a couple of shops, close to her home, where Abelard could confirm their honesty. Coincidentally, they were all food shops, something that the human food-lover didn't mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the bakery, where she had already a good bond with the owners. It was a family business, led by a nice couple with the help of their children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri entered and greeted the woman behind the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glesheri, you're again today?\" asked the woman with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Giana, your bread is really good,\" replied the elf who, after going there nearly every day, had become a favorite customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiana was a really large woman, probably twice as large as the average female-elves of the Verge, with short dark brown hair. Her hips were almost brushing against the doorframe, but being a mother of four children, that could have been expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want?\" asked Giana. \"Today we've got this special bread with olives.\" She waved the bread in front the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying new food was an offer Glesheri couldn't refuse. \"Olives, aren't these the ones used to make oil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiana nodded, making her double chin quiver. \"Yes, they're also good to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I suppose I really can't refuse,\" replied the elf. \"However, I'd want some regular bread too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem. I'll go to the oven, so you can have some fresh bread,\" replied the baker, patting Glesheri's head as if she were a pet. She had gotten used to that. Humans still knew so very little about elves, and they thought of her as no more than an ignorant primitive. She didn\u2019t mind it, as that was better than some of the abuse she had suffered at the hands of her own people, but she hoped her husband\u2019s research would help disprove some of those ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman waddled to the back door, and Glesheri could hear her talking to her husband. Meanwhile she waved her hand to one of their children, and the only daughter among them; she was something like ten years younger than Nessar, and every time Glesheri came in the shop, the blonde girl looked at her with curiosity, especially the pointy ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a blow of wind signaled that the back door opened momentarily, and Glesheri could see the baker squishing his wife's hips in a close embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri leaned her head and started to think. Was the baker liking his wife because she was fat?<br>\r\nSuddenly, she remembered Nessar's words: that where he came from a fat wife was a good sign that the man is rich and takes good care of her. Could it be that Nessar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her thoughts were interrupted as Giana came back with a tray of freshly-made bread, hot from the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is, how much do you want?\" asked Giana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, the usual,\" replied Glesheri, still in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, and the bread with olives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026\" Glesheri looked at the bread; the small green fruits seemed inviting. \"Three pieces,\" she said, but she changed her mind. Maybe it costed too much. \"No two.\" But she changed her mind again, as it seemed really inviting. \"No, three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiana laughed. \"Ok, here it is. It's 5 golden coins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri thanked her and said hello to the fat baker and his daughter as she left the bakery before quickly sinking her teeth in the new kind of bread. It was soft, but the olives didn't add much to the flavor. It wasn't much different from bread with oil. But, still, a new experience was always good, especially regarding human food. Still, that didn\u2019t change the kicking sensation she felt. \u201cYou like that, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said, knowing her little one kicked frequently when her mother ate food she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in the streets, Glesheri looked at the women of the city and noticed how they were much fuller figured than the ones of the Verge. In fact, if the elves commented on how chubby she had become, in Adinah she didn't have a hard time finding a woman more padded than her, and she had gotten even plumper since the day she moved in Adinah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was inevitable, since she came to this city. Eating had become probably her main activity of the day, and she knew it wasn't the pregnancy\u2019s fault. She simply liked human food too much. In a way, she was really glad to have moved to Adinah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite her plumper form, Nessar loved her regardless. Actually, considering Adinah's women's constitution, could it be that he liked her even more with more meat on her bones? She noticed how he hugged and tickled her jiggling form, but had never considered that maybe, Nessar would like her even more with some more flab, and that could mean that she had to eat even more delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about that while going in another shop, gently stroking her womb</span></div></div>",

The Verge saw its fair share of cold temperatures and the occasional snow. However, the trees of the Verge served as a protective barrier against the most frigid winds and the harshest blizzards. Second, Glesheri was so far along in her pregnancy that she just couldn't get around as well as she would have liked. Plus, Nessar insisted that she spend this time getting plenty of rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little one must be especially hungry today,\" Abelard remarked, bringing her something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbelard had stuck around to help assist her at home, and to be around should she go into labor anytime soon. If anything else, Glesheri was just glad to have company around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf chuckled. \"Well, that's not exactly it,\" she said. \"At least not all of it. I've just been thinking lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on the corner of the bed. She liked having Abelard around. He was a very good conversationalist, and he didn't consider her as simple-minded like some of the other people did. He knew her well enough to know that she was intelligent in her own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking about what?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri now felt a little embarrassed. It was one thing to have this idea, but saying it aloud seemed odd, now that she thought about it. \"Well, I've just been thinking. It might be nice to...I don't know, get a little fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a hearty laugh. \"Now, that's a new one for me. Whatever for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that I've noticed some of the other people here, what they look like and all. And, Nessar said something about having a fat wife as a sign of success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbelard continued to chuckle. \"Ah, yes, humans here in the city are rather well-fed, and the women here are a tad on the large side. But, I wouldn't worry too much about that. Nessar loves you just the way you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" she said. \"I don't have to worry about him not liking me. But, I just thought it might be nice, and he might be very pleased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Well, I suppose a little extra winter weight wouldn't hurt you. And yes, Nessar does have his penchant for larger women. I just so happen to know a little recipe that my mother used to make that you might like. It's simple, and a bit fattening, just what you're looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back, eager to try  whatever it was that he had promised. It turned out that they were a simple sweet tart. They were simply delicious. Despite all her explorations of human foods, she hadn't really explored too many of their sweets, and now she regretted not having done so early. She ate several dozen of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the little one seemed to like them too. She kicked cheerfully. Glesheri made sure not to eat so many that she made herself too full. She didn't want the little one to feel too crowded in there with her full stomach. Abelard seemed to be aware of that and made sure she ate rich, quality meals rather than just massive amounts of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple of weeks, the results were starting to show. She was indeed getting plumper every day. Eating plenty and spending almost all of her time laying around was bound to do that. Her cute round face had gotten even rounder, and her double-chin was more pronounced. Her belly had gotten even rounder, and while true, that was mostly the child growing, parts of it were soft and squishy. She had gotten significantly wider as well. She gently pinched some of her sides. Yes, she was getting fatter. Hopefully, Nessar would be pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Nessar did notice these changes. He noticed that his wife was softer to cuddle at nights when they slept together. He noticed that every night, she seemed to take up more space on their bed. He noticed that there wasn't a single part of her that he could feel that was bony in the slightest. He rather liked these changes, and found that she was even more attractive, if that was even possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...where had that idea come from? Why did he think she was more attractive this way? Nessar always prided himself on believing that looks didn't matter. But, he couldn't deny it: he liked her this way. He had always grown up with the larger women of Adinah and was attracted to them for sure, but with Glesheri, none of that had mattered. He loved her because she was sweet, kind, and funny. He still did like all those things about her, he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he didn't know that his wife was doing this on purpose. He just knew his wife was eating more every day, and was starting to look nice and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm...perhaps he did like the idea of having a fat and happy wife.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nIt was a cold day of winter in Adinah, and Glesheri was lying in her bed. Recently sleeping was becoming harder, as with her pregnant belly she was having some difficulties in finding a comfortable position. Thankfully, she thought as she woke up, she developed a soft natural cushion in her own body, and it kept growing every passing day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri was probably double her original size, if not even more, and she was liking it. She didn't know for sure why, though. Maybe because it was simply the consequence of eating delicious human food, or maybe because it was arousing touching her own new curves, or possibly because there was someone else that was enjoying it even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Nessar came in the bedroom with a tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my dear,\" said the man sitting beside her on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" replied the elf, raising her back so she would be sitting on the bed too while also moving some of her long hair from her face. She winced a little as a sharp pain struck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I just woke up the little one trying to sit up is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You woke up just in time, I was about to leave for work,\" said Nessar, putting the tray next to his wife and kissing her round cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you gonna stay at home these days? It could be any day now,\" said Glesheri, patting her overly round belly, still much softer than a standard pregnant one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a couple more days, just enough time to finish the translations, and then I'll have the permission to stay at home for a few weeks,\" replied Nessar, getting close to Glesheri's side. Now he could feel his body brushing against something very squishy, very different from the willowy body of months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally Nessar was really happy for this change, and not only because he thought Glesheri's new form suited her, but because she seemed happy with this too. So, he couldn't help but not-so-subtly encourage Glesheri's eating habits by making her richer and even more fattening meals, unaware that Abelard was doing the same thing. Glesheri caught onto this and was more than happy to satisfy her caring husband's desire and, at the same time, her gluttony for human food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's dinner,\" said Nessar bringing a tray with two bowls of stew and a large piece of bread to his wife later that evening, who was forced to stay at bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri cooed. \"Thanks my dear, I really wanted it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still more back in the kitchen, if you want,\" replied Nessar, getting next to his wife's hip, which was softer than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri giggled. \"Stop tickling me, or I can't eat,\" she said patting Nessar's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry. I hope you like it. This time I've used different kinds of meat, let's hope it tastes good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt that sharp pain again. It didn\u2019t worry her because she had been feeling them every so often the past couple of weeks. It was just her body telling her things were getting close, she figured. She brushed off all of Nessar\u2019s worries and decided to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri's voraciousness in devouring all the stew was a good answer to Nessar\u2019s hope, and she quickly emptied the first bowl and proceeded to empty the second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll fill this one,\" said Nessar with a wink, while Glesheri nodded in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Glesheri's appetite rose, so did her standard portions, and recently she reached the average of three servings per meal, plus some side dish, but she contained herself and didn't stuff until she was full. The baby was now big and she couldn't risk crowding her with her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dinner, the couple spent some time embracing each other, almost apparent in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep treating me so well, I'll really become fat,\" commented Glesheri suddenly. She didn't want to discuss the idea of gaining on purpose with Nessar, at least not yet. She didn't know for how long he would have enjoyed it, and tried to inquire in an indirect way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve to be treated so well,\" replied Nessar; it seemed he would've liked it, no matter her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, maybe I can give you a little reward,\" replied Glesheri before giving him a long passionate kiss. \"I don't know if it's Adinah's atmosphere, but I love you more than ever,\" said the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, you've never looked so beautiful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri smiled. He was probably referring to her extra weight, but something more important was about to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessar...\" said Glesheri with a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The baby is coming,\" replied Glesheri, putting an hand on her belly with a grimace, while water poured across the bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"She's beautiful,\" Glesheri murmured as she gazed lovingly at the small sleeping bundle in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as much worrying as Nessar did during her pregnancy, he had kept his head through the whole ordeal. He sent Sornna at once to fetch a midwife. At first, that concerned the elf. In her culture, while midwives did exist, they were only called upon in emergencies, when complications arose. Mostly, a trusted female relative or friend would help with the birth. Though, if they had stayed in the Verge, she would have had no one who would have wanted to help her, lest they become an outcast as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Glesheri, she faced very little struggle. True, humans were a tad larger than elves, and the child being half-human did make it a tad more painful, but it was worth it. In the early hours of that morning, their daughter had come squalling into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, she was just content to be lying there in a clean bed, holding her daughter while she slept peacefully after her first feeding. She wouldn't trade this moment for anything in the world. She already felt a strong bond with her child the moment they first touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's perfect,\" Nessar said, stroking the few dark hairs on the top of the baby's head gently, and kissing his wife. \"I can't believe she's finally here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf smiled as the child nestled closer to her mother's soft body, yawning slightly. \"Look,\" she said, nodding at her child's head, \"her ears are closed. They'll open in a few weeks, and will be pointed like mine, just like you hoped. And look, she has your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's everything we could've hoped for,\" he said. \"What are we going to name her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a good human name?\" she asked. \"We live in a human city now, so I think that would be best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar thought for a moment. \"How about Nilinda?\" he said. \"That was my mother's name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed. \"I love it already. Hello, little Nilinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child gurgled a little in her sleep and smiled back. \"It's wonderful,\" Glesheri said. \"We're going to be a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Well, you'll get to name the next one. There will be a next one, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a look, but nodded. \"Yes, if the gods will it, I'd like several children. But, for now, I'm happy to have my body back to myself for a little while.\" Nessar laughed, grabbing some of her side and gently squeezing it. \"Well, mostly to myself anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stifled a yawn herself. \"Here,\" said Nessar. \"She's sleeping right now, and you probably should get some rest too. You've been up since last night. I'll hold her, and wake you if she needs to be fed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to want to let go of her child after having just held her for the first time, but she had to admit that Nessar was right: she needed sleep when she could. Glesheri carefully handed Nilinda to her husband, instructing him on how to properly hold her before laying back down on the bed for a little rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar still couldn't believe this was really happening. He had a daughter now! He never wanted this moment to end, being a family for the first time. He looked at her proudly, glad he could be here to witness all of this. In a short time, the child awoke, and Nessar feared she would cry being in the arms of someone unfamiliar to her, but those beautiful baby blue eyes seemed to know that he wasn't all that much of a stranger. \"Hey,\" he said gently, \"I guess this is the first time we get to talk outside of your mother's belly. My pretty little Nilinda...you're really here. Don't worry, I love your mother so much, I would do anything for her, and I'll do anything for you. Just, maybe go a little easy on us. We're new to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a few small noises, and he would have liked to believe she understood. More likely, she probably recognized the voice that spoke to her just outside the womb. \"I already know you'll be beautiful, like your mother,\" he said, \"but maybe getting a few brains from your dad isn't so bad either, right? I'm sure you'll be pretty smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar reached out a finger towards her, and she took it instinctively in her firm grasp. She shook at it for a few seconds, comfortable with her father being this close to her. \"I love you more than anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to where Glesheri lay sleeping, clearly exhausted from her ordeal. Even without her great bump, she was still a bit on the heavy side, and Nessar still liked that. A mother should be soft and warm anyway, he reasoned. Plus, he told himself, there was no way he was going to deny the mother of his child anything, especially food. Truly, this was a perfect life.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, there were only a few nights where she cried, forcing Nessar to wake up and cuddle her. He didn't mind it much though because, looking at the bright side, he could see his beautiful daughter. She really resembled her mother, barring the dark hair, or to be more precise, her mother when she was very slim.<br>\r\nNilinda stopped crying the moment she felt her father's warm arms, and quickly fell asleep, but Nessar kept her in his arms for a couple more of minutes before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, my princess,\" said the man, gently kissing his daughter's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilinda was a very quiet child, and generally cried only for a thing: when she was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really resembles you a lot,\" joked Nessar watching his wife breastfeeding Nilinda. \"She's even got your appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha, very funny,\" replied Glesheri, who couldn't deny that she was becoming really gluttonous, as she was eating as much as ever, and now she didn't even have the pregnancy as an excuse. \"You could make less food if you wanted,\" added the elf before giving a pat on the baby's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can resist the temptation?\" asked Nessar, putting a pastry on the table, next to Glesheri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf looked at it. It was very inviting, and even had a cherry on it. She loved those small red fruits. She put Nilinda comfortably on one arm and grabbed the treat, only to shove it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I can't, but you can't resist this either,\" said Glesheri, pinching one of her sides and winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar leaned close to her, almost face to face, with a big smile. Glesheri blushed, and prepared her lips for a kiss, only to find that Nessar had picked up Nilinda and was now raising her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's daddy's princess? Yes, you are,\" said Nessar in a goofy voice.<br>\r\nThe more than a month-old baby smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, she smiled! Did you see honey? She smiled at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was probably just gas,\" replied Glesheri with a laugh, taking back Nilinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, their bliss didn't last long. After a couple of months, Nessar had to go back to work, and came back with a sad expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, what is it?\" asked Glesheri upon glancing his husband's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king gave me a new job, and I have to study the naga in the marshes,\" replied the man, taking a seat on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, is it so far away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Nessar with his head nodding like there was a spring in the neck. \"I Will probably stay some months away from home. I tried to refuse it, but it would cost me my future job as a master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri put Nilinda back in the crib and sat next to Nessar. \"If it's just for the job, please refuse it. I don't care if we don't have many money.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we need it,\" replied the man. Then he took Glesheri's hands. \"I want for you and Nilinda to not face any difficulties, but I promise I'll complete my research as fast as possible and then I'll come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri hugged him, with some tears dropping from the eyes. \"If you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar went to the crib. Nilinda was asleep and curled on a side. He gently stroked her black hair and her small pointy ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When are you departing?\" asked Glesheri, hugging him from behind. Her belly, which had become round and soft, was pressed against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, I have to prepare my luggage,\" replied her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he suddenly turned around and grabbed her hips. \"But first, I want to spend one last night with you,\" he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri smiled back. \"Ok, come here, you!\" And she pulled him with her, before landing on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night was one of the best the two had, probably because the idea of being separated for so long goaded them in enjoying it the most they could. Once the loving moment had finished, Glesheri could hardly sleep; she had just spent a whole year married to Nessar, and now she didn't know how she could endure entire months without him. At least there was Nilinda, and this motivated her to stay strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Nessar left, with the luggage in his hand, he looked at his wife and daughter for a last time before departing. Glesheri was a chubby elf, bordering on fat, with a round face with puffy cheeks, a large gut bulging from her dress and thick thighs to sustain her wide hips. Even her breasts had become large, though part of it it's because she was now a mother. He was going to miss all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her arms there was Nilinda, small and with her eyes wide open. Once Nessar started to leave, the baby started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, don't cry, my dear little Nilinda. Dad is going to return soon,\" said Glesheri lulling her daughter, even if inside she was having the same feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days were hard, as she woke up without finding her husband making her breakfast (there was Abelard or Sornna, but it wasn't the same) and the bed seemed much larger and emptier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least there was Nilinda. Glesheri spent nearly all her time next to her daughter and playing with her, as the little half-elf was growing, and Glesheri expected her to say her first words as soon as possible. She was her father\u2019s child after all: incredibly smart and quick to learn. Though that didn't fill the void left by Nessar's departure and she tried to compensate with more food. She had barely left her home in weeks, having to take care of her child, and asked Sornna to buy the groceries in her place, and to take as much as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf loved human cuisine, but at the same time it reminded her of Nessar, so she would swing from happy moments to melancholic ones, with the main results were becoming plumper than ever. However, maybe this would be a pleasant surprise for Nessar once he came back, to find that both his daughter and wife had grown, albeit in different ways.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the warmer weather approached, and the sun began to stay out longer, it was hard to resist the temptation to go outside. Back in the Verge, like most elves, Glesheri had spent most hours outdoors, and she missed going out in the sunshine and fresh air, though a crowded city like Adinah lacked some of the natural comforts. Still, it was a good day for being out, and she thought it might help her take her mind off of missing Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fashioned a simple little sling to carry Nilinda in from a blanket. She draped it over her shoulder and placed the baby in, so that the three-month old could lay snug across her chest. Such things were common to the elves, as the women often foraged for food, tended family gardens, and other such matters, having to take their small children with them. Nilinda looked comfortable and went into her afternoon snooze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing out in the city for the first time since going on bed rest felt old and new at the same time. It was old because very little had changed. The city was the same, the people were the same, very little changed in Adinah. But it was different because it felt like the first time in nearly forever to the elf. She had forgotten how crowded the streets could be and had to maneuver carefully, so as not to run into anyone, or disturb the child hanging in front of her. True, part of the problem may have been that she was much wider than the last time she had been out and about in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had decided too make this a functional trip out as well, and stopped at the usual shops for food for the week. Many of the shop owners, who hadn't seen her in a while, were glad to see that she was back. They would chat and fuss over her new child, telling her how adorable she looked and how much she looked like her mother. Glesheri beamed and was glad to converse with people she considered to be somewhat friends. She had forgotten how much she missed this part of going out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you gettin' much sleep these days?\" the baker's wife teased, as she played with Nilinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri nodded. \"She's a quiet baby, for the most part. Though, she's been crying a little more often lately. I think she misses her father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe they sent him off to that gods-forsaken land,\" she said. \"I wouldn't want to be anywhere near those serpents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a day that went by that Glesheri didn't worry about him over there. She had heard tales about how dangerous the southern jungles could be. She had heard how the naga were a fierce and sometimes formidable race. She hoped Nessar was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sensed her discomfort and decided to change the subject. \"You've been looking good though, nice and healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time today, Glesheri realized she was actually starting to look normal in Adinah. Her extra girth made her seem like any other well-fed woman in the bustling city. Were it not for the ears, people would have mistook her for human. She absent-mindedly rubbed her hand into her soft, round belly, liking the feel of the plush skin as she squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Nessar makes sure I never starve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"I can see that. You were such a scrawny little thing when you first came here. Well, city-livin' does certainly have a way of putting meat on your bones.\" She handed Nilinda back to her mother. \"Now, then, I think I've got everything you asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the elf a sack, filled with all the various goods she had purchased. At least Nessar must have been doing fairly well on his excursion, as the money that was coming in to their home was a little more than it used to be. She happily paid, and wandered out onto her next stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople didn't seem to be so fascinated with an elf in their midst anymore. Fads had a tendency of wearing off quickly in the city. Plus, Glesheri, like so many others in the city had heard the news: the king had married the princess of the elves. Glesheri had a hard time believing Princess Dhasca would have wanted to marry a human king on her own. But then, if the king was handsome enough, or if they had really fallen in love it was possible. She couldn't help but feel a pang of anger and frustration at that. She had married a human and became a social pariah. The princess does it, and suddenly it's okay? Then again, Glesheri didn't know how the other elves might have reacted to such a thing. Maybe they had been just as angry with Dhasca as they were with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy late afternoon, she decided to take a small rest on a bench. Nilinda was getting fussy for her afternoon feeding anyway. It was nice just sitting and watching the people go by. A few times, some people would stop to ask her how old her baby was or to make funny faces at the child. But, mostly, people let her be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she reached lulled periods like this, she turned to her frequent activity: eating. She snacked on a few of the goods she had gotten, and she had bought extra, knowing this would probably happen. Glesheri still liked the idea of being rather round and fat. She liked the feel of her soft body, and she knew Nessar enjoyed it too. Plus, Nilinda liked snuggling close to her mother's soft curves. If it made everyone happy, why stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she knew she had to get up and continue her shopping if she wanted to get home before supper.

Thankfully, they were all much nicer than what their appearance suggested and didn't trouble him at all. This way, his research was done in only six months, and the young man was home. He was especially fascinated by the idea of the rainy season rituals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instantly recognized the roofs of Adinah's towers and buildings from far away, and while he saw them becoming taller and closer, his heartbeat kept racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You from Adinah, huh?\" asked a man sitting next to him. He had a half messy blonde head, and was missing a tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar nodded. \"Um, yeah. I haven't been here in months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that from your eyes,\" commented the man. \"Do you have someone important waiting for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar nodded. \"A beautiful wife and a just as beautiful daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnswering that question, made Nessar even more anxious to see Glesheri and Nilinda again. He wondered if they've been well without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled. \"And what are they gonna do once you are back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar shrugged his shoulders. \"Don't know, I guess they'll be happy? Especially my wife once I show her what I have here.\" And he patted his large bag, that was almost ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed home. The king could've waited for the research's results, but Nessar couldn't wait to meet his family again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hurry, he had troubles in fitting the key, but once he could open the door he slammed it and screamed, \"I'm baaack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first there was no answer, and Nessar put the heavy bag on the floor during the wait, then, he could hear some steps, and soon after that, Glesheri was walking toward him. Actually, she wasn't walking but waddling, and the elf had a beaming smile on her round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar couldn't help but notice Glesheri's changes. In the span of 5-6 months, the elf had gotten much wider. She was officially, undeniably fat, probably even more than Adinah's average woman, with large breasts resting on her round and soft belly, which was jiggling in front of her large thighs. All these features plus the wide hips made Glesheri looks like a motherly goddess. And for her husband, she was just as beautiful as an actual goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two met, tears poured from the eyes of both, and they embraced in a big hug. Nessar felt Glesheri's body had gotten much softer, and that he could barely touch his hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you,\" said the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you too,\" replied the man. \"There hasn't been a day where I didn't think about you and Nilinda. Speaking of, how is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri grabbed his hand and dragged him to Nilinda's room. There Nessar saw his daughter, who had grown a lot during these months, sitting on the carpet and playing with a doll and some wooden toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nilinda\" said Glesheri. \"your father is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little half-elf raised her eyes to see Nessar. She now had big eyes, the elven ears had fully stretched, and her black hair were growing to halfway down her neck. Once she saw her father, as if she somehow recognized him, she leaned on her hands to reach him, but she couldn't crawl yet so she simply fell on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar chuckled and approached Nilinda. \"Don't worry, my daughter.\" Then he raised her and looked at her. \"You've grown into a beautiful baby.\" He turned toward Glesheri. \"It's too obvious she's taken from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri sat on a chair and replied, \"Please, stop with these flatteries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying the truth,\" said Nessar getting close to her. \"Now we're all together, and we will be forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilinda smiled and muttered some baby words. The couple interpreted it as an agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar narrated some episodes that happened with the naga, like the meeting with the queen, who was incredibly fat, like the king's fattest concubines, then, after he finished narrating, it was Glesheri's turn.<br>\r\nThe elf, however, didn't have much to say, except some episodes regarding Nilinda, like her first words or her failures when she tried to stand up. This was because she mainly spent the time at home or going for a walk in Adinah, and on both occasions she spent most of the time eating, and she was aware of her changes, and how Nessar and Nilinda (The latter by sleeping comfortable next to her mother) appreciated them, and Glesheri didn't mind them at all too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meanwhile, Nessar prepared a special feast for his wife using a large chunk of triceratops meat he brought back from the Motee Marshes. Glesheri couldn't resist from the smell and began digging in, while Nessar fed Nilinda her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would've liked it,\" said Nessar, looking at Glesheri, eating with delight. \"There are these fruits too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks *munch* I've already seen them *chomp* but, honestly, I think human food is better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then later we can go and eat in a tavern, if you have some space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished the triceratops meat and proceeded on eating the rest of the food, Glesheri replied, \"Sure! I'll surprise you with how much I can eat.\u201d She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Glesheri could see herself eating more and more as her stomach became larger. Abelard took note of that since he had to make his portions bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll ask Sornna to take care of Nilinda for a while,\" replied Nessar while lulling his daughter to make her fall asleep, \"and then we'll spend a nice day together.\"</span></div></div>",

But, Glesheri listened with wonder in her eyes and was absolutely fascinated by their culture. She didn't seem to mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Nessar finished, \"I think with this last bit of research, they'll finally promote me to a Master, and from what I understand, most of my duties would be held at Bosch Keep. I wouldn't have to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, then,\" Glesheri said, finishing the last bit of her meal. Or rather, meals, Nessar would argue. Glesheri had, by herself, managed to eat enough for three people at the tavern. He shook his head with a little laugh. \"I mean, I'm glad you had fun and you got to experience all of that. But, I don't think we can go that long without you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her stuffed gut, finally feeling full. Nessar glanced. Indeed, since they had come in, it had swelled outward, brushing against the table, and looked hard as a rock. \"I can tell you missed me,\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating helped me forget how much I missed you,\" she said. \"I guess I didn't realize just how much bigger I was getting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooted closer to her on the bench and helped her rub small circles, helping her ease the tightness. He leaned in and whispered in her ear. \"You know, looking like this, it does remind me that we never finished our conversation on having more children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and kissed his cheek. \"No, I suppose not. I guess I wanted Nilinda to be a little bit older before we gave her siblings, but I wouldn't mind at least trying right now. If you are going to be here in the city now, it would be a good time.\" She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...I don't miss the way people treated us back at the Verge, but I miss the Verge. I'm getting used to the city, sure, but it would've been nice for our children to see it just once, to know what all that fresh air and green earth felt like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed her shoulder. \"I know, and I would've liked that too. I'll try asking around. Maybe attitudes have changed after your princess married the king. Maybe we can visit once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped him in a tight embrace. \"I'd like that very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" He could tell there seemed to be more on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri placed her hands on her belly again. \"Well...do you like me being bigger? I mean, I've always known you love me no matter what, but is me being fatter something that...arouses you? I've kind of suspected, so I've been...sort of...eating more on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and gave her side a gentle poke. He was surprised to see that his finger sunk down to the first knuckle. \"Well, I'm not going to lie, it has made you that much softer and warmer to cuddle. But, if we're being honest, yes, I guess that is something I like very much. When you're eating and I can tell how happy that makes you, it makes me happy. And, yes, I've always liked a girl with more meat on her bones. But, you don't have to go forcing yourself to eat to make me happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again. \"It's not really forcing. I really do love eating. But, I thought if I ate just to get fat, it'd be nice. Plus, I guess, I kind of like it too. It's just...what if I got too big for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's possible,\" he said, kissing the side of her head. \"I love you no matter what. So, if you want to eat until you're as big as a house, I'd let you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her eyebrows in surprise. \"I don't think anyone could get that big. But, I meant, what if I got too big to care for Nilinda, or any of our children? What if I was too big to even get up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, trying to think of his answer, and how to say it right. He had thought about that possibility, given his wife's appetite, and he had wondered what he would do in that situation. But, then, he had seen some of the Naga in their fattened, immobile states after rainy season, and the answer became pretty clear to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like you've always told me: we'll figure it out. No matter what happens to us, we always find some way to manage. I'm not going to lie; it probably wouldn't be easy, but we'd find a way. I'll always be by your side, no matter what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward and kissed him. \"I love you so much, right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stroked her hair for several seconds. \"I love you too. Now, I think Sorrna still has a few more hours with Nilinda. I think that's just enough time for a little time to ourselves.\" He winked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nNessar got used to the life in Adinah again, as very little had changed. The only differences were his new job as headmaster, Nilinda was able to crawl and not a little bundle anymore, and Glesheri was rounder with a larger appetite. But Nessar gladly adapted his portions to his wife's needs, and his new job allowed that without any economic trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Nessar could see that not everything was perfect for his wife, and it definitely wasn't the food, as she always ate until she was stuffed and then some. It wasn't her gain, as she even admitted to like it. It wasn't a lack of attention, as Nessar spent a lot of time with her. So, what was it? After a couple of days, Nessar got the answer: she missed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdinah was a good place to live in for the elf. She was considered an ordinary citizen (even if they sometimes treated her like a pet, but it was definitely much better than being an outcast) and could eat all the delicious human dishes she wanted. But it wasn't the place she lived in. There were different traditions, different people, and different buildings. It was very different from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her husband caught on to that, he had a talk with the king, and it wasn't hard to convince him for into allowing a short trip. After all, Nessar was now a headmaster and it was thanks to his research that King Roland found a wife (and, according to some rumors, an heir).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Nessar came home with a big smile, hoping Glesheri would smile too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I have a surprise,\" said Nessar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri waddled to him, with Nilinda in her arms. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar gave her a kiss on her lips and then said, \"We're going on a small trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri felt confused. \"Ok\u2026where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the Verge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf was silent for a few seconds, almost stunned, and then said, \"R-really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Glesheri was unsure, she didn't leave the Verge on good terms with the other elves, but then, nostalgia kicked in and she hugged her husband in a big squishy hug, along with her daughter, and thanked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to thank me,\" said Nessar. \"How many times did I tell you that I want you happy? So, don't worry. Now let's have a large dinner, and later we'll prepare our stuff for the journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they had a very big dinner, which meant that all the extras went to Glesheri. The news of the visit at the Verge made her really happy, and it kicked up her appetite, so much that she didn't realize she had eaten enough for an entire family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Nessar prepared their things, while Nilinda slept and Glesheri rested on the bed to digest all the food she ate. The elf patted her large and round stomach, wondering what capacity it would reach in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, the family left home, and got on a cart toward the Verge. The journey was long, and Glesheri and Nessar and showed all the places they could see during the travel to their daughter, even though she was still too young to remember them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while Glesheri was at first excited, that feeling got mixed with worry, wondering if the elves would accept her or if she would still be considered an outcast. She looked at Nilinda with apprehension, hoping the best for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the question of how they would react to her new curves. During her time at Adinah she gained new layers of fat, and while Adinah's women were large on average (still, an average smaller than what Glesheri had become), in the Verge the elves were willowy and slim, not even the half of Glesheri's current weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this anxiety caused the elf to eat much more than usual, and even if Nessar was prepared enough to bring plenty of food for the journey, Glesheri dug through it in half the expected time. But her husband was understanding enough (if not downright happy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some weeks, they finally reached Pyknos Verge. Glesheri could see all the large and tall trees that caught the sunrays, while only some light reached the grass, could still recognize the traces left by a satyr who passed there not long ago, and could already smell the aroma of the most beautiful flowers, along with that of the sweet honey of the bees, which brought memories of some of the most delicious and juicy berries that grew in the forest, the sweetness of the fruits, and the tasty meat of the rabbits. All these memories, made Glesheri hungry, and her stomach rumbled, scaring poor little Nilinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Nilinda,\" said Glesheri hugging her daughter. \"Mom didn't want to upset you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the first thing I'll do, once we arrive, is make a rich lunch,\" said Nessar, patting his wife's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the Verge, they went back to their old house. Nessar and Glesheri recognized their previous neighbors, who also remembered the couple. The elves looked at the couple with surprise, some with curiosity and/or suspiciousness, but no one with disdain like they did before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was left untouched, and it was all dusty. Nessar didn't waste any time to clean it up, while Glesheri slept on the bed, which seemed much smaller than she could remember, until she realized that it was she who had gotten bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, dinner was ready, made with elven ingredients that Nessar bought not long before arriving. It looked more like a feast than a dinner for a small family, and naturally, most of It went to Glesheri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished, Glesheri said, \"You didn't lose your touch cooking with the ingredients of the Verge. It was all good, congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar chuckled. \"Are you sure it's not you who would accept anything edible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf blushed. \"Of course not. For instance, I still prefer human food, but after so much time, it was good eating this nostalgic flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Nilinda?\" asked Nessar, pointing at the baby crawling around the house. \"What would she eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we have a special mush made with a mixture of berries for the babies. But would probably have to ask the neighbors for ingredients,\" she said, the last line with hesitation. Would they lend them food again? She wasn't sure, but given their nicer looks, maybe it was worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and her husband asked together, and, with great surprise, they were nice again, and lent a large bowl of the grains and berries used to make the dish. Apparently they had had a baby who was born not long after Nilinda. Not only that, they even apologized for their behavior from before, and explained how the reputations of the humans changed after the elven princess' marriage with the human king. The fact that it was necessary for such a big marriage to change their minds irked Glesheri, since she didn't consider it fair when she had such a loving one with Nessar that was disrespected, but it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this change in attitude, the couple could spend a wonderful week, where they could walk through the Verge without being judged. Glesheri could show her husband and her daughter some of the most beautiful places and buildings, and all in all, have a good time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy it?\" asked Nessar as he lay in the bed with Glesheri, while Nilinda was sleeping in a room next to theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cuddles? Of course, though you tickle my hips too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was talking about the week here. And sorry about that, but I can't resist it,\" he replied, poking his wife's exposed fat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri giggled. \"Easy, boy! Well, it was beautiful being at home again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar replied, \"I see. If you prefer, we can live here. It won't tamper my job at headmaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri thought about it. She clearly loved the Verge; she spent most of her life there, and she wouldn't mind living here, especially if they could afford a much larger house. But at the same time, she had some friends in Adinah, and human food was really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she replied:</span></div></div>",

Moving her feet and staying balanced was another matter entirely, but she had been improving. Since coming back to the city, Nessar and Glesheri felt that their lives were finally on the right track. Things seemed to be going smoothly once again. Nessar went to work every day at the palace, and came home every night, able to spend time with his family. Glesheri had gotten comfortable in her usual routines, and spent most of her time caring for their daughter. She was getting old enough now that her mother had to keep a close eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't have minded staying in the Verge. Life for their family there would have improved, compared to how they had been treated before. But, in the end, she had grown accustomed to life in the city, and was glad to stay there. Still, a few visits here or there weren't totally out of the question. Still, Glesheri had a life here that she genuinely enjoyed, and the food wasn't too bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little struggle, Nilinda was starting to take her first few steps, her tongue sticking out of the corner of her mouth as she concentrated hard on walking. But, after the first few, she was able to walk to her mother's arms with relative ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that! You're walking now!\" Glesheri exclaimed, picking her up, and holding her in a tight embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar came in shortly after. \"Did I hear that right? Someone's started walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Glesheri said, \"and pretty soon this one's going to be getting into all sorts of trouble, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar came up behind his wife and helped her to her feet. In the past few months since coming back to the city, she had indeed gotten larger, as always, but this time, it was for different reasons. Glesheri got her balance, and placed a hand on the small swell of her stomach that hadn't been there before. \"I get one walking just in time for another to come along,\" she said, kissing Nessar's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, not long after (and the couple suspected it had happened shortly before their visit to the Verge), Glesheri had gotten pregnant, and she eagerly awaited experiencing motherhood again. Nessar picked Nilinda up and patted his wife's shoulder. \"That is the way of it, isn't it. But, I'm sure our little girl's going to be a wonderful big sister, isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, sis!\" the toddler squealed, mimicking the sounds she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri smiled. \"I'm sure.\" Her stomach growled. \"But right now, this one's making me hungry all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar had his doubts about that. His wife still ate quite a bit, as always, but she often liked to use the new baby as her excuse to eat even more. Still, he was happy to oblige, knowing he could never deny the rotund elf. As she ate today, he did notice that her dress was looking quite tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may want to consider going to town soon for a few new outfits,\" he said. \"I believe this one's starting to look pretty snug.\" He rubbed a hand up and down her belly, knowing that commenting on her size got her in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked to tease him back just as much. \"I don't know. I think you like it when my clothes are a little tight,\" she said, pulling him in closer for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little,\" he admitted. \"But, in all seriousness, you might want to consider it here soon. The king has invited me to one of his feasts here soon, and he said it would be nice if I could bring my family as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Oh, that would be wonderful!\" she beamed. \"I assume, then, that things are going well at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"More or less. I get to engage in whatever studies I want, and I hardly see the king. He only calls upon me when he's holding council and needs to make tough decisions. He's starting to think about making some arrangements with the nagas after he saw my research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all the same, I'm proud of you. No more long trips though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"I promise. Mostly, I get to read the work of other scholars on other races of Yndyre and come back to the king with my thoughts on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Glesheri was happy to be back in the city. She had everything she needed there: a husband with a decent job, a family, friends, and all the food she could desire. She was quite content with this decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nGlesheri waddled through the streets of Adinah, feeling more at home than ever. She brought Nilinda with her in a pouch on her back and could hear the half-elf\u2019s giggles behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, bwed,\" said Nilinda, pointing at the bakery they were walking by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what an eye!\" complimented Glesheri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the elf also noticed the bakery, especially because she couldn't ignore the smell of recently baked bread, but first she had another thing to do. For once, food could wait (hopefully, not for long).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri entered the tailor shop and found Mya, the tailor, busy sewing a blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mya! It's me, Glesheri,\" puffed the elf. These long walks really were taking it out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMya raised her head. \"Look if it isn't my favorite elf! Glesheri, how've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she went to greet the customer in a big squishy hug. Mya was a portly woman with a round face and blonde locks. She was well-known in Adinah because of her large bosom (which very few men missed) and for being an extraordinary tailoress, especially when it came to larger sizes, something that came very handy in a city populated by women larger than usual. Even the king himself sometimes asked her to make some special clothes for his larger concubines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, and you? How's business going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, recently I had another request from the king and... oh, but there's little Nilinda too,\" squealed Mya upon noticing the little half elf in the back pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri put her daughter on a pouf in the corner. \"Yes, recently I can't get a moment without staying close to her. She's growing into a little trouble-maker. Let's hope she wants to go to bed tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can such a cute bundle of adorableness cause any kind of trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to keep her for an entire day?\" joked Glesheri. \"Anyway, speaking of the King, Nessar, Nilinda, and I have been invited to one of his feasts, so I need a new dress, and possibly one for Nilinda too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMya smirked. \"Do you want something looser? With more space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I'm waiting for a second child, so I definitely need some more room to grow,\" replied Glesheri, avoiding the blonde's eyes while pointing at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMya nodded and giggled. She guessed that the elf would've grown baby or no. The first time she saw her she probably weighed half of what she did now. Heck, she could see the elf not-so-slowly becoming bigger than her. Probably not even the king's favorite concubines grew that fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, come here and remove your clothes. I need to take your measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri and Mya moved into another room, and thankfully Nilinda fell asleep, and the elf stripped herself. Mya's eyes bulged; that was definitely a lot of elf. She first measured her chest, each breast round and soft and as large as a child's head; then to the belly, and there Mya feared she would've needed a larger tape, but it was right enough for Glesheri's large middle, heaved in two by the tape around it, but offered some resistance thanks to the womb inside; then to the equally large hips, with each thigh nearly as thick as a slim woman's waist; and lastly, her arms, even those were covered by a layer of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew,\" said Mya. While not the largest woman she had met, the list of customers with lower measurements was probably longer. What surprised the tailor was her growing pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think it should be done in three days, is that fine?\" asked Mya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine, and what about my daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I should have some clothes for toddlers already done, let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having picked a dress for Nilinda, Glesheri decided it was time for a \"little\" reward and visited the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, it was the evening of the feast. Nessar was wearing the best outfit he had, while Nilinda was wearing a little dress with round sleeves and a large ribbon on the back. They were waiting for Glesheri, who was in the bedroom changing into her new dress. She brought it home two days ago, but Nessar couldn't see it. She said it was a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't need me to come and help?\" asked Nessar. While his wife wasn't that big, he thought her new curves might be giving her too much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's ok. I'm nearly done\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Glesheri came into full view with her new, emerald-green dress. It passed under her armpit, leaving the upper part of her chest exposed, with many knots around the waist and a large light green gown that came down to her feet. The dress didn't emphasize too much her curves; Mya thought of leaving a lot of room to grow, and it was larger on the belly. She also had a pair of elegant gloves which went up nearly to the shoulder. Her long brown hair was tied into a tail that reached past her hips and around her neck (the few that remained) there was also a golden necklace, Nessar's gift for her last birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're... you're...\" said Nessar dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful?\" asked Glesheri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.... that would be an understatement... even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks, my dear,\" said Glesheri with a quick kiss on the lips, \"now, we have a feast to go to.\"</span></div></div>",

The great hall was vast and decked out in the finest banners. Glesheri didn't even know buildings could get this big. Compared to this, the halls of the elven king seemed like a shack in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king himself struck an impressive figure. He was a tall man with red hair, a beard, and a round gut. He too was dressed in his finest clothes, and Glesheri giggled to herself as she thought them a tad over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're impressed with the palace,\" he said, bringing her out of her thoughts. \"It's a look I'm quite familiar with. Many guests don't know what to say their first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri bowed slightly in greeting, and the king shook Nessar's hand. \"So glad you could make it,\" he said to her husband. \"I've been eager to meet your family. Contrary to what some might think, I do value the importance of familial bonds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar cleared his throat. \"Um, yes, well, this is Glesheri, and my daughter Nilinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe beamed. \"Wonderful. Nessar, I see you're a man after my heart. You certainly know how to keep a healthy-looking wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, letting her hands rest on the top of her dome of a belly. Nessar had at least given her some warning about the king's tastes, and that he may get a bit flirtatious with her as he had more to drink. While Glesheri had come to love her own size, she still found it odd that the king not only liked larger women but encouraged them to only get larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king continued. \"I apologize in advance, but the queen will not be able to attend tonight. She's recently entered confinement, and she cannot accept visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confinement?\" Glesheri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, elven customs are a bit different. What I mean is that she's incredibly far along in her pregnancy. During the last couple of months, a woman enters a confinement chamber where she can rest and remain comfortable until the birth. But, it is important that she is not disturbed. Only her midwife attends to her. I'm not even allowed in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, come, get seated, and the feast should begin shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar led his family over to the east side of the tables in the great hall. There, the family was able to find a comfortable spot. Glesheri was rather impressed with how wide the chairs were. Then it occurred to her that the king was probably trying to accommodate some of his larger concubines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, the elf got to see some of these immense women for herself. These women were far bigger than any of those she had seen in the city, and that was a lot of fat, quivering masses to take in for one night. Not all of them were human either, and Glesheri wasn't sure she could name all of the species present. The king did have quite the collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few were so large they had to be hauled in on litters, unable to walk themselves. She couldn't help but stare at some of them. She had never seen anyone that big before. Still, they did not look like they were unhappy with their lot. Trading the ability to walk for all the food one could ever hope for seemed like a pretty good deal. Glesheri was tempted to laugh. She was probably the thinnest woman there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilinda had taken notice too. She tugged at her mother's dress. \"Mama, big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, don't be rude, sweetie,\" she said. \"But, yes, they are...big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar winked. \"I told you, you would be surprised with this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is something else,\" she said. \"I never realized all this went on here. I don't think I could even imagine being that big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed her cheek, and rubbed his hand up and down her belly. \"I don't know. The way you put away food, that could be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"Stop, if I didn't know better, I'd say that was a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"No, you know I love you no matter your size. But wait 'til you see the feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a feast it was. Plump serving girls began to bring out the dishes and set them out on the tables. There was just about everything imaginable to eat. There had to be at least ten different kinds of meats, and Glesheri was sure an entire farm's crops had to be out there, if not more. Adinah must be incredibly prosperous if they could afford to have these kinds of feasts and still be able to feed its people well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tables filled with food, Glesheri began to realize that there was far more food than there was tablespace. Had the king over-prepared? She hardly doubted it. Likely, it wouldn't last long if his concubine's appetites were as big as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king, once again, welcomed all of his guests, offered a small toast, and commenced the feast. He wasn't about to let his women go hungry for too much longer.</span></div></div>",

Then she got the idea: why decide when you could get one of everything?<br>\r\nShe was a guest, after all, and the king would've been glad if his guests appreciated the food he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she began. First, she picked some of the warm bread with ham, a type of meat she didn't recognize but looked shiny enough under the lights to seem very good, some cheese and a bowl of minced meat.<br>\r\nAfter she filled all the reachable portions on the table with plates of \"tasting samples\", she proceeded to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her first bite of the steak, her taste buds where excited like they had never been before. It was really good, maybe even better than what Nessar usually made (though she would never admit it). Maybe the buttery sauce had something to do with it, and it didn't take long for the elf to finish her first plate. Then she went on to another, still meat, but this time of a different kind, which Glesheri recognized as beef that was amazing. Then she decided to eat something other than meat and went for the bread. It was crispy outside and soft in the inside and had black olives in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri ate and ate, without noticing, nor caring, how much she was eating. Human food always brought her great pleasure, and the elf was in pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she had eaten all the food next to her, but thankfully the maids readily removed the empty plates and asked her if she wanted more, and Glesheri couldn't say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf didn't notice that she had attracted the attention of many guests, and even some of the concubines, many of the latter were surprised by the quantity of food the elf was eating, and they weren't slouching either (in fact, most of them were visibly fatter). Some of the concubines even began eating more to challenge the unaware elf, like a red-haired kitsune and a gorgon so fat that could barely move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Nessar was having fun watching his wife eating all that food while barely giving any care and playing with Nilinda, who was impressed by her mother's feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad... where momma food?\" asked the half-elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in mommy's tummy,\" replied Nessar, pointing at Glesheri's round and stuffed gut, which was pressing against the table. Thankfully the dress Mya made had a lot of free space and could contain her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, after a while Glesheri reached her limit, completely full, as she had never eaten that much before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help?\" asked Nessar, placing a hand on Glesheri's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no thanks. I can do it alone,\" replied the elf, who felt a bit embarrassed in doing that in front of the others. If they were alone she would've gladly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she massaged her round gut, and asked to the baby inside, \"It's not too crowded out there, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure have a big appetite, don't you?\" commented her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, haven\u2019t you been paying attention?\" asked Glesheri. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, I love the food here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you've eaten almost as much as this before. If I knew you were able to eat this much, I would've made richer lunches,\" Then he started playing with Nilinda on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri blushed. \"Oh, please, it's just the pregnancy.\" Though in her mind, she wouldn't have minded eating these meals at home, with Nessar helping feed her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began talking with one of the concubines, another elf, though she didn't look too happy about her lifestyle (and was probably the thinnest of the concubines, even slightly thinner than Glesheri), but she didn't want to talk about that, and in the meanwhile she snacked on a few things the maids kept bringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after she more or less digested, she slowly raised herself from the chair and decided to take a little walk. Nessar would have come with her but was too busy with Nilinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile exploring the castle, Glesheri looked around. It was all so fancy and big, with knight statues that looked too scary for her and paintings of what looked like previous rulers, and she noticed how all of them were on the heavy side, especially the queens. Heck, some of those women had probably outgrown the already large throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how large this castle was, from the inside it was already huge, but now it seemed even larger, like a multi-floor labyrinth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even looked around for a maid as she felt like she was lost, and her legs were already giving up on her, despite the fact she didn't walk this much, and besides, she would have liked another couple of those sweet tarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of exploration, she found an interesting door. The elf knew she shouldn't open it, but the curiosity was just too much, so she opened it and found..</span></div></div>",

Many avoided him if they saw his presence anywhere near them. His work was starting to suffer greatly. Still, he was willing to accept all of that so long as Glesheri was happy. So long as they stayed in the Verge, in their small, but suitable home, everything would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, all was not as well as hoped. He found her sitting by the hearth, a teary look in her eye. \"Everything okay?\" he asked worriedly. If anyone had caused her distress because of her marriage to him, they had better hope the gods took mercy on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's working,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already knew what she meant. They had made several attempts to conceive a child over the past few months, and a series of failures was becoming increasingly frustrating for the two of them. Glesheri especially was becoming upset by it, as if she felt it was somehow her fault. He scooped her up in a comforting hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" he said. \"Our luck will turn around soon enough. Gods willing, we'll have more children than we know what to do with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if the gods aren't listening?\" she sobbed. \"What if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew open as a strong gust of wind struck their home. The sky had seemed to turn several shades darker as well. Standing on the threshold of their home was a dark, hooded figure whose face was concealed by their dark cloak. Nessar instinctively shielded his wife. \"Who are you?\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure ignored him, strode into their home, and took a seat at their table. He removed his hood, revealing the face of an old, withered elf, whose skin was as pale as the snow-capped mountains and hair dark as a raven's. He was a dark elf of the north. His face was worn and weathered from blistering winds, and ugly scars crossed his face. He was hard to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Nessar asked again, his voice rising to sound more intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gods aren't listening to you,\" the dark elf said, grabbing a leg of rabbit from their dinner table and proceeding to eat without their invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri was curious by his statement. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a chiding laugh. \"You're an elf who married a human. Of course, Yva isn't going to bless you with a child. After her first failed marriage with a human, she's always had it out for them. She isn't going to help someone who betrays their people, like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri wilted at that. Now that she thought about it, he was right. She had heard all the tales. Yva had been gifted with the first man to be her mate, and he gave her the twin gods, Ardoid and Enkoia, but he wasn't true to her. She turned him into a deer as punishment and removed all human qualities from her children. She hated man ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was still fuming at the arrival of this stranger who only proceeded to upset his wife further. At the same time, his scholarly personality drove him to question further. \"So, then, what are we supposed to do with that information?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a raspy wheeze and wiped the meat juices from his chin. \"You're going about it all wrong. You want a child? You don't go to some holier-than-thou goddess who has it out for you. Let the bitch stew in her hatred.\" The couple winced at how easily the dark elf cursed a god. \"I'm saying you need to seek out other sources.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the goddess of the dark elves will lend a more sympathetic ear. She doesn't care who you are or who you're married to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The goddess of the dark elves?\" Glesheri asked. She had never heard of such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled wickedly. \"Glustra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri gasped. Nessar was now more confused than ever. \"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...she's Yva's...'shadow,' I think is the right word. A demon,\" Glesheri answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark elf scoffed. \"Demon is just what you 'high and mighty' elves call something that doesn't fit your perfect worldview. But yes, she is another side to Yva, her opposite. She's much looser in her morals. I think she's just the person to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Nessar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"Don't you worry about that. You look hard enough for her, and she'll make sure you find her hut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, their mysterious guest skulked out of their home as mysteriously as he had appeared. The couple was still pretty shaken by the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...\" Nessar began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we?\" Glesheri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped to carefully pick out her next words. \"Should we seek Glustra out to help us? It feels dangerous, but it might be our only option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something doesn't feel right about all this. That guy, he just happened to come here to help us with our problem? No, something doesn't add up. But, if you really want it, I'll go with you. We're in this together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment. There was so much danger in this situation. Nessar was right, this was all too convenient. There had to be something up. At the same time, the reward was too great.</span></div></div>",

Really, they had just started off in one direction, hoping to come across any kind of a sign, having no real idea of how to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man was right,\" she said, following behind him. \"Yva would never help us. If this is what it will take for us to have a family, then I'm willing to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at what cost? Glesheri, I don't think she's just going to give us children out of the goodness of her heart. If I know one thing about demons, it's that everything has a price with them. At least that's what all the legends say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But maybe she's not a demon like he said. Maybe we've just been looking at it wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar didn't argue with her any further. She was determined, and there was no stopping her. They were quiet for some time. And, for quite some time, they weren't sure if they would ever find this hut. After all, they were just wandering around nowhere hoping to find something. But, at long last, Glesheri spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even want children?\" she asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want children? Is that why you're so unsure about this plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped and took her in his arms. \"Of course, I want children. I want as many as you could ever wish for. Glesheri, I love you, and nothing would please me more than having a family to share that love with. But...I just feel we're getting into some dangerous territory for it. Look, in all the stories I've heard, forces like Glustra only want one thing: to torture mortalkind. They hide behind this visage of wanting to help people for the right price, only to make them suffer. And that's the last thing I want: to see you suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like she was thinking deeply, really considering their options. \"But, if we don't try, then we don't have a chance. I'd rather suffer and at least believe there is some hope rather than just suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Okay then, I support you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri looked up from her embrace with him. \"What's that over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind him, Nessar saw it too: a faint light in the distance. Feeling a sinking sense of dread, he had a feeling. The couple walked towards it, getting closer and closer. Upon their approach, they saw it was a large but simple hut in the middle of the woods, with smoke emitting from the hole in the roof, and the faint glow of a fire from a window. This had to be it. There could be no other explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, the two dared to enter the doorway. Upon entering, they realized they had to be in the realm of an otherworldly being, for the hut itself was much larger on the inside than it appeared to be on the outside. In fact, it looked like one massive great hall, larger than that of the king of the elves. A long table stretched out around the room, food everywhere. And off to the sides, they could see several doors that must lead to other rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't what drew their attention the most. All around the great table were dozens of humans, elves, and other people in Yndyre, if they could be called people anymore. Rather they were just rounded, blobs of flesh, devouring any food that was within reach. They were like pigs at a trough, eating with abandon. In fact, it seemed that they really had no capability of thought beyond pressing food into their mouths. Whenever one would run out of food within reach, they would scramble about blindly, grabbing at air until one of the lithe, beautiful dark elves who served the food would bring them more. No, they weren't dark elves proper, but ethereal somehow, as if they didn't really exist, at least not fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the head of the table, all the way at the other end of the hall was a rotund creature. She was elvish, at least that much they could tell, but her tall ears looked like they had been gnawed at by a wild beast. She wore crude animal furs about her. Though she was not exactly a pile of flab like the mindless creatures who feasted at her table, she was massive, looking to be one of the largest women any of them had ever seen. Her gut looked round and taut as if she were with child, it was clear that her shape was a result of her gluttonous eating. Unlike her \"guests,\" this woman ate with some refinement, but otherwise devoured food as fast as they could, her mouth salivating with blood at each bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly noticed her two guests in the room, and motioned for them to come forward. \"I was wondering when I would expect you two,\" she said, taking a minor break from her feast. \"Glesheri and Nessar, the couple who shocked the Verge. An honor it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was dumbstruck, but Glesheri was brave enough to speak. \"So, you know who we are and why we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"Not so hard really. All who truly desire to find my lair will find it eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're Glustra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"You got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar was still looking around at the flabby creatures. \"Who are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlustra gave an even toothier grin. \"They are also people who found my halls, and decided that staying here was better than the outside world. Most are lost travelers, a few curious souls, and some like you, who thought they knew what they were looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri was undeterred. \"We know exactly why we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you do. Yva certainly has been cruel to the two of you. That bitch has always had it out for humans since her mate. Of course, if she only knew a thing or two about pleasing a man, he wouldn't have run off on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri was hopeful. \"So you'll help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On one condition...\"</span></div></div>",

He had expected this kind of thing to happen. \"What kind of test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon took another bite from the piping hot meat she was holding. \"Well, if there is one thing Yva and I do agree on, it's that men are unfaithful by there very nature. I'm just less discriminating than her and say it applies to all men, not just humans. But nothing would please me more than to see that smug elf be proven wrong, even if that means I'd be wrong as well. So, let's have a little wager, shall we? Here's how it works. Glesheri here will stay with me in my halls for an entire year. I really don't give a damn what you do during that time, but if you so much as look at another woman longingly during that time, you lose, and she is mine forever. But, if you really do love her and are true to her, then I will grant you both your wish. Her womb will be opened, and you can have as many children to your hearts' content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A whole year?\" Glesheri gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"If you don't think you can handle it, then be on your merry way and get out. I'm sure you're way of trying to have children before was working so well.\" She chuckled maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf turned to her husband, a determined look in her eyes. Nessar wasn't as confident. \"You can't be serious,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessar, I trust you, and I know you would stay true to me. That means we have nothing to worry about. We can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clasped her shoulders. \"But...but, a whole year without you, and what if Glustra goes back on her promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon spoke up, clearly able to hear them, despite their whispering. \"A shadow's word is binding. Even if I wanted to torment your pathetic souls, I've already promised you, and there are grave consequences for me if I don't adhere to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still felt unsure about it all and was desperately trying to find some way out of it. He would do anything to talk his wife out of this. Nessar looked around the room again, the overweight beings still deep in their gluttonous daze. He had a feeling there would be more to this than meets the eye. \"Please,\" he said, \"this is dangerous, and I'm afraid of what'll happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a fierceness come over Glesheri that he had never seen before. \"Do you love me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, but -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you want a family with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than anything, but Glesheri, let's think about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"There's nothing to think about. We can succeed in her test, and we'll be able to start our family. Nessar, I wouldn't do this if I didn't think it was our only option. But you heard that man the other day, and you heard her. The gods are working against us. If we don't do this now, I don't think we have any other chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a long, drawn-out sigh. \"Okay, yes. Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlustra smiled from her perch. \"Excellent. So, it shall begin. As of now, Glesheri belongs to me. You shall return to this hut in one year's time to retrieve her, Nessar. And remember, I will know if you've ever been untrue to your dear, sweet wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the ethereal beings began to escort him towards the door. He kept his gaze focused behind him, trying to get as much of a last look at his wife as he could. He would never see her again for an entire year. He wasn't sure how he would be able to go on. As the wooden door shut behind him, he could see Glesheri give him one last tearful look of goodbye, but he also detected a hint of hope in her. He prayed she knew what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpf, seemed awfully eager to not let you do this,\" Glustra said. \"Makes me wonder if he questioned his own faithfulness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri turned back to her. \"I'm not going to let you get into my head. Nessar loves me, and he will return just as true to me as he is now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that, my dear. In the meantime, you are in my halls, which means a welcome feast is in order. Go on now, sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how confident she had appeared, Glesheri did feel a sense of unease about all of this. She cautiously took a nearby empty seat at the great table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that moment, it was as if something possessed her. It was like her mind had only one command: eat. She began grabbing foods left and right on the table, eating with relish each delicious bite. She wasn't going to deny that the demon had a knack for amazing food. But after a while, the command in her brain urged her with new thoughts: more and faster. Pretty soon, she was hardly chewing on any of the food and found herself gorging for the sake of putting only more in her mouth. Yet all the while, a part of her knew this wasn't normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlustra smirked as she noted the slight hint of fear in her eyes. \"Confused? I imagine you would be. You see, Yva is the goddess of fertility and plenty. She only gives. I only take. I am mistress of gluttony and instinct. Any who enter my halls are possessed by a spell that lets you give in to your baser instincts. It's quite amusing really. And this is about to be your future for the next year...more, if I'm lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple of hours, all Glesheri did was gorge on the bounty Glustra offered. But then when her hand went to reach for more, she found she had been restrained by the ethereal servants, who began trying to heave her away from the table. The spell pushing her on, she continued to try and reach, frustrated by her efforts. Glustra finally came down from her perch and looked the elf over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the enthusiasm, my dear, but I'm not about to let you eat yourself to death. I do have a bargain to uphold, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri followed the demon's gaze and saw her own stomach outstretched and taut, wobbling and quivering in protest for her not to eat another bite. Glustra poked her finger into it, finding there wasn't even an inch of give left. \"Yes, that'll do for now. Don't worry, my dear. You'll find that as the days pass and this tiny little stomach stretches just a little more each day, you'll be able to stay at my table longer.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every day was quickly becoming a routine for Glesheri. She was brought to the great hall where she would eat until nearly burst, only being held off by Glustra's servants. She would be brought back to her quarters in the hut, one of the many, many rooms in this magical structure, where she was expected to rest and digest. And after a while, she would be brought back to the halls to do it all again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell that possessed her never ceased and clouded her mind very easily. When she was resting in her room, her mind was plagued with thoughts of more food. The spell only commanded her to eat, and never let her own instincts tell her when to stop. She had to always be forced away from the food before she could cause herself harm. And when she wasn't near the food, her brain made her crave it thrice more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut each day, as she gorged herself to near bursting at every opportunity, her stomach stretched just a little further, meaning that the next time she returned to the table, she was able to eat for longer periods of time. At the moment, she still ate a regular three meals a day, as she still did not have the stomach capacity to eat like the other mindless slaves at the great table. Glesheri wondered about them, who they had been, and if there was any semblance of the person they were still in those dull, lifeless eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every day, once she had been pulled from the tables, gut full and taut, Glustra would inspect her, marveling at her increased size day by day. \"Certainly are coming along well,\" Glustra finished one day. \"Of course, you did have quite a bit of an appetite before you came here. You were a little chubbier than I'm used to seeing elves.\" Her fingers grazed the shiny, red, swollen dome of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri winced. Even though the demon had agreed to help them, she still felt uncomfortable around her, and didn't take to kindly to being touched. Instead, she asked a question. \"What has happened to them?\" she said, nodding over to the piles of flesh still gorging. \"Are they possessed at a state worse than mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"Hardly. They started out pretty much like you. But, the longer the urges took possession of them, the more inclined they were to give into them. After a while, they just became what they truly are: animals. I find it rather humorous that you mortal beings think yourself so advanced and mighty. It's even funnier that the gods think that because they created you, you are more gifted than any other lower creature. But, I have proven you are no more than sacks of flesh that behave just as any other creature in the wild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To prove my point. Haven't I just explained that?\" she said with a huff. \"But, if we're being totally honest, I like doing it just for the amusement. You have heard of the king in the central region and his women, yes? He's got nothing on me. You haven't even seen all of them. Some are so large, they can no longer be taken here to the halls. They just lie in a fleshy pile in their quarters, waiting for my servants to feed them. It's quite fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri was becoming more and more worried. \"You don't...you don't...\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat them? Of course not. I'm not like those vampires in the north, fattening up their victims for sustenance. It's just fun watching you mortals act like the dumb animals you are. I can assure you, though, they never suffer. They die natural deaths in pure, gluttonous bliss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is this to become my fate as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlustra gave her a toothy grin. \"After only a year? No, my dear. Your mind will still be intact, if not just a tad slower-witted, but those effects would wear off upon your return to the mortal realm. That is, if you get to return. However, I must admit, that is what makes it enjoyable right now. It's been so long since I've had a newcomer I can actually converse with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri shook her head. \"Nessar will come back for me, and I will get to go home. You won't get to enjoy my company for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon laughed. \"My dear, you forget that I've had much, much, much more experience on this world than you can ever hope to imagine. I think I know just a little more about men than you do. It'll be a shame to no longer have someone to talk to as your mind dulls, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know him,\" Glesheri said with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\"</span></div></div>",

He would never see Glesheri again for another year, and he had no idea what kinds of horrible things could happen to her while she was in the demon's care. And the worst part of it was that there was nothing he could do about it. He simply had to wait, a long agonizing wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few deep breaths. He had to remain calm, he kept telling himself. If he lost his head now, he wouldn't be able to help her. He had to think. Nessar knew he would remain true to his wife. He could think of loving no one else. But, he had a sneaking suspicion that the demon's deal wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Chances were, there would be a trap lying in wait somehow, someway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would he go for an entire year while he did nothing but wait? Nessar considered going back to Adinah, back to his college to continue his studies to take his mind off of her loss. But, Adinah was filled with people, including some of its buxom women of the night. Not that he would have been tempted, but what if Glustra or one of her minions used that as a disguise to try and sabotage them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't go back to the Verge, especially not without Glesheri. The elves already hated him enough. There would be no way they'd let him back into their civilization as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first several days, Nessar stayed in the woods, living off of what supplies he had and a little bit of hunting and fishing. For a while, he considered that as a possibility. He could just live as a hermit in the woods. He'd be far away from any female temptation and he would not be intruding upon the elves' territory. But, he knew that couldn't last. The Verge was located where it was because it was an area plentiful with game and wild plants to eat. Out here in the middle of nowhere, there was almost nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to top it all off, he was lonely. He could have endured any trial so long as Glesheri was by his side. But now, he had nothing. She was far away in essentially some other realm, and he would not be able to see her again until he had waited out the full time. He wasn't sure he could make it. He was now a man with nothing. The only thing that could make his will strong was knowing that he could see her again, but right now, at the very start of this task, with a full year ahead of him, that seemed near impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staying in the woods for a few days, Nessar knew he had to go somewhere.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nessar decided to make his way north. He had heard that the small villages there were sparsely populated, but at least he would be near civilization of some kind. And, as he understood it, young women were in short supply there as well, for some reason he didn't know, but at least it would keep him away from temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, it wasn't an easy journey. It was actually quite a distance to reach the northern lands from the Verge. He still had to spend many days living off of whatever he could find in the woods as he journeyed on. And the further he got from the bounty of the Verge, the harder it was to find fresh water and a bit of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at long last, he did start seeing the northern lands. They were far more barren looking than those of the forests he had just come from. It was colder, as he had expected. But it was also simple. The few villages he saw sprawled out in the north were simple, the people living off of what little they could grow and the livestock they raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a simple inn where he was able to come by a cheap room and a few warm meals. Supposedly, its young cook was amazing, and he had to agree. If anything, the rotund inn owner was proof of how good she was. After a few days of just resting after his long journey, he decided to try and find a little work to keep him busy and to keep his room and board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the north wasn't a fertile oasis, it did have enough grassland to make it's living off of livestock. In this part of the north, there were mostly sheep farms. He took up work at a small farm, run only by a man with his two sons. They were eager to have an extra set of hands to help. They couldn't offer much in the way of wages, but it was enough to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, everything worked out rather nicely. He was working. He had a place to stay, and so far, nothing suspicious had arisen as far as temptations went to try and sway him away from his wife. He was still certain Glustra would try something. That is, until he learned the truth of why the north was so sparsely populated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had happened so suddenly one evening as he was finishing sheering the farm's sheep. The people of the village went into a frenzy as the sound of carriage wheels could be heard in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, boy?\" Bessel, the farmer's owner shouted. \"Get inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Nessar followed him inside the house as he bolted the door. He and the farmer's two sons sat quietly in the house, Nessar still unsure what was going on. And despite all the silence between the group, he spoke. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessel shook his head, muttering, \"The vampires. They always come here ever few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vampires? But, aren't you going to do something about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men laughed. \"You might as well stop a river. Those vampires are the power around here. They protect us from the other dangers out there, and from any attacks from other regions. In exchange, they take their dues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessel gave a weak smile. \"They protect us, in exchange for the young women of our village. They take our daughters in the night, grabbing any who catch their eye. Gods know what happens to them once they disappear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar stuttered out a few words, still in disbelief. \"But thats...why would...don't you try to do anything about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just say, boy? You don't stop them. All we can do is continue to live on, hope some of our women stay with us long enough to marry and have children, and keep this place going. There's nothing to do about it. Right now, one of them is out there inspecting all the young women, deciding on how many to take this time. It's the natural order around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar stood. \"There's nothing natural about that. I have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started making his way for the door before Bessel's two sons restrained him. \"You're not doing shit,\" he said. \"We've got a good thing going in this village. They leave us alone so long as we give into their demands. They don't bother us, and we don't bother them. You stay out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar hung his head and sat back at the table until they had decided the ordeal was over. He returned to his rooms and slumped into bed, wondering how this village could live under such tyranny.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Glesheri easily lost count of the days, and she wasn't even sure if there was a passage of days in this realm of the demon. There were periods of rest between her gorging sessions, and that was all she knew. But, as she grew and her stomach demanded more and more to be filled, the time between those rest periods was getting longer and longer, so she had no way of knowing how long she had been here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat filled her with a sense of dread. If she could just know how much longer she needed to be here, how long it would be until she could see Nessar again, then she could maybe have had the will to keep going, to keep fighting through this. But, of course, there was no way Glustra was going to let her know that information. Whenever the demon wasn't eating herself into a gluttonous stupor, she was taunting the elf, trying to break her. She wanted to give her reason to doubt her husband, to taunt her into believing he would fail in his task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, my pet,\" she would say. \"Keep eating. He won't be taking you back with him. You'll just stay here, growing nice and round for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, Glesheri had gotten quite round as the time passed. She could see it every day as she looked down at her swelled belly. It's circumference was slowly getting larger by the day, or whatever passage of time there was here. She could see how her arms had gotten puffier, her hips wider, her chest softer. And she could feel how heavy she had gotten. The walks from her quarters to the halls to eat had gotten harder and left her more exhausted and hungrier than ever. Every waddling step was getting more and more difficult. It made her begin to wonder. Even if Nessar did succeed and returned for her, what kind of a state would she be in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eating was getting harder as well. With her belly pressing up against the table more often than not now, and her pudgy arms having gotten heavier, her efforts to shove more food in her mouth were becoming increasingly difficult. Yet, Glesheri wasn't about to go the way of Glustra's other prisoners, who ate like pigs at a trough. She wanted to retain her sense of personhood as long as she could. She wasn't about to give in and become an animal like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, that gave the demon more fuel to taunt her with. She noticed the elf struggling to grab a piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing, let me help you,\" she said in her best feigned concerned voice. She then proceeded to hand feed Glesheri herself, the elf unable to resist, thanks to the spell. The demon laughed. \"My, you are coming along quite nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked her fingers across the dome of Glesheri's nearly full stomach. She was nearing that point in the day when she would be too full to eat another bite and needed rest. Glustra rather admired her work. The little elf wasn't exactly scrawny to begin with, but she had blossomed magnificently into a ball of fat rather quickly, at least faster than she had expected. At this rate, she'd be lucky to still be standing at the end of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri squirmed at the demon's touch. She knew that in her full state, she was really powerless to stop her, but that didn't change how uncomfortable she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it would be a lot easier if you just ate like them,\" Glustra said, nodding over to the animal-like beings, who seemed as though they never left her tables. It was as if they had gotten so large, that eating was all they did, that they didn't need to stop and rest like she did. \"Much easier to get the food in your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, if you think you're above animal instincts, then you are sorely mistaken. Why fight the impulse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlustra shrugged. \"Suit yourself, but you are going to give in eventually. After all, you are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Glesheri had reached her full-point, and Glustra had stopped feeding her. \"Ah, ah, ah, no more. Remember, we don't want you hurting yourself.\" She stroked her belly again, admiring it's taut roundness and the gleaming shine on its surface. \"Besides, I have something to show you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Glustra helped the overfed elf onto a litter, carried by some of the demon's servants. Glesheri could barely walk as it was, and certainly couldn't in a full state. \"I think you're going to like this,\" the demon said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heave, the litter was lifted, and Glustra led the way as Glesheri was carried down the halls, past her own quarters, to the other rooms in the hut, the ones she didn't even know existed. She was a bit nervous, unsure what the demon would do to her. She knew she couldn't be harmed, as that would go against the bargain, but that didn't mean that something bad couldn't happen. At the same time, Glesheri was surprised someone Glustra's size could still walk so nimbly, whereas she was reduced to huffing and puffing, just sitting there in the litter. Then again, she wasn't exactly a mortal being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in front of one of the doors, and Glesheri wondered how she could possibly know which one, as they all looked the same to her. \"Have you ever wondered what happens to some of my guests? After all, they stay here for years on end. Surely, they can't always be expected to join my tables, not after they get heavy enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Glesheri tried to think as little about that sort of thing as possible. She wasn't going to end up here for the rest of her life, she kept telling herself. She swallowed hard, fearing what she might see. \"N-no,\" she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, here's what happens when you give in to your instincts completely. You become dependent on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door to reveal, what must have once been a person, but now it was nothing but a massive pile of flesh and blobby fat, sprawled out on the floor. It nearly took up the entire floor really. The creature just lay there, mouth hanging open as one of the demon's servants continued to feed it an endless amount of food. If the thing had teeth, she could no longer see them. It just swallowed the food almost instantly, and then hung its mouth out for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlustra was right up next to her ear. \"Trust me, I know what you're thinking, and it's not torture. They rather enjoy this actually. All they have to do is lie there and enjoy the bounties of the earth without having to lift a finger. It doesn't care that it can't think beyond the basic need to eat. In fact, I'd say that this is one of the happiest existences a mortal can have. And it can be yours. It will be yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't,\" she said firmly. \"You won't get to keep me here. Nessar will come back for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure about that,\" Glustra said. \"I'd say, he's on a pretty good path to forgetting you as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying,\" Glesheri hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I? And just how would you know otherwise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I know him. I love him, and I know he wouldn't do that to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon got close to her face, letting her elbows rest on the elf's full stomach roughly. Glesheri groaned as the sudden pressure caused her great pain. \"Remember, I'm the one keeping an eye on him, and I can tell you right now, he won't come back for you. He's found somewhere else to live, up north. In fact, he's got a nice little living situation; cozy rooms at an inn, a job, and I'm pretty sure he's going to be having an eye for the innkeeper's cook here pretty soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri fought back tears. \"That's a lie! I'm not going to be fooled by your tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tricks? My dear, why would I trick you? I have nothing to gain from that. Trying to outsmart your dolt of a husband, now that's something I would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to cry now. \"You just want me to give up hope on him, to become one of those...those creatures,\" she said, nodding over to the pile of flesh. \"I won't do it. You don't own me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, anyway,\" Glustra said. \"But, as for giving in to me, you already have.\" She began kneading Glesheri's fat. \"No one is able to resist me and my palace of pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't forgotten why I'm here. There is nothing you can say to make me believe otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon laughed. \"Oh, that's right, you're here for children. My dear, do you honestly think you'll be able to keep a child at your size? Imagine what you'll look like when the year's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave the elf pause. \"What...what do you mean. You said that you would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know what I said, and I do live up to my word. If your husband succeeds, your womb will indeed be opened. You can conceive as many children as you like, but I never promised they would all make it. Just look at how much you've grown. You'll just as likely lose as many in that fat gut of yours as you have many meals. Trust me when I say, you're better off here with me. At least then you could live in ignorant bliss like them.\" She smiled wickedly at the fat creature laying on the floor demanding even more food like a helpless child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat broke Glesheri. She didn't know what to say, nor could she even think about what the demon was implying. In the meantime, her stomach began to growl fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for your next feast.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Never for a minute had Nessar lost track of time. He slowly, but surely counted down the days when he could be reunited with his wife once more. And in the last few months of that time, he was getting more and more hopeful. Even despite what he had learned during this time about the vampires that plagued the north, he still kept his positive outlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had been true to his word with the demon. While a great many of the young women had been taken over the years by the vampires, there were still a good number around who were eagerly looking for husbands. After all, the minute a woman had her first child in the north, she became protected from the vampires' watchful eyes. And indeed, several women in the village had taken an interest in Nessar. He was young, he was a man, what more did they need?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he easily resisted them, constantly assuring them that he was already married. Though, that didn't stop a few determined souls who kept pointing out that his wife was nowhere to be seen. But, again, Nessar rebuffed their efforts, knowing that he would see Glesheri again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only woman in the village that seemed to leave him alone, despite the chance at freedom he represented was the young cook at the inn where he slept: Olga. She seemed to be the only one who could understand his predicament, having lost her sister to the vampires recently. She knew what it was like to be without someone important. Nessar feared her the most. The other women he could resist easily. They tried to hard. But Olga was capable of reaching out to him as a friend, and he avoided her at all costs, lest he be tempted by her kindred spirit. This hurt the young chef, since she felt that he seemed to hate her. Perhaps when this was all over, he might return with his wife and apologize to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Nessar had grown excited. He was now only weeks away from seeing his beloved again. He knew if he could just hold out a few more days, he would be happier than he could ever imagine. Still, knowing it was that close, yet so far away made it harder, and he knew that that would be the real test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few days, he had been preparing to make his journey back into the forests to seek out Glustra's hut once more. He knew it would be several days in that forest, and he wanted to make sure he had enough supplies this time. He sat in the tavern, finishing his last meal before he would set off the next morning. People were going in and out as they always had done. He really didn't pay it all that much mind anymore. He was used to everyone's daily habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it happened, as if out of a dream. The doors creaked open, and standing in the light was Glesheri, just as he had seen her that fateful day. He couldn't hide his surprise, and just sat there with a stunned look on his face. She rushed to him, sweeping him up in a tender embrace. \"What...how...when...\" was all he could stutter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"Oh, you always had such a way with words. Aren't you going to tell me how much you've missed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Of course, but it hasn't been a year yet. How did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was finally able to escape Glustra's hut. She kept a very close eye on me, so it was hard to find a chance to get out. Thankfully, she's more concerned with her 'pets.' I found my chance to run away. Of course, she wasn't too smart, since she accidentally let it slip that you had gone north, so I was able to find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar wanted to take her in his arms in that instant, but something still felt off. \"What about the deal? What about being able to have children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri shook her head. \"Glustra was never going to give us that. I overheard her one day, and her true plan was to find a way to make me her prisoner. Nessar, you were right. It was awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what about us having children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out, we always do. Nessar, I'm just so glad to be back here with you. I just want to spend the whole night holding you in my arms.\"</span></div></div>",

Everything felt to nice, neat, and convenient. He wanted to believe that his wife had really returned to him, but he had to acknowledge that his gut was telling him to beware. But, he had to play this naturally to avoid suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you would. Why don't you go upstairs to my room? It's just on the right there. I need to finish up down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri wandered off upstairs, a wry smile on her face. Nessar watched her go before dashing out of the tavern as fast as his legs could carry him. Unfortunately, he wouldn't be able to take all the supplies as he had planned, but he needed to see the truth for himself. He ran to the nearest stables and hastily paid the man for the first available horse and took off southward. At least this way, he had a good headstart over whoever she was. If she was indeed his beloved wife, he would return and apologize profusely, but he had a good feeling he would find the truth in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse had started to give out as soon as he reached the edge of the woods. Just as well, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis journey into the forest took him several days. He knew there were still a few more before the full year was up anyway. At least this way, he was hidden from whatever force was coming after him. Again, he was forced to live off of whatever he could find, but at least his mind was somewhat at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably good for him anyway, since it helped him lose track of time. He could spend several days here and wait patiently. Every day, he did go off on a little walk, hoping he would find the mystical hut once more. And eventually, one late afternoon, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart leapt and he ran towards the light in the window, for once eager to see it. He sucked in a breath and opened the door. Again, he was met with the same scene he had first walked into: tables lined with food, mindless flabby beasts devouring with abandon, and the enormous and round Glustra sitting at the head of the table, eating with relish and stroking her own swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrows raised in surprise upon seeing him again. \"Hm, so it has been a year, hasn't it? Honestly, I was hoping you wouldn't even show. But, in case you didn't notice, your wife was already returned to you. The sneaky little bitch ran away on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessar shook his head. \"I don't believe you. That wasn't her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Glustra smiled wickedly, a dribble of blood running down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped he was right about this. He was about to take a huge gamble on not just his life, but his wife's. \"It wasn't. I know my wife. She is determined, kind, and puts others before herself. She wouldn't have begrudged the lives of her future children just for her own happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon sat back in her chair, no longer devouring her food. In fact, her expression looked rather sour. She snorted. \"Hmpf, so you have proven yourself after all. A shame, really. I was just starting to like your wife as my newest pet. Still, a deal was a deal, and I suppose you have proven that idiot deity, Yva wrong, so I can't complain there. Very well, I shall return her to you. Ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers and several of her servants came in, bearing a massive litter. It took nearly a dozen of them to lift the massive structure and its occupant. Nessar's eyes widened in surprise as he realized what he was seeing. When the litter was set down, he saw Glesheri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer was there the small, but plump little elf, but now a small mountain of a woman. Her stomach was a massive dome that eclipsed nearly the rest of her body and dominated her figure. It quivered and jiggled with each of her heaving breaths, as though just sitting had worn her out. Her arms and legs hung limp and useless, swaddled under layers of cushy fat. She could hardly lift her arms and instead chose to just let them rest on her bulbous gut. He couldn't see her backside but imagined that it too had a sizeable amount of weight to it, as she had to have gotten wider just to accommodate her enormous size. Her cheeks were swollen and puffy and left her eyes in a slight squint. Still, it was the same Glesheri he knew and loved, and her expression was one of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came back for me!\" she squealed in her slightly huskier voice. \"I knew you would. Oh, Nessar, I've missed you so much.\" Her pudgy fingers and toes were the only parts of her that could move in excitement. It was very clear to him that she could no longer stand to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlustra smiled again. \"As promised, she is free to leave once more. She can now conceive as many children as her heart desires. And I'll even be extra nice. I will send you two to wherever you wish. As you can see, I doubt you two will be able to travel on your own.\" She waited for Nessar's response.</span></div></div>",

I'm so glad you're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to think for a minute, though. Where would they go from here? He couldn't exactly take her back to the Verge. There was a pretty good chance they would not be welcomed back. And the fact of the matter was, Glesheri was enormous. It would be hard to find a home, let alone keep her fed. He imagined she had indeed gained quite an appetite. He couldn't take her back north. True, the vampires supposedly left a woman alone once she had children, but he wasn't taking any chances. It seemed there was really only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glesheri, if you'd like, I think I could make you very happy in the city of Adinah. You'd be well-cared-for beyond your wildest dreams, and we would be welcomed there with no trouble. I know your home was the Verge, but I think we can make a good life for ourselves in the city, but that's only if you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf shifted as much as her body would allow in her seat. She hadn't really thought about where they would go after this whole ordeal was over. In fact, for what had probably been the past few days, which felt like months to her, she was starting to lose her resolve and thought she might never get to leave. However, Nessar's offer was very sincere, and she did believe that things could work out for them. She nodded. \"Yes, I would be happy anywhere,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlustra snorted. \"Not like it'll matter to you anyway. You won't be able to see much beyond your own bed. But, as you wish. You will find yourselves in a home suited just for you in Adinah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the hut seemed to vanish away, and Nessar found himself sitting beside his enormously fat wife as she lay on one of the largest beds he had ever seen. True to her word, they were in a cozy, but sizeable home in Adinah. He recognized the architecture. True, it wasn't his old apartment in the city, but there would have been no way he could have fit Glesheri in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, he watched his wife laying there, her massive belly wobbling with each breath. He went to her and gave her a warm embrace around the neck. \"I can't believe you're really here,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she laughed, \"though certainly bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been trying to avoid the topic. He wasn't sure how she felt about her size. \"Yeah, how did that happen?\" he asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to relay to him her adventure in the demon's hut: how she was cursed to eat nearly endlessly. When she was finished, she looked slightly red in the face out of embarrassment. \"I feel so ashamed,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyebrows raised in surprise. \"Why should you be? It wasn't your fault. Glustra put you under a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I still feel...I don't know, embarrassed by it all. Nessar, I'm more than just a fat and happy wife, I'm huge. I can't even get up anymore, and even though the curse has worn off, it's not going to change the fact that I will probably still eat a lot...and maybe only get bigger. I love you and everything, but I don't want to be a burden to you, too helpless to do anything myself anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed her. \"You'd never be that to me. I love you no matter what. Sure, it isn't going to be easy, but I'm willing to do what it takes to make our lives together as wonderful as possible. And besides...\" he took a handful of her flab and squeezed gently, \"I kind of like this a little, much more of you to love. Now then, I believe there was the matter of children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri practically melted at his touch. She had missed it so much. But, she stopped when he mentioned children. She hadn't forgotten the demon's words. \"Nessar, wait. I'm worried. I know that now I'm supposed to be able to conceive a child, but at my size, am I going to be able to carry it? I'm worried for their safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nuzzled against her forehead. \"I will personally see to it that you are well cared-for through the whole thing. I won't let anything happen to you. Besides, children or no, I haven't seen you in a whole year. We've got some catching up to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlesheri giggled, enjoying the feeling of being with her husband once more.</span></div></div>",

Elvish dancers, captives taken in successful raids, bobbed and swayed among the orcs to tunes plucked on strings to the beat of boarskin drums. In one corner of the tent, two Orcs settled their friendly rivalry in an epic wrestling match while in the other corner the shamans regaled the younger warriors with the tales of glorious conquests and dangerous hunts. In the center of everything sat the cause of the celebration; the butchered and broiled corpse of a vicious manticore, a legendary beast whose fur was stained red with the blood of those too weak or feeble to slay it, and whose defeat was the source of this great victory feast. Its skull would adorn the yurts of clan leaders centuries from now, and its crimson pelt lay across the throne of the warrior who struck the final blow that slayed the vile beast, a warrior whose name inspired fear and awe as it swept through the Dustbowl like a typhoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tha great Bralga Head-Crusha, tha greatest warrior in all o' Yndyre!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great tumult rose up as dozens of orcs raised their cups in a toast to her. Bralga Head-Crusha, seated at the head of this great congress, lifted her own goblet, a trophy taken from a noble fop who strayed too close to her territory, and drank deeply. Running a broad thumb across her favorite battle-axe resting at her side, fine silk from the provinces of Futotta-Machi draped across her shoulders, Bralga looked over the scene with a rather pensive expression. To her clan, the great warrior looked to be quietly reveling in her glory as the mighty do, surveying her realm with a troubled brow. Perhaps she was plotting her next great battle, or perhaps considered a romantic conquest for the evening. This seemed to be a popular theory, as several men and woman stood up to boast of their prowess, hoping to earn her favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth, however, was a lot simpler. She was damned bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something that had brewed for quite some time, and the manticore fight had finally driven that ugly fact home. The elders and shamans spoke volumes of the beast's tenacity and ferocity, calling it the avatar of Ardoid himself, yet one blow from her mighty axe and the creature crumpled like a collapsed yurt. She played along of course and celebrated with her pack but she was utterly furious. Where had the challenge gone? What happened to the days when her battles soaked the ground with her own blood as well as her enemies, when she broke her weapons fighting and resorted to her fists and teeth? What good was the skull of the most vile beast in the Dustbowl when it was no less difficult to tear from its body then crushing an ant underfoot? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the point of being the greatest warrior of Clan Head-Crusha when there was nothing worth fighting? By the Gods, she thought to herself, give me SOMETHING worth my damned time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bralga <i>Burrrup</i> Head-Crusha....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralga turned to glare daggers at the sentry, a bottle of foreign ale clutched in his hand. She couldn't help but roll her eyes; the man was already tipsy. How many bottles had he downed by now, ten? Tch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What d'you want?\" Bralga snarled.</span></div></div>",

She loved to make a good first impression by brandishing this fire-hardened meteor iron weapon in front of her captives. Some of the celebrating orcs took notice of the movement and quieted down to watch as an oily, irritated voice became audible from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and if you scuff these boots I'll have your head, you brutes! I'm due in the capital any day now and if- OUCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent flaps parted as two orcs strode in, gripping the shoulders of a man rubbing a sore spot on his upper arm and throwing him at Bralga's feet. He was dressed exotically but elegantly in a thick black fur, with a heavy rucksack on his back and a conical hat hiding the top of his head. As the man looked up towards her, Bralga's hand instinctively went for the handle of her weapon at the sight of his visage before she realized the man was wearing a white mask, with two inky dots for eyes and a long thin line curved into a smile. His gaze seemed to drift upwards, past her sturdy hips and rippling abdominal muscles and heading upwards as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, pardon me, I didn't mean to intrude, I just was intrigued by the size of your lovely...tents,\" the merchant said, his gaze lingering on Bralga's heaving bosom before he drew fully upright, which for him was still hunched over slightly, tapping his fingertips together. \"See I was just heading west to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man jumped at the sudden demand. \"Er...Ky\u014d.\" Ky\u014d Naginata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what made you think you could just intrude on the lands of Clan Head-Crusha?\" Bralga said, a chorus of boisterous laughter erupting behind her. Ky\u014d Naginata, cowed as the orcish woman towered over him, drummed his fingers together faster and faster as he searched for the words to say. \"What's he got on em?\" Bralga called out over the head of the poor merchant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a buncha silks an stuff...\" the orc called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take 'em,\" Bralga called out lazily in response. \"Then send this mewling weakling packing!\" She lifted her goblet up to her clan and prompted a rousing celebratory cheer at the bullying of this merchant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-now wait just a moment, you can get silks anywhere, why me!?!\" Mr. Naginata protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it one of those payments you give to your own great warriors...whatsit called...taxes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I could trade for them back?\" the merchant said frantically. \"I'm...a collector you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have anything else Clan Head-Crusha wants,\" Bralga laughed as she turned to head back to her throne. \"Go back home  and crawl into your comfortable bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain? You do seem rather...unfulfilled...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralga froze, turning back sharply to the merchant. The men nearby had wandered back into their revelries, so it was much like they two of them were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know of how I 'seem', merchant?\" Bralga spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing,\" Mr. Naginata said, steepling his fingers. \"I just know quite a few warriors like yourself from back in the day. Great warriors, so good in fact that they grew...rather bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not bored!\" Bralga insisted. \"I...I am the greatest warrior in all the Dustbowl, there is nothing I cannot do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, my friends said the same thing to me once, more or less,\" Mr. Naginata mused. \"But then again, I had to wonder...what was the point of being the greatest warrior when there was nothing worth fighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralga glowered at the merchant as he opened his fur cloak, reaching inside to rummage around. For some reason, in this light, she couldn't see any part of him underneath that outer cloak. How odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps in exchange for my cargo...\" Mr. Naginata said, holding something out to her. \"I can give you this? I think it might solve your problems.\" Bralga took the gift in both hands, turning it over once, then twice. It shouldn't have been all that impressive to her and yet, there was something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lurga, Jingor!\" Bralga shouted to the two guards that brought him in. \"Return this man to his caravan, take nothing from him and escort him to the edge of our lands.\" The two burly orcs looked shocked and confused, but one angry look from Bralga sent them packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, blessings upon you, Bralga Head-Crusha!\" Mr. Naginata cried out happily as he backed out of the tent after them. \"You will not regret your choice today, milady! After all, Mr. Naginata always sells quality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep bow as he made his exit, Bralga wondered for a moment how the strange man knew her name. Perhaps she was famed outside of the Dustbowl, she thought proudly. Returning to her throne as the party continued on, she looked over her new prize with interest...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three suns passed over the lands of Head-Crusha since the great feast and the departure of the strange merchant, and things were slowly falling back into routine. As hangovers and bloating wore off, craftsmen returned to their tools and herdsman returned to their fields, while the youngest and nimblest patrolled the outskirts of Head-Crusha territory atop of fast and agile warboars. Two scouts on the Eastern side made idle chat, bragging about their amorous conquests the night of the Manticore Feast when their sharp ears and eyes caught sight of a single figure riding atop a warboar of his own. Turning their boars around, they rode out to meet the visitor, their ragged swords drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You!\" they grunted, cutting off the visitor's path. \"What you doin in Head-Crusha Clan territory?\" The visitor lowered his hood, revealing himself to be an Orc, shorter and stockier then most, with a shock of short black hair and, most notably, milky white eyes with no pupils or iris to speak of. Pulling a face, the Orc sniffed at the air and pondered a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yegoth and Oghash, is it? No!\" he jabbed a thick callused finger towards the lady orc among the two. \"That is Oghash's coat, not Oghash herself. You are...\" The Orc sniffed the air again. \"Bulak. I'd recognize the gait of your warboar anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYegoth and Bulak looked at one another awkwardly before the latter spoke up. \"Y-yes. Many apologies, Zudagog. We just doing our jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you should,\" Zudagog the Vigilant smirked before sniffing at the air again. \"Hrmm, eating well, have we? What has my sister slain since I've been away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulak blushed, placing her hand defensively against the potbelly bulging from her fur tunic. \"It was the Crimson Manticore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's a wily one. Very well, I'll leave you two to work off that blubber then.\" Spurring his Warboar, Zudagog passed the two sentries, his spirits lifted substantially. After all, he wasn't truly home unless he coddled some of the younglings. It had been an admittedly bad habit he picked up because of who he was. Being a blind Orc with a taste for the civilized life was a death sentence in the Ookh Dustbowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had certainly been the intent the night of his father's sky burial, when his friend made his move for the head of clan Skull-Crusha. He could still remember waking up to the murderous look in Kharag's eyes, right before an axe sprung from the darkness and lopped off his friend turned rival's hand before it could plunge into his chest. It was the last thing he ever saw with his own vision, as Kharag drew a second blade across his eyes before being thrown off; how he wished he could have kept them long enough to see his own sister fight off a dozen armed men long enough for him to be whisked away to safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZudagog spent years in pain and agony on the outskirts of Futotta-Machi as the apothecaries tended to his wounds, certain he would have never been able to come home, when a messenger arrived summoning him to the court of Bralga Head-Crusha. He might not have been able to see his own sister in all her splendor, but when he entered his father's yurt, he could feel it in his bones that she was the one to lead the clan as she declared him to be her right hand, second to none but her among all of the Head-Crushas. It had been a glorious night of celebration, culminating with his reunion with his old friend and rival Kharag. He couldn't see it of course, but Zudagog so enjoyed hearing Kharag's screams of agony that night, coupled with that messy aftermath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to the main camp was quiet today, unusually so, since his sister almost always rode out to meet him on his return from the outskirts. Was she perhaps preoccupied? Shrugging it off, Zudagog rode on until he could hear the distinctive sounds of the main camp ahead. Passing by the outer yurts, he dismounted next to a heavily pregnant maiden singing a song to the baby in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zudagog, hello!\" the maiden called out brightly. \"How was the journey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uneventful as always, Mogak,\" Zudagog sniffed. \"At the very least that ponce from the city won't be sending more hires to tangle with us. Where is my sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been in her tent since the celebration...entertaining that nubile elf dancer.\" Zudagog rolled his blank eyes as the maiden giggled. Reaching the flap of the main tent, he strode right in, completely unconcerned with catching his sister in a compromising position. She should have known better anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bralga, what's this I hear about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRASH</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the Gods, was Bralga trying to kill that waif? Breaking into a jog he ran into the center of the yurt where the commotion came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, M-Mr. Zudagog, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZudagog titled his head as the elfish dancer sitting in the corner called his name. Sniffing the air, she seemed to be fully clothed, with some sort of book in her hands. What was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BANG</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yes! You great sparring partner, now try and push me out of ring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind orc sniffed the air again, realizing that the center of the tent seemed to have been cleared out. He caught the whiff of chalk, probably drawn onto the ground. Most notably, he recognized the presence of his sister Bralga, her tunic shedded in favor of only her short trousers and a wrapping around her bosom, shoving up against a rather large and slow fellow by the name of Goor, himself dressed in only his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Ardoid's name are you doing!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zudagog, you're home! One moment!\" Bralga let out a warcry, nearly lifting Goor off his feet before she slammed him down again and flung him out of the center of the tent where he collapsed onto a stool, making it into splinters. Hair disheveled and a big stupid smile on her face, Bralga ran up to her brother and wrapped her muscular arms tightly around him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That milk drinker Sir Frum will not trouble us any longer?\" she said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not...but what is going on? Why does the elf have a book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't read in Elfish, she can?\" Bralga shrugged as the elf girl cowered in terror. \"How else am I going to learn sumo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you're learning what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumo, wrestling style from farther east!\" Bralga spread out her stance and stomped the ground, sending up dust clouds from her muscular action. \"I think I can be good at it, too! You heard of sumos, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...of course I have, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manticores and wyverns are no match for Clan Head-Crusha, brother!\" Bralga ranted on. \"If we wish to stay powerful and strong, we need to learn new things and challenge ourselves, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all a bit much to take in, Zudagog thought as he furrowed his brow. Why now with this obsession? How far would she take this? And more importantly, how would Clan Head-Crusha react to such a change? She did not have an heir yet, and if she was cast out, there was no question that the great Head-Crusha would fall to infighting and be gobbled up by their neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Zudagog suddenly realized, this could be a golden opportunity. This newfound interest in Futotta-Machi culture could be the first step in more peaceful relationships with the more civilized urban cities. They could trade for knowledge and luxury goods instead of stealing them, and perhaps they could even procure some of their famous swords and bows for use in their warbands. Such advances could make Head-Crusha even more powerful...perhaps, powerful enough to unite the Ookh Dustbowl under one banner for the first time in centuries?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you are serious about this...\" Zudagog said gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, very!\" Bralga said proudly. \"Bralga Head-Crusha will be the greatest sumo warlord ever! Now, elf girl, what does book say about sumo's diet?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next time the clan moved to better hunting grounds, a new yurt went up among the expected tents and dwellings in the Head-Crusha camp. Bigger then even the main tent where feasts and celebrations were held, the clan did not need to be convinced to enter and look around when the command was given to gather in the new tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, gather around ring!\" Bralga Head-Crusha shouted as the first Orcs entered the yurt. \"Hurry! This important!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent was surprisingly sparse, perfectly circular with wide open spaces and crude wooden benches around the walls. Subtle magical enchantments hung in the air overhead, keeping the expansive tent alight, especially on the center, where a wide circle of grass enclosed in chalk had been beaten and smoothed into a flat surface. Bralga herself stood proudly in the center, looking fiercer then usual as the sleeves of her silken deel stretched against her thick arm muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clan Head-Crusha!\" Bralga announced, unleashing a celebratory roar from her clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bralga!\" a particularly vocal warrior woman called out. \"Is this new combat arena?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...a sumo ring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused stares abounded as the orcs all gazed in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is new fighting style?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralga nodded. \"This new style of fighting that we shall master to conquer enemies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction wasn't what she had hoped. The overeager orc from earlier looked intrigued, but few others did. Most looked confused, but some looked rather irritated. Was this why they had been made to hunt more, to raid foodstuffs and grains from traders instead of gold and valuables like they always had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already best clan in all of Ookh!\" one heckler cried out. \"Why we need new fighting? Old fighting is best!\" Shouts of agreement echoed off the tent walls. Bralga's confident snarl faltered slightly, but not entirely. She knew her desire to escape from the mundane boredom wasn't shared by the rest of the clan, but Bralga still knew what made her people happy, and knew what they wanted more then anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will be hard to learn new fighting style, yes,\" Bralga admitted. \"But will be helpful when we face....Clan Bone-Rippa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand orcish eyes lit up at the mention of that name, in a way that could only grow from the deepest of animosities. The rivalry between Head-Crusha and Bone-Rippa was such an animosity. Their feud was the stuff of legends, baked into the very mythology of the orcish people in a way that could only be accomplished by the orcs. The last true equals to Bralga's horde, Bone-Rippa was an insurmountable foe, and above all a worthy adversary, and what more could a warrior want then a worthy adversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bone-Rippa...fight us?\" one orc said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bone-Rippas never offer to fight...\" another piped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they know we beat them if they come around!\" Bralga announced as the silent confusion began to melt into a supportive rumble. \"We learn new fighting style, so they think they have chance! But will we give them chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" a dozen orcs roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we need warriors to learn new style!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will learn!\" the headstrong warrior girl from earlier shouted, storming up to join her clan leader! Four other girls her age saw this display and, not willing to be called cowards, shouted their support and joined the small group, each volunteer receiving a tumultuous cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will learn new fighting style!\" Bralga cried out, both fists in the air. \"And we defeat Bone-Rippa good! Because NONE CAN BEAT CLAN HEAD-CRUSHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe din was so loud that you could hear roaring a mile away as every orc leapt to his or her feet, battering their shields and stomping their feet in celebration. Zudagog, sitting near the front of the rambunctious crowd, remained seated, grinning as he knew he received an appreciative glance from his sister. After all, without his help, Turgi Bone-Rippa would have never agreed to the sumo match to settle their long-standing grievances with their rivals. A fine warrior in her own right, Turgi had ascended to the head of her clan much in the same way as his sister had, through violence and treachery. Turgi, however, had watched her own father butchered by his brothers and had since lost the stomach for the inter-clan warfare that characterized the rivalry between the two clans, instead choosing to focus on hunting, raiding caravans, and shoring up what defenses she could. Her reign was in dire straits though, not helped by the fact that she tended to eat more then she hunted and fought, so when Zudagog offered her a chance to participate in this sumo match with Head-Crusha and earn some prestige in a less violent way, she jumped at the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it an orcish way of doing things? Perhaps not, but Zudagog and to a lesser extent Bralga were out to make things different.. And that started with this slim chance of turning a rivalry into a friendship through a mutual love of fighting. You couldn't get much more Orcish then that, could you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzzing with excitement, the orcs of Clan Head-Crusha finally filtered out of the yurt, the last of which being the gruff Zudagog, leaving Bralga and her volunteers behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, have seat in front. Will give quick explanation of rules.\" Bralga said, undoing the sash of her tunic. \"Thaciona will give you first meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meals?\" one of the orc girls asked as Thaciona, the elfish girl who had been translating the manual for Bralga, stumbled forward with large bowls in her arms. \"We need special diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sumo is much like wrestling, only you try to throw out of ring, and you have special body.\" Bralga finished undoing her fasteners and disrobed, leaving the volunteers in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be too embarrassed,\" Bralga chuckled. \"This will be outfit you wear! Special for fighting style!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBralga being dressed only in a loincloth and a chest wrapping was indeed enough to stun to silence, but not as much as seeing the change in her physique. Her arms and legs still bristled with powerful muscles, but instead of the row of abdominal muscles they expected to see, the great clan leader sported a potbelly, gently wobbling as she adjusted her stance. The addition of this lump of fat drew their attention to her body for the first time and how different it seemed to be. Her arms, for instance, seemed to be thicker with more then just muscle, and now that they weren't hidden by the deel her hips were definitely looking a hair wider. Even her strong chin seemed to be widening out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the girls realized what this new fighting style meant for them, reinforced when Thaciona dropped a heavy bowl of rice and meats in front of them. A couple made eyes towards the door, and only the loud and boisterous orc girl from earlier still looked eager to learn, but regret was setting in. They couldn't turn back now though. They made a vow by volunteering to help, and it would bring shame to their families if they backed out from a chance to fight those Bone-Rippas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, we begin with stances!\" Bralga announced, beginning the lecture of the first chapter of the book, one that she had learned by heart at this point, as her trainees began to reluctantly dig into their meals.</span></div></div>",

As a peace offering from a village she no longer remembered to halt skirmishes with an incoming Orc war-band, she could only sulk back to her position as barmaid and occasional belly dancer and work out her \u201cremaining days\u201d as her mistress called them. <br>\r\nShe was working on borrowed time of course; with the war climate she came out of, she was lucky not to be dead.

Catch her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let her get away\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning through a snowy forest in a long Kimono dress was not the plan Licsoku had for her day, but now, thanks to a botched attempt at scoring some free food, the long-haired Futakuchi Onna was running ankle-deep through the drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare feet were surprisingly adept at traversing such environments, and quite cold resistant, but there was a different reason that she could hear her pursuers getting closer by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpying a large rock to her left, the Yokai quickly changed course towards it. She slipped underneath the overhang, spotting suddenly that her footprints were going to give her away. With a quick darting motion, her long black hair rose up around her head like tentacles, lashing at the snow and smoothing its surface. With mere moments to spare Licsoku withdrew her hair just as they were upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of men, covered in rigged armor with demonic face-plates stopped, their long Katanas gleaming in the reflected light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe tracks end here\u201d one pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe demon must have taken to the treetops\u201d a second pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStraight ahead then, let us bring her back to the Shogun!\u201d the third one stated, egging them on as they continued forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicsoku sighed as their crunching footfalls fell silent as they ran into the distance. This was her third failure this month. The easiest and most familiar way for a Futakuchi Onna to find food was to trick people; this was why the entire race looked like beautiful long-haired women. Their strategy would be to find a stately home on a cold evening and wander up to their door, shivering as they pretended to be lost and needing shelter for the night. Once the owner of the home lets them in they would act naturally, keeping the act up until everyone else falls asleep. This is where phase two came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Futakuchi would feign sleep, getting up in the middle of the night to locate the houses food stores and larders. Sitting themselves with their back to the food, the Futakuchi\u2019s hair then gets to work. The long tendrils grab everything they can reach, and bring them towards the back of her head. This opens up to reveal a second mouth, brimming with sharp teeth strong enough to bite through solid steel. The tendrils stuff the mouth with as much speed and gluttony as they can, as the Futakuchi\u2019s belly swells and swells, thanks to their natural stretchiness, until she looks full term with child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had had more food than a human would eat in a month, the Futakuchi gingerly rises to her feet, her hair going lank once more as she cradles her full stomach tenderly, and leaves via the nearest exit. To an onlooker she appears as simply a mother-to-be going about her day-to-day business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Futakuchi only ate like this rarely, allowing them to go back to slim and frail-looking. But Licsoku had had a good string of luck for quite a while (several short-sighted house-owners had contributed to this), meaning she had not slimmed back down to her usual self. Now Licsoku sported a thick round belly that sat on her thighs at all times, thick tree-trunk-like thighs, plump arms and a round face. This made her a dead give-away whenever she tried to score a free meal; resorting to her being chased across the snowy landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if Licsoku had not eaten so much once she realised she was on a streak of success\u2019s; but her greedy nature got the better of her, meaning within a month she had eaten enough food to last a single human a year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though she was starving\u2026fat and starving, what a wonderful ironic combination\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to herself, Licsoku grabbed the pale pudge that resided beneath her long dress and huffed, her breath turned into visible particles in front of her as she contemplated her next move. Repeatedly picking up and dropping the weighty sack of fat, she considered her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try moving to another area? The landscape would be unfamiliar, but people there might not have heard of creatures that look like women, but steal your food in the night. Or she could try one of the local monasteries, they were quite happy to hand food out\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be much but it would be something. Or she could keep trying other homesteads, perhaps if she was careful she could be more tactful with her appetite and stick around for a while?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions decisions\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Chapter provided by Trampltrum</i></span></div></div>",

These were the hours of twilight and for one resident of the land of Futotta-Machi this was the last few hours of light she got for training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko spent most of her days training; training her mind in meditation, training her reflexes in martial arts, training her body through rigorous exercises but most of all she was trying to use her last hours of light to get as much food into her body as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young woman sat at the table stuffing her face with as much rice as she could scoop down her throat as possible you would wonder why something would go to such lengths to ruin what would be otherwise seen as a perfect body. Fumiko was strong, shockingly so in fact, and with only the barest hint of fast on a slight pot-belly that could barely jiggle\u2026but for her dreams that was only the beginning, she needed bigger\u2026much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still eating?\u201d Came a cackle from the stairs top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Mmm hmmm*\u201d Fumiko mumbled as her chopsticks slid another mouthful of rice between her petite lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Why you still trying to be sumo? You are way too small huehuehuehue!\u201d Came the retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-haired girl slammed her empty bowl to the wooden table, \u201cThat\u2019s why I am eating you shrivelled raisin!\u201d She snapped. Fumiko had wanted to move into her own place and start her career so much, so much in fact that she had rented a room in a house belonging to this old geezer. In the beginning she thought Mr Nakumura was going to grope her or something equally creepy; but no, instead the old man seemed to get his jollies exchanging banter with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! You want to look like a sumo? Go out and eat at the bars with the real sumo\u2019s!\u201d The bearded man taunted, pointing his cane at the door. Fumiko however quickly rose to his baiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026I will! Don\u2019t lock up; I\u2019ll be back with a belly so full I will barely get it through the door!\u201d The hot-headed girl stated, grabbing her winter Kimono and slinging it over her shoulders before marching out into the winter weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko\u2019s village was a small home, located half-way up a semi-frozen mountainside where the elements loved to test the limits of all the people living there. The sumo-in-training had hoped this would give her some grit and stamina, but a lot of the time it just gave her a runny nose when she left the hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Achoo!* Stupid snow\u2026\u201d She mumbled, her feet dragging through the frozen fluff as the young woman made her way towards the tavern. Fumiko was no fan of this weather, not after her first winter anyway. It blew her scruffy hair into her eyes and went straight through her muscles to freeze her to her soul; it gave her all the more incentive to get fat as quickly as possible. Hopefully by next winter she would have acquired enough blubber to brace this foul weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the drapes covering the door to one side, Fumiko brought herself into the warm of the local tavern. After dusk it was quite a popular place; there were plenty of people drinking at the front of the bar, downing shots of rice-wine. Meanwhile a group of Samurai guards were playing some sort of betting game in the far corner, sitting on the cushions on the floor. Over in the other corner was a wandering Ronin smoking a pipe, keeping herself to herself. And also, like her cheap-shot-throwing landlord had said, there were sumos\u2019 present as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two men and a woman, the latter of which Fumiko looked on in envy towards. She was the biggest of the three, her huge bulk overwhelming the cushion she had parked her immensity on while her bare belly spilled over her lap and almost hid her legs. She was as round as one of the lanterns hanging from the ceiling and must have weighed as much as an Ox. Oh how Fumiko wished she were that big; she imagined herself with the woman\u2019s pillar-sized legs, bloated feet and big boulder of a gut, causing mini earthquakes when she stepped into the arena\u2026oh that would be the life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking herself back to the real world though, Fumiko strode towards the bar. She was eager to get herself to that level as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a portion of rice!\u201d Fumiko snapped at the barkeep as she slammed her coins on the countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026some people prefer to use manners when they ask for something\u2026\u201d The bartender replied lowly before calling back to the kitchen behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko gave him a small scowl as he returned with a bowl. It was small, barely the size of the one she had just finished at home. \u201cHey! You call this a portion!\u201d She snapped, pointing at the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terse barkeep turned back to her, \u201cFor a shrimp like you\u2026yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, look here\u2019s some more coins; give me the same size as them!\u201d On that demand Fumiko pointed towards the sumos in the far corner. As the man tried to retake the rice Fumiko grabbed the bowl and dumped the majority of it down her gullet; \u201cAnd I am keeping this first serving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular woman broke into a smug grin when she saw the look of surprise on the man\u2019s face as he called back to make a bigger order; that showed him she was ready for the big time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fumiko waited for her <i>real</i> meal, she spotted something\u2026</span></div></div>",

Plenty of people were having a drink, perhaps she should order one as well. Although the taste of the local rice wine was too strong for her. Mr. Nakumura drank plenty of it, he had offered her a bottle one time after she managed to trust that he was not a perverted old man looking to knock her out easy. It was horrid stuff, actually, and made up most of his diet although he remained a shriveled raisin. Fumiko had taken too much to drink, her first time, as she was out cold the rest of the night. She had missed out on all that time when she could have been training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was never going to waste those remaining hours of the day for her training ever again! She pounded at the table she sat by, anticipating the tavern's rice, earning an annoyed look from other patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople came an went. There was a ruckus from the gambling samurai, the sumos traded jokes, the ronin looked to have fallen asleep with her pipe snuffed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when the shouting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads turned towards a pair of men who had just entered. They had fierce tones and faces reddened by the wind sweeping down over the mountains. They were in the midst of a heated argument, the subject quite disruptive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had more relations than you've ever known! Why, I once charmed the magistrate over a long weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Politics, bah,\" spat his companion. \"Try wooing one of the kitsune acolytes that have yet to dedicate themselves to their meditation. They're quite strong lovers and much more fleeting than women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko turned from the display with disgust. Pigs! Such lecherous men! It went to show that even in a place as pleasant to live in as Futotta-Machi, there could be the vilest of people. Fumiko willed herself to ignore them, eagerly eying the mountain of rice that came in a sumo sized serving. It towered over the bowl. She possibly may have bitten off more than she could chew but Fumiko had 'promised' to her landlord that she would come home with a bulging belly, a sign of her commitment to her training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug into her rice, deftly working her chopsticks, getting the first morsels down her gullet. She was given a cup of traditional wine with her bowl, she wanted to eat more before trying it again. Have something in her stomach to absorb the taste and alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the arguing chauvinists had sat themselves close to Fumiko's seat, and their talk of conquests was very rude and distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To say nothing of the wittily creatures further along the mountains. A once made a Futakuchi Onna swoon like a young maiden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing, show them the larder and a Futakuchi Onna will be your best friend! I out seduced a Jorogumo and lived to tell the tale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the gods were they rude. Fumiko fumed their direction, of their crude conversation going unchecked. Surely the rest of the patrons of the tavern could hear them? By now somebody should get them to shut up and turn them back out into the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was looking across the tavern's seating she accidentally locked eyes with one of them. That turned out to given the men an unintentionally invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, girl, you wouldn't want to date a poor excuse for a man like my associate when I have so much to offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pah, don't listen to him miss,\" the other had a hint of the strong stuff in his system, the bravado laid on extra thick. \"If it's a good time you're looking for, I can show you things this charlatan would never be able to perform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh! The pair of them were making Fumiko sick to her stomach, the very opposite of how she wanted to feel with a belly crammed with rice. The pair were not picking up on her distaste as the drew closer, all the more brash and argumentative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a strong woman you are, a weakling like him wouldn't have the stamina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore him, he proclaims too much when results are better than words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, nobody in the tavern was curbing this rude, unwarranted pair? By now Fumiko was sure that everyone could hear them, she was just waiting on somebody to kick them out. She wanted to finish her rice in peace!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Go away!\" Fumiko told the rude men, turning back to her meal. That tell-off did not linger in their thick skulls, as the two continued to try and one up each other with the wannabe sumo caught in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like a girl with your spirit! This fool of a man would never be able to handle you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baka, he is all talk with nothing to back it up. The only girl to love him was his mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth full of rice, Fumiko gave dark looks at both of them under her scruffy hair. Couldn't a girl gain weight for sumo in peace. Surely the antics of this pair would have gotten them thrown out for sure. She looked out across the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, the barman was counting a stack of coins. Along with the samurai, who were gambling with much higher stakes than Fumiko remembered them playing with. The jingle of a coin purse brought her eyes to the belt of one of the disruptive men, as he tightened the drawstring of a much smaller purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implication disgusted Fumiko even more. Had they paid off the tavern staff and the authorities? Made them look away with such a monetary bribe? And she was equally disgusted by how much their attention was turned her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"~Hey~*hic*\" there was a low, feminine voice that was sounding quite toshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fumiko and the men turned. A form lumbered to her feet, Fumiko had mistaken the woman for a set of particular dirty cushions set off to the side. The stranger had long black hair spilling out from her flat conical straw hat. She leaned unsteadily on a staff, dressed in a once blue samue over a grey tunic and loose sandals. Several more sticks, with a few drinking gourds, were tied to her back with a fraying rope. She was very plump around the middle, bigger than Fumiko but nowhere near sumo size, with a gut that looked like she enjoyed her drink. Indeed, she reeked of rice wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"~*hic* the lady said to go away,\" she stumbled over, that strong smell of alcohol overbearing. The pair of main looked as disgusted by her as Fumiko was of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back to your drinking, wrench, this doesn't concern you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, *hic* come on,\" she leaned in closer, precariously so. \"Yur looking for a good time in all the wrong places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was offering her company the men sure didn't go for it. \"Leave us be, my associate and I are not men to cross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore her,\" the other said with realization. \"That's Otsuka. You know, the woman that was blacklisted from the monastery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed. \"A good thing they did. Look at her, such a degenerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Otsuka woman didn't appear to hear what they were saying about her. She stubbled closer, peering at the men through a gape in her hair, only one grey eye visible. Fumiko couldn't take this any longer, she was about to give the men a piece of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from us you drunken wretch!\" He moved to shove her forcefully. The drunken woman tipped out of the way, her staff catching him as he tripped and fell hard on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry!\" Otsuka hiccuped in a mockingly innocent tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you disgraceful savage!\" The other man swung wildly. Otsuka staggered back, nearly falling over, her other leg seining up for balance and catching the guy in the chin as she struggled to regain her balance. He spun about in a cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" Fumiko warned, as both men recovered and charged at the drunken woman from both sides. She was to inebriated to move, how could she fight back with those hits had just been flukes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Fumiko was recognizing that there might be a method to the madness. Otsuka bobbed out of the way again, each man punching the other in the face at where she had just been a moment before. She held her staff horizontally and lurched forward, pushing them off balance with her shifting weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch it!\" Fumiko barely saved her bowl of rice in time as the men tripped over the table, one set crashing into an uncleaned pacesetting. The other was more nimble on his feet, crying out as he took a fighting stance. He advanced, jabbing wildly at the drunken woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Fumiko blinked she would have missed it. Otsuka tipped and swayed out of the way from each blow. He caught a jut of her staff to the groin for his troubles, sending him sprawling over his companion that had just gotten to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtsuka made her own advancement as she lurched and tripped, her heft squashing both men as she twisted in midair. They howled in pain. She lurched up again, holding tight to her staff, was one of them scrambled up off the pile leaving his friend below. A spinning kick sent him careening out of the tavern, Otsuka pinning the remaining man to the floor with her full weight yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko blinked, stunned. The entire fight had taken less than a minute. She looked to the round face of the drunken woman, flushed from the exertion. Or maybe it was the heavy drinking. Or now that Fumiko could see her face in full, the right side of Ostuka's face was scarred from a burn, the side that had been covered from her hair earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"~Whew,\" Ostuka sighed, now sitting across from Fumiko in the wake of the tables destroyed during the fight. \"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" was all Fumiko could reply back at the moment, slightly in awe of the fighting prowess she had seen. The woman had just fought them while drunk, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the unlikeliest of fighters the man yelled, although it was a bit muffled, as he tried to crawl his way out from under her. Ostuka struggled to remain on him, falling to the side. Although Fumiko had picked up on her movements enough to notice that her elbow clonked him across the temple, knocking him unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...Ostuka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tatsuki Otsuka *hic*,\" the disgraced former monk replied with a drunken grin. She picked up one of her drinking gourds but was saddened to find that it was empty.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much as the fight had excited her, for Fumiko what was most important was that she could finish her meal in peace. She eagerly turned back to her rice but a crestfallen expression passed the wannabe sumo's face. \"What happened to my chopsticks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki was still searching for imaginary drops from her dry gourd. \"*hic*?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww,\" Fumiko finally spotted the wayward chopsticks, at the bottom of a mess from an overturned, broken table from when the drunken monk fought off the disruptive duo. Fumiko sighed. \"Well, I'm not letting this go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began shoveling rice into her mouth with her free hand, chewing at a breakneck pace so as to make up for lost time. Her other hand cupped the bowl protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yur sure eat a lot,\" Tatsuki said with slurred speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed at being interrupted again, Fumiko just scowled. Although the threat was lost from her full cheeks. \"Ygn donf bu chulkt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki paused before searching about her possessions. \"Sorry, *hic* no chalk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mueau,\" Fumiko swallowed, \"--No, you're one to talk!\" Fumiko was a tinge jealous that Tatsuki Otsuka had more girth on her, as they looked to have similar heights and builds. \"I've got to gain weight for sumo! I won't get anywhere if I stay at this featherweight weight class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" the disheveled monk nodded knowingly, having procured a bottle. \"Sumo s'takes a lot of training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knowgh,\" Fumiko replied curtly as she ate through her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots'a discipline,\" Tatsuki made a sour face. It had not been booze but soy sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm plenty *gulp* disciplined!\" Fumiko retorted, with a handful of rice to her lips as she talked with her mouth full. This woman didn't know just how much of the day Fumiko dedicated to training her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one!\" a furious voice came from the entrance to the sake house. The disruptive man who had been kicked out of the shop was back with local guard, their swords drawn. \"She's the miscreant right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki was pouring the rest of the soy sauce in an emptied drinking gourd. \"Who, *hic* me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf forgotten, the other man started to stir from underneath Otsuka's rump and began crying out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guard came over. \"On your feet, both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Fumiko protested, spitting out some of her precious rice. \"I didn't do anything but have my dinner interrupted! She's the one that was fighting them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA set of guards had descended on Tatsuki Otsuka, trying to heave her up and remove an actual bottle of sake she had managed to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" the owner of the restaurant spoke up from his counter, the rest of the place having oddly become vacant of the other customers in the wake of Ostuka's fight with the two men. \"They were both causing disorder, interrupting my other customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko swallowed the wrong way, having a coughing fit from rice almost entering her lungs. \"I didn't--\" she gestured towards the two men, the one that had gone for the guard and the other recovering from being the drunken monk's pillow, \"they paid off everybody else when they were the ones causing a ruckus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that what they all say,\" the cynical guard replied. \"You're both under arrest for a breach of the peace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrested?

The guard restraining Fumiko rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hit her aside the head and carry her, you fool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's twice my size!\" the other guard complained, sparking another pang of jealousy inside the wannabee sumo as Otsuka pitched forward, the guard approaching from behind. \"I'm not going to lift her fat ass on my shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Fumiko saw the subtle hints before it happened, catching the drunken woman shifting her stance ever so slightly, her head tilting at just the right angle. Fighting drunken loudmouths was one thing, but she wasn't seriously going to try and fight off the city guards, was she? She couldn't...she wouldn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard reached for the drunken monk's arms, letting out a little gasp of surprise when she ducked out of the way and grabbed his wrist over her shoulder, giving a great tug and lifting the guard onto her shoulders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard shomeone ssay...liftin' people s'hard...?\" Otsuka murmured, tossing the guard off her shoulders where he crashed into a heap behind her. \"See...very *hic* easy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard in front of Fumiko reached for his sword, but Fumiko had had enough. This corrupt fool had accused her of a crime she didn't commit, helped to cover for an abusive drunkard that tried to harass her, and was about to kill the woman who at least up until this point had saved her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd perhaps most egregiously of all, <i><b>he had utterly ruined her dinner!!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard reeled backwards, blood covering his face as it poured from a nose shattered by Fumiko's forehead strike. Teeth bared, the man drew his blade with a flourish and swung wildly in her direction. Fumiko dodged the blows, a few coming close enough that she could feel the temperature of the cold steel on her skin, and ducked behind the bar in time to avoid a stab that embedded itself in the sturdy wood. Hearing the sounds of furniture being smashed where Otsuka was fighting, she glanced towards the corner to see the admittedly amusing sight of seats flying through the air and the distinctive sound of metal on wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sword being pulled free behind her, Fumiko tried to chew off the ropes binding her hands together, but it was too tight. Salvation came however when a sword flew across the room from where Otsuka was fighting, landing in between Fumiko's legs and embedding into the floor. Thinking quickly, she cut the ropes with the edge of the sword and rolled to the side as her own opponent vaulted the bar and made a rough stab in her area. With the blood coating his lips and staining his snarled teeth, he looked particularly savage as he rounded on her, but she was undeterred. If there was anything she knew from the art of sumo, it was that when you lose control, you lose the fight, in or out of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to rearrange your nose again?\" Fumiko taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll kill you AND your drunken lout of a friend!\" the guard hissed, waving his blade threateningly. \"You stupid, <i>skinny</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guard felt the wind and the life knocked out of him as the wannabe sumo charged, slamming into his chest and knocking his weapon clear. Fumiko may not have had the bulk of a sumo yet, but she had the strength and style of one, and on a regular old brute like this one, it worked just fine. Knocking aside tables and glassware as she traveled, the sumo performed a textbook maneuver to launch an opponent out of the ring, and the guard smashed clean through the wall of the restaurant, moaning briefly before he fell unconscious. Flexing her arms triumphantly, she found that the original troublemaker and his friend were long gone, as was the owner. Scared away, or heading to find more help? Probably best not to stick around and find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko nearly started another fight when someone clapped a hand on her shoulder, only to realize it was Otsuka, looking no worse or sober then before. Behind her, a very out-of-sorts Guard was crouched over on the ground, his head firmly planted into the wooden floorboards like an ostrich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...we should find 'nother hidey hole,\" Otsuka hiccuped. \"I know a placesh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead on then,\" Fumiko insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them ducked out the side door, just as a commotion sounded out front. Her head starting to cool from the adrenaline rush, Fumiko thought about the situation at hand as she trailed the drunken woman through the snow with surprising speed and agility. Becoming an outlaw was not going to help her on the path to becoming a proper sumo; her best chance was to lay low for a while until this blew over, hoping that the guards would lose interest with a relatively minor crime. This would cut into her training dramatically, but what else could she do? Her mood was already souring quickly when Otsuka staggered to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're...<i>hic</i>....here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko blinked, realizing the woman had brought her to...</span></div></div>",

The building, all half burnt wood and tattered banners, listed to one side, having to supported by various mounds of rubbish next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually live here?\" Fumiko asked, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'not really,\" Tatsuki Ostuka slurred, ducking into the door, \"but itss a good place to 'void notice,\" she punctuated with another hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Fumiko didn't have many options but to trust the disgraced monk at this point. The incident at the sake house was going to draw a lot of undue attention. Fumiko made her way inside, careful to not brush against any load bearing supports, or the whole hovel might collapse on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior was dank and dim, with a bit of a smell, but thankfully it was dry and not too cold. Ostuka was trying to light some kindling over a small fire, although clearly she had too much to drink as she failed to keep the sticks in the correct positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko sighed, finding herself a spot to sit on a mound of rags. \"Here, let me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainee sumo channeled her frustrations into hot friction along the sticks, starting a small fire that made the accommodations more bearable. The hovel could have been a lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunken monk must have frequented this place, as she loosened a different drinking gourd stashed away in a wall nook. \"So, wash your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fumiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOstuka took in this information with a long draught of her gourd. \"And what makes you want to be a sumo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko stopped adding more sticks to the fire. \"How did you know I want to be one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'popular place for sumos, there,\" Ostuka gestured, \"and your fighting style is sumo based, not the most dish'iplined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm plenty disciplined,\" Fumiko fumed. \"I'm training very hard at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And hot tempered,\" replied the drunken woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well--\" Fumiko tried to think of a rebuttal but was caught off guard by Ostuka's mirthful glance. While she had gotten Fumiko landed into this mess, she had also helped her out of it, and that wasn't even the direct root of the problem. \"--why wouldn't you be angry, with those deplorable men paying off the sake house for their lecherous causes! Nobody else stood up to 'em. And those sumos at the higher weight class can brush it off because they think they're so high and mighty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think you're better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b>will</b> be better,\" Fumiko declared. \"I'm going to be the strongest, the toughest and the biggest sumo in these mountains.\" The declaration fell flat in the ruined interior of their current hideout, and her rumbling stomach reminded Fumiko that she was setback on her original goal; upping her caloric intake so she could gain weight for sumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twang of jealousy at Ostuka's plump, bulging form filled her voice again as Fumiko asked \"Don't you have anything to eat around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOstuka looked pensive. \"Posh-ibbli, if the mites haven't gotten to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't fill Fumiko with confidence as she watched the disheveled monk dig around pots and baskets. \"Plenty of red beans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me,\" Fumiko said, sad it wasn't a steaming bowl of rice but she needed something to stay on her regime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOstuka passed her a bowl. \"I got picked fish in here,\" she opened the wooden lid of a vessel, releasing a sour stench. \"Herring, eel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko gritted her teeth and willed her nostrils closed. \"Some of that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the preserved fish congeal on the bowl of red beans, Fumiko contemplated the calories she could get. The fish was at least a protein source, and the red beans were pretty much paste and baking away from being like a red bean bun for desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might have some stuff hidden away for a hotpot,\" Ostuka continued, now that she had found a pot to sit on the flames. Silence descended in the hovel for several minutes as Fumiko chewed and chewed as Ostuka readied a steam pot of miscellany. It was getting a bit steamy in the shack, sweat formed on Fumiko's brow. Her host also looked red faced, or that was probably just the drink, as she brushed her long black hair aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close, Fumiko got a full look at the burn over half of the monk's rounded face. The burn scars spread across her cheek up towards her ear, with the organ and eye being unscarred. The scar itself was a lurid color as Ostuka looked to have had a dark, wine colored birthmark on that side of her face before the burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity getting the better of her, Fumiko asked after she had swallowed her last mouthful, \"So how did you get burned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOstuka took a long swing to empty the last of her gourd, also getting herself a bowl of beans. \"Do you really want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOstuka paused to eat her own food. \"The magistrate threw hot coals from a lantern on my face as punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...what?\" Fumiko might have choked on her food. The magistrate of Futotta-Machi was said to be a beautiful, yet steely woman who operated on top of the feudal hierarchy that operated in these Eastern mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'not really much of a story,\" Ostuka said, deflecting the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko tried to piece together what she had learned about her drunken host in this short timeframe. \"But those perverts said you were kicked out of a monastery, but you don't have any fox tails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox tails?\" Ostuka replied. \"Oh, the Kitsune. No, their monastery is one for meditation and ritual to contact the higher powers. I belonged to the monastery of warrior scholars, ones often in service to the magistrate's court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumiko was about to ask more but another bowl of red beans and eel was pushed into her face. \"Eat up, once your done I'll take this off the boil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiet beat out curiosity as Fumiko focused back on her food. The conversation died down to the crunch of red beans and slurps of eel. Fumiko had only seen the former monk drink her meals up to this point, but Ostuka could put away the food as well. Soon the hotpot was finished, a miasma of spent ends, bits of food scraps and some lone veggies about to spoil. Nothing spectacular but not that horrible. Provided there was food to be had, Fumiko would train to better her appetite and weight class.</span></div></div>",

Some of the best warlord are known to have the conjuring powers of a vessel-djinn in their possession as well.

Just what lies beyond the southern seas? Well, that is for our pirates and sea farers to find out, but it is rumored that sirens might lie nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Motee Marshes:</b> Connected to the border of the eastern region, the jungles of the Motee Marshes are steeped in mystery. It is quite easy for one to become lost in this vast jungle. However, it is not devoid of civilization. The naga clans build massive temples and stone structures in the heart of this land, forever devoted to the gods.

Sure the market stalls of the Samin Desert were famous, but they were located far from many potential buyers. So the streets of Adinah were the best alternative. And it is here where one warlord from the Samin Desert itself can be found searching for his first purchase on rising to power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me again why I have to do this\u2026\u201d Warlord Sal-Dalin muttered to his advisor as they wound their way through the narrow passages between the city stalls, his eyes keenly observing for any potential pick-pockets eyeing him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord, you MUST have a harem, it is customary from any person within a position of power to surround themselves with beauty; it shows status, it shows wealth (the bigger they are the better), connections and builds positive relations with other regions\u201d the adviser reminded him in a slightly scolding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but let us be done with this affair as soon as possible, I find these markets detestable\u201d Sal-Dalin noted as he stared daggers at some salesman trying to oversell a piece of pottery for far more than it\u2019s worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo made their way through many stalls, some dealing in potential members for a harem, but each time Sal-Dalin was not satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut my lord, she is beautiful and extremely well fed\u201d the warlords advisor exclaimed, trying to convince the man that a very overweight Harpie was being sold for a good price. Sal-Dalin simply shook his head, from what he knew of harpies they were constantly as hungry as a starved pig. It would be much cheaper to find a thin Harpie and let nature take its course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, come along Tar-quil, I see nothing here\u201d Sal-Dalin stated flatly, eager to get away from the creepy salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord, please stay, I\u2026I might have something in your taste right here!\u201d the man in the shop stuttered before hurrying himself and the fat feathered woman away, returning with a pitch-black and much thinner slave. \u201cA Rakshasa from the Motee Marshes, very rare coloring\u201d the man gestured as the potential buyers surveyed the new entrant. She was clearly a Rakshasa, quite well-built and with black skin and short black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she\u2026safe? I hear the Rakshasa\u2019s eat\u2026meat\u2026plentifully\u201d Sal-Dalin half-asked already knowing which way he leaned with this potential purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can assure you she is quite tame, I had her claws trimmed this morni-YEOWCH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal-Dalin and Tar-Quil jumped as they watched the cat-like woman lunge at her \u201chandler\u201d digging her long canines savagely onto his hand. Thankfully her arms were tied, or things would have become much bloodier. The stunned pair watched as she was quickly ferried to the back as well, with the shop-keeper returning a few minutes later, hand-bandaged and a rope being held in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne last one\u2026.I can assure you this one does NOT bite\u201d the salesman almost scowled as he tugged on the thin chain. And out from the back emerged a thin, red-skinned woman with a pair of long horns and fur-covered cloven hooves on her feet. \u201cI can offer a low price on this one, most turn their noses up at keeping a\u2026demon in their harems\u2026\u201d he stated, teasing the woman\u2019s species out with a grin. While she was rather short and petite, her horns jutting out the sides of her head and her blood-colored skin easily singled her out as a demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA demon!? How by the gods did you come by one?\u201d Sal-Dalin asked in shock. Demons were immensely powerful and servants to nobody but their basal urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not drag your stay in our beloved city out with a tale of how I can across such a rare and beautiful creature, but if you are interested I can have her ready to go immediately\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal-Dalin stared at the woman, her beauty was entrancing, even though he could not see her face fully due to her bowed head, and a demon would certainly shut Tal-Quil up about needing a whole harem if he had a DEMON in the palace. \u201cWe will take her\u201d the warlord stated firmly as he advisers eyes bugged, she might be trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride back was uneventful, almost eerily so in fact. The demon simply sat on the horse that had been provided, hands clenched into fists, her body physically trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time on the road, they made it back to Sal-Dalin\u2019s palace. It was modest by palace standards, barely taller than the surrounding buildings and possessing little in the way of distinct architecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn arrival, the Warlords new consort was shown her quarters and given some robes to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is your dress, veil and top, I hope they are to your liking; we have also provided you with the best room in the palace, there is a built-in spring if you wish to freshen up\u201d Sal-Dalim stated, offering the clothes. While they were rather revealing, they were certainly not as ridiculous as the almost string-like garments the demon was currently dressed in. He hoped that the idea of wearing something more appropriate might cheer her up, but she still refused to meet his gaze. Sal-Dalim wondered if her refusal to look at him was a pride thing, demons were normally care-free, so being caught must really have shaken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later the warlord and his advisor were in the throne room, discussing general affairs, but mostly the recent acquisition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am telling you it is bad luck to keep a demon in the palace, let alone what mischief she may cause, she probably spent the whole trip back plotting some horrible revenge\u201d Tal-Quil ranted and raved, pacing back and forth in front of the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm yourself man, she is as timid as a baby unicorn, I am sure we won\u2019t be having an trouble from her\u201d the warlord sighed, rubbing his forehead with his thumb and fore-finger. As he did, a *clip-clop* noise signalled the aforementioned demon\u2019s arrival. \u201cAh! Here she comes now!\u201d Sal-Dalin announced as the entrance curtain to the room parted revealing a figure with light-brown skin and a pale expanse over her stomach. It LOOKED like the warlords demon he bought for his harem\u2026but her skin color had changed! How did this happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I hoped this wouldn\u2019t h-happen\u201d the woman stuttered, now dressed in a short light-blue dress and matching top &amp; veil bearing the warlords banner symbol on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what!?\u201d the advisor exclaimed, almost jumping out of his black robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026.former master misled you\u2026I am not a demon\u2026at all, he p-poured red dye over me to try and get a better price\u2026I am actually a minotaur\u201d she continued, muttering towards her hooves as she poked the ground with the tip of one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew that trawling the markets was a bad idea\u201d Sal-Dalin grumbled as he glared at his advisor. \u201cTell me; what is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrargi, master\u201d the minotaur replied, now holding her tail in both hands. Rising from his throne, Sal-Dalin took a closer look at her. It seemed the shifty salesman had shaved some of Grargi\u2019s fur in places, to make her look more demonic, like her legs and the tip of her tail. Her loincloth had also hidden her udder, which thanks to the short skirt Sal could now just about make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you rather\u2026small for a minotaur?\u201d Sal asked, causing the half-cow to flinch a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, I am, I was the smallest of my family\u201d Grargi pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I will send for someone to scrub your bath, I am sure it is stained redder than a battlefield right now, for now make yourself comfortable in the dining hall, I will have someone prepare you a meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Grargi gave a short bow and hurried off, her hooves clip-clopping off into the distance. She never had much of an appetite, but after this ordeal, she could really go for a big hot meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Chapter provided by Trampltrum</i></span></div></div>",

Even I was fooled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warlord shook his head. \"No, no, I'm keeping a clear head. And I intend to do nothing short of what is expected of a man in my position. I will organize a small party to go back to Adinah and retrieve our little merchant friend, quietly, of course, and without making a scene. Besides, that'll keep his head fresher for when I mount it outside my walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the young warlord, that was actually tame by comparison to some of the bolder actions he had taken upon becoming chief of his clan. Tal-Quil breathed a small sigh of relief for that. \"There is still the matter of the minotaur, sir. What are we to do with her? I mean, it wouldn't be practical, and she's certainly not suitable, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not as suitable as a demon or a rakshasa, both of which would have been great dangers?\" Sal-Dalin mocked. \"To be honest, this is even better than we could've hoped. At least with her, she could bear me sons, strong ones at that. I've seen what male minotaurs can look like. As a demon, she was more for show. Minotaurs are just as unseen in these parts. She's exotic enough. The only thing unsuitable about any of this was the price we paid for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTal-Quil was at a loss for words. When the warlord made up his mind, there was very little anyone could do to change it. \"So, you'll keep her?\" was all he could ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"I see no reason not to. She's a wife, she's something different to show off, she can give me sons, and she's submissive. What more do I need to ask for? We found what we were looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is still the matter of perhaps finding a few other wives to fill out your harem. A warlord is judged by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal-Dalin only gave him a sharp look. \"No more markets,\" he said shortly. \"A true warlord takes his wives from the spoils of battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTal-Quil shrunk back. \"Of course, sir. Right away, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young warlord, in the meantime, decided to actually speak with his new bride. Sal-Dalin may have been ruthless with his enemies, and he may have had a reputation for his tough-love approach to ruling his own people, but let it be known, he was not a cruel man. He recognized that frightened look in the minotaur, and he wanted to put her at ease about her new living arrangements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found her slurping down a hot broth prepared by his cooks. Given how she practically inhaled her food, he was inclined to believe she hadn't seen a hot meal in a while. He was actually surprised. Not many foreigners could handle some of the hotter spices of the south. Then again, perhaps she was eating too fast to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal-Dalin sat across from her, and that was the first time she became aware of his presence in the room. She gasped a little, wiping the hot soup from her muzzle before bowing her head a little. He laughed. \"You don't need to stop on my account,\" he said. \"I merely wanted to see that everything was too your liking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrargi nodded, not daring to meet his eyes. \"It is, you majesty. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majesty?\" he said with a loud guffaw. \"Now, that's a good one. No, no, my dear, I'm not like the king of that noisy city. We warlords are much more humble than that. None of us rule the south, though many would like to. We fight for land, for resources, and such, and that's about it. If anything, we're just very good generals, running our armies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she said. She seemed almost afraid of him whenever she spoke. That was to be expected, he thought. She was in a new land, having been bought by a warlord who slaughtered armies on a whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about yourself,\" he said gently, hoping to elicit more than just a few simple sentences from the minotaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him curiously for a moment, not sure if he was serious about his question. Eventually, she spoke up. \"There's not much to tell. I was born on a farm and raised by my parents. I was one of seven kids, and we all worked the fields once we were old enough to walk. It was fun because we got to be outside all the time. That must sound boring to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" he said. \"Contrary to what others have said about us, many of our people would like nothing better than to have a stable lifestyle like that. The constant fighting between our tribes wears us down. But, how did you end up in the market.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrargi swallowed another spoonful of soup. \"Well, my family fell on some hard times. One of the local barons was starting to overtax all of us. My parents couldn't afford to take care of all of us. Some man came by our house and offered to take some of us in exchange for money. He promised my parents he would be taking us to some sort of school to help us get jobs in the city. He took me and two of my sisters. He lied to us. My sisters were sold a few weeks ago. I don't know where they went. Erigine might have been sold to a brothel, but I don't know for sure. And that's when you found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal-Dalin felt justified mounting this crook's head on a pike once he found him. Such an absolute monster. The warlord wished there was more he could have done for the frightened minotaur. He would have liked to have found her sisters for her, but in a big city like Adinah, they could be lost to the world. Instead, he laid a comforting hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all over now,\" he said. \"Know this, you are safe in my home, and I will never lay a hand on you unless you will it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I'm now your wife, or your concubine, or something now,\" she said, tears forming in her eyes. \"Aren't you supposed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, I will not do anything unless you ask. One thing you should know about a warlord's wife is...\"</span></div></div>",

All around her were the sounds of combat, the clash of blades and the screams of the wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia loved it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, though, the battle (really more of a skirmish) came to an end as the morale of the bandit group broke down completely and the survivors fled into the desert. Alexia lifted one of her curved swords into the air, and let out a yell of triumph. The soldiers under her command (at least those who could) imitated the action. After that, it was time for the usual activities after combat. Wounded warriors had to be looked after, the dead were gathered for the last rites, and a million other little things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia left those matters to her soldiers, and instead walked over towards the merchant caravan. It appeared that not one of the bandits had gotten near it, an unqualified victory for her. This was, after all, the first merchant caravan that had approached <b>her</b> for protection, had given the proper respect and deference when asking to travel through <b>her</b> territory. She'd be a sorry excuse for a warlord if she couldn't police the lands she'd claimed, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused as she passed the nearest wagon, seeing herself in one of the mirrors that was being transported aboard it. She was dressed in her armor, which consisted of a metal cuirass that she'd stolen when she'd set out on her own. Her wide hips and strong legs were clad in simple pants, and she wore a pair of sturdy boots. She noticed some wounds marring her bronze skin, though nothing fatal. She ran a hand through her red hair, and shook her head. There was a reason she'd walked over here, after all. Better to not get sucked into preening over her appearance like some of the airheads in her father's harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caravan leader, a middle-aged man dressed in fine silks that almost concealed his potbelly, saw her approach. He got up to meet her, and bowed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would appear that the tales of your skill were not exaggerated in the least, Lady Alexia,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia smirked. Sure, he was laying on the flattery a little thick, but it felt damn good to hear after today's battle. \"Naturally. You sought my protection, and I have granted it. I always keep my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course!\" the merchant replied, bobbing his head up and down. \"And, I was thinking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia waited for a moment, then made a gesture with her hand for the man to continue. \"Well, my company's caravans travel this way quite often, as it is one of the safer routes from the Roiling Bay up to the center of the realm. And your control of the area has made it safer! So, my thought is that a friendlier relationship between my company and your army could only benefit the both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" Alexia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, with a gift of course! I am prepared to offer you...\"</span></div></div>",

He then spent the next several minutes praising Alexia and her band of warriors. She rather thought that made up some of it on the spot, but it all sounded rather good in any case. She might need to borrow some of the tales herself to better stake her claim as the powerful and rightful ruler of her territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he continued to blather on, Alexia turned her focus to the possibility of adding another woman to her harem. The several she had already were fantastic and well worth the trouble she had in keeping them happy. Yet, a new one might be a welcome change of pace. She did feel some concern about the process though. The others came to Alexis of their own will, wanting nothing to do with the threat of suffering under one of the more brutish warlords that stalked the Samin. This merchant\u2019s daughter might not be so willing to be used as trade object, much as Alexis faced before she struck out on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she could at least examine the woman; see if it was worth her time and effort. The rest of her band were still busy with their tasks while the scouts moved ahead to investigate the path ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she with you?\u201d Alexis interrupted the merchant at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-ye-yes, of course, Lady Alexis, I thought you might be interested, so I brought her along just in case.\u201d Alexis saw the twinkle in his eye, and knew he was eager to close a deal that was so close, he could almost taste it. \u201cPlease, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, come this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to lead the warlord back along the wagon train. Several carts later, he peaked through the cloth and asked someone to step out. He helped the young woman to step out into the blazing sun where Alexis got her first good look of her potential new woman. She is a\u2026</span></div></div>",

Few dare to brave its desolate wastes, save destitute souls with nothing to lose or traders taking a million to one gamble on crossing. It is a world of sand and death, where the sting of scorpions wait amidst the dunes, dancing mirages come to life to torment the minds of the weak-willed, and hardened warlords scour the sands in search of money and power, holding their lives and the lives of their prey cheap. And yet, many still chose to brave the dunes, drawn by its mysticism or the promise of great rewards for those that survive, and some may even come to a small oasis that seems to pop out of the ground as one approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer you get to the cluster of trees, the more the oppressive heat and blasted wind fades, until you can touch the bark of palm trees amidst a balmy, almost pleasant breeze, an almost magical feeling after so many days underneath a burning sun. Indeed it is a magical feeling, because amidst the trees, you might just find the creator of this little sanctuary from the blood and sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirocco sighed, basking in the noon sun as she reclined in her hammock strung between two palm trees, swaying back and forth with the wind. Dressed in her chest wrap and sarong, the light blue Djinn glistened in the light like the cool waters of the oasis, her wild orange hair falling in bundles around her head. Resting her eyes, she smacked her lips thinking of the last good meal she had. A succulent veal, roasted to perfection with a hint of lemon. She reached down to stroke the curve of her stomach, remembering how she had given the merchant who brought it for her quite a lot of gold and gems for that meal, it was so good. How long ago was that, then? A month? Maybe two? Perhaps when the merchant came back he'd find another offering for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt annoyed her to no end that this long waiting period between visitors had become the norm. Was her mission so difficult that it needed further explanation? Bring her a meal worth her time, and you'll be rewarded. Much less complicated then the deals and bargains that she once used to play the desert like her own personal chessboard, an activity she had long ago gotten bored with, and to be fair a lot more fun, since it was something she couldn't experience herself. Oh sure, she could summon up a succulent feast with the blink of an eye, and to the dulled senses of a mortal it would indeed be succulent. But to a Djinn, especially one like her? It was sustenance, and bland sustenance at that, so easy to tell that it's not the real thing. She wanted flavor, texture, something delectable that she could enjoy because real, mortal hands made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeze suddenly picked up, and Sirocco's eyes opened wide. She could tell in an instant from the sound of shifting sand upon the horizon; someone was coming! Sirocco stepped out of the hammock, her toes sinking into the sand as she held a hand to her ear, picking up the sounds of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was indeed a warboar, Sirocco could tell from a distance. Some would be surprised to see an exotic creature such as that so far from the dustbowl, but the genie knew better. Boars were hardy creatures, able to survive almost any environment, and while they were no camels their low, wide stance made them better for trekking across the desert then horses at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough speculating though...it was time to put on a performance. Turning her back to the approaching figure and staring wistfully into the distance, pretending not to notice anyone coming. The aloofness helped to make her seem alien and exotic to those that came to her mystical oasis, ensuring those who brought her gifts that she was the one they were looking for. She sniffed the air as the hooves drew closer. Dust, leathers, fur...and fresh blood. An orc, no doubt about it, a creature as unusual in the desert as those rideable boars. She'd never even been visited by orcs, even after hundreds of years of visitors from all around. This might be fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she smirked to herself as the sound of the boar's trodding footsteps lessened, and a heavy thump indicated the rider had dismounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You See-roco?\" came a questioning grunt of a voice, deep but unmistakably feminine. The djinn winced at the mispronunciation. Definitely an orc, she thought as spun around, fanning her hair out behind her elegantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...a -ulp- visitor, for me?\" she said playfully, only pausing when her stomach swung around with her and almost tossed her off balance. \"My, haven't we come a long way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes, I suppose,\" the orc woman said, looking mildly annoyed but mostly confused. Sauntering up to her gave Sirocco a chance to look over her new visitor, standing a head taller with a mane of tangled black hair, severe dark eyes, and typically gray-green skin. Her bare arms and lower legs bulged with powerful muscles, and it looked like they had been put to use recently; the fur on her animal skin jerkin was matted with dried blood in places, a fresh bandage was wrapped around her forearm, and her left eye was squinting from a nasty looking swollen bruise on her cheek. Sirocco made sure to note the spear on her back as well as the jagged sabre in her hilt...just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it the great Sirocco can do for you, my darling?\" the djinn cooed, confident that even this brute of a woman posed no danger to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you grant wishes for a good meal,\" the orc woman said. \"I make you one.\" Sirocco blinked at the orc's bluntness as she shook a satchel strap off her shoulder and began preparing a cooking area right there in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well...go ahead,\" she said. \"Feel free to gather water from the spring, if you need it.\" The orc nodded in thanks, fetching some to put in a bowl. Getting the impression that the orc wasn't the talkative type, she waved her fingers and the hammock vanished and reappeared between the two trees next to her. Lying down to leave the orc to her work, the smells of burning wood filled the air, along with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirocco blinked, rising from the hammock at once to float over to the orc woman, eager to try out what possible concoction the orc could have made, only to find a singular large pot with brackish liquid and chunks of vegetables and meats floating inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...soup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stew, but...yes,\" the orc nodded. \"Simple, but good and hearty, filling too. Try some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirocco yelped as the orc shoved a piping hot bowl into her hands, nearly singing her fingers in the process. She stared at the offending bowl, barely hiding her look of disgust. Months, almost years of waiting, and she was visited by a strange new creature, only to get...soup! That was barely a meal, barely even the START of a meal! Why if anyone had dared to pass this off as worth her time back in the old days, they'd find themselves blasted into neat little pieces and rearranged backwards! SOUP? She looked back at the orc, expecting her to be smirking or barely restraining laughter, but she was stone-faced. Rolling her eyes, the djinn summoned a golden spoon and took a generous helping of the soup, popping it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really the best you can offer me?\" she said as she chewed and swallowed. \"I've given judgement on many and...oh....oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat...what was that? That savory flavor? Right away, she dove in with her spoon to sample it again, eager to see what that wonderful taste was and...goodness, could it be? Dustroots and carrots, who knew they'd be so delightful together? And it's so thick and hardy, she could feel her whole body warming up with every bite, and even in this weather she didn't break a sweat! It was...by the gods, it was astounding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you like it?\" The djinn was shocked out of her reverie by the orc's question. The spoon seemed to lay forgotten in the sand, she realized; she had tried to lick the bowl clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...good!\" Sirocco said, pleasantly surprised as she summoned a second spoon. \"Another helping, please?\" The orc quietly ladled another spoonful and Sirocco almost dove in, keeping her head together but indulging in the stew with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, no need to bother with pretense, you have your wish!\" the djinn said, practically glowing as she stuffed her cheeks full. \"Make your wish, my dear, whatever your heart's desire!\" She stared excitedly as the orc crossed her arms, thinking to herself what she could get from this magical denizen. A flawlessly made sword, a mighty new warboar, perhaps even a powerful magical item to help her win every battle and never be harmed again. She could make them all just for her and then some, and there was no doubt her many enemies back home in the Dustbowl would give their oversized canines to have just a fraction of what this woman had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure,\" the orc woman said. \"I hadn't expected this to even work, but it was my last chance.\" Her voice cracked in the last few words and Sirocco saw the most surprising thing of all; a tear welling in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I can make anything, you know!\" the djinn said, emitting dancing lights from her hands in a display of her powers. \"Weapons, armor, gold, anything to help you fight your-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe djinn jumped backwards as the orc woman barked at her, baring her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more fighting! No more killing! I...I can't. Not anymore.\" The orc woman, breathing heavily, leaned against one of the palm trees, clutching her head. \"Every time I try...her eyes, staring back at me...questioning...why I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirocco stepped forward cautiously, and realized that her shuddering breaths weren't from anger, but from open weeping. The orc woman sunk to the ground, holding her head in her hands as she kept sobbing. Dropping all pretenses of above-it-all aloofness, the djinn summoned a silken blanket, soft to the touch, wrapping it around the orc woman's shoulders. Bored as she may have been, her heart still ached at such a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there...\" she said reassuringly, patting her gently on the shoulder. \"You stay as long as you need to, my dear...\" This was an offer she'd never made to her visitors, not even once, but perhaps this was the one person in all the realms who needed it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore then before, she was immensely curious about what this strange woman wanted from her.</span></div></div>",

Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirocco smiled, hovering a few inches off the ground as the orcish woman stirred, then blinked her eyes open, still curled around the animal skin blanket she slept under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been...watching me?\" the orc woman said suspiciously. \"Djinn don't sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course not,\" Sirocco lied, a little giggle escaping her lips. \"Now, why don't you freshen up and we can talk, hm? The oasis is magically purified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman grunted and shrugged, which the djinn took to mean 'thank you', pushing herself to her feet and staggering towards the water. Sirocco peered towards the horizon, spotting no telltale dust clouds for miles around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say,\" she said idly. \"You wouldn't happen to have any more of that soup would...what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc woman stopped wading into the oasis as the water reached her knees. \"I'm...freshening up?\" the woman said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world as she reached towards the bottom of her jerkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought you were going to splash water on your-\" she started to say before the orc woman suddenly pulled the garment up and the djinn was suddenly made acutely aware of how long it had been since she had some real companionship as she exposed her chiseled, flawless abdominals and two perky but sizeable breasts flopped out, barely restrained by a rather thin chestwrap. Tossing the jerkin to shore, she reached up to undo the topknot of her hair, letting the whole mess fall in an elegant curtain down to her shoulders while Sirocco watched those perfect arms bulge with muscle. Dipping her head in the water entirely, she got just a hint of her rippling back muscles before she rose up again, shaking her head like a dog drying off as she combed through it with her fingers, giving off a satisfied sigh. The djinn's expression didn't crack, though she hoped that the cold sweat she broke out in watching this orc 'freshen up' wasn't noticeable, and she made an effort to suck in her stomach a little better, to no avail. Luckily for all involved, as the orc woman stepped out of the oasis, shaking the sand from her jerkin, she didn't seem to notice or care that they were both soaking wet right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, I don't think I got your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glem,\" the orcish woman said as she redid her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's an odd name for an Orc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's not,\" Glem said simply. \"Almost the word for sand. First I could think of just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I see, a pseudonym,\" Sirocco said delicately. \"Trouble with the law?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Glem let out a deep sigh. \"Let's...just say I forgot. Better for us both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" the djinn said thoughtfully, her purple iris' gleaming as her mind worked. \"So, it seems like what you want is a fresh start, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and maybe you help?\" Glem asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course! You did earn the wish after all! Just say what you want and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, not wish. I have...\" she trailed off, searching for the right word in the common tongue. \"Proposal!\" She didn't even wait to ask as she sat down on the overturned pot from last night, taking a deep breath. Sirocco got the distinct impression that Glem was about to give a 'proposal' that she had been prepping for days, maybe weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I don't want to kill and fight,\" she began. \"But, all I know are two things; fighting, and cooking. So if I can't do one, I do other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" the djinn said noncommittally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This desert then, very perilous. Hard to cross, many die. But oasis like this, good place to stop and refresh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of Glem's chiseled biceps popped up in Sirocco's head again, her light blue cheeks darkening a bit as they flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there were...place of rest here, then many could come and stop to refresh. Not just water, but place to sleep, and good meal! And I can make good meal! That would be good for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...your wish is to make this place into a resting place for travelers?\" Sirocco said, raising an unimpressed eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, not a wish! Proposal!\" Glem repeated, reaching a fever pitch. \"Now, with magic you can help make this place, and that way, more people bring you meals! People come in safer groups to find you, and news can spread over djinn that grants wishes for food! It's good idea, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirocco...was actually somewhat intrigued by this idea. Sure she didn't like the idea of turning her domain into a caravansarai, but it would be a great way to get more people to bring her a good meal in exchange for a blessing of her magic. And it would be a good business too, she supposed...and a nice thing to do for all involved, and...okay, maybe her whole motivation for thinking about this was exploding out of that tiny jerkin that Glem wore, but it wasn't a half bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a crazy idea...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nWind was blowing and the sun was high in the sky. There wasn't a cloud in the sky above Port Charcarias as ships wove in and out of her docks. Port Charcarias was a small city among many in Roiling Bay, but was the one that pirates frequented the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, some fishermen already noticed a pirate ship, with a golden whale as figurehead, and a flag with an easily recognizable Jolly Roger: a skull with two eels popping out of the sockets and twisting their bodies. That was Elizabeth Robin\u2019s; known as \"Sea legs\", ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pretty famous among the pirates for being one of the very few female captains, and one of the youngest, and also because her crew was the only one where all the members were female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf for a pirate a woman on board brought bad luck, one could only imagine what would happen when all the crewmembers were women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Elizabeth was also known for her skills, as rumors said that her ship, the \"Sunny whale\", originally belonged to another pirate, until the day she stole the ship from under him; and many people were as much afraid of stumbling across the sunny whale as much as meeting a Kraken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was on the top deck, where the wind was blowing her golden braids, while the sunlight reflected off her tanned skin. She was wearing a captain\u2019s hat and a large pirate jacket, left open while the other clothes, a short white blouse and a pair of extremely short shorts with a large belt, revealed her hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the ship stopped moving Elizabeth went towards the ramp, and called her second in command. \"Katy!\" The captain bellowed across the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnswering was a woman of roughly the same age but taller, with reddish-brown hair kept in a pony-tail that almost touched the ground. She was wearing a pair of long trousers, a corset and a shirt that left her large cleavage exposed and a pair of long gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do ya\u2019 need captain?\" said Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to Scylla's, I should return to the ship in an hour at most. In the meantime, you give the orders, and make sure we are ready to set sail once I'm back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes captain but, shouldn\u2019t we get more stocks? Arlene said the depot is almost empty. And we need to sell the jewels we stole to those old nobles\" replied Katy before taking a sip from her rum-flask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth shook her shoulders, \"Fine, send someone to buy enough stock for a week or two, but do it quickly, we set sail when I return and not a moment later. As for the jewels, we'll sell them at the Rock-fang\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye captain\" replied Katy taking another sip of rum, but noticed with displeasure that it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! One of you sea-whores bring me another flask!\" That was the last Elizabeth heard before setting foot into port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScylla's was a notorious tavern for those who habitually visited Port Charcarias. It was cheap (but very few dared risking their life and ordering something to drink) and it was the perfect place if you wanted information about undiscovered treasures, mysterious outlaws or simple gossips. Though getting that information wasn't as easy as it seemed, and was definitely not cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner, Norm, was your average tavern owner: short, chubby, a big nose with a riotous moustache and a head so bald it looked like he had covered it in boot polish. But no-one dared to tangle with Norm, even when he tried to kick patrons out, thanks to his assistant, Wilda, a minotaur that was as tall as she was large, who made sure no-one laid a finger on her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Elizabeth was playing \"du-do\", a game with dice where you can make a bet on the others results. Elizabeth loved that game, and she was winning as usual. She had already won a hundred gold coins, a pair of golden necklaces and a wooden leg (it was just a random wooden leg, but she wanted to win it out of spite for the now one-legged pirate sitting to her left), and now was about to win something she was really really interested in, and the main reason she went to the bar in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman and the man in front of her had their iron glasses down, with the die inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared into each other's eyes, in the hope to find the sign of a bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Elizabeth shouted \"I say three fives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man brushed his long beard and replied \"Fourrrrr sixes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven Fives\" replied the tanned blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pirates at the table gasped. That was a large bet considering there were only ten die in total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you really want to lose that \"scale of the sea\"\u2026\" the brutish pirate commented, pointing at the gem in Elisabeth's earring. It was a light-blue gem that shined on its own. \"Eight sixes\" replied the man with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth kept her cool, and gave a quick look under her glass, then she said: \"Four jollys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big smile, lacking a pair of teeth, appeared on the big brute's face. \"Ah-ha! I doubt it!\" And revealed the five die under his glass. Not one of them had a \"one\", the equivalent of the jolly, face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that!\" Said the brute anxious to get his reward as he leaned over the table..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth put a finger to his forehead, \"uh-uh-uh; do you think I don't have four jollys under my glass? I have five die\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drop of sweat poured dripped from the Brute's face... and Elizabeth revealed her die. There were four \"one\" faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't mess with \"sea legs\" so easily\" said Elizabeth putting a hand on her lips and blowing a kiss while crossing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your nickname is well earned\" commented eagerly a man next to her, gazing at her long tanned legs, before the blonde imprinted her boot on his face with a sift twirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's impossible! you cheated!\" The opposing pirate protested furiously, slamming his hand on the table and preparing himself to punch Elizabeth, if not for the woman\u2019s quicker reflexes as she drew the flintlock pistol from her belt, and pointed it directly towards his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth noticed the minotaur raising her head with a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Wilda, I will be finished with my transaction immediately.\" Then turned her head toward the bearded man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Rob the Repulsive. But you lost\" said the woman stretching her hand \"Now give me it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grunted and handed her...</span></div></div>",

A stream of golden light flickered out, across her gaze as her eyes lit up with greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pirate captain shut the box though she heard a few dozen clicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t yar know ya cannot trust a pirate?\u201d The sour-puss pirate remarked with a grin on his cracked lips. He and a few of his crewmates had surrounded Elizabeth and were all pointing pistols at her. \u201cYa cannot shoot all of us\u2026\u201d He added, beckoning a hand forward for Elizabeth to return the well-won goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery true\u2026it seems you have me\u2026\u201d Elizabeth relented, holding her hands up in surrender\u2026then with a swift movement she fired her pistol up towards the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pirates looked up in horror as a chandelier came rocketing down towards them. Meanwhile Elizabeth tucked the box under her free arm and jumped onto the table, then used Rob the Repulsive\u2019s face as a stepping stone for her boot as she leapt upwards and over him and his crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was out the door in moments\u2026only for more shipmates to surround her outside the door, blocking her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot haaaaar!\u201d Came the cry of the injured pirate captain as pistols and cutlasses were drawn. Elizabeth scanned her eyes frantically left and right, then something caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, no time to play boys\u2026\u201d She remarked, jumping backwards onto a plank that was leaning against a cart. Then with another well-aimed shot she fired at a rope holding a load of fish, freshly caught that morning. The sack of salmon plummeted onto the other end of the plank, catapulting the acrobatic pirate upwards and onto a balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth landed in front of a young terrified washerwoman; silencing her with a suave kiss, the pirate clambered up onto the rooftop and began running across the masonry, jumping from one building to the other as pirates tried to chase her from the streets below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pirate captain could see the mast of her ship drawing closer and closer. Thankfully she was used to this kind of ridiculous escape, and she was outpacing her pursuers. As she drew to the end of the row of houses, Elizabeth jumped onto a washing line and slid her way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSET SAIL!\u201d Elizabeth bellowed at her crew as she hit the end of the washing line and began pumping her legs across the cobbled street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU HEARD THE CAPTAIN!\u201d Her first mate yelled to the rest of the crew as they began to hurry back and forth across the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth neared the end of the dock the ship pulled up the plank and started to move from harbour. The blonde woman turned to see Rob the Repulsive turning the corner, his face still in-filled with shards of the chandelier from the bar. The captain backed up a bit then ran full pelt and jumped with all her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body slammed into the side of her ship, but her hand managed to catch the rope while one of her boots jammed itself in a porthole. Sighing with relief Elizabeth began to pull herself up the side of the wooden ship and onto the deck. Turning around she saw the other pirates finally approach the end of the dock, some trying to jump as well but succeeding in only falling into the salty seawater below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha!\u201d Elizabeth crowed. \u201cTough luck boys! Perhaps you can sell some of that crystal lodged in your captain\u2019s face to pay off the tab!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to strut in another taunt Elizabeth passed by Katy, with a casual flick of her wrist Elizabeth knocked the bottle of rum out of her first-mate\u2019s hands and into her own. \u201cNext time, try not to set sail until <i><b>after</b></i> I am on board\u2026\u201d Elizabeth hissed before downing what remained of the bottle and chucking the empty glass overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye aye captain\u2026\u201d Katy huffed, thinking that she had actually done a good job. The captain was on board and the rival pirates hadn\u2019t laid so much as a finger on the woodwork, what was the problem? \u201cYou going to come and celebrate with the rest of us?\u201d Katy asked as Elizabeth started to make her way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, I just want to look at my prize\u2026\u201d The captain answered as she headed into her quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain\u2019s quarters of the Sunny Whale were very well decorated. Elizabeth had laid out as many of her sentimental trophies as possible throughout her sleeping quarters and it provided quite the trophy room. There was that ring she had stolen from a lustful siren she had outwitted, the tooth of a shark that had plowed into the lower decks, and the peg-leg from a long-retired rival pirate gang among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth though was not interested in her current d\u00e9cor; sitting herself down at her desk and putting her booted feet up, she re-opened the small box to take a better look at her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a medallion; round and made of gold, with two serpents eating each other\u2019s tails on it. Elizabeth leaned over her desk and grabbed some string, threading it through the medallion and then draping it across her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked pretty fetching, resting down softly in her cleavage. Suddenly, Elizabeth swore she could see the serpents move, devouring each other\u2019s tails further and glowing bright yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the spectacle started it had finished. Strange\u2026Elizabeth had heard of cursed items before, but she had never believed in them. It was probably a trick of the light\u2026or the rum setting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off as nothing Elizabeth stood up and headed back outside. However there was no crew to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026celebrations\u2026\u201d The blonde muttered to herself as she headed below deck. As she reached the dining quarters though something peculiar happened\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nElizabeth walked under the deck, and found all the crew already sitting on the barrels around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a seat next to Katy, who was chugging down the rum from her bottle as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've told me the party was ready\" commented the captain to her first mate with a wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did\" replied the redhead before letting out a belch \"*URP* Eh Kojina, pass me another bottle\" she said to the half-orc sitting in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" replied Kojina throwing a bottle to the first crewmate, while drinking a bottle herself. This latter detail surprised Elizabeth, from what she remembered, Kojina hated rum, but she shrugged her shoulders and ignored it, maybe she decided she liked it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the other crewmembers were making a big noise together, which disappeared after a big bellow from the ships cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut-up, if you want to eat something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelling at them was a portly woman with long black hair, wearing a stained brown apron in front of her round belly. She was Arlene, the chef of the crew. While Elizabeth was the captain of the ship, in the kitchen, Arlene was the undisputed ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the crewmembers watched with trepidation as the chef served the usual slop with eggs and fish. Elizabeth was surprised by what was seeing; the moment a pirate-girl got her grub, she would quickly eat it and asks for seconds once she finished every scrap, could it be that it was better than usual?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth ate it, but for her it seemed the usual slop, and yet, even the youngest members of the crew, Phania and Lessya, were having seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLessya and Phania were a couple of blonde twin elves with short hair, they where the ship boys (or in this case, girls) and Phania wore an eye-patch on her eye (which eye changed continuously) only to distinguish herself from her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, once the large pots were emptied and nearly everyone was having seconds, Elizabeth made her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls! I hope you're enjoying your lunch\" probably even too much, she thought \"because today we're gonna sail to the rock-fang, so it's going to be a couple of weeks journey! But be prepared, because we're assaulting every noble ship we're going to see, so I want you all ready! I'm talking especially to you, Winona\" said Elizabeth to a harpy with white and gray feathers, like those of a seagull, and the mouth full of slop, with some sauce dipping from her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis harpy was the crew lookout, thanks to her race's enhanced vision, meaning that her job was to warn the captain about whatever she glanced at on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was no answer from the harpy \"Winona, did you hear me?\" Barked Elizabeth, louder this time, \"Winona!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the harpy heard it and with a clawed hand on the forehead, said \"Aye aye captain\" before diving back to empty her bowl. Elizabeth wasn't much surprised by that, Winona was far from the brightest of the crew, but what bothered her was that barely anyone listened to her today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, what's happening to you? This seems the usual slop Arlene makes\u2026\" Speaking of Arlene, she couldn't find her anywhere, where has she gone already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t bother the captain much, and simply said \"Alright, crew! Lunch time is over! Everyone go back to their job\" and gave a glare to the young elf twins \"Even you two! I want the deck to sparkle\" said before getting up and going back to her cabin, where she could admire her treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was playing with an emerald idol in her hands. According to the person she stole-ahem, gently took it from, it was made by a tribe in the Motee marshes and represented a goddess. Though for Elizabeth was more a fat tiger-woman in a buddha-like pose (And body). She liked it, especially because it was so round it seemed like it could roll away from her hands at any given moment. Once she got bored she placed it carefully back in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her newly-acquired treasure, the necklace she was wearing, and noticed that the snakes on it were biting their tails... had it always been this way? She shrugged it off and left her cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the navigator's room. \"Hey Kojina, how is the navigation going?\" Asked Elizabeth, as she abruptly opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-orc turned around with her hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well\" replied the navigator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth got closer to Kojina. She was a half-orc, meaning that, while her face was still thin-boned in-build, rather pretty and human-like, she had some small sharp canines and a green-gray skin. She also had long black hair and was on the chubby side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we now?\" Asked Elizabeth as she leaned onto the table covered with maps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the captain was distracted, Kojina put the fish she was hiding in her mouth and swallowed it as fast as she could. Elizabeth heard some munches and turned around, but Kojina tried to stay vague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you answer me, please?\" Repeated the captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure\" said the half-orc pointing on the map \"at the moment we're here, but judging by the wind and the pressure, we have to take a long trip to avoid the storm, but it will take just three-four days longer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't expect nothing less from you\" said Elizabeth in a proud tone. Kojina was, after all, one of the best navigators of Yndyre, and had all the maps memorized in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... thanks\" replied Kojina awkwardly. In truth, there was no storm coming, but wanted to take the long route so the ship had to stop to Carchan, where they could get more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you happen to know where Katy is?\" Asked Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, why would I?\" Asked Kojina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, according to the rumors, you two are pretty close\" said Elizabeth, grinning maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft it's just a rumor. Probably spread by Arlene, she should just think about cooking\u2026not who is in bed with whom\" replied Kojina leaving the room, mentioning the word 'cooking' had made her hungry again, and she absolutely needed to raid the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth shrugged, \"Whatever, better get some rest if it will be a long trip\" with a stretch of her arms.<br>\r\nSo she leaned on a chair and took in the sun, noticing how the crew around her was strangely quiet. It had been one weird day, thought the pirate captain.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile the other two players gave a quick nonchalant glance to both sides, until Nuta hid her fruit under her chair and Kojina quickly swallowed the fish she was slowly chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth didn't notice that, as she was too busy looking at her cards, and then said \"I raise thirty gold coins\" and pushed a much larger pile of money into the center of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaid sitting next to her made a slasher smile and, pushed her money, said \"I'm in!\" and laid back in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth grinned \"Oh, so you accept the challenge, Nuta? Could it be you're still bitter for me having captured you some time ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if!\" Replied the mermaid moving some of her long white fins out from in front of her face \"I'm an official crewmember, right? And besides, without my songs, you wouldn't have any entertainment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever\u2026I still would get plenty of entertainment watching these lot lose at card games\u2026\" said the captain. \"Kojina, do you have anything? You have to add at least an extra eighteen golden coins\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKojina pushed her share of money \"of course I'm in!\" she roared showing her little sharp canines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out\" said Katy dropping her cards on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a chicken\u2026\" commented Kojina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a chicken\" yelled Katy with her face turning redder \"I just know I can't win a game with our captain\". Hearing this Elizabeth raised her chin and made a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know why I decided to play cards with you. I'm gonna get more rum\u2026\" grumbled the redhead, leaving the room and shaking her empty flask for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, does anyone want to eat those anchovies?\" Asked Nuta stretching her hand toward the half empty box with oil and fish in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth slammed a fist on the table, and the coins jumped into the air. \"Nuta, we are trying to play cards, not eat! Besides, you've already eaten alot during breakfast. Do you want to go from a fish to a whale?\" Asked Elizabeth looking at Nuta's still waifish light-blue body; but marred by the swollen gut that protruded an inch further from her frame. The mermaid was not wearing very modest clothes, a little piece of clothing wrapped around her chest, a short skirt and a pair of bracelets, nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuta retired her hand with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" said Elizabeth \"Now, if no one else has anything to say, I guess we have to show what we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened sharply, slamming against the wall. It was Lessya, the twin without eyepatch (or was she the one with one? Nobody could remember).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, Winona has just seen Carchan at the horizon, we should dock in about ten minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth raised a brow \"What? Why would we stop at Carchan? I said we needed to reach the Basody-pelago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKojina whistled and raised her eyes, hoping that Elizabeth didn\u2019t realize it was her who changed the course of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Elizabeth didn't notice her strange behaviour (recently there has been a different \"strange behaviour\" in all the crew anyway), put her captain coat over her shoulder loosely and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winona, are you sure that is Carchan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye captain!\" Replied the harpy from the top of the mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth went to the prow and checked the horizon with a telescope. There was a peninsula with a large somewhat bear-shaped rock and a small town where the buildings had blue roofs. It was Carchan without any doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why are we going to Carchan?\" Wondered Elizabeth under her breath as she closed the telescope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get some new stocks\" answered a voice on her back, the captain turned and saw Rihan, the shipwright of the Sunny Whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the tallest member of the crew and, with all her muscles, the strongest too; with her size, it wasn't uncommon for some people to mistake her for a dark-skinned orc (even moreso than the half-orc Kojina), a mistake she doesn't forgive. Her skin was tanned, almost bronze-like, and some short dirty blonde bangs popped from under her bandana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you stopped lazing around on your hammock?\" Asked Elizabeth putting a hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault if this ship works so well that I don\u2019t have to lift a finger some days\" replied Rihan patting the solid wood of the ships rails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" said Elizabeth passing near the shipwright, and noticed how Rihan had some cream dotting the side of her lips. This made Elizabeth suspicious, and went to the kitchen to clear a thought that had been nagging at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arlene!\" Yelled Elizabeth stomping her boot \"Arlene where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the pantry emerged Arlene, the cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rihan just told me we need some stock, is it true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just check the pantry\" answered the black haired woman with a gesture of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain went inside and noticed how the pantry was almost empty. How could it be? They had stocks for a month and yet, in the span of a week or so, they were nearly finished. The sound of munching answered her questions. Arlene was snacking on a slice of melon, and Elizabeth could see the peel from further slices left on the shelf. Yes, all her crew recently had been snacking nearly all the time, and Arlene made some pretty large portions during lunches, and there had never been any leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of pure instinct, Elizabeth grabbed the medallion around her neck for a moment, then checked Arlene's belly. The cook had always been portly, but the captain could see that her belly was protruding more than usual, some of the pink skin clearly visible under her shirt, and wondered how much she truly snacked with the pantry at her complete disposal. Her train of thought was interrupted by the sudden movements of the ship, a sign it must have docked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde captain ran outside and screamed \"Ok, you damned bitches, we're staying at Carchan for a few hours! I don't want any trouble, so avoid beginning a fray, ok? Feel free to spend all the money, but we need some gunpowder for the cannon and enough food for a month or two! Speaking of food, I don't know what got into you, but you all must stop this snacking! Our supplies aren't unlimited! Have I been clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain!\" Replied some of the crewmembers within earshot namely; Phania, Lessya and Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed and went back to the pantry to get a bottle of rum, she desperately needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth walked into the chaotic harbour, between screaming salaryman and pirates insulting each other, and wasn't surprised to see all the crewmembers busy with buying and loading crates onto the ship. It was food. Lots of food. She saw Rihan taking two large crates filled with eggs, Kojina a chest with fruit, which wouldn't have been bad if these fruits weren't sweet and very sugary, and Katy a smaller one while with the other hand she was emptying her flask of rum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in front of a tavern, she exchanged a gaze with a young, large men who was sitting near the entrance, and the men immediately fled inside. Elizabeth smiled smugly, he was a rival pirate until he and his crew assaulted her ship, but that proved to be a big mistake, and in the end, she killed all of his crew and burned his ship, while leaving him on a raft with just a bottle of rum and a gun loaded with a single bullet, but it seemed he was lucky enough to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw the two elven twins snatching a couple of fish from a stand, but with a gaze she intimidated them to get to work. Apparently the two did, until she felt something cold near her butt, and noticed how the two left the fishbone in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those little...\" cursed Elizabeth \"Once we're aboard, I'll make them clean the ship until I can see my reflection on the deck\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before her rage could explode, something caught the pirate captain's attention...</span></div></div>",

She had moved in a few months ago, after deciding that the beach she lived in wasn't an ideal home, even though she then spent most of her time working in a tavern called \"The Royal Parrot\". In that tavern, she heard lots of tales from the sea. Csarvia had always been adventurous, and hearing these tales were a primary reason of why she stayed. Her knew home was once filled with treasures, these she sold, being payed in high quality food, which left some pudge on her body. However, there was one treasure she didn't sell, a map, not just any map, but an enchanted map. Even though being in water, it wasn't damaged, so it must be some kind of protection spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe map was written in an unknown, presumably ancient language. She went around the village surrounding The Royal Parrot asking if someone could read it, so far only some traveling wizard could read the lines \"Ancient Relic\" and \"Island Of Fire\".

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The salty air blew calmly over the open water of the southern sea. A vast, blue expanse touched by few land dwellers but the bravest of seafarers and whoever may have the mettle to stand boisterous sailors for countless hours. Anna Skyriver was not either of those things and yet here she was, in a cabin on a wooden ship, floating into the great unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a bit past dinnertime and the sun hangs low in the sky, shining directly into Anna's cabin as she scribbles in a journal. Her day today had been boring, as most days tended to be. It was three weeks into her journey and she still had not quite bonded with any of the members of the ship's crew. Sometimes she wondered why she was on this ship in the first place, but her mind would always come up with the same answer: she had to be for the sake of discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna is an esteemed member of the Adinah Archaeological Society, the foremost repository of ancient civilization and history in all of Yndyre. While on an expedition to the Samin Desert of all places, Anna found a map of the sea with strange markings all over its back in a box within a cavern that must have been untouched for hundreds of years. An expert in cartography, she had never seen a map this large or detailed of the southern sea in her time. Even merfolk maps did not contain the amount of information that this one did. After taking it to one of her colleagues who is an expert in language back at the Society, she discovered that its markings are an ancient Djinn script and upon rough translation pointed to a specific place in the sea that existed outside of charted boundaries. It went on to explain that great treasure lies within a temple on an island there, the riches of a tribe that went off in search of enlightenment and never returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to turn down an archaeological expedition, Anna chartered a merchant ship from Roiling Bay to take her to the island and off they sailed and had been sailing. Despite her adventurous attitude, Anna was quite a shy creature. It took a lot of courage for her to even charter this boat in the first place and she mostly kept to her room, writing one thing or another in her books and reading historical tomes borrowed from the Society's vast library. She always dressed modestly and prudently, currently wearing loose brown slacks, knee-high black boots, a chocolate brown jacket, and a cream colored blouse. They hang loosely to her adequately sized curves, a fit hourglass shape with rounded breasts and buttocks. Though she had a body many women would die for and many men had thirsted over, Anna was a virgin and had little interest in the pleasures of the flesh. Her mind was consistently set upon one thing: knowledge. She didn't want to cloud her scholarly pursuits with a sex life, no sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriting in her book, Anna's concentration is rudely broken by a commotion above deck. Men yelling, running on the creaky wooden boards, swords clanking together, and even a bit of gunpowder exploding. Oh no. Could this be...? Just then, Anna's cabin door is kicked in by a disheveled looking woman. Her revealing outfit made it abundantly clear she was on the portly side, a chubby double belly pooching from her midsection, thick thighs dotted with cellulite. Shit. These are definitely pirates. Today just got a whole lot more exciting, maybe for the wrong reasons. She barked in a salty accent, \"Yer comin' wit' me, lassie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hauled Anna to the main deck, allowing her to take in the disarray caused by the pirates. Men were being thrown overboard if they were alive or dead, pools of blood and ripped fabric adorned the floor, and the pirates, who were all women and who were all at least chubby, pillaged the cargo hold, loading up crates of whatever this ship was hauling. What was this ship hauling, anyway? Who cares. Anna knew her doom was imminent and couldn't control the intense beat of her anxious little heart. To her surprise, though, she was not being taken directly to the edge of the boat, she was being taken to a woman. A woman who was currently bent over into one of the crates, peering deep inside for something she really wanted. A woman wearing nothing on her legs but knee-high red leather boots and a pair of underwear skimpier than anything she'd ever seen before. A woman with a very, very large ass. As they approached the butt, the woman holding Anna called out, \"Oi! Cap'n! This lass's different! I reckon she's an elf or somethin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain's torso and head emerged from the crate, holding her treasure: a block of cheese. As Anna was dropped to her knees the captain took a bite, savoring it and rubbing her exposed tummy before asking between chews, \"What's an elf like ye doin' on a cheese ship? Ye the cheesemaker's daughter or somethin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nervous as ever, Anna spit out, \"I-I charted this s-ship miss, er, ma'am, captain! I'm looking for an island, w-with treasure! I'm still trying to go there s-so if you want some treasure you could, um, take me? And we can share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain stopped for a moment and laughed the kind of laugh only a fat pirate could. \"Are ye pullin' me fat leg, lass? Ye reckon I be belivin' that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing impending doom, Anna desperately defended herself. \"It's true! I have a map! If I may make a p-proposition to you ma'am, captain, er... What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proudly took another bite of her cheese. \"I be  Captain Gillian Davies, the Derriere! Have ye heard o' me lassie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, I don't believe I have, Captain Davies.\" Anna quivered. If she fucks this up, she's dead. Sinking to the bottom of the ocean to be swallowed by a whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me 'n me pirate crew here 'ave been terrorizin' this sea fer years now! We find ships like these, clear them out, loot all th' grub, 'ave a great feast, 'n find more ships! We must 'ave a name fer ourselves, right?\" She seemed a little worried. Maybe reassuring her would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna decided to lie. \"Oh... Now that I think about it I have heard of you! Lots of stories of food trade ships going missing... That's you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another victorious bite of cheese. \"I knew it! They always told me me whole grub pirate schtick wouldna stick but look at me! Terror o' th' high seas!\" She lowered her voice and crouched down to Anna's level  \"Say, do ye know if they 'ave any pastry ships? All these thin's are cheese 'n meat 'n spirits, but this big booty needs some cake, do ye know wha' I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her. Thank the gods. \"I don't believe they do fully cooked pastry shipments, just of the raw ingredients. But... if you let me take you to this island you'll have so much treasure and wealth that you could have as many sweets as you want, whenever you want? How does that sound captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment and said, \"That sounds... great. I dunno why I ne'er considered plunderin' riches instead o' grub afore. I'll take ye t' this island but, jus' so ye know, if thar's no booty, ye're ripe t' facin' a cruel 'n unusual punishment fer trickin' me. They don't call me th' derriere fer naught!\" Captain Davies smacked her wide rear with her open hand. Yikes. Anna did not want her death to be \"crushed by massive pirate ass\" but at least she knew she wouldn't be the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Captain Davies let Anna go back down to her cabin and retrieve her things before setting sail for the mysterious island. The new ship was a lot more spacious than the old one, and more lively too. Reading a tome became more difficult with the much fatter crew thumping around, chowing down on plundered riches, having burping contests, and just generally being loud slobs. But at least she was getting where she was going, right? She scribbled in her journal. Today had been quite an exciting day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days of journeying with Captain Davies and her crew had not been too difficult for Anna, even though they were a murderous group of pirates. She wasn't expecting them to be so... pleasant? Not that she was complaining! She would take this over getting eaten alive by sea creatures any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's welcome on the ship was warm, she was given her own room, albeit a small one, and was told to ask the Captain if she ever needed anything at all. Was this a genuinely kind-hearted group of women or were they just using her as a key to the treasure? Anna didn't want to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna found the Captain to be a friendly, yet somewhat callous person. She was blunt, boisterous, and had absolutely awful manners. At the same time, she cared deeply for her crew, always seemed in a good mood, and was surprisingly cordial any time she and Anna would interact. She often wore a blue tricorne hat which she must have stolen from a hapless sailor over her shoulder length brown hair, frayed and frizzed from the salty air. Her coat also seemed stolen, a gray and blue jacket a size too small for her somewhat portly frame. She wore a dark corset on top of a white undershirt, which she used to draw attention away from her tubby waist and towards her bountiful bum. Anna had seen much bigger butts in her day, but few that made her as jealous as the Captain's. Her cheeks were globe-round and enormous: Anna estimated about 70 inches around. Captain Davies never wore a pair of pants in her life: she wanted desparately to flaunt what she had, and she had a lot to flaunt. Despite their difference in species and skin color (Anna a pale white and the Captain a light brown Human, like you would see from desert folk) the two women were about the same height, a moderately tall 5'11\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, the Captain knocked on Anna's cabin door while she was deep into a passage detailing ancient Orcish customs. Anna didn't have a chance to get up before the Captain burst in, two pitchers of mead in her hands and jollily proclaimed, \"Oi! Elf lass! Let's see this map o' yers 'n get drunk! Do ye like mead?\" She pulled a wooden chair from the corner, spilling some drink from one of her glasses, and stuffed her butt in it. The fat from her cheeks bulged from under its arms. Anna could almost hear it screaming in agony as the Captain excitedly handed her one of the pitchers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she rarely partook in alcohol consumption, Anna decided to accept the drink. Who knows what would have happened if she turned her down, right? She murmured politely in her soft, quiet voice, \"Oh, yes. Thank you very much, Captain Davies. My name is Anna, by the way. I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot.\" She extended her free hand for a formal greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain pushed her hand away. \"Nay, I don't go fer those standard greetin' thin's. Much too borin'. Let's clink our glasses together 'n chug, Anna!\" She extended the big cup of mead toward her. \"To untold riches!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf followed suit with a more nervous \"To untold riches!\" and got her glass clinked a little more forcefully than she was expecting, spilling some alcohol on her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women chugged from their glasses, the Captain much longer than Anna. After depleting half her supply in a single drink, Davies let loose a deep belch, followed by a single hiccup. She scrunched over in her chair, exasperated. \"'Tis times like these I wish I didn' always wear this damned corset. I be mighty full o' cheese, Anna. I be so compressed in this thin'! But I gotta show off me arse somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna chuckled, taking another slight sip from her mead. \"I understand, Captain.\" She bent over to retrieve the map from her bag. \"If I may ask, ma'am, and I mean no offense by this of course, but why do you feel the need to display your bottom so proudly? I'm just a curious person, unfamiliar with pirate customs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies thought for a moment, taking a deep swig from her drink. She thoughtfully responded, \"Well, ye must know that th' best pirates in history all had or 'ave a signature definin' trait. Fer example, Thomas th' Fearsome had a wooden arm. Bluebeard was known fer his bright blue beard. Mary th' Minotaur was a minotaur. *HOOOORRP!* 'n me definin' trait be this fat booty o' mine. When scallywags remember me in th' distant future, they gonna reckon o' th' poppet who crushed sailors wit' her humongous arse 'n looted 'n ate lots o' grub so she could keep crushin' sailors! A true pirate legend! *OURRP!* Farrgin' corset makin' me burp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna had taken out the map after listening deeply. This was quite an interesting human. \"Thank you for telling me that, Captain. Every day we'll know more of you pirates and how you live day to day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two perused the map, got seconds and then thirds of Mead, and turned in for the night drunk as skunks after a dinner of cheese and bread. As the days wore on, Anna became less of a recluse with Davies's encouragement, speaking and eating with the crew, and getting drunk with the Captain, listening to her stories of looting the high seas and telling her of her many expeditions around Yndyre. The two were becoming quite close, and even though the ship was hot and smelled like cheese, Anna began to think of it as a home, an honorary member of the Grub Pirate Crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later on a particularly cloudy afternoon, Anna was rousted from her studies by the lookout screaming \"Land!\" She felt her heart jump. She knew they were there. Getting up as fast as she could, she breathlessly joined the rest of the crew above deck as they approached...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ship floated anchored as Anna and its crew gazed upon the sight before them. It was a sandy isle, not too big of an isle but an isle nonetheless. Its beach gently sloped upward into a grassy hill, interspersed with vegetation and coconut trees. Erected between those trees were large 20 foot stone sculptures of heads, their rocky, crudely carved eyes staring emotionlessly out into the water which surrounded them. The biggest point of interest on the island was the massive temple which crowned the top of its hill. It was ornate and imposing, the decorated steeple of its entryway beautifully scraping the sky. Anna had never seen anything like this before, not even in her studies of Djinn civilization. The architecture wasn't even in line with their customary style. An enigma, sure, but she breathed a sigh of relief that the place did exist. Now she nervously hoped that whatever was inside the temple would be enough to satisfy her bottom-heavy friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stood next to the Captain, whose mouth gaped open. This must have been beyond her expectations. Davies gave Anna a strong pat on the back, nearly knocking her over, laughed a deep belly laugh, and bellowed to her crew, \"She's real! Har har! She's real! Come then, lower a lifeboat fer me 'n th' Elf lass posthaste! We've got riches t' plunder!\" She then turned to Anna and said, \"Thank ye fer bringin' us here. If I get rich from this ye'll ne'er lift a finger in yer life again.\" Anna nodded, accepting her thanks even though she had really no choice but to bring the Captain along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lifeboat ran aground on the isle's beach. A crab scuttered up the sand by the boat, burrowing into the ground. As Anna and Davies disembarked, the Captain wobbled a little bit, stopping for a second. She exhaled and pleaded, \"Hang on jus' a minute, wait up. I haven't got me land legs yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two slowly made their way up the hill, the Captain dizzily hobbling along. As they walked, Anna admired the stone heads, scribbling frantically in her journal her observations and questions: Who made these heads? How long have they been here? How did they get the stone here to make them? Why are they all looking out into the sea? Do they serve any purpose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they reached the gateway of the temple, a grand archway leading into a quiet courtyard. As they walked in, the two womens' boots clacked upon the stone slab floor. The yard was totally empty. Anna postulated that it must have been some sort of common meeting place for whoever worshipped here. Something odd she noticed was that there was no iconography of the Gods anywhere to be seen. Typically temples like this had at least some statues or carvings of whichever God the building was built for, but there was absolutely nothing here except for the ornate carvings that also decorated the temple's exterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the center of the courtyard was a spiral staircase leading downwards into the ground. The duo descended into the earth for what seemed like a millennia until they finally reached a hallway, lit only by torches. The Captain was confused as to how they stayed lit, to which Anna responded that it was a very typical magical incantation for Djinn temples, nothing quite out of the ordinary. At the end of the hall was a stone door, painted in a dull green and blue. The two pushed the door with their combined strength, managing to open it with a great effort. Their effort paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door revealed a massive chamber absolutely filled with offerings: gold, silver, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, jewelry beyond comprehension, mountains of ancient gold coins and expensive trinkets. At the other side of the room was a large circular structure with stairs leading up and through it. Both Anna and the Captain stood motionless with their jaws on the floor, not sure what to even do in this situation. In the middle of the room was a red velvet throne upon which a glass bottle containing a blue smoke sat. Anna noticed this, realizing she had seen something like it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Captain stood still in shock taking in the riches which she now assumed were hers, Anna broke away, going to the throne. She picked up the bottle and opened its cork, releasing the smoke. It poured out the lip of the bottle in a linear stream, forming into a little blob of smog a few feet from the throne. Finally noticing the strange events before her, Davies was snapped from her gold trance, powerwalking towards the commotion and shouting, \"Wha's this then? Wha' did ye do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna calmed her. \"Relax, Captain Davies. Watch.\" As she watched the smoke began to take the form of a tall, voluptuous woman. Though she wore no clothes, her blue skin was as opaque and smooth as a doll, without blemishes or genitals. She did, however, have a belly button on her chubby tummy. Her face was formed next, beautifully made up with thick black eyeliner and red lipstick. She wore two golden hoop earrings and a gold necklace with thick beads around her neck, along with many bracelets of multiple precious materials. A short head of hair finished the woman, who strutted toward Anna on her bare feet with slight blue residue. She had a very sultry voice, and a dainty twang in her accent one night expect a farmer's wife to have. She spoke to Anna, \"Greetings, my new master. I am a Djinn, born of alchemy 434 years, 3 months, 6 days, 10 hours, and 6 minutes ago. I was created by Ehsan of Monument Island before she left to the Great Unknown. What is your name, master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gripped the bottle, looking the Djinn straight in the eyes. \"I am Anna Skyriver, an Elven archaeologist from the great city of Adinah.\" She motioned to the Captain, extending the palm of her hand to her. \"And this is my friend, Captain Gillian Davies, a sailor of the high seas. We come in search of information regarding this place and the people that once resided here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies butted in, rushing next to Anna, putting her chunky arm around her. \"'n riches! We wants th' great treasure here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe djinn laughed. \"I'm afraid you can't have any of the treasure here. Not that it's mine and I'm keeping you from it, no. It's cursed, you see. It cannot leave this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sensed Davies's disapproval. She quickly asked, \"Djinn, is there any way to lift the curse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only person who can remove the curse is the person who put it on in the first place. That person is my creator, Ehsan, but he hasn't been present in this plane of existence for 400 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna once again felt Davies's leer. She had to salvage something, else she knew she'd be smothered by booty tonight. Before the Captain could insult the djinn, Anna cut her off, muffling her mouth with a hand and asked, \"What do you mean this plane of existence? How can we find her? You see, my friend here does not want to leave empty handed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Djinn conjured two chairs from smoke for the women, one courteously larger than the others, and invited them to take a seat. Then she started her lesson. \"A long time ago there was a sect of djinn who broke from the main community in the Samin Desert over theological differences. You see, the djinn are a scientific and atheistic people: we believe the gods are not gods but simply incredibly powerful beings. The main group of djinn believe that once a person dies, they are gone forever. However, the sect I was created by believed differently. They believed the soul of all living beings coexists between an unknowable amount of parallel universe, each one radically different than the last. When one dies, they are transferred to a parallel soul within another universe to live again. They were ostracized for these beliefs and left the desert for this island, upon which they created this temple as a waypoint for transferrence between different planes of existence. Using forbidden forms of magic, my creator conjured a portal within the circular structure beyond us and she and the rest of her people went inside, to the Great Unknown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their chairs, Davies sullenly crossed her arms while Anna scribbled wildly in her journal. She stopped writing and looked up. \"So, how would we go about reopening this portal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe djinn thought for a moment. \"First of all, you would need a very powerful sorceress. This magic is quite difficult to pull off. Second, you will need ingredients for a binding substance. The blood of a corpulent vampire. Eternal snow which does not melt. The seeds of a vato flower. Gorgon venom. Finally, the sweat of a princess. Enchanting this substance will allow you to open the portal in this room and follow the djinn to wherever they ended up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprising Anna, Davies rocketed up from her chair. \"We'll do it! But a wee price t' pay fer such massive wealth!\"</span></div></div>",

You may very likely perish, along with my master. Are you sure you're up to the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain grew closer to the djinn. \"O' course we be! I eat danger 'n peril fer breakfast! If anyone dares cross Captain Davies th' Derriere I'll sit on 'em 'til thar lungs give out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna also stood up. \"Well, it sounds like we're off on an adventure. You don't mind if you come with us, djinn? I could use your help and insight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be honored, master. Besides, what else is a girl to do? Sit down here alone until you get back?\" The two women laughed and started off before being interrupted by the djinn. \"Quickly, master, if you can I'd like to make a request of you. I do not have a name. You simply must give me one, else I cannot leave the building I was created in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna felt stupid. She sighed and apologized, \"Oh, I'm so sorry! I knew that rule but it must have slipped my mind.\" She thought for a moment, and then got an idea. \"How about Kayka, after the great Djinn scholar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"I would be honored, master.\" Just then, black tattoos appeared on both of the djinn's arms and around her waist. Anna recognized the tattoos as being words in the ancient script written on the back of the map that led her there. \"I am Kayka. Let us go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up the spiral staircase was much harder than going down it. When the trio eventually arrived at its top, the two mortals were panting and heaving, Davies much more so than Anna. It was a cakewalk for Kayka, who promptly conjured a glass of water for her master to drink. Davies saw this and was very interested yet incensed. She shouted, \"Hey! Why does she get a glass o' water? ...Can I get a glass o' water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka kept walking. \"I can conjure you anything you desire within reason, as long as master has no complaints.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Davies got her glass of water... and another glass of water... and a pitcher of mead... and a slice of pie... and the rest of the pie. By the time the party returned to the beach, the Captain was stuffed and tipsy, trying to rub her belly through its corset. She asked Anna, \"So wha' are we goin' t' do- *BOORP* first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna replied, \"We're getting the best sorceress in Yndyre to join us.

Within the ship, Anna, Captain Davies, and her pirate crew were having a large breakfast provided by their new djinn companion. Kayka's powers of conjuration were very much being abused by the women, but she didn't mind. Conjuration didn't take much energy and if master was happy, she was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna leaned back on the mess hall bench, her stomach more engorged than it's ever been in recent memory. She politely stifled a burp with her hand, excused herself, and said, \"Captain, I understand that you're excited about the circumstances, but don't you think we're indulging a little much? This is the third feast we've had since we've set sail and I don't know how much my poor stomach can take!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from her, the Captain dug deeply into a huge stack of pancakes, shoveling overloaded forkfuls into her maw. Mouth completely full, she reassured Anna as she chewed. \"MMMPH! Nonsense! We've got, mmnn, celebratin' t' do! Eat yer, mmmph, grub 'n stop complainin'. Now... *GULP* tell me about this sorceress we be goin' t' get. Wha's she like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gave herself a belly rub while she explained, \"Well, her name's Barri. She's a succubus that got kicked out of the succubus society for being too short.\" The Captain snorted, mouth too full of pancakes to laugh. Anna continued, \"Yes, she absolutely holds a grudge. Don't mention her height when you meet her, she'll probably kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, they were interrupted by Kayka silently plodding towards them, swinging her curvy hips. She sat down next to her master as she greeted her. \"Do you desire anything more, master? Perhaps some more pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna waved her hand, still clutching her stuffed tum. \"No, no, but it's much appreciated, Kayka. If I eat any more I think I'll pop.\" She paused for a second. \"You know, I think I have some questions for you, if it's not a bother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka chuckled and smiled at Anna's formality. \"It's never a bother, master. Ask me anything you please and I'll do my best to answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could ask anything, the Captain let loose an enormous belch, which was met with applause and cheers from the crew. She immediately went back to loudly stuffing her face. Anna looked at Kayka with all seriousness, keeping her voice down as she politely asked, \"Do you think we could go somewhere more quiet? The racket in here is starting to get to me.\" Kayka nodded. The two of them stood from their bench, Anna saying to the Captain, \"Excuse us, Captain Davies. We're going to retire to another room for some Q&amp;A.\" Davies didn't even respond, simply giving the duo a frantic nod as she continued to be immersed in her syrupy breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Anna's cabin, Kayka laid down on the bed as Anna opened up her journal for some note taking. She was a little lethargic from her feasting, but still excited to learn more about man-made djinn. \"So, the first thing I'd really like to know is what it was like to be stuck in a bottle for hundreds of years. How did you keep busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka stared at the ceiling, basking in her momentary rest. \"A lot of it was a blur for me. It felt more like fifteen minutes rather than 400 years. I guess I was just preparing myself for you to summon me, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked up from her book. \"No need to be so formal, Kayka! You don't need to call me master all the time. Call me Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe djinn turned her head on the pillow. \"As much as I'd like to grant your request, master, it's against the code. I must call you master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else is in the code?\" She went back to writing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we must be loyal to our master. We must obey our master no matter what. We cannot kill. The code cannot be altered, and it cannot be altered that the code cannot be altered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fairly boilerplate. Now, I have some questions about you specifically, Kayka. If I may ask, what's the significance of your accent? It's unlike any I've heard before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka laughed, orienting herself to her side, relaxed. \"My creator said she had visions of these people called 'southern belles'. She modeled my voice off the ones in her visions. Odd, I know. I have to resist the urge to call you 'sugar' all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna kept scribbling. \"Interesting... Now, I apologize if this question is too invasive, but I'd like to know about your body. You're a little chubbier than most alchemized djinn I've seen, and you have a belly button. I'm just curious as to why that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka put a hand on her thick hip. \"Well, my creator modeled me after herself, and she wasn't the thinnest person.\" She laughed again. \"As for my belly button... I'm not sure. Maybe my creator thought her belly button was an attractive trait and wanted to pass it down to me. Does it bother you, master? I can reform my body however you'd like. If you'd like, I could give myself genitalia and we could have sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna blushed. She wasn't expecting to be offered a fuck today. She stammered, \"Oh, n-no, thank you Kayka. You don't have to change anything about your body. I was just wondering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained casual. She stated, matter-of-factly \"That's perfectly alright, master. Just know that if you'd ever like to have sex with me, you can just ask. Pleasing you is my job, and we djinn are very good at pleasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna continued to blush. Jeez, she really wasn't expecting Kayka to be so... dirty. \"W-well, to change the subject, I'd finally like to ask about y-your magical abilities. What can you do? What can't you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We djinn are masters of conjuration spells, as you must have already seen. We can also use telekinesis to move objects and float, as well as long distance teleportation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna perked up. \"Long distance teleportation? Can you transport us directly to the sorcerer's guild at Adinah?\" As much as Anna would enjoy travelling with the Captain and her crew the couple months it would normally take to get back to her home city, she was thinking of her stomach. With the way they've been eating, she'd be as big as a house by the time they got back to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can transport you, master. It just takes great energy to do it, and I don't have that kind of energy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna leaned forward. \"How can we get you to that energy level?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, a plan was formulated between Anna and the Captain. The pirates would raid the next trade ship they came across for its sustenance, as simply having Kayka conjure herself food is against the code, they'd use that sustenance to power up the djinn with calories, and then ask her to transport them directly to the Sorcerer's Guild in Adinah so they can pick up Barri and begin their journey for real. Davies had no objections as she rested herself between feasts, barely keeping her eyes open. The mass quantities of food sat heavily and uneasily in her corset-imprisoned stomach. As much as she enjoyed the act of sea travel, she wanted her gold as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the pirate ship finally came across a merchant cargo ship. At Anna's request and much to their chagrin, the pirates were to take a non-lethal approach to their raid. After they boarded, they threatened the luckily inexperienced crew with drownings, shootings, and evenings under the Captain's deadly posterior. This was enough to do it, though one sailor was taken prisoner by his own request and the Captain's permission to be kept in her cabin for whatever fun she may desire. Despite the circumstances, the sailor seemed happy to be there and the Captain seemed more than happy to have him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the ship, the pirates seized multiple crates of shark jerky. Yeah, this ship must have just traded with merpeople. Anna didn't want Kayka to waste any of the calories she may eat, so they set her up on some pillows in the mess hall as comfortable as possible. She would lay there as the Anna and the crew fed her mass amounts of jerky. Djinn like Kayka didn't normally eat, so the experience was quite a special one for her. The jerky was delicious: salty, tough, and oh so flavorful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stood by with her notebook, observing. This aspect of djinn anatomy fascinated her. Kayka's body was immediately digesting and storing all the calories she was taking in as fat. Anna and the crew watched as the djinn's belly pudged out, her nippleless breasts chunked up, her arms and legs grew tubbier, her face filled out, and her hips expanded below her. By the time she had finished the beef jerky, it was like she doubled her weight, something met with total disinterest by her like it was a fact of life. She looked at Anna, speaking her first words since she began the ordeal, \"Master, are you ready to transport? I believe I have enough energy stored to get us across the entire continent.\" She slapped her bigger belly for emphasis, blue fat rippling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna took a breath in deeply, preparing herself. \"Alright.\" She turned to one of the crew members. \"Could you go retrieve Captain Davies? She's been up in her room for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, the crew member returned with the Captain. She was disheveled and sweaty, smelling of sex. Her mouth was covered in barbeque sauce and her scantily clad ass sported a red hand-shaped mark upon its right cheek. Anna greeted her with a snide remark. \"Having fun with your new friend from the other boat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was out of breath, obviously just having the time of her life. \"Oh, ayyyyye. He's a wildman, let me tell ye. *OOOOUUURP!* He's a sucker fer me big bum. Ye know, I've ne'er met someone that actually likes bein' smothered under me afore.\" She took a load off on a bench, eyes scanning the much fatter Kayka. She licked some of the sauce from her lips, exclaiming, \"She looks like she jus' ate a mammoth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka spoke to her from the other side of the room, not moving from her supine position. \"I believe I just ate about 147 pounds of shark jerky, Captain. It was delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stepped in before the inevitable conversation on the merits of shark jerky could begin. \"Kayka, if you will, could you transport us to the sorcerer's guild in Adinah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka touched her belly lightly. \"Of course, master. This might be a little bumpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light filled the mess hall, and...</span></div></div>",

'tis a bit odd.\" Captain Davies was awed as she and her crew were hauled off by royal guards. Anna and Kayka manged to escape with some help and were currently hiding in an alley diagonal from where the pirate ship crashed from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly the transportation spell was a success. Perhaps a bit too much of a success. Instead of transporting just the trio of novice adventurers, Kayka ended up moving the pirate ship, its entire crew, a few hundred gallons of seawater, and some stray marine life with them. The payload ended up smashing into a guard post in the middle of the city as well, which may have been the least lucky place they could have landed. Kayka was extraordinarily apologetic, almost in tears crying to her shellshocked master. She had lost almost all of the weight she gained back on the boat, having used all that energy for the great spell. \"I'm so sorry master! I must have eaten too much jerky! I couldn't control my powers! Could you ever forgive me? What can I do to make it up to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at her journal, stoicly scribbling notes on the past few minutes. She reassured Kayka, \"It's- it's okay Kayka. We're all okay. Once we find Barri we just have to break Captain Davies out of prison. It shouldn't be too hard with a sorceress of her caliber on our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka continued bawling, wrapping her blue arms around the elf. \"Anything you desire, master, I will do. I feel so bad! I hope Captain Davies will forgive me. I hope she doesn't hold it against me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna eased her off of her. \"It's okay, Kayka. It's really okay. We need to focus on finding Barri now. Come on, I think I know where she is.\" She took Kayka by the wrist and began to drag her along in a direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hungry Harpie: misspelled on purpose. Perhaps one of Adinah's seediest saloons, populated by miscreants and malingerers looking to get a little drunk, cheat at cards, and talk their way into a quick fuck. It was happy hour here at the bar, and Anna knew Barri never missed a single one. The elf and her companion stuck out like a sore thumb among the rough men and women drinking that afternoon. They drew some stares, but for the most part the population was too occupied with their vices to bother caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pushing their way through the crowd and copious smoke from pipes and cigars, they found their girl, liplocked with an obese satyr, rubbing her immense belly sensually. This was typical for Barri: chubby chasing was one of her many quirks. After noticing Anna's timid wave from across the room, Barri broke from her kiss and pushed past the fat girl, quickly making her way to her friend. She really was a tiny little thing of 5 foot nothing, but she more than made up for her small stature with her looks: perky, full breasts, a rounded butt, a perfectly flat stomach, and the chiseled face of a model with plump lips and striking green eyes. She was almost never seen in public in anything but her jet black underwear, which skimpily clung to her curves and contrasted nicely with her deep red skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small succubus went in for a hug, burying her face in Anna's conservatively dressed bosom. She was very happy to see her. She called out in her posh succubic accent, her surprisingly throaty and bassy but still incredibly feminine voice resonating, \"Anna! My dear! It's been so long since I last saw you! How are you???\" She turned her attention to Kayka, still hugging. She gave a wink as she asked, \"And who's your... beautiful blue friend here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna didn't expect to be hugged, let alone so tightly. \"Haha, it's- it's good to s-see you too, Barri. That's Kayka. She's a djinn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke from the embrace. \"Ohhoho. I hear djinn are GREAT in bed. I've never had the pleasure to lay one before.\" She extended her hand to Kayka for a shake. \"I'm Barri. Sorceress of love. You can have me for free anytime, cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was embarrassed this was happening, even though her djinn seemed to be enjoying it. She blushed, stammering, \"Alright, e-enough flirting you guys. Haha. We really have something serious to talk about with you, Barri. Can we go somewhere quiet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention back to Anna. \"Oh, somewhere quiet you say?~ I'm sorry Anna, but you're not my type. Put on a hundred pounds and we'll talk.\" She heard this joke from Barri before, but she still blushed even harder. \"Sure. Let's go over in the other room, friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we need to rescue this girl from the royal jail and then find these five components, and then we can have all these riches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the mission. Do you want to join? You'd be a great asset. And I can't think of a better sorceress to help.\" Anna and Kayka sat opposite of the succubus, who cracked a peanut on her nubby horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to think long. \"You know I'll do it, dear. I still owe you for the jam you got me out of back in the north. Now, how are we gonna break this girl out of prison? That place is locked down tighter than a virgin kitsune's pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was delighted. \"First of all, thank you Barri. You'll be rewarded greatly for this. Second, I'm not really sure. Do you have any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri lounged back in her chair, absentmindedly opening another peanut on her horn. \"Well, I was thinking we could...</span></div></div>",

Bars bustled, royal guards roamed the streets roughing up drunkards, and good citizens laid sweaty in their beds, trying to sleep in such awful heat. In a small jail cell, Captain Davies sat uncomfortably on a bale of hay, untrustworthy of the dinky, flimsy stool that was provided to her. She had been sadly separated from her crew and put into special accomodations for the time being, as the guardsmen felt that if she were able to coordinate with her usual scoundrels in general population she could perhaps organize a jailbreak. So, she was alone in the single cell in a shack out behind the jail. Guarding her were two lightly armored men whose names she didn't know. One was a redhead and the other was bald,  so they became \"Ginger\" and \"Baldy\" to her in her complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of complaints, Davies' corsetted belly was whining and crying to her non-stop. After her constant binging back on the ship, her body had sort of gotten used to very large portions, and large portions were not what she was given today. The only things put into her stomach today was a bowl of porridge and some cups of water. Quite a shock. After a particularly large tummy grumble, Davies looked up at the cell ceiling in exasperation, calling out to her captors, \"Oi! Guards! I really needs some grub in me! Cannah ye hear me belly o'er here? I be gonna starve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaldy sat at a desk, silently whittling something from a wood block. A few feet away, Ginger leaned up against the wall, half asleep. Her demands woke him up somewhat, to which he replied in a gruff voice, \"Quiet, jailbird. You'll get oatmeal in the morning. Sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain was unsatisfied, clearly. \"We strumpets o' th' sea cannah jus' sleep on an empty stomach, Ginger. We needs somethin' in our gullet other than farrgin' oat slop. Protein! Vitamins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaldy chimed in. \"Then don't sleep. Stay up all night, we don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies crossed her arms and sighed. Jail sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething like 10 minutes later, there was a knock at the door. Despite its suddenness, both hardened guards weren't startled, as Ginger pulled it open. On the other side was a beautiful girl in a royal guard uniform that he didn't recognize. Whatever. Must be a new recruit or something. She carried a brown paper bag. Ginger asked, \"Yes? What's this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl coughed and replied in a nervous, vaguely northern accent, \"Oh, I'm here from Captain Baker, sir. He bought all the night guards bagels as a thank you for your service. Here.\" She extended the bag to Ginger, which he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Tell Baker thanks as well. Have a good night.\" He shut the door and carried the bag to the desk where Baldy was. \"Did you hear that? Baker got us bagels.\" He opened the bag, pulled out a delicious looking bagel, examined its sesame seeds, and took a bite. Baldy did the same, savoring the bready flavor. Davies watched on in her cell, incredibly jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the guards finished their bagels, something happened. Davies felt words appearing in her thoughts, like intrusions. They weren't full sentences, no, just the words \"flirt\" and \"seduce\" materializing in her brain. Then, she caught a glimpse of both guards ogling her before they turned their views away inconspicuously. Hmm. Davies wasn't the smartest person in the world, but she certainly wasn't dumb. She put two and two together: Anna found the sorceress and she gave the guards enchanted bagels to help perform a prison break. Yes! She could probably get them to let her go if she used her... feminine charm on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies got up and approached the bars, leaning her face into the hole between them. Both guards were avoiding contact. She tried putting on her best sexy voice, but her flirtations still came out in a pirate drawl. \"Yoo-hoo! Guaaaards!~ I reckon me wee booty might be gettin' scratched up by this nasty hay I've been sittin' on. Can ye lads check fer me? Th' last thin' I wants are unsightly marks on me cute bum here.\" She proceeded to turn around and squish her vast bottom against the cell door, fat and soft flesh pudging through the gaps. She turned her head backwards and sexily bit her lip as she confirmed that the guards' gaze was exactly where she wanted. She rubbed it up and down, the metal slightly squeaking against her mostly bare cheeks. \"Soooo? Do ye lads see anythin'? Ye can come 'n take a closer look if ye wants, I don't bite unless ye wants me t'~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaldy stammered without managing to utter a single word, so Ginger, flustered, did the talking. \"I-I, uh, I don't see anything miss, uh, prisoner. Lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried her best fake cute giggle and cooed, \"Ohhhhh, that's good then. Like I said, I don't wants any scratches or scrapes on me perfect arse.\" She could practically hear the blood vessels in their head snap as she moved away from the bars to give her cheeks a sultry smack. \"Say, do ye two wants t' touch?~ I don't let jus' anyone grope 'n grab this buttmeat but since ye're both so cute I'll let ye 'ave some fun wit' me out behind th' buildin'. In th' dark. So no one can see...\" She wiggled her hips, jiggling her aforementioned buttmeat. Gods, she hoped this would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards looked at each other briefly and bugged out their eyes. They didn't even need to discuss it. Baldy fumbled with the keys on the desk and handed them to Ginger to do the unlocking. Davies couldn't see his crotch below the desk, but she was certain he was trying to hide a raging erection. As soon as he unlocked the cell door, Davies slunk out, took him in her arms and planted her lips to his. Yuck. She didn't wanna kiss this guy, but she had to stay in character. Anything to get out of this fuckin' jail. Speaking of things she didn't want to do, she moved her hand down to Ginger's groin, squeezing the large bulge in his pants. She moaned into his ear, \"Oh, so ye're nice 'n big, are ye? Are ye big enough t' handle all this woman? 'ave ye ever pleased a lass wit' a gigantic arse afore, Ginger?\" Davies looked over at Baldy, who was trying not to blow a gasket. \"How about ye, Baldy? I hear scallywags without hair 'ave big dicks. This true?\" He stammered again. Jeez, good thing he wasn't talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies took both of the guards by their wrists, practically dragging them out the door. \"Here, lads, let's go outside. Ye can take turns gettin' squeezed by me big cheeks.\" Once they were out the door and into the humid exterior, rounding the jail shack, she waited nervously for the moment of truth. And it came! Behind her she heard two dull metal clangs and felt the guards fall limp onto the ground. She looked back and saw a short demon girl holding a shovel, flanked by Anna and Kayka! She breathed a sigh of relief. \"Oh, thank th' Gods ye poppets came t' save me. I really didn' wants t' 'ave sex wit' those pigs.\" She turned her attention to the girl with the shovel. \"I assume ye're Jerry? Th' sorceress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sized up the caramel cutie before her. The Captain looked like she'd be tons of fun for the fat-loving sorceress. \"Barri. I'd love to do our introductions but we really can't stick around here. Judging by all that marvelous fat on your rump, you must be a girl that likes to eat. How about a bite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Davies' belly rumbled. \"Ye read me mind. I could eat a horse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri smiled. \"Say no more. Kayka, if you'd be so kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka looked like she just ate a pie or three. \"My pleasure, Miss Barri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a flash, they were gone, leaving the two horny guards alone and unconscious on the ground. Great success.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the Hungry Harpie, a large-chested barmaid escorts the reunited party into a private back room. Barri slips a few bucks into her cleavage as a tip. \"Thanks for the accommodation, Jayla. We've gotta lay low right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayla nods. \"Anything for our most valuable customer! Now, what can I get you girls?\" She pulled out a little notebook and a pen as the four sat down at a table, Anna next to Kayka and Barri next to Davies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri started off. \"First, I'd like to buy me and these lovely ladies a round. Big pitchers, please. Extra bubbly, if you could. As for food, I'd just like a salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayla looked at the Captain. She was caught off guard. There wasn't even a menu! \"Uh, wha's good here? I've ne'er been afore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the barmaid could answer with a recommendation, Barri cut in confidently. \"Put her down for a house special, darling. On me. Actually, get all three of these lovely ladies the house special, but make this girl's special EXTRA special. She's practically wasting away, Jayla!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and Kayka had no complaints. They didn't even know what the house special was, but if Barri was buying, they didn't care. Anna shyly nodded in approval. Jayla was satisfied. \"Okay, two house specials, an extra special special, a salad, and a round of beer coming right up, ladies!\" With that, she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna leaned forward on the bench and asked in her little voice, \"So, Captain, how did jail treat you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quick to grumble. \"Like shite! I be so thankful ye three got me outta thar. I was goin' t' break down at any second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka giggled at the word \"shite\". \"Don't thank us, Captain, thank Barri here. The whole plan was her idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Barri, sounds like I owe ye a serious favor in repayment. That was th' Gods' work right thar!\" She put a chubby arm around the girl beside her. \"Now, if only ye could rescue me crew, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that might be too much of a feat, my friend. If I think of something I'll let you know, but that might be beyond my power level.\" Davies looked disappointed, but she kept her arm around the succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************<br>\r\nAn hour later...<br>\r\n***************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house special: an entire turkey, roast and seasoned. A chicken pot pie. A mound of mashed potatoes and gravy. Davies had gotten the extra special version, which got her the biggest turkey of the bunch, loaded up with hunger enhancers and aphrodisiacs in the kitchen, courtesy of Barri. She had demolished the whole thing, and now was reluctantly being pushed into dessert. She was drunk, she was stuffed, and she was horny. Barry was standing up and leaning over her, cheese danish in her hand. \"Come on, Captain. You can't be full already! This little danish wants in! Don't you wanna let him in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies groaned. \"Ohhhhhh... HUORP. As much as I wants t', I don't reckon I canORRRRP... eat another bite... Me belly be soooo fullllll... URRRRP. BUUURP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I reckon that the problem here is how you've got this damned corset on. Take it off! Make some room!\" Barri edged the danish closer to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation was too much. Davies cautiously took a little bite of the danish. Shit, it was delicious. \"Mmmph... Fine... But ye hafta... OOOUUURRRLP! Ye hafta undo it. URP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and Kayka were watching this unfold from the other side of the table. Anna had long since been finished with her food, unable to fully clean her plate. Her stomach was engorged and round, like she just ate a watermelon. Kayka, however, finished her entire spread, looking a little chubbier all around as a result. Food didn't quite phase her, so she was curious about the mortal stomach's capacity and all the weird, deep, guttural sounds that Davies was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Barri struggled with corset laces and Davies belched her heart out, Anna finally spoke up. \"Ladies, I know you're having fun, but can we concentrate on the journey ahead for a moment? We need to know where we're going and how to find these things. Don't forget that Captain Davies is a wanted woman and we're going to have to hoof it out of here by the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri didn't look up from her task, grunting in frustration. \"Go ahead and talk. I'm listening.\" After Davies burped an especially long and loud burp, she patted her on the head from behind and brought her voice up an octave. \"Oh, that was maaaarvelous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna fidgeted. \"Uh, so. Urrp. Excuse me. We have five components of the solution we need to get. We need to figure out where to get each one and decide a route. We should go as efficiently as possible. Let's start at the top.\" She took out her journal, dog-earing the page she turned to. \"Corpulent vampire blood. Obviously, Racovania is an idea. Lots of the vampires up there are pretty plump. The only problem would be getting into that circle and getting the- urrrp. Excuse me. The blood. There's also Jorogumo and Lamia, but it might be even more difficult to convince one of them to give blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri looked over. \"Yeah, I feel like getting the blood of a Stranken might be as simple as exchanging favors. I've nailed a couple of those ladies in the past and hoo boy, they were some kinky, greedy bastards. Might end up being a pretty extensive favor.\" She turned her attention back to the corset. \"Keep holding on there, Captain, I'm almost done.\" She responded with another burp and a clearly sexual moan. Anna blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so next is the snow. Really our only option there is to go way up north to the tundra. I hear there are ancient ice temples there, but I've never seen one. We can probably find the non-melting snow in one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka had a concern. \"Master, how will we know the snow is truly eternal if we find it in an already cold place? I've been told of places in the East that have snow where there shouldn't be snow. We might have better luck there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed. \"Good point. We'll cross that bridge when we get there, I suppose. Next is the vato flower seed. I honestly have no idea what a vato flower is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure either, master. I only know the name of the plant. Perhaps we can ask a horticulturalist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded. \"Okay. Gorgon venom is easy: we'll have to go to Sarkos for that, but we'll also need to figure out some kind of way in and protection. Hmm. And then princess sweat. Barri, you should know this. Where are there princesses in Yndyre?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri's eyes lit up, finally turning her attention away from the needlessly complex corset strings. \"Oh, you know I know. Adinah obviously, Spekkfitu, Ookh, Futtota-Machi, Samin, Motee, and Dew-Drop Forest. Those are all the places that still have monarchies and I know they all had princesses at some point. Let me know when it's time to get sweaty.\" She winked, turning her attention back to the drunk girl, who was humming a tune and touching her loins lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I guess we should start with either the Snow, the Blood, or the Princess since we need additional information for all those other ones. Any-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was interrupted by a cartoonish sight. Barri had finally gotten the corset off. After having it removed, Davies let out a deep breath, extending her shockingly large pot belly with a comical GA-LUNK and slosh. She rested a hand on her caramel-colored belly, finally free of its prison. What an incredible relief. \"UUUUUUURRRHHHP! OOORRRRUUUUUUUUUUP! FUCK! ORRRP! Gods that was sexy. Barri... HORP! Rub me tum. I needs dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri rested her head on the taut, burgeoning belly before her, listening to the food and beer digest inside. \"Anna and Kayka, you might need to leave us alone for a few. I think we're going to have a moment.\" As the two hastily got up and headed for the door, they heard a conversation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Captaaain?\"<br>\r\n\"URRRRP. Aye?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you see how the horns on the top of my head are blunted down rather than sharpened?\"<br>\r\n\"Aye.\"<br>\r\n\"Would you like to know why?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Because when I got women with humongous, beautiful bums like yours to smother me before, they'd complain about being poked.\"<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... Be that a challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the room before they could hear any more.</span></div></div>",

She and Kayka leaned on a wooden fence at the edge of town, waiting for Davies and Barri to make an appearance. Kayka stared out at the sun rising over the wheat fields in the distance, then turned her attention back to Anna, still transfixed on her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got her attention. \"Oh, uh, y-yes Kayka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay? You seem distracted this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed, disappointed. \"I just think I put on a little weight, is all. I used to be pretty plump as a girl so I have some body image issues. Must be the Captain's influence rubbing off on me, bringing me back to my old ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, master. I know we aren't incredibly close yet, but I would be devoted to you no matter what size you are if that means anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to poking her stomach through her shirt. \"Yeah, but you have to do that anyway. It's in the djinn code.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka loosened up and relaxed even more against the fence. \"I guess what I mean is that I don't judge. That's what I'm here for, master. I know I'm not the most fit person in the world, but if you need a personal trainer I'll help you drop any unwanted pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked her in the eyes. \"Thank you, Kayka. It means a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Barri and Davies finally appeared. Davies had been hastily disguised in concealing religious clothing. She was even wearing pants. The only part of her face visible were her eyes, which looked unhappy that she was showing so little skin. Barri walked beside her, a total opposite. Her red skin glistened in the rising sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna called out. \"Hey you two! Did you have fun last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri responded with confidence. \"Oh, we certainly did. I don't think I've been crushed between a more wonderful pair of thighs.\" She turned her head to the Captain beside her. \"Alright, we're out of town now, love. You can disrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies' eyes breathed a sigh of relief as she stripped off her disguise, revealing her typical outfit underneath. Somehow she managed to redo her corset, which was back to where it was around her waist. She muttered, \"Oh, thank th' heavens. I hate these gods damned clothes.\" She quickly changed her tune. \"Ahoy me mateys! Are ye all ready fer an adventure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka smirked. \"It sounds like you already had a pretty fun adventure last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know ye're tryin' t' embarrass me, but jus' know that if ye ever wants a piece o' this wide load ye can 'ave it. This arse needs as much love as it can get!\" She smugly put her hands to her now bare butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri seemed to approve of this. \"Oh, same goes for me. I've never fucked a blue babe like you before, I'd love to see what it's like. Perhaps a threesome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, the blushing prude she was, diverted the conversation. \"S-so guys. Where are w-we going? What are we, uh... What are we gonna do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri looked a little confused. \"Aren't you the leader of this journey? What do YOU think we should start with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stared down at her feet briefly. \"Shit, uh... How about we start with...</span></div></div>",

Let's go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri licked her lips. \"Great! I've been meaning to pay those Strankens a visit anyway. Let's set off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Anna, Captain Davies, Barri, and Kayka began their journey to the mountains in the distance. As they were on foot, this journey might take a little bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grobland Plains seemed to stretch on and on, a veritable sea of crops ripe for the harvest, which should be starting any minute now. The Overvektige mountain range, their destination, loomed on the northern horizon, tantalizingly teasing the party; so close yet so far. Every day they grew nearer, however, and so the party kept on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sparse wood encased the foot of the hills which because the mountains, and this was where the party made their camp a week into the journey. They were in the home stretch, Racovania was only but a couple days away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark trees hung around the campfire, which burned with a comforting heat thanks to Kayka's magic. Also thanks to Kayka, the group had been maintaining their weights. They munched on dinner around the fire, a conjured mass of chicken which had been browned and fried and seasoned in a way that none of the women had seen before. But it was absolutely delicious. Despite the strain and exercise of walking such a far distance, the generous caloric intake from Kayka's meals prevented any weight from being shed. In fact, Anna could have sworn she'd gained a few more pounds, but she wouldn't dare say it. She tried to nap on the forest floor, but her upset tummy from the chicken kept her awake. Kayka, who didn't need sleep, was off in the woods somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Davies tore into a chicken breast with her teeth, savoring the brown, crunchy skin, grease coating the margins of her lips. Like every night, she binged with the vigor of a woman who hadn't eaten in a month. \"Mmm... So Barri. I've got a riddle fer ye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A riddle? What are you talking about?\" She rubbed her taut stomach. Despite her small size and thin stature, she was a big eater. Need energy for sexual escapades somehow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we pirates say riddle. Ye lubbers must reckon I be gonna ask ye some kinda... URP. Some kinda \"wha''s th' difference between a cat 'n a bundle o' firewood\" kinda shit, right? I jus' got a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you should have just said! What's your question? I'm an open book, love.\" She muffled a dainty, cute little belch with her hand and excused herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies kept messily ripping into her chicken, no regard for decent table manners or feminine standards. \"Ye like em chunky, don't ye? Girls wit' meat on thar bones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't it obvious, dear?\" She leaned in smugly. \"You know how it was to fuck me! You think a woman who likes stick thin peasants would fondle your flab the way I did? That someone with 'normal' tastes would savor your fat ass as much as I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was jus' makin' sure. Ye ne'er know wit' scallywags nowadays. They smack yer arse 'n then tell ye t' lose weight. Madness.\" She finished her current morsel and chucked the clean bone onto a pile behind her, reaching for another plump drumstick and digging in. \"Mmmmm, fuck, this chicken be great... Anyw- UOORP! Anyway. That wasn't me riddle, er, question. I wanna know wha' yer fattest lay was 'n wha' 'twas like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri chuckled. \"Oh, I've been wanting to answer this question for a looong time. Thank you dearly for asking.\" She picked herself up from her seat and moved over to the log where Davies had been planting her wide load. She sat down next to her, placing a tiny hand gently and sensuously on a gargantuan thigh. \"A number of years ago I was the personal servant for a human noblelady in Adinah. She was quite fat when I entered her service, a good 500 or 600 pounds, which is very much my size. Her belly was this giant thing which she loved very much. I'd rub it and squeeze it for her whenever she asked. It made her incredibly horny when I touched it, it was a very sensitive area for her. As I continued in her service, she grew and grew and grew into this great blob of fat. She could no longer move on her own. I had to bathe her and help her use the toilet and all that. It was quite unpleasant, love. You never want to be that big, it's humiliating. But the fucking... it was odd. I was like a grain of sand compared to her then, it was like I could swim in her fat rolls. Every time I ate her out I couldn't stop thinking about that time when she was still mobile. It turned into a one-sided relationship, you know? I did all the work and she laid there like the boulder she was. I had to resign my position, it just wasn't fulfilling anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies had long since stopped chowing down and listened thoughtfully to Barri's story. When it ended, she took another bite of her chicken and said, \"Aye, that sounds rougher than I was expectin'. I thought this would be a fun tale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri moved herself onto the Captain's lap and kissed her deeply on the lips. \"It was a good lesson for me and one I pass down to beautiful fatties like yourself whenever I can. Don't get too wrapped up in pleasure because that pleasure might end up being your downfall. There's a difference between being a hedonist like myself and someone who lets that hedonism dominate themselves. Keep yourself and love yourself. That's all I have to say.\" She kissed her again and dismounted. \"I'm going to bed. Take off your corset and spoon me. I wanna feel that fat gut of yours rumble against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies threw away the bone she had just polished. \"But I be still starvin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri grinned. \"Then come join me when you're full. A stuffed belly is a happy belly.\" She went off to her spot and curled up on a blanket by the fire. Tonight, she'd dream of meat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Racovania was a gloomy place, even during the day. Hardly a bustling metropolis, what would be a quaint little town of commonfolk in any other location was recontextualized by the things that loomed around it: drooping, dense trees, ever-steepening mountainous crag, and a series of ornate, gothic castles in the middle distance. The residents of Racovania took it for granted that the denizens of those castles watched their every move, lurking in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party snagged a couple of rooms at the town's inn and waited for nightfall, snacking idly on Kayka's conjured food because there really wasn't much else to do. Then, at sunset, Anna and Barri left their other two party members at the inn so as not to overwhelm their mark and went together to a specific castle in the distance, one belonging to an old friend of Barri's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri's short stature made it difficult for her to reach the already high up door knockers on the vast gate that stood before them, so Anna reluctantly did it for her. She was admittedly a bit skittish about this whole \"ask a vampire for some of their blood\" thing, but under the circumstances she just had to grin and bear it. The knock reverberated through the stone of the castle's interior, and soon enough they were greeted by a rather tall, gaunt butler with a sharp fashion sense and a wispy voice. He held a burning candlebra near his face. \"May I assist you ladies?\" he asked in a friendly tone. Hey, maybe vampires aren't as hostile as they seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Anna could stammer her way through an introduction, Barri spoke up. \"Yes, we're here to see Miss Zeena Stranken. I'm an old friend of hers. Could you tell her Barri is here for a visit and a favor?\" The butler nodded his head slowly and grunted so as to say \"one moment please\" and gently closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting outside the castle door, Anna nervously started a conversation. \"So, Barri, what's your relationship with this Zeena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri giggled. \"Oh, we made an incredible team a long while ago. I helped her fatten up some gals so she could feed better. Did you know that the more weight a girl has on her, the better her blood tastes? At least, that's what I've been told. Blood drinking doesn't get my rocks off, you know that.\" She giggled again. Gulp. This did little to soothe Anna's discomfort. She had only read about vampiric practices, it was another thing to know they're right around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butler returned shortly after, waving the duo inside. The entry hall was cavernous, dotted inconsistently by golden spots of candlelight. The red carpet below them smelled of dust, and cobwebs hung across the stone walls. Beautiful, massive paintings of landscapes adorned these walls, their beauty somewhat obscured by the dismal lighting conditions. The butler lead the two down a few halls and up a spiral staircase until they reached the sitting room of the Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there she was. Sitting in an ornate red velvet chair at the head of the room was Zeena Stranken. Her face was just about as traditionally beautiful as Barri's, with high cheekbones and plump, red lips that contrasted well with her dull grey skin. Her long, jet black hair hung down behind her. She wore a tight black dress that accentuated her thin but curvy figure, its deep v showing off an ample amount of cleavage between her round breasts. She crossed her skinny legs in the chair, one of her hands holding a paperback book and in the other a goblet presumably filled with blood. She took a sip and looked up at Barri and Anna, eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooo!\" Her voice was higher and bubblier than her gothic demeanor suggested. \"Barri, it's been so long since I've seen you! You haven't changed a bit!\" She rose from her seat and shuffled over to the two on her high heels. Standing up, she was a bit tall, maybe 6 foot 1 or 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went in for a hug, lifting up the little succubus with ease. Anna began taking notes in her book. Jeez, vampires be strong. Barri was clearly in a death grip as she groaned, \"It's, urrrg, wonderful to see you too, Zeena. Let me... nnnn... go... please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeena put her down and apologized. \"Oh, I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget my own strength.\" She laughed a high pitched laugh that gave off more \"pretty princess\" vibes than \"vampire mistress of the dark\" vibes. She took another sip from her goblet. \"So, who's your friend with the notebook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked up from her notes. \"Oh, I-I'm Anna. I'm from the Archaeological Society in Adinah. Me and Barri go waaay back, haha. I actually helped her out of a major jam back in the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri friendily backed her up. \"Oh, it was quite the jam. I'll have to tell you about it sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeena clapped her hands together. \"So, shall we go down to the den and catch up? Discuss this favor Mr. Smith mentioned to me? I would offer you something to eat, but unless you want some blood, I don't think I have anything.\" She giggled again, leading the duo down the stairs with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe den was nice and cozy. Comfy chairs, a fireplace, bookshelves, a bearskin rug, a mounted deer head, it had it all. Zeena sat sideways on an armchair, legs draped over the arm. She looked at the two girls, who sat opposite of her on a sofa. They had just finished telling her the story of their journey and what they needed from her. She nodded her head and smiled, showing off her fangs. \"I think I can help you, but you know I'll need something in return. Favor for favor, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri leaned forward ominously. \"Did you have anything in mind, Zeena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeena thought for a moment, her words turning sour. \"I need you to get back at my sister for me. Layla. That vain bitch. Remember that belly I got when I was with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri sat back, Anna taking notes on the sidelines. \"Oh, I was wondering where that went. You looked sooooo much better with it, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her voice to a raspy whisper. \"You know I agree! But that bitch ratted me out to everyone after she saw me! I had to lose it or be persona non grata with my family!\" She looked around the room, to check if anybody was listening. \"That's where you come in. I need you to get her fat. Really fat. We both know how good you are at expanding waistlines. Make her into a blood-guzzling piggy and you can have a direct line into my arteries.\" She extended a hand to Barri. \"Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarri shook Zeena's hand. \"It's a deal.\"</span></div></div>",

Hogwash. They weren't THAT fat! Either way, these two were bored. So very bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss master. I hope she's alright.\" Kayka crossed her arms across her chest, worried. Davies glared at her. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha's wit' this master thin'? Ye tryin' t' bang her or somethin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kayka cleared her throat. \"I'm simply devoted to her. It's the djinn code! I'll do anything she pleases. If she wishes to have sex with me, I will gladly do so. We djinn are no strangers to performing sexual favors for our masters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Davies stood up from her bed and stretched, wanting to change the subject. She didn't wanna hear about weird djinn sex stuff right now. \"Let's go outside 'n find somethin' t' do. I wants some peasants t' ogle me booty. Come on.\" The Captain exited the room, followed by Kayka, who dashed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood on the dirt road in the center of town. Townsfolk plodded past, without as much as the bat of an eye. This was not alleviating anything. \"This place sucks.\" Davies looked desparately around for anything at all. \"Ahoy, peasant scallywags! Look! Fat arse!\" She loudly smacked her left cheek, which drew no attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old bearded man in rags passing by looked at the very large ass and the moderately sized blue booty in front of him and said to their owners in a gravelly voice, \"Put those unsightly mounds away, you wenches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man kept walking, Davies frustratedly called out to him, \"Hey! Ye wanna see unsightly? I'll show ye unsightly when I crush yer windpipe!\" The man paid no mind to her threat, leaving the two women just standing there awkwardly. \"'tis naught like th' high seas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacovania was a maze of one boring dirt road lined with cottages after another. Wandering about, Davies and Kayka didn't really know whether they had passed this area before. The pirate talked the djinn's ear off as they walked around about one thing or another: sea adventures, epic plunders, scurvy dogs she'd made suffer between her buttocks, the usual for her. She was in the middle of a story about a frozen food ship she robbed and the overindulgent ice cream feast that followed it when something made her stop in her tracks and sniff. \"Do ye smell that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka looked around, trying to see what she was referring to. \"My nose doesn't work too well, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I smell somethin' godsdamned delightful.\" Davies kept sniffing around the area like a dog looking for a treat until she settled on a specific cottage a little bit down the road. She knocked on the door and no one answered. Frustrated, she turned to Kayka. \"I needs t' get in here. I be goin' t' lockpick this, be me lookout.\" Kayka wordlessly obliged, looking back and forth while Davies bent her chubby ass over the doorknob, very soon managing to open the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies and Kayka gently moved into the great-smelling, surprisingly big house to find the reason for its scent: tables and tables of freshly baked, heavily frosted, generously constructed, multi-layer cakes. Chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, cheese and carrot, it was all there. Davies had never seen anything like this before, in all her years of grub plunderin'. This was incredible. She stood with her jaw hanging open, eyes glazed over at the sight. \"Kayka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sight didn't quite phase the djinn. \"Yes, Captain Davies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needs ye t' close 'n lock this door. 'n conjure me a lot o' ale. I reckon we jus' found somethin' t' do.\" Davies expertly removed her corset, freeing her pudgy pot belly. She almost never did this. She meant business.</span></div></div>",

You don't want to get caught, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're the one in uniform and I'm invisible doing my magic. Don't worry, I'll still be there with you. Don't panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and Barri were crouched behind a bush near the castle of Layla Stranken, the bitch they were tasked with bloating. Barri lathered herself up with an invisibility potion while Anna had already changed into the bright, anachronistic uniform of a food courier: a red cap, red t-shirt, khaki pants, and sensible shoes. She didn't quite understand the fashion sense of the clothes but she didn't feel like questioning it; they were a lot more comfortable than her frilly, belty normal outfit. Also behind the bush was a wagon, nicely stocked with delightful looking food made to taste like blood, perfect for a vampire who doesn't typically indulge in the cuisine of mortals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had become completely invisible, Barri cleared her throat to give Anna the signal. She dragged the wagon across the moat bridge and pensively knocked on the wooden castle door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a small wait, the door ominously opened by itself with a low creak. Nervously, Anna stepped inside followed by the wagon, calling out \"Hello?\" a few times. The entry hall was not unlike the hall at Zeena's castle, a tall, dark, cavernous room that reverberated with every sound. It smelled like cobwebs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, lights turned on and illuminated a grand red staircase at the head of the room. Travelling down it was someone who had to be Layla. Her appearance was much \"trendier\" than the classicly gothic look of Zeena. Her black hair was short and bob-cut, her bangs hiding her forehead. Her stunningly beautiful face was heavily done up with make-up: thick pointed eye shadow, heavy mascara, and lipstick the color of her hair. She wore a black, form-fitted dress that went down to the middle of her thick thighs. A large red-trimmed diamond shape was cut out of it around her midsection, revealing her trim, perfectly flat stomach and ruby belly button piercing. Her breasts were quite large, larger than her sister's, and pushed up out of the top of her dress exposing some bulging, jiggly cleavage. Pretty much all of the fat on her body was stored up there and down on her hips, which bodaciously sashayed with every step down the staircase. She wore dark stockings and bright red pumps that gave great attention to her movement. This was clearly a woman very concerned with her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a throaty, elegant, pretentious voice with a posh accent that her sister didn't possess. Anna thought she might have been falsely putting it on to impress for so long that it just became her regular voice. The light followed her as she walked. \"Who is this who dares step foot into my humble abode when I'm busy with my garden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stammered. \"Oh, uh, I'm Anna...lise. Annalise, my... my lady. I come bearing, umm, gifts! From your sister!\" She produced a folded note from her back pocket and displayed it to the vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which sister?\" she asked as she got closer. She was a little shorter than Zeena and slightly taller than Anna, maybe 5'11\" or 6 foot. She absolutely reeked of perfume, some awfully strong lavender or something. \"Is it from that fat hog Cameena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no ma'am, from Zeena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. The former fat hog...\" She rudely snatched the letter out of Anna's hand, reading it quickly aloud to herself. \"Dear Layla, I've been told you might appreciate some of this food... It's very good... Blood tasting... Low calorie... Blah blah blah... Have some right away and send my courier back to me with your thoughts. With love, Zeena.\" She pulled the letter away from her face, looking salaciously at the food and Anna before her. \"Well, I suppose a bit of early dinner couldn't hurt. Ninaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short, plump girl in a maid's outfit quickly scuttled from the top of the stairs. \"Yes mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set the dining room table for two. I have a guest tonight. Prepare her some food we use for the cattle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\" she breathlessly replied, scuttling away as quickly as she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she licked her black lips eagerly, showing off bright white fangs. \"let's get this cart up the stairs.\"</span></div></div>",

Cakes.\" Captain Davies was sitting on the floor up against a wall. She was wiped out, a victim of the entire table's worth of sweet, fatty goodness that she had just devoured. Sugary remsins of her dessert coated her mouth like clown makeup, a messy Polluck painting of pink, white, and brown frosting. Her glutted stomach surged forth into her ample lap, adorned with the stray crumbs of her hastily eaten meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince djinn stored calories immediately after they ate them, Kayka was looking a lot plumper than usual after finishing off her similarly inhaled cakes. She had never eaten a cake before and she was positively smitten. Barely able to resist the taste, she made short work of almost as many cakes as Davies, and since djinn didn't get full, she intended to eat a lot more. She had put on maybe 20-25 pounds since she started eating, which settled nicely and evenly on her curvy form. Most evident of the gain was her belly, which grew into a nicely plump blue gut, emphasized by her now deeper belly button and new rolls on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka strutted confidently and happily to the beached whale on the floor, bending down to rub her big, stuffed belly as requested. Davies closed her eyes in ecstasy and burped a few times. Gods, she was good at this belly rub thing. As she squeezed more air out of the Captain, she asked, \"I have a question for you, Captain Davies. Why do humans make that loud noise with their mouths after they've eaten or drank? It's a bit odd to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies kept her eyes closed and smiled. \"Ye mean... HOOOURP! Belches? Why are humans so burpy? URP! Keep massagin' me tum 'n I'll tell ye. Ye're a naturUURRPal at this.\" Kayka switched positions and began to use both her hands for the massage, which got even more of an ecstatic reaction from her. \"So, URRRRROOOOORRP! That's so fuckin' good... So we mortals 'ave finite space in these stomachs o' ours. I can eat more than a regular idiot off th' street cause I've spent so much time stuffin' it 'n 'tis all stretched ouUURRRRP! ...out now. But anyway, we... ORRRRRP. When we eat we also end up swallowin' air, 'n we cannah digest it so that air's gotta come up somehow, either through our mouths which be a big ol' burp like so... HUUUURRRROOOORP! Or through our booty holes which be a fart. I won't demonstrate that. Ye don't wanna hear me fart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakya kept rubbing and groping her fat. \"Interesting. I'll keep that in mind for future reference.\" Mortals are weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a riddle fer ye about yer URRRP body, now, since ye're so curious about mine. How come ye don't got any holes? Nothin' between those booty cheeks o' yers. Nothin' where yer sex best be. But yer body's still built like 'tis got those holes, ye know? Why?\" The burps were becoming littler and less frequent now. Kayka was doing an excellent job forcing all that gas out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we djinn don't have anuses or vaginas or nipples because we don't bear children and we don't need to vacate any bowels because we don't have them. No waste is left over when we take in energy. However, if our master wants to have sex with us, then we can change our genital areas to provide that. We don't get much carnal pleasure out of sexual intercourse, but we want our masters to be satisfied in whatever way they please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' be weird fer me.\" Davies heaved herself off the floor, dusting crumbs off her belly and dirt off her ass. \"I've banged me fair share o' dudes 'n broads o'er th' years but I be a kinky bastard 'n none o' them really enjoyed havin' t' help me get off. But that sailor back on th' galleon 'n Barri th' other night... I reckon I be on a sexual high right now. ...I dunno why I be tellin' ye this.\" She licked some frosting off her lips. Kayka nodded her head, having listened closely and thoughtfully to Davies' opening up. \"Let's eat more cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls stood at the opposite sides of the room, shoveling handfuls of sweetness into their mouths. Kayka, with her mouth full, put an icing laden hand to her pudgy, growing belly. \"Captain, what if... mmmnnm... What if the owner of these cakes comes back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sit on 'em! Duh! Mmmmph... 'tis th' most powerful arse in th' high- urp! seas, don't forget!\" Davies' stuffed pot pressed up against and oozed over the table she stood by. She was lucky she took off her corset before she started eating, it would have broken off of her by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayka stopped eating. \"You know, I have an idea. It may provide you with some sexual gratification.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain practically spit out her mouthful of chocolate cake before swallowing. \"Sexual gratification? I be havin' some sexual gratification right now! I be as wet 'n horny as a water buffalo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if you tested out how powerful your bottom was by sitting on one of those big cakes over there? I'm sure the feeling might turn you on even more, maybe make you hungrier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavies stopped and gritted her teeth. \"...Shit. That does sound incredibly hot.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Layla's dining hall was as exquisite as her abode would suggest. It was spacious room draped in red tapestries and dark carpets. Hanging from the ceiling was a lavish, bright chandelier and below it stood the grand table: long and mahogany, covered in a red lace tablecloth. Atop the table, arranged neatly in a line across its length, were a number of burning candlesticks perched neatly in clearly expensive candlestick holders shaped like little dishes to collect the liquid wax. At one end of the vast table sat the dignified Layla Stranken in her regal, high backed chair; directly to her left was Anna in a significantly less significant wooden chair that matched the table's reddish material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina, the quick-footed servant, had just finished setting the table for their dinner. Layla's food, which had been provided from the cart, could only be described as \"meaty\". A massive, juicy, bloody steak, a mound of pulled pork, a few large, plump sausages, and a plethora of chicken wings, all of which were slathered in a special sauce that reeked of spices and vinegar and human blood. Anna's dinner was also quite substantial, but in a different way. Her food had been procured from the castle's kitchen which typically only prepared food for the fattened blood banks that Layla kept pampered and portly in the basement. Her dinner could barely be described as one, more as a very big dessert. Some slices of cake, some slices of pie, a grand bowl of ice cream showered in sprinkles and chocolate syrup, and a variety of positively sinful looking donuts. Anna would have felt weird about eating this weird sketchy vampire castle food if it didn't look and smell so dang delicious and expensive. Layla must have had a world-class pastry chef under her spell, because she would have expected to see this kind of food only within the Adinahn palace walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla unfolded a cloth napkin and stuffed it into the front of her dress and the crack of her bulging cleavage. She cracked her knuckles. \"Oh, this food looks incredible. Where did Zeena even procure this? Was it left over from when her stomach was the size of Jupiter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stammered. She didn't expect to have to answer this question. \"Oh, um,\" she cleared her throat, \"she didn't tell me, in fact. I'm j-just the courier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire looked over for a second and then looked back down at the smorgasbord before her. \"Well, you should ask her and relay back her answer. I'd love to meet the butcher responsible for this.\" She picked up a fork and knife and began to carve a generous piece from her steak. \"You know, it's generally rare that people take the vampire diet into mind when they produce food. People seem to think we're just barbarians that can only drink blood, but that's really not the case. We enjoy lavish dinners like these from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was hoping that Barri was doing her job right now. She was supposed to cast a love spell the moment Layla bit into her food, and that moment was very fast approaching. Layla brought the fork to her mouth and placed the piece delicately onto her tongue. As she chewed, her eyes lit up and then closed tight, a giant grin growing on her black lips. Mouth still full, she began to quickly cut a new piece and shove it in with the still masticating steak. She put down her silverware and let her arms grow limp, slouching back in her chair in ecstasy. Her cheeks billowed like a squirrel's. She gulped the food down, bulging her throat, immediately beginning to cut a generous piece from one of her sausages. \"This is absolutely diviiiiiine. I apologize if I don't make a good conversation partner tonight, but I think I'm going to be focusing on this food.\" She haphazardly shoved the sausage in, getting some sauce on her mouth. Mouth completely full, she gestured to Anna, saying something muffled with food that sounded like \"Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna hadn't taken a bite yet, paralyzed by the anxiety if Barri weren't able to perform her magic. Based on the noises that Layla was making, though, she had succeeded. Her new lust for meat combined with the special sauce, made especially to be very, very fattening, which was currently running down her neck onto her jutting boobs, would make Layla grow exponentially in no time. So, not to be rude and anxieties lifted, Anna took a spoonful of vanilla bean ice cream, guided it into her mouth, and to her surprise, had a similar reaction as Layla. The food exploded onto her taste buds, a sensation that made her feel ecstatic and a little faint. Fuck, did Barri cast on her, too? Whatever. This was delicious, and she was gonna eat the hell out of it. If Layla got seconds, maybe she'd get seconds too. Or thirds. Fourths?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stefan Lazarescu strolled down the unassuming Racovanian road. His mind was on one thing: his meager job. Stefan, a young, lively man, was the assistant and apprentice of the famed Minotaurian pastry chef Bramble the Great. Bramble was an imposing figure with a hot temper and not-to-be-fucked-with attitude, but perhaps the most talented dessert chef in all of Yndyre. He had served under the emperor for a time before going freelance and eventually ending up in Racovania under the lease of the influential Stranken sisters who loomed above the town like gargoyles in their castles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery year around the harvest, Cameena Stranken would send a messenger down from her abode with an extra large commission for Bramble: lots and lots of cakes of various make and model for a special festival. Years ago, Cameena, a notorious vampire in her day, had acquired a taste for non-blood food and became a vegetarian, swearing off human blood forever. This breakage from the vampiric ways ostracized her from her family and friends, causing her to withdraw from much of her social life. She re-emerged many years later, glutted and fat from her sedentary lifestyle and generous diet with a proclamation to the town of Racovania. In order to gain the favor of the townspeople, she would throw an annual harvest ball and feast, open to all who wished to attend. These feasts were always lavishly catered with the finest of foods, including a plethora of cakes baked by the one and only Bramble the Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Stefan rolled the last few of Bramble's works for this year's ball on a cart before him: four vanilla-chocolate swirl cakes thickly coated in overwhelmingly sweet icing and dotted with strawberries and raspberries on the top and sides. The storage house was luckily just up on his right, an unassuming little cottage that'd be easy to miss if he hadn't been there many, many times the past week or so. He stopped the cart by the door and slipped the key into the lock, but before he could turn the tumbler, he heard a curious noise muffled through the wood. It sounded like a woman's voice, but he couldn't make out what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and cautiously, he turned the key, unlocking the door. Twisting the door handle and carefully sticking his head through the crack, he surveyed the terrible sight. To say the storage building was in disarray would be an understatement; it was positively wrecked. Some tables overturned, cake and icing residue coating their tops and some even on the walls... Hey, one of the tables was even cracked! But, oh gods, the cakes. They were all gone, the only traces but stains and crumbs. Stefan's eyes bulged out of his sockets. Who did this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question would be quickly answered by the same woman's voice he heard through the door crooning, \"Ohhhhh... Ye're so good at this, Kayka~...\" Kayka? Stefan opened the door a little more and moved into the room silently. Behind one of the flipped tables near the back of the room was an... odd sight to say the least. Two women, a human and a djinn, both very obviously the culprits. The human, a fat chick with a large ass and a remarkably engorged stomach, crouched on her hands and knees, giving her big belly room to exist without getting squashed. She had her butt out in the air, which was currently being caressed by the seated djinn, a flabby blue woman who looked like a swirled ice cream cone. Stefan watched for a moment as the djinn stuck her tongue out and licked the human's butt cheek, eliciting another groan from her. He then noticed that there was icing residue on her rump. Had she been sitting on cakes and getting the djinn to clean up the mess so nothing went to waste?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan cleared his throat and got a quick, nasty look from both ladies. Gulp. He started, \"Uh, who are you people and why are you in the storage room? Did you eat all the-\" but the thought was cut off by them wordlessly getting up off the floor. GULP.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile back at the castle, after many demands for more and more food, another feast had reached its end\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HHHHOOOOUURP! Mmm, oh heavens above, that was\u2026 gloooorious.\" Layla purred and groaned, shifting back in her newly creaking chair. Barri's magic and the enhanced food worked exactly as intended, turning the elegant vampire into a flabby hog in record time. Her once flat stomach had long since escaped her dress and ballooned into a veritable, doughy gut, its two bulging rolls ripping through what was previously a diamond shaped hole and now was just a regular hole. Her piercing could now barely be seen, as it was lost in the depths of her belly button. Her ass and hips and thighs had also taken quite a bit of extra weight, marshmallowing out across the soft red cushion of her chair. Her booty had ripped clean through both the bottom of the dress and her panties, the latter of which laid snapped off and tattered under her expanse. Lucky for her, she wasn't wearing any stockings or anything, as her log sized thighs would have expanded right through them. Her top half was less affected by her very quick gain, but there still was noticeable extra pudge. Her breasts, previously her fatty pride and joy, were now nothing compared to the size of her belly or thighs. Still, what fat did go to them turned what was previously a sexy display of cleavage into what looked like two big stress balls shoved together into a too small tube. A hint of her pink areolas was visible, and from the way she was panting, no one would be surprised if she just took her tits out and started playing with them. Finally, her face and arms received some residual chub, rounding her chin, cheeks, and biceps out. All in all, it seemed like Anna and Barri's work here would please Zeena quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Anna, her current emotional status was similar to Layla's, stretched out in her chair and exhausted from the feast she just inhaled. Fortunately, Barri didn't cast the ultra-gain spell on her, leaving her thin for the time being. However, to say she wasn't showing any effect of her binge would be preposterous. One often overlooked aspect of Elf biology is their stomachs' high food capacity, a vestigial trait left over from when the species' evolutionary ancestors lived in cold climates hundreds of thousands of years ago. As a result of this, Anna could fit all that dessert into her belly without it exploding inside of her. What she got in return was a stuffed tummy she couldn't even fathom having. Round and taut, it extended from her midsection like a globe. She looked like she was pregnant with a moderately sized rock and she felt like she had swallowed some kind of mid-ocean steam jet. It was rumbling and gurgling like a bear almost embarrassingly loud, though Layla had bigger problems right now so it didn't quite bother her. Her t-shirt had obviously ridden up her torso by now, and she'd unbuttoned her pants long ago. Staring up at the chandelier, she put one hand on her bellydome, which was burning hot, and the other hung limp at her side. She had the urge to burp, but it was much too painful to. Plus, Anna has never been the world\u2019s best burper, and it\u2019s possible that her little urps wouldn\u2019t do much to relieve the massive pressure she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NINAAAAA!!!\" Layla shouted into the air with all her might, slumped over in her chair. Nina's little feet pattered against the floor as she jogged in from the other room. Layla's new size didn't seem to faze her, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress?\" She stood with her hands at her back, ready to serve as she'd been doing all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you be a doll and- oof\u2026 give me a belly rub? It's oh so tight\u2026 Be gentle...\" Layla looked at her gut with exhaustion and wonder, like she was thinking, \"holy shit, what did I do to myself and how can I do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress.\" Nina made her way over to the seated fatty and began lightly caressing her bare stomach, an act that made the portly vampire purr with delight. A little gurgle escaped her throat as she began tonguing her fangs for any stray meat that may have been stuck between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lazily turned her head to the overtaxed elf, who was still trying to comprehend her current situation and pray for the feeling of fullness to go away quickly. \"Mmm, did you enjoy our little dinner tonight, Miss Annalise? Because I CERTAINLY did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna couldn't do much but moan and mumble, but she uttered a little affirmative \"mmhmm\u2026\" as she lightly touched her skin. It was true, Anna had thoroughly enjoyed herself that night, and the aftermath was great evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good\u2026 HUUURP. Oh, pardon me\u2026\" she giggled as her servant lightly groped her new fat, \"I'm just a gassy little thing tonight, aren't I? And my belly's so sensitive\u2026\" She looked up at Nina and back to Anna. \"Do I have any sauce on my mouth? That food was so incredible, I was so wrapped up I forgot to wipe it...\" Her mouth was covered in the barbeque sauce and blood mixture, and the napkin she had procured at the beginning of the feast was still lodged unused in the tight canyon of her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gave another \"mhmm\", still staring at the ceiling. This answer prompted Layla to start licking wildly at her lips, trying desperately to get a taste of as much of the sauce as possible. Yep, she was hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Anna and Layla were both fast asleep in their chairs, completely taken away into a deep food coma. After their mutual nap (man, could that vampire snore!), Layla escorted Anna back to the castle's entrance. Getting up from their seats was difficult for both of them, having been planted there for hours not to mention their new forms, but they somehow managed to lug themselves from their spots. Walking was a little difficult for Anna, as her center of gravity had shifted greatly to accommodate her oversized bowling ball of a belly, while Layla still walked gracefully, albeit with a lot more jiggle than before. Even though she was invisible, Anna knew that Barri's eyes were glued to Layla's rear end, the natural sashay of her wide hips causing her now massive, bare buns to wobble and pop with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your presence here tonight was great, Annalise, and I was pleased to have you for dinner.\" Layla purred once again, hand to her tummy. \"Do let Zeena know that I very much appreciated her gift and that I would like more. Much more. Immediately. Please come back anytime. I mean it.\" As she closed the door, Anna heard Layla yell once again to her servant, \"Nina! Prepare my bed chambers! And a snack!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a little village of the Motee Marshes, there was a great ruckus. All the people were leaving their huts and were directed toward the same places; all the people were bringing something with them: food. Every person either had a chunk of meat, and it didn't seem to be a preference of a specific kind, a fresh pike, or just a couple of papayas. Among those people, there was Jiroo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiroo was a young boy of the village, only 8 years old, but that day, it was the first time for him to bring food for the goddess. This tradition began only a couple of months ago, when, apparently, a goddess arrived demanding a lot of food or she would've had destroyed the village, and every few days, all the citizen had to bring their share to the altar to satisfy their demand. Jiroo never had the occasion of bringing food before though, his parents thought it might have been too dangerous for him, but the boy wanted so desperately to see the fearsome goddess, that his father allowed him to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jiroo was bringing a peccary leg, with a big smile full of excitement and fear at the same time. He followed the crowd, his older sister grasping his hand, until he reached the altar.<br>\r\nIt was a large rectangular stone, with torches at its corners and three some pots with perfumed ashes at every side.<br>\r\nThe people got in line and, one after another, everyone put their food. The village was very small, barely 100 inhabitants including the children, but the citizens managed to amass enough food for a large family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the goddess?\" Asked an impatient Jiroo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't arrived yet\" replied his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid waited thrilled for the goddess. Would have she come from the sky in a storm? Riding a wyvern? Erupting with a flame? And what was she like? All these answers were answered after a few minutes of waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess came simply walking from the forest, and it wasn't exactly how he expected.<br>\r\nThe goddess was a lady with a doughy body covered almost entirely in orange fur with black stripes, sans for the palm of the hands, the plants of the feet and the belly. The latter was especially noticeable; it was big and sagged in front of the thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was round, with puffy cheeks. She had big yellow diamond eyes, a black cat-like nose and a pair of black horns near her tiger ears. The hair on her head was short, barely reaching the chin and was black at the tips.<br>\r\nShe was wearing a simple piece of cloth around the chest, which wasn't very large compared to the rest of the body, and a loincloth covering the genitals (if a goddess had any, thought Jiroo). The clothes had gold coins attached to them, which tinkled at every step when the clothes waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't what Jiroo expected, as to him; she resembled more a fat cat than a vengeful goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was right as Tejral, wasn't a goddess, but a rakshasa, a tiger-like creature that lived in the marshy jungle. They were a race of skilled hunters, able to catch even the largest Triceratops with their strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTejral tried to make the most serious and scary expression she could put. And all the humans slowly retreated while she advanced toward the altar. Then she sat, and her expression switched toward a happy and gluttonous one, with a big smile while she licked her lips, and her striped tail wagged back and forth behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTejral too lived off hunting, until, after stumbling across a village of humans, she noticed how those tribal people were scared of her, and came up with the \"vengeful goddess\" idea. Either the villagers paid her a tribute in food, or she would've destroyed their village utterly. The plan worked, and she suddenly found a very easy way to get all the food she wanted. Why bother hunting when she could get much more without breaking a sweat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rakshasa was devouring all the goods that were on the table. The villages there were full of good hunters, so she could taste all the delicious meats of the area every day, and they even left some fruits too; she wasn't a fruit lover too, but why bother to refuse them when they were so good? Especially the red and juicy ones; and in that moment she sunk her fangs into one, and all the sweet juice poured on her soft cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree humans, along with a much older one, came in front of her. Tejral could see the terrified expression on their faces, with one breaking into a sweat. Two humans had a wooden flute in their hands, and the third a little drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goddess, Tejral\" said the old man, the chief. Even if old, he still had a body that would make any average person envious, after all, he wasn't the chief only because he was the wisest (but not wise enough to see through Tejral's facade, thought the rakshasa with a grin) \"I thought you might enjoy some music while you're eating our offering\" he added, and pointed at the other three with his hand, waiting for Tejral's approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTejral, with a mouth full of food like a chipmunk's, nodded. Some music wouldn't have minded her, and if it was good, she might had begin to \"honour\" this village more with her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTejral was, in fact, too greedy to stop to a single village, she wanted more. And thus, most of the villages in the area were serving her, bringing food on regular basis. And noticed how some began bringing more for her approval, either with more food, gold offering (a Rakshasa never refused gold) or other services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, all of these had some consequence, as the once slender Tejral had almost doubled her weight in a few months. And her previous slender form could have been proved by the golden bracelet on her wrist, which was too small for her flabby arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the villages didn't questioned how could have a goddess gained weight, and so far Tejral was having the time of her life, even if her new size brought a couple of drawbacks, the pros were just too many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked the music they were playing, but she didn't bother too much, as she was concentrated to the food on the altar. Once she was finished, she patted her overstuffed gut and asked for help to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you appreciated our offering\" said the chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did\" replied Tejral with a big smile \"I won't destroy this village\" then she turned to her \"scary face\" \"But I ask for another offering in three days, at the same hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we will\" replied the chief bowing to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I shall take my leave of you,\" said Tejral, holding her belly as if she was pregnant, and slowly going back to the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTejral walked slowly back home, while trying to remember which village was next morning. She had now planned meals *ahem* offerings with most of the villages in the area, but even after a couple of months, she hadn't remembered it quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, the one near the waterfall\" said Tejral at low voice. That village was full of fishermen, and thinking about the delicious fish she would have eaten the next day, made the rakshasa already hungry, despite all the stuff she had eaten not long ago.<br>\r\nThen, as if a real goddess heard her desire, she saw a peccary with three piglets. She licked her lips, and raised her hand with sharp claws, while also grabbing a branch which seemed sharp enough to work, and then she moved as quietly as she could, and jumped toward it with a surprise attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the animals were too fast and escaped, while she was winded after a few meters of running. She tried to throw the branch as a spear too, but missed all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTejral stopped, with her still full belly rising and lowering with her breath. She was getting too out of shape for such activity, but her stomach was getting so used to all the extra food, she needed more to satisfy her gluttony. She thought perhaps she could demand more food from the villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back to her tree and sunk her claws into the bark, pulling her weighty form up until she arrived at her tree-top hut. One of the downside of this \"goddess\" play was that she had to walk a lot to get her food, if only she could stay in one of the villages forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered herself onto her pile of fur that served as a bed, next to a dusty javelin who hadn't been touched in months, and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, she woke up, and her large stomach, having digested all the food of the day before, was growling, demanding to be filled. Tejral was more than happy to oblige, and left the hut to go toward the next village...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the deep jungles of the Motee Marsh there are many great golden palaces that erupt out of the canopy like glittering mountains; the greatest and largest of all these houses the queen of the most populous race within the steamy jungles, the Naga Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin her titanic golden palace there are many rooms for the queen\u2019s usage. One in particular nobody is allowed within, save for the queen and her chosen bride. Outside armed guards stand tall, their tails not even twitching as they stand motionless, halberds in hand. But inside this room there was plenty of movement going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one was to gaze within this sacred room they would see a gigantic bed, made of many silken cushions and spreads, with giant golden snake statues on each corner. And on the bed was the naga queen herself, laid flat on her back with her arms splayed out, long black hair askew and her eyes clenched as her fangs bite her bottom-lip in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! YES! YES!!!\u201d The queen screamed as her wife and lover lay on top, her snake-like bottom half wrapped around her larger partner\u2019s larger tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir entwined tails lashed around wildly as the pair engaged in the intimate act of naga love-making. As an all female species, the naga needed a way to keep their population up, so females had evolved to fill either role. There were legends that there were once Naga males, but due to low population percentages between the sexes, some isolated all-female cities evolved this trait and the males died out once they re-integrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was still a small problem. Naga women only laid one egg at a time, and their gestation period was very long\u2026with one exception. A Naga queen could give birth to one hundred eggs at a time, and spent just as long gestating them as any other female would one. This was partially why Naga queens were larger than standard Naga, their bone structure needed to be stronger to hold the extra weight pregnancy would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaga were not the only all-female race in Yndyre though, but they were the only ones with such low population growth. Which was why it was deemed necessary that the queen find a wife as soon as possible after her coronation; luckily for Coatzintli, her childhood friend and once hand-maiden had become her partner and then wife. The coronation had finished only a few hours ago even, and already the pair were \u201ccelebrating\u201d hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli screamed at the top of her lungs as she felt her wife enter her over and over, their tightened tails made every motion all the more pleasurable. The serpent sovereign lashed her arms around her wife\u2019s back, holding her tight and pushing even more as she felt her pleasure reach its peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-mon, so close\u2026\u201d Coatzintli grunted as beads of sweat from her wife\u2019s brow dripped onto her face. Then it happened, there was a sudden rush, and a feeling of being suddenly full before both snakes lost all their energy and collapsed together in a heap. All their rolling and thrashing however had led to them rolling towards the edge of the massive bed, and with a heavy thud both rolled over onto the golden floor, bedspread falling across them moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLi\u2026I think we fell off\u2026\u201d the smaller naga giggled as both started laughing uncontrollably. Thankfully, despite the guard hearing the noise, none rushed to the \u201crescue\u201d. They had been given explicit instructions to not disturb at all costs. This gave both Naga the chance to fall asleep on each other as they bathed in the afterglow, the tips of their tail sticking out of the sheets and holding on to each other firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, why do I have to entertain this\u2026monkey\u2026\u201d Coatzintli huffed as she stood stock still while her attendants were in the middle of dressing her in all her finery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is to show the humans that we mean business by having them meet with the queen\u2026and please don\u2019t call them a monkey during the trade.\u201d Her wife explained with a slight pleading tone at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Fine</i> Patli\u2026\u201d The queen huffed as the final robes and ornaments were attached to her form. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli gazed upon her wife in all her finery. A massive and magnificent headdress rested upon her crown, tipped with the longest feathers of the local birds of the Marshes. A thin piece of fabric was dressed across her modest bosom, with small gold rings dangling from it. Her smooth belly was exposed to the elements, to allow her skin to breath in such a hot climate; and right at the point where her brown and black-striped skin met her scales she wore a flowing dress, bedecked with many precious jewels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful as always.\u201d Patli stated with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! You never say anything else do you?\u201d Coatzintli replied, slithering over and leaning down to give her wife a small kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it is always true.\u201d Patli replied, tapping the queen on the nose as they turned to enter the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli could not help stare back however, Patli was dressed in far less resplendent clothes, but they still made her look even more beautiful than before. Patli had beautiful turquoise, red and black stripes that ran laterally up her scaly body until they met her smooth orangey-brown skin. Her black hair had been braided and tied around her head, unlike Coatzintli\u2019s which was left to flow behind her. Coatzintli was always enthralled by her more colorful partner; Naga queens were not only bigger than normal Naga, but they had duller colors too (most likely a leftover of some trait where they had to camouflage). But Patli's colors were more than just for show, the venom in her incisors was extremely powerful, capable of knocking any of the massive Saurian beasts that roamed the jungles out cold for several hours, and killing anything smaller than that. Thankfully for the Queen, she had nothing to fear, Naga's were notoriously poison-resistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they slithered hands in hands, Coatzintli felt a little gurgling coming from her middle. Placing one of her right hands on it seemed to settle it, so she paid it no heed for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the golden throne room, the queen slithered her way up onto her dais. There was no way a Naga could sit on anything remotely like the more humanoid thrones; so instead they had these large bed-like surfaces for the queen to curl her serpentine body onto. Patli had her own smaller one to the right of the main dais.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her advisors arriving shortly after and lining up beside the duel thrones, the massive golden doors creaked open to reveal a man in silver armour and wearing a strange helmet with a thin crest running up it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling his curled moustache to announce his presence, the man unrolled a scroll and began to read from it. \u201cMay I present to the royalty of the Naga Kingdom, her Excellency, The Duchess Esmeralda De Cortenza, owner of the Great Western Trading Corporation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man instantly took a step away from the doors as flanks of guards, wearing the same armor as the first man, marched into the room. In between the pair of serried ranks was an absolute whale of a woman. She was wearing an immense light-blue dress that flowed to the floor in a large dome shape (Coatzintli wondered if there was some hidden device under it to keep the fat woman upright). She was wielding a fan and waving it as if her life depended on it, it was quite clear she was not here for the weather. A massive powdered wig adorned her head and her face was colored a pallid snow white, save for a single black dot on her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to my palace Duchess.\u201d Coatzintli began (she remembered her mother\u2019s pleasantries routine off by heart). \"I am queen Coatzintli, this is my wife Patli and my advisers, I hope your travel through my jungles was pleasant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman began to beat the fan even harder until it looked inches off from scraping her immense cheeks. \u201cWell!\u201d she began, \u201cAside from ze weather being 'ot enough to boil a cat, it vas pleasant enough. But now, let uz talk business\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sow-like woman prattled on, Coatzintli felt the queasiness in her belly return again, only much stronger this time. Then, she could bear it no longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d Coatzintli mumbled, placing one hand over her mouth the queen slithered off her dais and out back through the door she came in through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLi!\u201d Patli cried out, before turning towards the stunned Duchess. \u201cThe Queen has been feeling unwell recently, I do apologize!\u201d Patli thought up before slithering after her spouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Coatzintli back in the dressing room, her head leaning out of the window. \u201cLi, are you ok?\u201d Patli asked, placing a hand on her wife\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026just\u2026don\u2019t look down\u2026bit of a royal mess there now...\u201d Coatzintli mumbled, before turning to face Patli. \u201cI\u2026I think I\u2019m pregnant\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was normally sprung on the public however, so nobody ever saw it coming; it made all the cheers all the greater and there were normally public events afterwards such as special food stalls, activities for the hatchlings; it was all a nice day out.

Her size would have confused most humans, who would have to wait four months to get around this big; at least there was one advantage over the mammals Coatzintli had\u2026she wouldn\u2019t have that weird popped-out belly-button the humans got during the final months. That was something she always found odd about those monkeys\u2026why did they have a small hole there anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for why Coatzintli was already so clearly showing, it was because of the incoming size of her brood.

Not become a massive baby-factory like my mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame her for this\u2026\u201d Patli added quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli gripped her wife\u2019s hands tightly. \u201cI know\u2026it was not her fault she got sick\u2026but I still have my regrets\u2026I know what you are going to say next, we shouldn\u2019t have had sex on our wedding night\u2026but gods you looked so good in that dress\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli smiled at the compliment. \u201cWe could find a compromise? Like we could have your dais transported around other places so you can see the world\u2026once your first pregnancy is over anyway, the people would be horrified if you just disappeared part-way through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I know, I am a symbol of prosperity and fertility to my people\u2026gods know I will be for the last part, I\u2019m going to be gravid if there are a hundred of them in here\u2026\u201d Coatzintli gently rubbed the mound again, looking down at her stretched brown and black skin; she was thankful at this point that Naga were so used to eating such vast quantities of food in a single sitting, no way was her belly going to accommodate this pregnancy otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair pressed their foreheads together and embraced into a gentle hug. As they did, Patli pinched some of Coatzintli\u2019s skin. \u201cAre you eating properly?\u201d The Naga asked, pulling out of the hug and giving her wife a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli rolled her eyes, god THIS part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to up your intake; otherwise you won\u2019t have the strength.\u201d Patli scolded. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t like the idea of getting fat, everyone gets fat every wet season\u2026I mean I remember last wet season SOME chubby Naga I knew got so big she burst her dress in front of that Merfolk peace envoy, good thing he had such a sense of humour\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Why do you keep bringing that up!\u201d Coatzintli pouted. \u201cMention that again and I will have you sent to the dungeons.\u201d The Queen added, jokingly poking her wife on the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, I bet you would like to have me in chains for a while.\u201d Patli giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it\u2026anyway, there is a difference between me getting chubby once a year and me getting\u2026<i>that</i> big\u2026\u201d Coatzintli almost hissed as she remembered the sheer size her mother had become before she fell ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLi, nobody cares if you get fat\u2026in fact the people expect it of\u2026you\u2026wait, are you worried that if you get fat I won\u2019t find you attractive anymore?\u201d Patli pried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno\u2026maybe\u2026\u201d The queen muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLI! Ugh! I told you before, I.love.you. I married you for Yva\u2019s sake!\u201d Patli smacked her face with one of her many palms. \u201cI don\u2019t care how fat you get, you could be as big as the palace and I would still think you are the hottest thing to slither around this jungle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if my cheeks get super duper fat?\u201d Coatzintli pined; she always had been super sensitive about how fat her face got every wet season, and the threat of getting even bigger made her super self-conscious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey would just be extra-adorable and extra-pinchable!\u201d Patli cooed, \u201cNo speaking of adore, your public awaits!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey to the balcony felt like it took forever. Coatzintli hugged her mound as she slithered towards the doorway bathed in bright light that the jungle floor rarely saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPresenting her Highness Queen Coatzintli!\u201d A guard bellowed as the Naga slithered into the eye-line of the crowd. The audience erupted as they caught sight of Coatzintli in her pure white robes meant to symbolize fertility and her golden headdress that was a gesture of thanks to the gods for the miracle of the life growing within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green queen did not know if she really wanted to thank the gods at this stage. Sure she loved Patli and that night of passion she wished she could have over and over again\u2026but this after-effect would cripple her chance to see the outside world. Well, maybe not\u2026Patli did have a plan. But if she really did get even half as big as her mother did, that would be a lot of Naga needed to hold a palanquin big enough for her\u2026perhaps they could coerce some stronger races to lend some guards for a trip? Perhaps some clever designer had built a carriage that could be pulled? Hmmm, thinking things over as she waved to the crowds, Coatzintli thought that maybe there was a way to see the world even in her immense post-pregnancy state\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since the announcement that Queen Coatzintli was with child, the Marshes had erupted in festivities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen (now referred to posthumously as the Queen Mother by Coatzintli's people) had been a well-beloved ruler for many decades. Even in the long lifespan of the naga, not even the oldest of the snake women could remember a ruler who took so well to the throne. Most of her reign had been a peaceful time of prosperity, and it was her leadership that saw the birth of the shaky alliance between the Naga and the Rakshasa who shared the marshes. The naga people thrived under her leadership, and had become quite accustomed to celebration. Every season, it seemed, the Queen Mother had given her kingdom another reason to rejoice. From births upon births to peace treaties to royal diplomats visiting to an especially fruitful rainy season, it wasn't hard to see why the recent generations of naga who had lived under the Queen Mother's rule had linked ceremonial duties with celebratory ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, still riding high on the coronation of their new queen, the news that she was to bear children was met with even further raucous celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...\" the queen tilted her head slightly at the sight in front of her, \"...Patli, what's the word I'm looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful? Generous? Delicious-looking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was thinking along the lines of 'unnecessary'...\" Coatzintli's upper set of arms crossed underneath her impressive brown bust, \"I'd hate to call it 'wasteful' because it's very nice. But it's... kinda wasteful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying dead in the great stone dining hall, felled from what looked to be a combination of poison and spearhead, several of the kingdom's finest hunters had offered their queen a gigantopithicus. These great orange apes were uncommon offerings, given their peaceful nature and the fact that they towered over even naga of royal breed. That being said, they were <i>delicious</i>. It wasn't common that they were taken by the hunters, thanks to their sheer size and power. How they'd managed this, Coatzintli was more than a little curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it wasteful?\" Patli asked from beside her wife, slithering in front of her and spreading her arms wide so as to truly capture the size of the peoples' offering, \"The captain's guard said that all of the festivities drew it out of the marshes. It was self defense, my queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then maybe we shouldn't have all of these festivities.\" Coatzintli offered sagely, \"It's the dry season, so we should be conserving resources... and gigantopithici are peaceful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peaceful and delicious.\" Patli countered with a shrug of her four shoulders, \"It'd be wasteful <i>not</i> to eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, even though she was loathe to admit it, Coatzintli could see the merit in her wife's argument. Her hunters and guards had gone to great length to procure what was, in naga culture, a delicacy. Giga-meat had been a favorite of Coatzintli's since she was just a little girl, elbowing her many sisters for scraps. She hadn't had it in years, and the smell of it was beginning to make her resolve a little weak. Her turgid brown stomach, ripe with child, squelched longingly at the sight of so much of it in one place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards!\" Coatzintli's fanged mouth opened wide, her upper hands clapped together while the lower ones habitually rested on her gravid stomach, \"Get this monkey to my chefs post-haste. Have them prepare it for supper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes your highness!</i> four armor-clad naga women saluted, tapping the dull ends of their lances to the stone floor of the palace before slithering into place. Strong arms wrapped around the various limbs of the great ape, joined quickly by another two sets of four, and hefted the massive monkey towards the great hall. Six naga held it high, so that its protruding stomach didn't scrape against the floor. The queen and her wife reconvened among themselves as the guards hefted supper away to be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise decision, Li.\" Patli smiled, \"I'm sure your servants will be pleased that you're taking a liking to their generous offering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they aren't too pleased.\" Coatzintli tugged her full brown lips tersely, \"We really shouldn't be killing those things willy-nilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to tell them in a royal decree.\" Patli nodded sagely, \"Can't have our queen unhappy now, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\" Coatzintli laughed a little, \"You're never going to get me to see myself as Queenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not the queen, then that royal decree is literally just me shouting out on the plaza.\" the smaller naga said, running a hand up her lover's swollen stomach, \"Now, enough of that. You go take a royal nap while I see to the preparation of dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two naga women embraced, Patli's more colorful scales wrapping around the wide hips and tail of her queen. They parted with a kiss and a flirtatious wave, Patli wiggling her fingers cutely at her long-time lover. As Coatzintli slithered away, Patli hurried down the hall and caught up to the captain of the guards. Reaching into her satchel, she pulled out a few golden coins. The Captain's yellow eyes widened and her fanged mouth smiled appreciatively at the weight in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really expect you to be able to do it.\" Patli smiled as she dropped the gold into the captain's hand, \"Your queen says no more Gigantopithicus... <i>for now</i>... buuuut you know how those pregnancy cravings get. Maybe see if you can score something a little less endangered. Big game, but not endangered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a sly one, your highness.\" the Captain of the Guard chuckled, \"Generous too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that.\" Patli winked, \"If her highness starts to ask questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain of the Guard winked back and pretended to lock her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi might have had plans for her life post-partum. But Patli had plans of her own. Big plans.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Coatzintli, the great serpent and queen of the Naga, hadn't left her chambers in days. The people of Maya, the capital city, hadn't particularly minded her absence. The collective idea was that, due to her condition, she was to remain in her great stone palace. A queen so young, about to give birth to such a mighty load of children, it wasn't inconceivable to the public that she would need to prepare. And thanks to the ready machinations of the queen's ready wife, that idea had resulted in many offerings being left at the base of the stairs leading up to their palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day, golden trinkets and jewelry were left to celebrate the Queen's ravishing beauty. Feathers from winged serpents and mighty eagles that soared overhead were brought to decorate and accentuate her regal demeanor. Gold and rings were brought by any and all who wished her a long and happy life, marriage, and motherhood. But\u2014and this part was very important\u2014all those who wished such a young queen strength during such a momentous occasion brought food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirds felled by bows and spears, great \"lesser\" snakes that had been felled in battle, and mammals of all shapes and sizes were brought daily to the Queen and her palace. In respect to her wishes against eating \"peaceful\" creatures, the people were to only bring her what they felt wouldn't offend. Monkeys (no Gigantopithici, but few were that lucky to start!) were her favorite, but plenty of other beast met its fate in the name of Queen Coatzintli's \"continued health through pregnancy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is completely unnecessary.\" Coatzintli panted as she lay on the dais, her stomach distended with supper rather than child, \"I can go one day without... <i>urp</i>... stuffing my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, my lady.\" the smaller naga slithered to her wife's side to touch the royal stomach, \"You are with child. The shamans say that you're to have an especially <i>large</i> birthing. You need your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past few days, Coatzintli hadn't left her chambers. She'd lazed around, being waited on hand and foot by the royal servants. Even when she had been merely one of many princesses, she hadn't been so sedentary. She was always slithering around the palace, making trouble with Patli or her sisters. But ever since she'd been named Queen, all she'd done is <i>eat</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're spoiling me.\" Coatzintli puffed, her breath heavy and ragged. She winced as Patli's fingertips brushed against the tight skin of her stomach. With the steadily growing swarm of snakelets inside of her and the feasting she'd been doing lately, it was hard to tell what was sapping her strength more. The weight of the future generation of naga, or the amount of food it took to feed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your people are spoiling you.\" the smaller snake purred proudly into her wife's ear, rubbing concentric circles gently into her softening brown belly, \"They love their queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much.\" Coatzintli whined, \"They love their queen too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the pregnancy talking.\" Patli smiled, reaching for a small wooden bowl of panacea, \"Here, this will settle your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli glanced over her wife's figure. Her stature was great in size; she towered over all of the other snake women in the city in meters, not heads. But even in her great height, the offerings that her people (offerings helpfully \"suggested\" by none other than the worrying wife of Coatzintli herself!) had taken their toll on her girlish figure. The swell of her stomach had begun to hang with child, this much was inevitable. But the ample amounts of fat that clung to her sides, the breadth of her breasts, and the girth of her arms could not be ignored either. The Queen was growing, that much was certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quickly enough, for Patli's tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Patli cooed, stroking her queen's black feathered hair as her mighty head lay in her lap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little.\" she cooed like a hatchling one-tenth her size, \"Thank you Patli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my queen.\" the littler naga smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, picturing what her bride might look like at a truly queenly size\u2014Coatzintli's mother had left quite a high bar for future generations of naga to aspire towards. So large that she couldn't leave this very room, with its wide stone doorways that gave berth to literally everyone else in Yndyre but their very queen. The thought of her sweet little Li at even half that size gave her a wicked sense of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that monkey king in the Plains could have his harem of fat wives, why couldn't Patli? She was a queen too, you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, my love?\" Patli held up a sweet to her lover's lips, even their snake-tongues could appreciate the nectar and flavors within, \"Dinner will be quite a wait from now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli agreed with a weak smile, reasoning that it <i>would</i> be a while until dinner was ready. As she bit into the hard candy like-substance, her golden eyes rolled into the back of her head. An army of flavors rushed to dance across her serpent's tongue, devoid of half the taste buds that any other half-mammal had. Flavors were such a rare thing for the Naga, thanks to their biology. She'd only bitten into such riches once or twice during her life as a princess, but as a <i>queen</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...\" Coatzintli huffed, \"That's... that's really good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve a lot better than 'really good'.\" Patli purred, hand-feeding her queen the rest of her sweet, \"You're our queen. The mother of the next generation. You deserve everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sweet.\" Coatzintli managed as she came down from the flavor rush, her eyelids heavy, \"I don't deserve you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the Queen fell into a deep slumber, her wife's small hand rolled up onto her doughy brown side. She grabbed a handful of ample queenly flesh, and bit into her bottom lip as she felt the fat of her wife give way to her touch. Her heavy sleeping form may have pinned Patli beneath her, but you would be remiss to hear her complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep, my sweet little Li...\" Patli hissed as she fondled her queen's extra fluff, \"And when you wake up, I'll make sure you get a nice, <i>big</i> dinner...\"</span></div></div>",

She was suddenly overtaken with the smell of food- <u>breakfast at last!</u> she thought. She drooled at the thought of her first of an ever increasing number of breakfasts. It had been months since Coatzintli had even stood up, but the thought of moving at all was exhausting alone, never mind actually carrying out the action. Patli came in with four, no, five servants, each carrying two trays. Patli stayed with Coatzintli while the servants all went back to out the door.<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my queen.\" Patli said with a loving tone. \"How are you doing this morning?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>starving</i>! Hurry up and feed me!\" Coatzintli demanded. Patli laughed and began to hand-feed the ever growing queen, admiring her form. If her highness were to stand, her stomach would just barely miss the floor. At this point, though, her tail muscles had atrophied enough that she would need help to even hold herself up, let alone walk. Her heaving chest was larger than the tiny serpent's entire upper body. Coatzintli's arms were useless, her hands slowly being consumed by her ever-increasing corpulence. Her tail had grown in length and girth, now long enough it could wrap around Patli twice over- if it had the strength. Coatzintli's face was more of a blob, her neck only distinguishable from the rest of her thanks to the five chins she now sported. <i>And to think she's on an <b>empty</b> stomach.</i> Patli thought as she heaved an entire raptor into her gaping maw, beginning Coatzintli's meal. By the end of their feeding session, Coatzintli had eaten five Triceratops, at least twenty raptors, six monkeys, and an entire Tyrannosaurus Rex. Her stomach, now taught with food, hung over the opposite side of the bed, forcing Patli off.<br>\r\n\"That-<i>yawn</i>-was a good breakfast.\" Coatzintli said, smiling as she rubbed her stomach. \"Could I have more?\"<br>\r\n\"More?\" Patli said, shocked at what she had just heard. Her shock was replaced with pure delight as she realized what this meant: <i>it's worked! Or, at least <b>is</b> working</i>. Her plan was coming to fruition. \"Of course, my queen! Anything for you!\" Patli said with new vigor in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a week of this routine, the queen was in a state of near constant eating. Food at almost all times was being brought to her, and she ate all of it. Patli came in to check on the queen, and what she saw delighted her to no end:<br>\r\nThe queen's bed was removed some time ago after she had destroyed it under her mass, and she now lied atop a large number of pillows. Her stomach rose into the air, visibly expanding as she ate more and more. It was large enough it could fit at least ten naga inside- <b>rainy season naga</b>.  Her bust was in a similar state, each breast at least half the size of her stomach. Her face was sat atop a mountain of chins, too many for Patli to count from where she stood. The queen's arms were completely useless, consumed by fat piled upon fat, her many hands had disappeared beneath her ever-expanding mass. Roll after roll flowed down her entire frame, pooling on the floor as though she were a volcano, her flab the lava oozing out. And her <b>tail</b>. It wrapped around the room, twisting as it needed to just to be able to fit inside the space. Patli watched for an entire hour as the queen devoured her food without a second thought. Tyrannosaurs, Triceratops, Stegosauri, all of them entered Coatzintli's maw with ease, sliding down her mullet and into the depths of her stomach. She imagined her brood must be similarly engorged with so much food having been provided for her. Patli went up to her, \"Good to be the queen?\" she asked in jest, patting her stomach. Coatzintli didn't seem to hear her, too focused on devouring more and more food. Patli smiled and looked at her expanding stomach. Patli could feel the skin shifting as more and more entered the seemingly bottomless pit that was Coatzintli's stomach.  Patli rested her head upon the ever-growing mass, enjoying every second of what was occurring. <i>It <b>is</b> good to be the queen,</i> she thought to herself. Then, something happened that Patli wasn't expecting:</span></div></div>",

The servants had been bringing their plates up to rest on their gargantuan queen's forms so that Patli could personally feed her. As disrespectful as some might've have found this, it was the only way to make things practical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first servant to have fully ascended Coatzintli's bulk, to appear before the fattened face of her monarch, tripped. Not from any random act either. It was because Coatzintli had tried to lurched forward once her eyes rested on the large plate of food. Her food-addled state had blinded her to the fact that such an action was unnecessary. Food was only a few moments away. But she hadn't cared, she could no longer tolerate any interruptions in the stream of morsels given to her. She grew impatient and the poor servant paid for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Coatzintli couldn't move that much, her lurch had caused her immense bulk to wobble and shake. It was just enough that the servants struggled to stay upright given the large weight of the plates they were carrying. The servant fell forward even as she tried to remain balanced. As the servant and the plate came rushing towards her face, Coatzintli opened her mouth wide. But the palte and its food never made it to her mouth. No, it went sailing just over the queen's head. Instead the servant fell into her gaping maw. The poor girl barely had to scream in dismay before her head passed Coatzintli's lips and before anyone could do anything, the rest of the servant girl followed suit, disappearing down into the queen's gullet...</span></div></div>",

Patli came to her senses, whipping around and saying in a calm manner,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone just leave the food in this room. Wherever is fine; I would like some privacy with my queen.\" The servants obeyed, setting the food down and making their way out of the room, unsure as to what had changed. <i><b>My</b> queen</i>, Patli repeated to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli moved to feed the glutton lying before her, making sure not to make the same mistake as the now digesting servant had. Hours passed, and by the time Patli had run out of food Coatzintli was falling asleep, the digestion process tiring her. Patli had an internal dialogue with herself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this what I want from my queen? I'm loving every second of this, but I've lost the person who I fell in love with. What I have left is a pile of ever-growing bulk. Coatzintli's mind is gone, completely overtaken by a desire for food.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She is <b>my</b> queen, is she not? I can rule even if she cannot. And besides, she is in a clear state of euphoria over this whole situation, each piece of food increasing her pleasure and desire.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She ate a person! An actual person! I cannot simply overlook this... can I? Will anyone notice? What will people say?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She could eat the whole damn city for all I care! And why should I? I am the queen just as much as she is. I have the power, and she has willingly handed it over to me. As long as I keep her fed and keep this from happening again, things will be fine. Besides, I could always employ some... <u>political maneuvers</u> to keep things quiet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But that is awful! But... no. This is wrong. This is wrong on every level possible. Right? Isn't it? Of course it is. I have destroyed her, as a person. What made her unique, what made me love her, is now gone, replaced by a sack of corpulent flesh taking up more and more space in our castle. But... she does seem happy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli watched as her wife slept, her frame rising and lowering with each of her breaths. She still wasn't the size of her mother, but then again Coatzintli had said that she hadn't wanted to be. But, maybe she should be. Should she? Patli's desires flooded into her mind, and she moved to lean against the gurgling mass that was her stomach.  Patli found herself at a crossroad: her desire verse Coatzintli's. Who was to be the dominant queen, and who would roll over for the other?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some mornings later, Patli was slithering her way up to her beloveds\u2019 chambers. Clutched in her many arms were platters of rich food; the queen had not been eating as much as her wife had hoped, so she had made sure that the selection she brought up were extra strong-smelling, to tickle her pregnancy cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the super-sized double doors, Patli hip-checked them open. \u201cLi, I brought you some\u2026 meats\u2026\u201d she began, noticing that the room appeared empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the platters on the neatly-made bed, Patli began to slither around frantically, \u201cLI LI!\u201d She cried out, as her tail rolled over something on the floor. Turning around, the worried serpent found queen Coatlzintli\u2019s crown and royal finery. Oh gods! What if someone had kidnapped her!? She was pregnant with their babies! If she was put through too much stress, she might lose them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing from the room as fast as she could, Patli began to scour every square inch of the palace, notifying every guard that she could that the queen was missing. She checked the kitchens, the guard\u2019s quarters, but as Patli leaned out of a window, she spotted something. There was a figure in the royal gardens, not wearing the usual royal guard\u2019s armor. She couldn\u2019t make out who it was, so instantly made her way down the stairs and out into the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure hadn\u2019t gone very far from where the diminutive Naga had initially spotted them; dressed in a brown leather shawl to cover themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop right there!\u201d Patli yelled as she slithered up to the figure and snatched at the shawl; \u201cWhat\u2026 what are you doing here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of her, was her royal highness. Removed of all her royal jewelry, queen Coatlzintli looked struck a much less regal figure; her size however still kept her looking very imposing. In just those few weeks, she had grown even larger. Many pounds had clung themselves to her shape, and her belly was even more gravid than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I was hoping to get some exercise\u2026 outside\u2026 where nobody could see me\u2026\u201d Coatlzintli admitted, hands clutching her arms as she shifted nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gave me such a fright\u2026\u201d Patli replied. \u201cI thought someone had abducted you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatlzintli scowled, her four arms lowering to her belly and clutched it, \u201cDo you think anybody can abduct me like this? Look at me! I\u2019m huge!\u201d What proceeded was almost a guided tour of the queen\u2019s troubled parts; pinching her double chin, holding out her arms to show how they jiggled, hefting up her colossal breasts before letting them drop back to her belly. \u201cI can\u2019t get too big Patli, I need to shed some of this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli took Coatlzintli\u2019s hands in her own, \u201cI know you\u2019re frightened about this, but you need to be careful, too much stress can harm the children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatlzintli felt herself almost wishing she had never gotten pregnant; she wanted to at least see the world before relinquishing to her fate as a fat bloated egg-laying mass. It was such a selfish thought though, the young queen could barely look Patli in the eye as the idea rolled around in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026 just\u2026 let me get some fresh air before I go back inside.\u201d Coatlzintli stated as she eyed up one of the stone benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I will get the guards to call off the search.\u201d Patli agreed, as she left the queen alone to return indoors. Almost instantly she passed a hurried group of them; \u201cThe queen is just taking a break. Make sure nobody disturbs her.\u201d She instructed to the burly women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn\u2019t do at all, how was Coatlzintli supposed to get even close to her predecessor\u2019s size if she kept resisting nature like this? Patli would have to think up some kind of solution to the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later, and an idea finally came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatlzintli and Patli were sharing some private time together in their private chambers. Patli had to cuddle up next to her queen now; the gravidity of her majesties\u2019 form was making the idea of slithering under her life-threatening. Most of this however was centered in Coatlzintli\u2019s big pregnant belly; the queen hadn\u2019t been putting on weight quite as fast as she had in the past few weeks before the courtyard incident. It seemed her worrying was affecting her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair nuzzled together, Patli offered some more treats to her queen, dangling them above her head. The pair were sort of falling in and out of half-sleep, the larger of the two moreso though; and as Patli watched, her lover seemed to be more easily persuaded to eat like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when another sweet was dangled above Coatlzintli\u2019s head, and her long forked tongue lazily plucked it from Patli\u2019s brown fingers, an idea came to her. Making a mental note of her plan, she rested her head on the queen\u2019s shoulder and they both slipped into proper sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Patli slithered her way into the main barracks. There most of the royal guards who were not on duty were training. The building felt so much hotter and humid than the others, as the various snake-women trained. Biceps bulged, girl-abs strained, and long muscular tails flexed; for anyone that found such things attractive, they would have thought they had gone to the afterlife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Patli was not here to ogle, she was on a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to one particular part of the barracks, she found what were referred to as the Eagle Warriors. Naga that dressed in eagle feathers during battle, and were often the scouts and harassment troops; their speed and maneuverability being far greater than the burlier women in the barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention!\u201d Patli snapped, calling the slimmer women over. \u201cThe queen has become restless as of late; I need you to go into the jungles and find some medicinal herbs. The kind used for sleeping draughts.\u201d The Eagle Warriors simply saluted; Patli was the wife of her royal majesty, what she said goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Patli watched the women equip themselves for a trip into the deeper parts of the jungle, she smiled to herself. All she had to do was grind a little of the herbs into Coatlzintli\u2019s food, the mild sedative should make her easily suggestible, and more likely to give in to both her cravings and Patli\u2019s insistence that she overeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the plan anyway\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pregnant or no, Coatzintli was still expected to perform her duties as queen, and that meant one thing: playing host to the handful of cultures that were brave enough to venture this far into the jungles. In this case, she was expecting visitors from both the Samin Desert and the little mountain village of Futotta-Machi. She was used to the comings and goings of the Djinn scholars. They were always interested in the temples of her villages, specifically those dedicated to Ciros and Nilheia. They liked how the architecture of the temple aligned with the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, and were always wanting to study them. She couldn't understand why. If anything, the even larger temple to Zolneas was more impressive. It was also more active, as the Naga found a special affiliation with the serpentine goddess of fire. Still, the Djinn liked to flock to her capital, seeking to climb to the tops of these temples for a special place of meditation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune monk she was expecting from Futotta-Machi was another matter entirely. She knew very little about this race and their monks who resided in the monasteries located high in the snowy mountains. What she did know was that they were known for weaving the finest silks, hence her visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli rubbed her bump affectionately. \"Please cut me a break and don't cause trouble today,\" she whispered to it. Still in the early weeks of her pregnancy, she was still getting quite nauseous from time to time. She would prefer not to have a repeat of her incident with the duchess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first admitted into the palace was a silhouette she recognized very well. If one were just looking at his shadow, they would've assumed he were one of the hulking warlords of the south. Coatzintli knew better. Djinn males were often tall, broad, bulky, and angular, compared to their softer, smaller, and more curved female counterparts. She was certain that if she could stand on the tip of her tail, she would still be half a foot shorter than this giant. Knowing that the heat of the jungle was humid and wet, instead of dry like the desert he preferred, he had forgone his usual robes, wearing only his long, satin pants, allowing the queen to see the full extent of his bare chest, which looked chiseled enough to carve diamonds on. No...quit staring, Coatzintli told herself. She loved Patli, but there was no denying an exotic attractiveness exuded from this creature, and the vibrant indigo skin did nothing to help that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood before her, his fingers pyramided together as he gently bowed his head. She looked up at the two dark eyes that were so hard to read. Djinn were like that; they rarely expressed feelings, and so it was hard to know what they were thinking. They always had this expression of bemused curiosity on their face, as if they thought you were something to be studied and dissected. That was absurd, of course, she knew. They were usually very friendly, just hard to know exactly what to say with them. She returned the bow with her head. \"Mojit,\" she greeted, \"I am honored to have you as my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMojit finally smiled. \"The honor is all mine. I feel blessed to be with you to celebrate your latest joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded towards her protruding stomach, and she shyly looked down. That was a rather high compliment coming from the Djinn. They were not born like other creatures. At best, she understood them as ethereal beings that just came into existence. For him to attempt to empathize was rather high praise. \"I'm sure that's not all you're here for,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMojit laughed. \"Indeed, but perhaps we may discuss that over dinner. I have brought all your majesty's favorite treats from the south, and even a few spices I talked some sailors out of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she still did dislike the idea of eating constantly and getting huge, she couldn't help but acknowledge that Mojit knew her well. She did, after all, consider him a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have conversed longer, but they were interrupted by the arrival of her second guest. It was almost comical how much her two guests differed from each other. Whereas Mojit was boxy and angular, the Kitsune was rather round and plush-looking. No one could quite hold a candle to her mother's immense size, Coatzintli thought, but this one was sure trying. She stood at about her own height, but looked four, if not five times the size of the Naga queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rather interested in the unique appearance of these creatures. The monk's hair was as white as could be, and trailed down her back, brushing against the equally white and fluffy tails that trailed behind her. She wore a long, pale-pink robe and had an adorable, round, motherly looking face. As she finally waddled up to the queen, she did her best to bow. \"Mother Kayo,\" Coatzintli greeted. \"I hope you found your travel here pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman nodded. \"Indeed, I have been meaning to visit this place since I had heard of its existence. These jungles are simply gorgeous. Oh! I had no idea you were expecting. I would've brought you a special dress made of our silks if I had known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli only nodded. \"It's not necessary, but I thank you. I think we will still arrange a fair trade while you enjoy your stay. Mother Kayo, this is Sage Mojit, a Djinn from the Samin Desert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded to the Kitsune. \"I had heard of the Kitsune's alluring beauty, but I am thrilled to be seeing it in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, blushing. Coatzintli only rolled her eyes. Mojit was always such a charmer. He used to do it to her mother all the time. \"Well, why don't we take this all to the dining hall? Her majesty has prepared a welcome feast for you both,\" Patli said, coming through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was actually a rather pleasant affair. Her guests were both cordial, conversational, and the best part: no nausea. Coatzintli would actually have counted it a good night. \"I've heard your monks engage in a sort of active meditation,\" Mojit said to Mother Kayo, \"please, tell me more about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune dabbed her mouth with her napkin before speaking. \"It's really very simple. Our monks find activities which they enjoy and use them as a means of meditating and getting closer to the divine. For example, several of my sisters will tend to our beautiful cherry tree gardens as their meditation. One could even take up as simple an activity as cooking for this. Though, I say simple as if it's easy. We have one, Sister Ozami, who is an astounding chef. Some of her dishes...well, they're the reason I've put on a few pounds lately.\" She patted her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few? Well, Coatzintli reasoned, maybe the cook wasn't the only reason. Mojit nodded solemnly. \"It sounds very peaceful. I should perhaps visit your monastery in the future. Our scholars engage in several meditation strategies to gain enlightenment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mojit, you still haven't told me the reason for your visit,\" Coatzintli said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Well, we've been seeking more of a guarantee of our safety around here. The jungles are quite treacherous, and so many of us have been using paths through the catacombs to the west to get to the cities, but lately so many of them have disappeared. We would like a promise of our safety traveling through here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoatzintli thought for a moment, but eventually said, \"We've always been on good terms, Mojit. My people would never do you harm. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the Rakshasa, though. Perhaps we can arrange some sort of service to escort you and your people through the jungles? My warriors are used to those cats and could help take care of them for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Mojit said, closing his eyes. \"I will need to think on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that could take quite a while. Djinn were very contemplative and rarely made an instantaneous decision. \"It has been quite an eventful evening,\" Coatzintli finished. \"Perhaps I can give you both tours of the temples tomorrow. But for now, I think a good rest is in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried rising, but found that task to be quite difficult, as if something were weighing her down. Oh, gods! She looked down. Had her belly grown within the span of a few minutes. No, no, that couldn't be right. Yes, they were growing, but not that quickly. Oh! She looked at the massive spread of food on the table, or what had been the feast. Sure, the Kitsune woman ate quite a bit, but she had demolished quite a bit herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli seemed to figure it out and rose herself to show the two guests to the servants who would lead them to their rooms. She returned in a moment, a smug smile on her face. \"What are you so happy about?\" Coatzintli growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just proud of you,\" she said, touching her forehead affectionately. \"Looks like I'm not going to have to worry about you eating enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ha ha. You planned this somehow, I know you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wife chuckled. \"I did nothing of the sort. Did I force you to eat all that? Last time I checked, you did that yourself. If you're not doing it on your own, then the little ones certainly are. I told you before, they're hungry, and need plenty. It seems your own appetite got the best of you. Up you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatli slowly helped her up, placing a hand on her back as they went back to their own chambers. Coatzintli cursed her own appetite. This wasn't going to be easy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunlight drifted into the open windows of the temple, forcing Lalsini awake for yet another day of being the high priestess to Yva.  She lay there for just a few more blissful minutes, letting the sun warm her massive body. Many would have thought that the luxurious and pampered lifestyle of the high priestess must get boring after so many years, and indeed there were times where it was for Lalsini, but all in all, it was worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over and let her hand drift over the edge of her bed to scratch the head of her beloved Ajax. The handsome black leopard yawned sleepily and arched his back as his mistress continued to scratch. \"Mm, good morning, my love,\" she yawned sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his head tenderly on the edge of her belly, which was spilling over the side of her bed. It felt warm and tickled a bit. He was always so affectionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, Valendra, her eldest daughter came in to greet her with breakfast, or rather the feast that constituted as breakfast, for her. Lalsini had sixteen daughters to be exact, and her eldest three already had children of their own. Of course, she had had a few sons here or there, and three of them had been paired off well with only the best women in the village. Yes, Yva had blessed her with an incredible brood, though she was still young; there was time to have perhaps a couple more. She had proved a very fertile priestess over the years, easily able to conceive twins and once triplets. A few more little feet running around would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the grand spread before her, there was no doubt that the Dew-Drop Forest had indeed been blessed by the goddess. Biting into one of the succulent fruits offered to her, Lalsini relished her job as being the physical embodiment of the wealth of the land and her people. Certainly, she was that physical embodiment. She was a large, rotund woman, most of the weight settling in her round, doughy belly.  Twenty-some children and eating like a queen every day will do that to a person. That however, had not excused the rest of her body. A good portion of her weight laid in her enormous breasts, and she was not unaware of the thickening of her thighs. She found her double chin simply beautiful. Truly, she was the physical form of excess and fertility, her people expected her to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Valendra, you should join me,\" Lalsini said, remembering her manners. \"I couldn't possibly eat all this by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eldest, and as all her daughters lived with her and were treated just as well in the temple, Valendra was by no means small. Though, she was half her mother's age, more or less, meaning she was only half her size. She was a rather plump young woman, though now bordering on fat, and her mother just adored her beautiful round face. \"I think you could,\" she said coyly to her mother, \"but it does look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit,\" her mother said as Valendra joined her. \"Where's Diomedes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was referring to the lion companion who was never far from her daughter. He was a suitable mate, when she selected him for her eldest; powerful, protective, and not to bad on the eyes either. \"He's watching the kids,\" she replied, scratching behind Ajax's ear. The leopard purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was well past up when she finally finished eating, and Lalsini sat back to rub her full stomach. Ajax only too eagerly rushed to kneed her belly with his large paws. \"Oh, you are so good to me,\" she purred. She fingered the jade charm on her necklace which contained Ajax's human spirit. She was really tempted to have a little early morning delights with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as she loved this moment, it did not excuse her from the rest of her duties as high priestess. After a few minutes to let herself digest, she rolled back and forth a bit to get the momentum to stand and waddle to her main chambers where she held audiences with the villagers. Some of her fellow women would come to voice minor complaints, or she would hear from their fairy messengers. As always, she would be expected to ask Yva for her advice on such matters and come back with answers the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, she greeted a few of her other daughters who were enjoying the pleasures of the temple. It was so wonderful to see how happy they all were here. Huffing and puffing, she finally made it to the soft, velvety couch where she entertained those who came to voice their concerns. As always, some refreshments had been set out for her to snack on throughout the day; today it was a mix of nuts, wild berries, and fresh honey to dip them in. She settled in, Ajax resting at her feet, ready to take on just another day. Her first visitor was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A small, glowing, green figure hovered into her chambers. It bobbed and weaved about the room before alighting on Lalsini's hand. She was used to such visits. Many women hardly saw her in person. Rather, they sent their fairy messengers to relay information to each other. The fairies were a special gift from the gods, the druids believed. They spoke the language of the gods, and could only mimic human speech. They therefore served as wonderful companions for delivering important messages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLalsini recognized this one in particular. This adorable little, green fairy belonged to Mapelis, one of her closest friends. While sweet and kind, Mapelis was a bit of a glutton. Lalsini chuckled to herself, knowing this was probably another request for her to have lunch with the high priestess. That woman would do anything for the delicious temple food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was not the message she received at all. \"My lady,\" the fairy said, repeating her master's message, \"a miraculous sign has appeared! The central fire has been lit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was...unexpected. The great fire pit in the center of their village only became alight when the goddess Yva had something very important to say. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing always. But, usually Lalsini could always sense when such important matters were approaching before it came to this. She was completely blindsided by this turn of events. What could be so important that even the great goddess would not give her some inkling that something might be happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high priestess was now very curious, and she hefted her bulk up from her couch with quite a bit of effort. She needed to see this for herself. She called for a litter at once, as she was at such a size that she could no longer walk great distances without assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer party arrived at the center of the village shortly. Lalsini saw that already many women had gathered from the village to observe this strange phenomenon. It wasn't completely unheard of, but these instances were rare. Several of her own daughters had come with her to see it, many of them being too young to have remembered the last time this had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped down from her litter tentatively and approached the roaring flame in the stone fire pit before her. The yellow-orange flames danced in the sun. Mapelis approached her. \"Good, I see that you got my message,\" the rotund, dark-skinned woman said. \"I hope I wasn't disturbing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLalsini waved her off. \"This is a matter that takes precedence over any other business I may have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, you know what this means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess shook her head. \"I'm afraid not,\" she said. \"For once, Yva has not given me warning about this message. I shall have to meditate on it. Surely, this is an important sign, and I will need to stay vigilant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman bowed. \"I shall have all preparations made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had set up a small tent in front of the pit where Lalsini could sit and try to commune with the goddess. She never liked to brag, but one of the few things she could do well was establish a connection with nature to hear the will of Yva fairly quickly. She hoped this would not be a long ordeal. She had heard that priestesses in the past could sometimes go into trances for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted her ample rear down upon the cushioned pillows provided to her in the tent. A priestess always comes prepared, she knew. Lalsini took a few deep breaths and let her mind drift into nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all was not quiet. Murmurs and whispers were coming up among the villagers as they wondered in awe at this event. But, it was the next sounds she heard that troubled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adina, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLalsini opened one eye. Her six year-old daughter, Adina had begun to wander too close to the fire, and Valendra had gone after her. Just as the older sibling pulled her sister away from the fire, a stray flame licked Valendra's hand. Despite her immense size, Lalsini was up in an instant and went to tend to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valendra, are you okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mother, I'm fine. I was just trying to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValendra looked at her hand after her mother gasped. Unbelievably, where her hand should have been burned, or at least singed just a little, there was nothing. It was as if the flames had not touched her at all. Even stranger, mere seconds later, the fire in the pit dwindled down to nothing more but a few embers. Even more whispers emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I'm sorry,\" she said, tears forming in her eyes. \"I didn't mean to ruin anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLalsini said nothing, still unsure about what all of this meant. It was Mapleis who spoke. \"It's a sign from Yva. She...she's marked you somehow. You are untouched by fire. Lalsini, surely this is your sign. Surely you know this means that Yva intends for your own daughter to be the next high priestess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry of approval and merriment rose from the crowd. Lalsini's brow still furrowed in confusion. Valendra looked frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we sure that's what it means?\" Lalsini asked to Ajax that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lithe feline had been transformed back into a human. Lalsini did this frequently to spend the night with his company. He was tall and handsome, sure, with his dark hair and skin, and those gorgeous orange eyes, the same ones he had as a feline. But most importantly, he was a good listener, and sounding board when she was ever troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe curled himself around her, wrapping an arm over her pillowy waist. \"Such things have been known to happen,\" he said. \"You yourself were born under an eclipse. The goddess works in mysterious ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, that's not normal, is it? The position of high priestess has never been something hereditary before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"No, but it goes to someone who has the utmost respect and reverence for Yva. You've raised Valendra to be such. It does not surprise me in the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLalsini bit her lip. \"I just don't know. Something feels off about all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nuzzled her side. \"If you feel so worried about this, then reach out to Yva yourself. You always say to ask her whenever you're troubled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she nodded off to sleep, her mind plagued with a whirlwind of thoughts about today. She hoped the goddess would bless her with an answer while she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next day, the high priestess felt... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was not at all how this trip was supposed to go, Ketis thought as she was roughly tossed into what appeared to be a prison of sorts carved into the cavernous hole she had been swept up into. To many, such logical and rational thoughts during a time of distress such as this would seem strange. To Ketis, this was natural, and in some ways, distanced herself from the danger she was really in. Her captor had hardly said a word, and worse still, she had no idea what her captor looked like. It had all been such a blur. One minute she was checking her map, and the next, some sharp claws had snatched her up and carried her into the darkness before she could utter a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were still adjusting to the darkness as she scanned her surroundings. She had been traveling through the canyons on her way to Adinah. She had heard of a rare scroll she wanted to get her hands on, and the canyons seemed like the most logical route to take. It was much shorter and less dangerous than the jungles, she had thought. From what she could guess, looking around, she was still somewhere in the canyons, just within the walls of them. Ketis had seen several little holes pocketed along the high rock walls. She wondered what they were for. She supposed now, she would find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetis heard something shift in the darkness, and she pulled herself back as far in the cage as she could to avoid whatever it was. She tried to calm herself with rational thoughts. If her captor had intended to kill her, they would've done it already. They would not keep her prisoner. Again she heard more scuttling, but with the added screech of claws scrapping against the stone walls and ground. She almost screamed when she saw two pale faces peek in at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were humanoid in appearance, with feminine features, so she assumed them to be female. One was significantly older than the other, and she assumed from their traits that they were related. Perhaps a mother and daughter, or two sisters, she reasoned. Their faces were pale and angular. She could just barely make out claws on their fingers and she thought she saw a hint of scales below their waists. Their black hair was strewn about their faces, and their beady eyes never stopped looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll do,\" the older one said. \"You are getting lazy in your hunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one groaned. \"It's fine,\" she said. \"Look, she's already a little-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" the older one said in a mocking tone. \"The key word is 'little.' Do you see how much work it's going to take? We'll be wasting away before she's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger one huffed. \"Well, if she won't do, then why don't you go out and hunt? You've got legs, and you seem to be such an expert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrowed. \"Next time, maybe I will, and I won't share with you. You, come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe command was directed at Ketis. It seemed their argument had not distracted them enough from their prisoner. Shivering slightly, Ketis crawled over to where the older creature was waiting. \"W-what are you?\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" the creature screeched, and proceeded to grab Ketis through the stalagmites forming her cage and yanked her closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to inspect every inch of Ketis with her sharp claws. She felt her arms, pulled her closer to examine her face, and definitely took her sweet time pinching her rather soft sides. Ketis felt very uneasy even after the creature released her. \"Like I said, she'll do,\" she scoffed to the other. \"She's your catch. You take care of her. Just see how long it takes. And you call yourself a lamia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lamia,\" so that's what they were, Ketis realized. She had only heard of them from a few scant writings here or there, but no one had ever seen them or their culture up close. Probably because no one lived to. If she remembered right, they drank the blood of their victims, but that was all anyone really knew. So what did they mean about getting her \"ready?\" Surely by now they would have drained her and left her body to rot without a care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger one returned shortly, opening the one door to the cell, made out of a large stone that had to be rolled away. She slid a large wooden bowl in the cage. Ketis pulled it towards her and sniffed. It was some sort of grainy mixture, but it seemed edible. The lamia had shuffled away before she could ask any other questions. Reluctantly, she took a bite of the mealy substance. Again, it did not seem poisonous, so she ate a little bit more of it. It soon became apparent that this stuff was rather filling, and they had given her much more than she actually needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, that was it! Of course, why hadn't she put it together before. Yes, they drank the blood of their victims, but why just keep hunting? The bigger the prey, the more blood they had. It was so simple. Capture unsuspecting travelers, fatten them up until they were \"feast ready,\" and then they ate their victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetis paused for a moment to think this over. There was no way she was going to be able to avoid eating while she was here. Likely, the lamia would be checking up on her to make sure she ate her rations, and she hated to think what would happen if she didn't. There was no immediate escape either. Then again, these lamia did not seem like the brightest of creatures. She wondered. Maybe she could find a way to outsmart them and then escape. Yes, that was it. She'd have to observe them more to figure out their weaknesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why rush? This was a rare and unusual opportunity. She was going to see and be a part of lamia culture. She could document it all. The lamia had still left her with her bag of scrolls, ink, and quill. She would be the first to document how the lamia lived. All she had to do was stall for time. Again, these creatures weren't all that smart. She could make that work to her favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomach full and hard as a rock as she barely managed to polish off her first meal among the lamia, Ketis realized this wasn't at all how she planned this trip, but she would make the most of it. Maybe she could even fool them into giving her something better to eat than that mealy stuff. Hm, the possibilities.</span></div></div>",

For the most part, she wasn't afraid of her captors and let her fascination with their culture and behaviors be her coping mechanism to deal with this situation. That being said, she wasn't stupid either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day was practically the same. One of the two lamina would throw her a bowl with the grainy mixture roughly three, sometimes four times a day. Ketis also took notice that they seemed to give her a little more each day, hoping she would start to pack on pounds faster. The djinn scholar figured out how to play this right. For the most part, they left her unsupervised when she ate. She would eat perhaps half of the mixture, and would hide the rest under rocks, or once she dug a small hole in the ground to hide the extra rations. After enough observations, she discovered what the mixture was made of. It was some kind of meal made from grounding up the various mushrooms and fungi found in these caverns. A few other things were added, but it was mostly the fungi. It didn't taste bad, but it sure wasn't tempting either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, that didn't change the fact that the food was addictive. It had to be something in the mushrooms themselves that caused this, Ketis reasoned. Every day, after finishing her meals, she longed for the mixture thrice more, despite how bad it tasted. For now, she was able to fight these urges, but there were some nights where she would eat a little of the extra rations she stowed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it certainly did what it was expected to do. The mealy substance added weight to her frame rather quickly, even if she wasn't eating her full rations. She was getting wider and softer with each passing day. Every day, the lamina would demand that she stand close enough for them to inspect her. They pinched, prodded, and poked every bit of her, always finding that she was getting plumper, but thankfully, not fast enough to their liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Ketis feared that they might decide that she wasn't worth the time and drain her right there, but something else changed all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe djinn was used to the quiet in her cell. Her captors rarely talked to her, and when they did, it was taunting her with how fat she was becoming as they inspected her. Any other noises she heard from the two usually came when they were bickering at each other. Today was much different. Ketis awoke that morning to the sounds of thumps, bumps, and lots of screaming. She bolted upright to see the two lamina dragging some human girl into another stone cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a rather pretty girl, blonde hair that fell into delightful curls, blue eyes that looked like ice. She was dressed rather richly as well, and Ketis figured she was some noble from the city. However, it was unmistakably clear that the girl was rather fat, her plump, round gut bobbing and wobbling with each forced step she took as the lamina dragged her in. She had rosy round cheeks with plushy little arms and legs. Not a bit of her was thin. She wouldn't last long here, Ketis thought, feeling sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\" the girl roared. \"I am Maurlie Elbrey, daughter of Lord Elbrey, and when he hears what you did to my traveling party, you'll pay dearly! Do you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe Ketis didn't feel so sorry for her. She seemed like a spoiled brat. At the same time, she couldn't contain her excitement. She was about to witness how Lamina fattened their victims, without her being the victim that is. She was ready to take notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two creatures finally shoved the girl into the cell, where she fell face first and rolled about the dirty ground. \"Oh, I'm going to make you wish you were never born!\" she cursed. \"How dare you treat a lord's daughter this way? I demand to speak to whoever is in charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters paid very little attention to her and talked as if she weren't there. \"Now see,\" said the older one, \"that is how you catch prey that's actually worth the time. Your skinny little catch isn't anywhere close to this one's size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other rolled her eyes. \"Whatever. Look, you've got one, I've got one. We take care of our own in our own way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suits me just fine, but take good notes, dear sister; I've been doing it right for years. Now, go get me a bowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger one was still much too submissive in front of her sister to argue, and scampered away to grab a large bowl of the meal. They slid it over to their new prisoner. \"What in all the gods' names is that?\" she said with a look of pure disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's food, and you're going to eat it,\" the elder lamina hissed. \"Or so help you if you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoiled noble began to throw a fit. \"I will do no such thing. You can't order me around, and I'm not eating this slop! How dare you serve this to someone of my stature?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older lamina shuffled over to the other side of the cage and yanked the girl over by one of her plump arms. She squealed in terror. \"You'll eat it, my dear, and like it, or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl kicked the bowl and its contents splattered all over the cell, and some of it onto the face of her captor. \"No!\" she said again. \"If you're going to feed me, you are to bring me food fit for my stature. Now, away with you.\"</span></div></div>",

Not only she had just dissed and insulted a being that was more than capable than sucking her blood dry, she just did it in a closed cage with nowhere to scape to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was both figuratively and literally like teasing a giant cobra once you are inside its pit. She had to give it to Maurlie, she stood her ground like a proud royal, but maybe her father should have used some of his money to teach her how to behave on a hostage situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is about to get Interesting\u201d \u2013 Ketis said to herself, muffling her own voice to not call the attention of the Lamia.<br>\r\nThe Lamia slowly rose, losing her hunched posture, becoming taller and far more threatening, took a quick breath and launched herself over the girl making a hissing sound which echoed through the darkness of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry, what was what you said?\u201d \u2013 Said the Lamia over the girl\u2019s body as her serpentine arms lift and wrapped around the chubby figure of Maurlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, I\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human girl struggled trying to release herself from the lamia\u2019s tight hug, but judging by the way her body contorted on the pressure it seemed that not even the strongest human in all of Yndyre would have it easy to scape, so the chances of a rich noble girl who never had to lift anything heavier than a fancy purse were practically nonexistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetis knew that it was a morbid spectacle, that may end up with some blood, well lots of it, splattered around, but her scientific intrigue was pushing her to see it in first row and take note of all of the details. If she was going to die anyway, at least she would take a chance to learn from the experience!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember you said that my food is not good enough for you?\u201d - Inquired the lamia. - \u201cDo you have an idea of how hard is for us to fetch all those mushrooms? to cook\u2019em at the right temperature? And season them with the right herbs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaurlie did not answer, most likely because she was barely capable to breath under the Lamias embrace, let alone speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I <i>apologize my ~lady~</i> you are going to <b>eat them one way or the other, you hear!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment the Lamia stared directly into Maurlie\u2019s eyes and began doing what Ketis would only assume was some type of hypnotic enchantment as her eyes glow yellow, red, and orange in different patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ketis It was incredibly fascinating, terrifying and utterly horrific, but fascinating nonetheless. She had seen similar behaviors back into the desert, where cobras and other reptilians would lure their prey with their eyes down into their lairs to devour them more comfortably, no surprise Lamias could do it too! She wondered if Nagas could do the same, although if it was just like that she found weird that they had not used on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Yet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was extremely exhausting to perform so they only used it when absolutely necessary or when confronted with a less than cooperative prey, as it was the case. So she kept a close look upon the macabre spectacle. One for her research, two to aid the poor girl after its done and three find a way to avoid it ever happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamia stared into the girl for what appeared to be a few minutes, after which she just relaxed her body and left the human fell into the humid floor of the cavern, after which she just walked away from the cell, noticeably fatigued, as she needed to be supported by her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will show her\u201d \u2013Said the serpentine woman \u2013 \u201cAnd for you, girl, you better behave if you don\u2019t want to face a similar fate\u201d- Remarked at Ketis, who still was lying in the back of the cavern cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Lamias left the small cavern, introducing themselves into the pitch black darkness from the rest of the caves, leaving Ketis and the unconscious Maurlie alone inside the cell, not before leaving another rounds of mushroom mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Djinn did not lose a moment and immediately went to attend the human girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the chubby woman she could immediately notice the level of violence the Lamias were capable to exert by just rolling themselves on their victim; Maurlie\u2019s skin was all red with bruises along the areas the reptilian woman had co<div align=\"justify\"></div>ntorted on her body, and her face was pale with a faint bluish tone, probably due asphyxia, no surprise she had fainted, the girl probably couldn\u2019t even breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetis was ready to lay the girl down in her lap to check her other vital signs when suddenly and without a warning Maurlie just\u2026woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a swift move Maurlie, who a few moments ago had just been knocked out unconscious, straight opened her eyes and stood up, cleaned her dress and started to pick up the leftovers of the plate she discarded and place it along the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to add to Ketis surprise, Maurlie sat and started to eat the mush. Not even showing a slight hint of disgust or the repulsion she had previously exposed, no, all the contraire she slowly downed every bowl with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ketis this was obviously result of the hypnotic stare of the Lamia, if not she could not explain the sudden change of the human girl and her utterly lack of concern about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Maurlie\u2026</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Letilla was bored, she sat down in cave, overlooking the canyon floor. It seemed that the travelers, merchants, and others of the South found a new route to go through. She cursed herself, she couldn't be that pessimistic, travel was just slow right now. Letilla stretched, her feet dangling out of the overlook. Maybe she shouldn't have given her cattle up. But they became too much of a hassle of when they got bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetilla placed her head into her hand, what could she do? Well, she could converse with her \"sisters\" for intellectual stimulation, and possibly for help. Hopefully they were still full enough to actually want to converse. If they were smaller, she would be hard pressed to have an conversation that didn't revolve around food. With that, Letilla sat up from her seat, looked down and jumped from her thirty story cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nTen or so Lamia were all over the floor, their rotund bodies were really spread out. Some were in the realm of possibility, others were mountains of flesh. Letilla grimaced at them, lucky for her weird blessing she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, unlike the other Lamia, Letilla didn't gain weight all around her body. Instead it focuses more on one area of her, her lower body. Special focus was on her rear end. Giving Letilla more flexibility in fitting in some area, her vampire strength allowing her to easily carry her weight. Some even called her \"The Herald of Derrria\", which she found most flattering. It did come with some downsides however, like the fact that if she stood up too fast, she could fall on her rump. The fact that birds mistook it as a perch. The fact that when merchants that even the Lamia couldn't overwhelm traveler traveled to the Catacombs,they saw her ass as a target. There were more, but that was,in her mind,the most grievous of downsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Letilla's ass and hips were large, but not insanely large, yet. Her fae, almost beatific upper body, contrasting with the lower half of a well fed noble. With only a loincloth for decency, Letilla's rear jiggled for the Catacombs. Not that the residents cared, most Lamia were fine with nudity. A ass like that wasn't too strange, she was smaller than the other currently. Letilla went to the largest mountain of flesh, giving it a quick hip bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Letilla. Pray tell what do you want?\" It was Cassandra, the self proclaimed \"Matriarch\" of the lamia. Which she did back up, both because of her mind and rotundas size. Somehow keeping it, even in times of \"famine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matriarch, I politely incline that I may travel out to the world. Maybe I could find the source of our losing supply?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra looked at Letilla, and smiled at her. \"Well of course,we do need to do something about it, thank you for jogging my memory dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Cassandra stood up, her true height equal to the biggest of Minotaurs. Letilla didn't flinch, she saw this too many times, besides if Cassandra wanted you dead at this range, you wouldn't even have time to react. Shambling off, Letilla watched Cassandra leave to her massive \"palace-cave\". Cassandra disappeared from sight, Letilla walked over and sat upon another lamia. That lamia felt Letilla and futility tried to knock her off, she was unsuccessful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Cassandra waddled her way to Letilla, gifting her a cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll protect from the sun my dear, don't worry about other articles of clothing, just wear the cloak. With that, I name you \"Blood Mistress: Voice of the lamia\", now go out and find out why the travelers haven't been coming. And bring them back to our home!\" With that, Cassandra slumped back down into her torpor. Leaving Letilla with a cloak and her mission. She could explore the outside world, and maybe go look for why the Catacombs were loosing its merchants.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Caverns of Sarkos has always been an uninviting place. A labyrinthine inner structure that guarantees all outsiders are doomed to be lost forever. The unstable sharp pillars of rocks that hang in the ceiling of the caves, looking ready to fall down on any unsuspecting traveler at a moment's notice. The dry feel of the rocky terrain, further accentuating how barren of liveliness this accursed region is. The rows upon rows of previous wandering souls, all frozen in stone, faces deformed by fear and terror, lined up rather neatly around every corner of the caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombine all that with this being the den of the Gorgons, and anyone in their right mind would correctly label the Caverns of Sarkos a literal Hell on Earth. Perhaps not the entire fiery pit, but definitely one of its many levels of suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such statue-that-was-once-a-breathing-human nearly topples to the ground by the passing force of a hurried body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...!\" the figure, cloaked in a body-covering hood that was once an opulent red curtain, hisses in alarm and reaches to steady the lifeless statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe manages to save the lifeless exhibit from crumbling to pieces on the ground, more so to prevent any noise of giving away her presence. She sighs in relief, the immediate danger over. Her mind is now free to study the frozen corpse before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what did they do to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a young woman. Human. Dressed in the familiar sleeveless blouse and skirt of those from Roiling Bay way down at the South. How someone from that fishing village found themselves way up here is anyone's guess. It doesn't change how such a young and pretty soul didn't deserve having her life cut abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Damus guide you to rest,\" she stretches her sharp-nailed, scaly arms forward, caressing the statue's fearful, tear-streaked face, leaning close to plant a kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRespectful rites delivered, she turns around quickly, continuing down the labyrinth in hurry. Her feet strike against the stone surface, careful to not kick any loose rocks or pebbles as she makes her way beyond, out to where freedom awaits. She passes more and more of the petrified victims, but she doesn't stop. She's careful not to knock them over, but she continues on as though in a race against time. And really, she is; she has until dawn to make it out. The sun rises, and as does all life back at the temple. The priests and guards realize she's gone, and there will be search parties out to get her, only giving up once it becomes clear she is no longer in the region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of that makes her pick up the pace. Slowly her hurried walk turns into a short jog. She must be out of the region by daylight. She must get away <i>now</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind drifts back into what has led her on this path. The life of the Priestess of Sarkos is by all means a grand one. Carrying the honor of representing the will of the gods, having everyone look to you as the beacon of wisdom and guidance, and, most enticing of all, have all your needs and wants satisfied, never in short supply of the most succulent of meats, the finest drink, and the utmost reverence from your peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at the sacrifice of personal freedom. For your service to the gods, you must never set foot outside the world of mortals, for you now belong to the gods. For your stance as fountain of wisdom and guidance, you must sever all ties to family and loved ones, for you no longer walk among them. For your ascent to the highest stance, you must never move for yourself, for the people are now your extended limbs and it is sin to strain your divine-worthy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe life all Gorgon maidens are raised to aspire towards. Locked inside a gilded cage, safe and sober, yet sapped of all worldly connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo young Medea, that was no way of life. Her family wanted her to have that life, not her. Her society forced her to take up the mantle, with her having no say in the matter. Once, Medea had thought to entertain them, to let her be made Priestess and give them what they want. And yet, the more she thought about, the more she realized there would be no turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrimming with determination, she keeps at her hurried pace, navigating the labyrinth with the ease curious travelers and trespassers wished they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cloak billows suddenly, a gentle but firm breeze suddenly hitting her. Looking forward, she can see the outline of the cave's entrance, providing a great view of the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has made it out at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea outright dashes, momentarily overcome with exhilaration as she has finally made it to her destination. She runs, her triple-toed, scaly feet kicking away at the rocky terrain. She runs, her lips curling into a bittersweet smile as she is filled to the brim with excitement and sadness. Once she's at a reasonable distance, she comes to a halt and turns around, her hands shooting up to lower her makeshift hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since she was very young, when she would go out recklessly and explore, Medea looks upon the entrance to her beloved home from the outside. She can understand why travelers would wander in. To any outsider, the cavern entrance is nothing short of awe-inspiring. A gigantic formation of rock, protruding from the ground in the shape of a windpipe, with four distinct jagged pillars, two hanging from the ceiling, two more on the ground, creating the impression of a snake's fangs. The real marvel, however, is how the jagged pillars are made of luminescent stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea looks upon the entrance to her home somberly, the snakes that make up her hair writhing in anxiety. For what must be the umpteenth time, she wonders what consequences her actions will entail. She runs away, and she'll no doubt be condemning another maiden to be made Priestess. She goes back, and she will be miserable for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a deep breath, and lets it out. She turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell, all...\" she whispers to the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covers her face with the hood once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she walks anew, heading towards an unknowable destiny. It might be a mystery, but at least she has chosen it. Whatever comes, she is ready to accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is...where to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes gaze upon the massive landscape before her. Such an open world, and no clear destination in sight or in mind. Medea had forgotten how awfully big the world was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she must move. She can't linger anywhere near the Caverns of Sarkos, or anywhere in the West for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she steels herself. With renewed determination, she moves forward, heading in the direction of...</span></div></div>",

There are plains of grass as far as the eye can see, and the roads are clear and straight. Nothing at all like the disjointed, desolate, rocky ranges of the West. Already there is a sharp contrast to what she is used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Medea is loving it. Yes, the air is cooler, and it does feel odd to traverse a region that is nowhere near as rocky as back home, but such change exhilarates her. This must be what being on an adventure feels like!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, if she had a map, she'd know she's still a long way from being in the inner part of the North. Definitely nowhere near close to, say, Racovania. But she knows she's gone in the right direction, and not just because of the colder climate and the winter snowfall. The legendary mountain range of Overvektige Peaks is visible even from where she is. Not close, and yet she can make out the distant silhouettes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, right now her first priorities are another matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, she's been traveling from West to North for...three days, she thinks. It's so easy to lose track of the flow of time. The sun and moon <i>had </i>gone down three times, right? But...the sun had gone down just now, so maybe she was on her fourth day? Ugh, her head was spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint being, she had been traveling on foot for only the gods know how long, and she was <i>tired</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly...actually, wait. Three...two...one--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>GRRRRRRRRWL</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, right on time. The angry cries of her belly, demanding sustenance. It had been growling like so and hurting for a while now. She was <i>starved</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired and hungry. Not a favorable combination. Worse, there was no sign of civilization anywhere. No village in sight--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLights. Out of the corner of her eye. Curious, she looks to the side, and lo, as though the gods heard her plight, there lies a small settlement. Nothing extraordinarily big, but there are buildings. One of those must certainly be an inn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Zolneas be praised!\" Medea beamed. \"Her fire guides me to sanctuary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy! Outta tha way, gobshite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmed, the Gorgon clutches her hooded cloak to herself tightly, turning around in defense against the traveling merchant who'd rudely shouted at her. The twin horses pulling the merchant's cart whinny in discontent as their driver yanks the lead ropes to avoid trampling the idiot on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wont to die?!\" the portly man slurred. \"Git outta tha road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea regarded the human, careful to keep her eyes hidden under her hood. \"Oh, a thousand pardons, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made to step to the side, but winced as she put force on her foot upon taking a step. She experimented with her other foot, finding the results to be the same; her soles making contact with the earth resulted in a little pain. Looks like her feet had all but given up at the notion of more walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, excuse me?\" Medea asked politely. \"Sorry to be a bother, but are you, by chance, heading for that small town down the road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah?\" the merchant blinked before responding slowly. \"Aye. Got a stop ta make. Lots o' goods to drop. Whatsit to ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, if it's no trouble...\" Medea crossed her arms behind her back and craned her upper body forward, unintentionally making her big breasts bounce. \"May I ride on your cart? Our destinations are one and the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy, oy, oy! Wot do I look like, da royal carriage?!\" the human's face curled in disgust. \"Ain't my problem wot sort of wench wanders too far off home! Now outta da road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea, surprised, took a step forward. \"Sir? Have I...Have I offended you in some way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy, bitch,\" the merchant growled. \"I won't say it 'gain. Outta the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particularly strong breeze came, blowing at Medea's cloak powerfully. She managed to keep her hood on her face, but the rest of her body was momentarily exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe traveling merchant's eyes beheld the lime-green scales with black lines. For the first time, he took a good look at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at once, he blanched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the ride, kind sir!\" Medea smiled, jumping from the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant gave a curt grunt, keeping his gaze forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safe travels!\" Medea waved in farewell, heading in the direction of the inn, cheerfully ignoring how the man muttered some odd curse and something about never setting foot on this \"cursed region\" ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans can be so funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled again. She rubbed a tender hand on its flat surface. And the pain in her feet shot up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made for the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another beer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tavern-inn was lively this evening. Patrons everywhere, ordering big while the beautiful barmaids went about with smiles. To complete the merry image, the band was playing a lively tune, with one of the barmaids singing a jolly shanty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, Dani!\" one of the many barmaids groused playfully. \"Don't go getting all the attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike me for doing my job, Elsa!\" Daniela snarked, swinging her broad hips mockingly in the direction of her co-worker as she served a fresh glass of beer to a customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you two,\" Marta, one of the bustier barmaids, smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her place behind the bar, Adela the owner took a puff from her pipe, enjoying the sight of her business booming and her girls happily working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, nothing could destroy this merry image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! New customer!\" Frenda, a young blonde and one of the newer workers, announced. \"Welcome to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela quirked a raven eyebrow at the young lady's greeting ending in a horrified whimper. What could have provoked such a response? She and everybody else looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new arrival was intriguing on first sight, covered in what appeared to be a curtain of rich red fiber that had seen better days. It was draped over the figure like a cloak, a makeshift hood sewed on it. The individual's eyes were hidden by the shadows of the hood, and the cloak did a great job covering her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for her arms and legs. Her limbs, bare and covered in lime-colored scales with black lines. But her feet. Three toes splayed out, tipped by a black talon, and a fourth toe dangling by the ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that long, reptilian tail trailing and wiggling behind her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization struck everyone in the room like thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea, for her part, kept calm under all the stunned stares and made her way to the center of the bar. \"Uh, yes, excuse me? May I speak with the owner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela recovered quickly from the shock. She'd seen a lot in her travels before she settled down as an inn owner. A Gorgon suddenly showing up was unexpected, but not unwelcome. \"Ah, that would be me. How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea smiled and bowed her head forward in respect. Hopefully that little gesture would put all the other humans at ease. \"I request a room for the night. How much--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no need,\" Adela waved her pipe dismissively. \"Plenty of income has come in tonight, and far be it for me to charge the first Gorgon to ever set foot in my inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea bowed gratefully. \"You are most generous, Miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adela,\" the slender woman smiled. \"Anything else I may provide you with besides a room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the snake woman's stomach protested loudly for all to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea blushed. \"Some food and drink would be good, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela chuckled. \"Have a seat. One of my girls will see to it.\" She dutifully ignored the looks of abject horror and betrayal she received from said barmaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea simply smiled, sitting down at the closest table, causing every other patron to either scoot away or to outright leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's keeping you girls?\" Adela drawled, eyeing the fidgeting huddle that was her workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-D-D-Do we ha-ha-have to?!\" Elsa whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela brought down her pipe, and at once her youthful features looked narrower. \"Fine then, I'll make this simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaids breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frenda, tend to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\" the blonde wailed as the other girls edged away from her as though she was cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't finish your greeting,\" Adela shrugged. \"Now get to it. We don't make customers wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea smiled warmly. \"Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe received a startled yelp in response. Medea sighed inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer travels were going to be interesting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The young barmaid, Frenda, said hardly a word to Medea as she took her order. Her eyes fixated on the gorgon's scaly tail. Medea tried to put her at ease. \"Oh, you like it?\" she joked, wriggling her tail. \"I promise, it won't bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda squealed and retreated back to the kitchens. Medea shrugged and sighed, hoping things would get better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, she had been considered quite beautiful, even as a child. She could remember friends and neighbors telling her parents what an adorable child she was. And as a young maiden, she had been known to get a few sweet honey treats from some of the men who were too shy to speak to her. Of course, the favorites among the potential candidates for future priestess were always beautiful, she remembered. A priestess was supposed to be perfect, unblemished, a treat for the eyes of the gods. She hated that she was pretty for that reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this was no time to be thinking about home. She had made her decision and there was no turning back. Even if she did come back, she'd be more than just shunned by her people. Who knows what they would decide would be her punishment for running away from such an important position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Frenda came with her food, she slid the plates over to the gorgon gently, trying to keep her distance, as if the creature would swallow her whole then and there. Medea politely said thank you, and decided to keep it like that. One step at a time, she thought. If she could show them how kind she could be, maybe they would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roaring of her stomach disrupted her thoughts and she knew food was the top priority now. She didn't realize that humans had such a variety of foods. Gorgons weren't really farmers, as there wasn't much in the way of rich soil and sunlight in the caverns. Meat was whatever was dumb enough to wander too deep in the caves. Mostly, they kept to a diet of whatever naturally growing plants there were in the caves and a few smaller creatures they could trap. Honey combs were kept in the caves, but only as the occasional treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat lay before her was much more than that. Fresh, steaming bread, something she had never seen before, and a thick stew made with a heavy and greasy meat of some kind with root vegetables. Gods be praised, why hadn't her people heard of such bounty? She dug in with gusto, devouring her food with relish. It tasted just as good as it looked, and before she knew it, she had ordered another bowl of stew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and saw the barmaids and the other patrons looking at her fearfully. Oh, she must've looked a terrible sight eating impolitely like that. She wiped a bit of meat juice off her cheek and smiled, trying now to eat her food slower and savoring each bite. It was even better that way anyway, she reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other barmaids gossiped among themselves about their new patron. \"You think...you think she's a scout?\" Frenda asked fretfully. \"They're...they're planning to come and slaughter us aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to wimper into Marta's generous chest. The bustier lass stroked her hair. \"No, of course not,\" she soothed. \"Still, what are those things doing on the surface? We left them, and they left us alone. That's how it's always been, always should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa shuddered. \"Do you see those feet? Ugh, they're so ugly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela was the only one with a spine in the bunch. \"Yeah, well, beast or no beast, I'm making my tips tonight.\" She strode over to Medea with her fresh bowl of stew. \"There you go, enjoy,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea beamed back. \"Oh, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani wasn't sure what prompted her to do so. Perhaps she was just curious, or maybe she really did see the gorgon as friendly. \"So, uh, what brings you here? I mean, don't get a lot of...whatever it is you are around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon seemed as though she were waiting for that question all night. \"Oh! You really want to hear it. It's the awfullest thing. See, there's this temple, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door flew open as a weary traveler stumbled in the door. The wind blustered through the halls. He forced the door shut and turned about to the rest of the bar. \"Cold as Damus' heart out there,\" he muttered. \"Winds took a right mighty chill all of a sudden. Oi, innkeep, get me a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared distantly down the bar, mouth agape. He raised a hand, pointing a shaky finger across the way, right at Medea. The winds had blown her hood off and now everyone could see her exactly as she was. Much like the rest of her, her skin was a vibrant lime green, smooth and delicate. If she were a human, she would have been called quite beautiful, and many men would have fought for her hand. It was the golden yellow eyes that seemed to pierce through one's skin and the writhing mass of forest green snakes wriggling on her head that sent shivers down the spines of all the patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea gasped, and whipped her hood back up, trying to conceal her tears. Even Dani, who she was so close to making a connection with had started to back away. As she looked around, she saw that all the patrons had scooted to the far corners of the bar, deliberately averting their gaze from her. She knew why. She had heard the rumors humans made up about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait,\" she tried to explain. \"We don't turn people to stone...not on purpose...I mean, not unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela marched up to her, her cheery demeanor now gone. \"I've had enough of this nonsense,\" she shouted to the entire bar. Then she wheeled around on Medea. \"You've caused enough trouble for one night. I want you...</span></div></div>",

But, upon looking at Medea's downcast face, she softened a bit. \"Look, it's nothing against you, but I can't have you scaring away my customers. Just...don't come down until business hours are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea wanted to speak, wanted to yell, scream, do something. How could they treat her like this? All she had done was be nice. And now, they wanted to treat her like some sort of ugly child that was to be hidden from the world. They wanted to treat her like...like a monster, she realized. Her parents had always warned her that humans couldn't be trusted, that they couldn't understand. She wanted to think they were wrong, that some humans were nice. But, she had been proven wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of saying anything, she ran up the stairs to the open bedroom, tears streaming down her face. She threw herself down upon the bed and sobbed into the pillows. How could they be so cruel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know at what point her sobs led to a deep sleep, but she drifted off and only woke when the light started shining through her windows. Medea wanted to just lay there and continue to mope. Not more than a week being free from her oppressive environment among the gorgons, and she had proved she couldn't hack it on her own. She couldn't go home, though, so what was she to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea didn't get too long to dwell on these thoughts. One of the barmaids from last night was already in her room, opening the curtains and starting to straighten up. It was the braver one, Dani. None of the others would have probably wanted to come up here unless Adela bribed them, and even then, they probably would have found an excuse not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up and at it!\" Dani called to the gorgon, starting to grab the sheets off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea growled. If it was a monster they wanted, it would be a monster they got. \"Oh, is it safe now for me to show my face? I wouldn't have wanted to ruin your business,\" she mocked. \"Last time I checked, it was my room. I don't have to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't like being mean, but after the way they treated her last night, she felt they deserved it. Away from home and afraid she may be, but she wasn't about to roll over and be treated like some pest by these people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani let out a snorting laugh. \"Oh, really? You thought that was a permanent thing? Honey, please, Adela let you have the room for the night. She made enough that she was in good spirits. You want to keep the room, then you'd better start forking over some coin. Adela's only generous once in a decade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically, Adela hadn't said that, but it was fairly well implied, Dani thought. Adela didn't just give stuff away for free. A combination of good business and a little too much to drink last night made her a little loose-lipped last night. But after all that had happened, Adela wasn't soon going to be making that mistake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea gasped. She hadn't  thought about anything like that. Gorgons didn't exactly use currency. More or less, everything was traded and bartered, food necessities being the main commodity. But, in the brief time she had been out in the outside world, she became minutely aware of the currency exchange humans engaged in. But, how to obtain it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon looked frantically about. \"But, I don't have nay money. How am I supposed to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a job, duh,\" Dani scoffed. \"Gods, what do you do, live under a rock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind. Point is, you have to earn your keep around these parts. Life ain't all smiles and sunshine like it is in Adinah. This is the north: life's tough, and you get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe coming up here wasn't such a good idea, she thought. If she had known it was that bad, she might have reconsidered. More and more, this excursion was becoming less of an adventure and more of an ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, what could she do? She didn't exactly know what sort of jobs there were around here. She didn't really know what she could even do. Her whole life, she was raised to potentially be the high priestess. Plus, there was the matter of what she was. People would take one look at her, and that would be the end of a job. But her luck had to turn around at some point, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" she asked. \"I've never had a job before. I don't even know what sorts of things I'd be good at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani rolled her eyes. \"Have to teach you everything. Maybe you could...\"</span></div></div>",

A crude, mocking joke. This gorgon, working as a barmaid? Flay the thought! It was just impossible. Adela would never permit it unless she was looking to scare away customers and become a social pariah. And like any good tavern owner, she would not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she would, then Dani hoped to be struck down by Ardoid's arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then!\" Medea stood up from the bed confidently, straightening her back and leaning her head back like a sophisticated lord would. \"I'll see to Lady Adela about the job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in your dreams!\" Dani snorted, a cocky smirk spreading her lips. \"But I'll indulge you. Let's go to her room and watch you get thrown out for all the town to see! Let me just go get the other girls...all staff must be present!\" she added quickly upon receiving a dull glare from the snake woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then,\" Medea said slowly, tightening her cloak around her in a stiff manner before she marched out towards the door, her pace one of utmost confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost a shame, Daniela thought, that such admirable determination was about to be completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>***</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemingly came to a halt. Or rather, the entire room froze over as though suddenly perched on the highest point of the Overvektige Peaks. The assembled barmaids felt as such, with varying emotions of shock and horror to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSave for Medea, whose smile was as bright as the morning sun as she beamed at the lean-but-curvy, raven-haired woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huggah...huggfuuu...honna...WHAT?!\" Elsa managed, looking to be on the very verge of foaming at the mouth. \"M-M-M-Ma'am, what in the gods' collective pantheon--?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She works for us now,\" Adela reiterated coolly, earning horrified wails from her working girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung blonde, waify Frenda looked as though she had been told she would be taken in her sleep. She fell back as though to faint, but instead fell onto Marta's generous chest, the brunette steadying the younger girl by the shoulders while looking between Adela and the gorgon in shock. Elsa outright fainted, her black hair spreading on the floor. Daniela...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ardoid, strike me down.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much, Lady Adela!\" Medea bowed gratefully. \"I don't deserve such kindness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flatter me,\" Adela smiled and waved a dismissive hand, secretly enjoying the praise from such a feared being. Her inviting countenance shifted into one of business. \"Think of it as payback. The free night is on me, but you owe me some revenue in light of the customers you scared away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea frowned and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unintentional or not. Life can be unkind,\" the raven-haired woman droned before the gorgon could speak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With respect, Ma'am,\" Daniela cut in. \"Wouldn't this be cancerous for profit? Patrons <i>are </i>terrified of her at first sight,\" she paused, registering the other trembling barmaids and her own (loathe she was to admit it) unease. \"And us, too. Which would not be effective for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I mean to scare you lot...\" Medea grumbled under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela responded to the concerns by reaching for her pipe, igniting it, and taking a strong puff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the customers, just cover Medea's head, scales, tail, and just about anything that gives away her true nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we mummify her?\" Marta joked weakly, yelping as she earned a weary look from the gorgon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for <i>your </i>concerns,\" here Adela released a cloud of smoke just as her patient countenance shifted into an annoyed scowl. \"What are you, tavern ladies, or unweaned babies? Do I have to hold your hands through everything, hmm?! Whisper words of encouragement to go along with it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the young ladies present straightened up in alarm at the sudden shrill tone. For the barmaids, they were familiar with how Adela would get when coming down from a hangover or when one too many nonsense took place. They vividly remembered that time one particularly trigger-happy patron got mighty pissed and, in his stupor, tried to pick a fight with the passing Orc customer. Adela had kindly escorted the drunkard out. (Read: she'd dislocated the man's shoulder in her roughness and sent him flying face-first into the snow outside).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Medea, combined with last night's startling display of anger at everyone, she'd come to the conclusion that no matter what, she should most definitely stay on the lady's good graces. The lashing out last night from her was shocking, but Medea agreed internally that at least it calmed the situation before mass hysteria broke out, even though she was still bitter about having to be sent to her room to balance the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with this job, she hoped to begin the first step of a long trek in fixing this ridiculous prejudice humans had towards her kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back to reality, first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, Ma'am/Lady Adela!\" the girls chorused together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Adela barked before bringing her pipe to her lips for another puff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the anger was gone, replaced by her trademark cool demeanor. Medea couldn't help but stare in wonder; where humans like this, always flipping through emotions like a river, or was Adela just an individual case?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In all seriousness,\" Adela intoned coldly. \"Medea works here. Meaning she is one of you. And remember, any problems amongst yourselves...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we sort out between us.\" Medea looked on in awe as the barmaids chorused as one yet again. Such a level of discipline!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Adela nodded. \"I'm confident you can all work together. For each other, for the inn, and for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ma'am/Lady Adela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired woman nodded in satisfaction, tapping her pipe twice on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela motioned for Medea to follow them, but just as the gorgon went to follow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Medea?\" Adela called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" the inn owner cut off with a grimace. \"No need to call me that. It's not like I'm royalty. Just 'Ma'am' or something along those lines is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Lady Adela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela's palm met her forehead, and then she quickly reached to grab the gorgon by the shoulder and pull her out before Adela could so much as pop a blood vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were outside, there was a pregnant pause among them. No one dared break the ice as they processed this new development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then...\" Medea started with a tug of her hood to keep one of her snakes from coiling out into sight. \"I'm one of you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind us,\" Elsa muttered sourly, massaging her temple with one hand as she recovered from having passed out earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens now...?\" Marta looked to the older, more experienced Daniela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" the dark red-haired barmaid retorted. \"We do as the Lady says. Time to chaperone the newbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are funny,\" Elsa scowled. \"Good luck with that. I'm going to take a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elsa,\" Daniela glowered, patience wearing thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired barmaid froze in her tracks before she let out a petulant, angry whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Daniela turned her attention to the quiet gorgon. \"Okay, look, we don't like you, you don't like us--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correction,\" Medea interrupted dryly. \"You don't like me, for which I have done <i>nothing</i>, and I would like for us to like each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela let out a string of incomprehensible curses under her breath before letting slip a coherent one so foul that Marta instinctively covered Frenda's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! We will cross that bridge when we come across it! Just...just listen, alright? Here's how it works. You're new, you've no doubt never tended at a tavern or an inn before, and so we're going to show you how,\" here the dark ginger craned her head to the side, glaring at her co-workers. \"<i>All of us</i>. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which she got glum nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to the gorgon. \"Do <i>you </i>understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Medea gave an affirmative nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Proper introductions are due. I'm Daniela, I've worked here the longest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her others and silently urged them to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elsa,\" the black-haired girl looked like she was fighting off a disgusted curl of the lips as she eyed the exposed bits of Medea's scaly flesh through her cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marta, nice to meet you,\" despite her kind words, her eyes betrayed wariness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fr-Fr-Frenda...I'm new, j-j-just like you now...\" the youngest of the barmaids bowed low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe runaway priestess gave each of them a nod with a polite smile. \"I'm Medea. Let's get along, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Daniela waved a hand carelessly. \"Now that we have that posh gig out of the way...\"</span></div></div>",

Now let's begin with something simple. Let's see....oh! Let's do a two-egg omelette!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Medea answered readily before her enthusiasm shifted to curiosity. \"Wait, what's an omelette? And...two eggs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Observe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarta was noticeably less frightful of the gorgon compared to earlier, perhaps a result of being on her favored station of head cook and the giddiness that came with teaching someone else the fine art of the culinary. It certainly helped that if Adela was okay with the gorgon, and Daniela was too (erm, more or less...), then who was she to object? She was still wary, yes, but Marta was always one to push for peace. Medea was one of them now, so no use striving for conflict. Not that she would ever do that, gods no. Certainly no one among them would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you take the two eggs and--what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh, sorry,\" Medea sheepishly lowered one of the eggs from where it had been held close to her mouth. \"For a gorgon, eggs are quite the delicacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" Elsa arched an eyebrow. \"You eat them <i>raw</i>?\" she spat the last word like it was complete sacrilege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you humans don't?\" at the black-haired girl's feverish shake of the head, Medea shrugged. \"Eh, different tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, get ready to be amazed at the taste of cooked eggs!\" Marta chimed in, her smile brimming with the eagerness to share in her passion for cooking. \"So like I was saying, first we break the eggs--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break them?\" Medea blinked, and then shrugged. \"Very well, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, wait, not like--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, as Medea had already stacked the two eggs on her left palm, and then brought her right fist down upon them like a hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--that...\" Marta finished, face stained with a mix of egg sauce and yoke. \"Let's try that again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a hefty amount of trial and error...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now keep your pan balanced. Tighten your grip, but not too tight! Okay, now watch what I do... See, like that! Now you do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Medea took a breath. \"Tight grip, but not too tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaand...\" Marta paused, looking intently at the sizzling omelette in Medea's frying pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny pop rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flip it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea did so, and if one were to ask her, she would insist that she flipped it as Marta had done. Yet somehow, the omelette flew right out of her pan and, with a sickening wet splat, hit the wooden ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" Frenda whined, having looked on in awe and wonder at the gorgon's lesson, and thus disappointed that her hard effort ultimately ended in failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea threw her head back and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, you'll get better!\" Marta encouraged nicely. \"Mistakes happen so you can improve. In the meantime, let's try steak now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow <i>that </i>had started well enough. Medea followed instructions diligently, added the necessary implements in the right amounts, and had the meat cooking at a proper heat. But at the end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY IS IT ON FIRE?!\" Daniela roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE'S OUT TO KILL US!\" Elsa shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just turned up the fire a little, it was taking too long!\" Medea cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAH!\" Marta and Frenda ran back into the kitchen with a bucket of water, dunking the fresh well water right on the burning pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaids all breathed heavily, relief washing over their faces at the aversion of disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Marta said kindly, yet shakily. \"Practice makes perfect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela face-palmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, in this scenario, we're going to pretend you're serving,\" Elsa said in a stiff tone, sitting at a table. \"I'll be the customer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Medea answered with determination. \"What can I get you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Elsa held up a finger. \"You first say 'good morning', 'good afternoon', or 'good evening' as the situation calls for it. Always be polite. Asking outright for the customer to make a choice is being subtly rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Medea blinked, absorbing the lesson. \"You're right. I apologize. Ahem... Good morning, ma'am! What would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa hummed, pleased. \"Very good! But tone down the enthusiasm. Being eager is good, but too much eagerness can be mistaken for lunacy. Try to be a little subdued.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, alright. Ahem... Good morning, ma'am... How may I serve you today...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not <i>that </i>subdued! You sound like you're going to kill yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other barmaids couldn't help but look on with smiles. Despite what she would say, Elsa did in fact, in her own little way, start to warm up to their new unlikely barmaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa sighed dramatically. \"Let's just move on to serving the meal, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are the plates empty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Why am I carrying so many?\" to her credit, Medea stayed calm even as she fought to keep four dishes balanced on her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa huffed. \"Because part of being a barmaid is to serve fast and be as flexible as possible. We entertain as much as we serve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea frowned. \"You know, with my tail I could--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" Elsa snapped. \"Has it not sunk in yet that we can't casually show off a gorgon barmaid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the whole town is no doubt gossiping about me already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Elsa waved a hand. \"We tell them you left at the first instance of dawn. The rest, we'll work out. But enough of that. Step forward, and with grace! Imagine each of those dishes you're carrying is a succulent meal. Your job is to deliver each meal with precise grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace, alright, I understand...\" and Medea took steps forward, careful to keep her trembling arms as frozen still as possible. It was a tense moment, the barmaids looking on with great anxiety as their newest recruit waved through tables carefully. It was extremely worrisome how the plates tilted and looked ready to fall, but the gorgon did a good job. She was surprisingly nimble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...not so bad--\" Medea started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thunk</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEOUCH!\" Medea howled as her toe came into contact with the leg of a table she'd stepped a little too close to. The others watched in abject horror as she fell to the floor, the dishes following after...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea snapped to attention. She swung her right leg, kicking upwards while keeping her toes outstretched. One plate landed neatly at their tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spread her arms to the side, catching two with her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uncoiled her tail, letting it slink forward until its tip rose to the air and caught the final plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other barmaids stared, dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Incredible!\" Frenda beamed, clapping eagerly while the others looked on in surprise and approval at the gorgon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea smiled widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BAM</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on out here?!\" Adela's voice thundered, scaring the daylights out of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, tragically, causing Medea to lose her concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haunting sound of plates shattering on the floor echoed throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela face-palmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you do behind the bar,\" Daniela droned. \"See that barrel over there? Hoist it up to the counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy enough,\" Medea stated, bending down to grab at the large barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoisted it up with little to no effort, only grunting when adjusting it over her shoulder. She walked to the designated area on the bar to where the barrel went for easy fillings. She put it down heavily, and yet carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to it,\" the gorgon grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrah,\" Daniela deadpanned. \"Now, just serve me a pint and you're all done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, and me too!\" Marta chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela turned to the brunette. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One pint of beer, coming right up!\" Medea reached for a glass, placed it under the barrel, and turned the keg..,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in...\" Medea flipped the keg switch back and forth. Still nothing. \"What the?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Daniela realized what the problem was. \"You forgot to take off the safety latch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Medea nearly slapped her forehead. \"Of course!\" she went to remove the metal clamp around the hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in her haste, she forgot she had left the keg open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeaning quite the amount of beer had accumulated at the tip of the release hatch, ready to set loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it did when Medea undid the metal clamp. A quick torrent of beer flew out of the metal hose connected to the barrel, drenching the gorgon and the nearby barmaids in the rich, bubbly liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Elsa snarled. \"Now I <i>really </i>need that bath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got my beer after all!\" Marta grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela face-palmed, this time both of her palms hitting her face as she groaned in miserable irritation.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They were about to sit down to a breakfast. Mornings in the inn were slow, and that was usually when the girls could get an actual sit-down meal in. Marta had gone to the trouble to fix an incredible spread. Eggs, sizzling bacon, fresh bread, milk and cream, and even a few berries that Frenda had found this morning were all set out on the table. Medea, though, still preferred her raw eggs, even if Marta was the best cook, much to the disgust of everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adela lets you make all this, just for yourselves?\" she asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa nodded. \"Yup! If there's one thing Adela always stresses, it's that no barmaid should ever go hungry. Can't work on an empty stomach you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea shrugged, and decided to accept that answer as good enough. Sounded like a fair policy in her mind. She wondered if that was the reason humans were a tad plumper than she had initially imagined. Ever since meeting these creatures, she had noticed that many were a bit on the round side. But then, perhaps that was because this was truly a land of plenty, as she was beginning to see it. She had heard stories from the girls about the famous city of Adinah, which knew no hunger in any corner of its streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, they had barely sat down for the meal when they all heard the door start to open. The boisterous sounds of rowdy men could be heard coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Daniela shouted, rising quickly. \"Quick, hide her in the kitchens or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea was in the middle of eating one of her eggs, and Marta made a disgusted face as she grimaced and dragged the gorgon into the kitchens with her. \"Aww, but I wanted to see who it was,\" Medea said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well they probably don't want to see you,\" Marta hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stung the poor gorgon, and Marta softened a little. \"I don't mean it like that. It's just going to take some getting used to is all. Besides, this is a good chance to get some more cooking practice in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed at the thought of that. \"I get to cook again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaid swatted her hand away before she could get to touching stuff. \"You are to go no where near the oven or the skillet today. Just, hand me the stuff I need when I say I need it. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea nodded, and sighed wistfully. She began handing the inn's top chef the ingredients she asked for, and fetching this and that. All the while, she could hear the goings on outside. Well, it was something anyway. Apparently, the rowdy group was a band of hunters, who were busy relaying their triumphant tales of their latest kill to Elsa and Frenda, who seemed to want to only flirt with the strapping young men, while Daniela did all the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horns wide as three men standing abreast,\" one said with great exaggeration. \"Oh, and a surly look in that one's eye. They don't call him Ol' One Eye for nothin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you must have been so brave,\" Frenda swooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brave!\" said another. \"The little child here nearly wet himself at the sight of it. I rallied the boys together into the formation for the kill. Oh, when Ol' One Eye was caught in those ropes, he knew he didn't stand a chance. But, he died with dignity, he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he wasn't in pain,\" Elsa murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sweet face, he died swiftly,\" the man told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, get up off your feet, you lazy bones and help me,\" Daniela barked to the two. The two shuffled quickly to the roaring laughter of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like so much fun out there, and Medea wished she could be part of it. \"Are you listening?\" Marta's voice boomed, shaking her out of her daydreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, hand me the thyme,\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea reached for a small bundle of herbs hanging from the walls. She took a brief sniff of it, recoiling away from the stench. \"Oh, we can't serve this,\" she said. \"It'll ruin the meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so now you're a brilliant chef all of a sudden,\" Marta mocked. \"I've been doing this for years, and I always have been serving this the same way for all those years. Now, hand me the thyme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea yielded and handed her the offending herbs. She just knew it was all wrong. If she were back home, some lobi root would go perfectly with...oh! She might just have some on her. She rummaged through her cloak, realizing she always kept a few odds and ends in her pockets. She probably didn't realize that when she grabbed this cloak to run away with. Sure enough, there was a single root in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon looked around. Marta would never let her add an ingredient to the stew. She was too firmly in the belief that she was the best cook around. Maybe she was, but Medea was sure of this one thing right now. Once the girl was no longer looking, as she tended to kneading the dough for some fresh loaves of bread, Medea took a knife and cut a few scrapings of the root and let it drop into the pot. The stew sizzled and bubbled for a second. That would give it a little extra kick, she thought. A lot of the male hunters in her caves wanted something with actual flavor to it when they came in hungry, she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she wasn't in the clear just yet. Marta caught her at the last minute. \"What in Damus' halls do you think you're doing?\" she roared. \"Did I not tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's that stew, Marta?\" Daniela asked. \"They're starting to get restless. Oh, there it is.\" The barmaid began laddeling out several bowls, and began walking back out to the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Marta breathed, but then remembered what she was doing and struck Medea upside the head. \"What were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to help,\" she said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, no thanks to you, you've probably poisoned them.\" She looked warily out into the halls to see what would happen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both women waited with bated breath as Daniela set the steaming bowls before the hungry hunters. Marta was genuinely terrified, and Medea was just hoping Marta wouldn't be too mad at her in the end. Neither heard anyone drop dead or gag, so that was a good sign. \"Maybe they didn't notice,\" Marta said, breathing out what air she had been holding in. \"So, what did you think you were doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just trying to help,\" Medea said with a pleading look on her face. \"It's just some lobi root. We add it to a lot of our food to offset it's bland taste. We use a lot of spices actually to do that. I just had this on me from when I left. If I were to have some...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up, you,\" Marta said, \"I'm trying to hear what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela burst through the doors, and both girls stood at attention, fearful of what would come out of the waitress' mouth. She was smiling like an idiot. \"I don't know what you did to this batch, Marta, but they are just eating it up. They've already asked for seconds. And more customers are coming through the door as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were at a loss for words. Medea was beaming with pride, but Marta was stuttering like an idiot. \"But...I...she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't the time to go modest on me. We've got hungry customers, and they're loving what you're serving. Let's keep it going hot tonight, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bustled out the door and the two looked at each other. The gorgon grinned from ear to ear. \"So, I can stay in the kitchen tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarta huffed and went to chopping vegetables. \"Yeah, yeah, whatever. We'd better get started if we're going to keep up with all those orders. You got enough of that stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her pocket. \"For now. I'll need to find more if we intend to use this for another night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl wheeled on her, waving a wooden spoon in her face. \"Listen here, you, this was a fluke, and you got lucky. I'm not going to be putting up with this for much longer. We'll get through tonight, and never speak of this little mistake again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea still had a smug look on her face. She wasn't about to let this moment go by. She had actually been successful, and no longer felt like a total fool among the humans. She continued to work quietly grounding the lobi root, humming pleasantly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll night long, the other barmaids came in and out grabbing more orders of the stew which was now becoming famous. All the while they praised the two girls for their excellent work in the kitchen. Medea returned the kindnesses with much appreciation, while Marta grumbled a few curt \"thank yous\" all the while pounding the hell out of the meat. No flighty little gorgon was just going to waltz into her kitchen with all her charm and just take over. It was HER kitchen godsdamnit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, it was hard to keep up with all the orders. Requests for the delicious stew were filling up, and both women ran themselves ragged just trying to ensure they could meet the demand. By the end of the night, everyone was exhausted, and they all collapsed on the empty benches in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet are so sore,\" Frenda whined. \"I don't think I've ever walked that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela let out a wearied laugh. \"Good for ya. Means we all earned good tips tonight. Again, I don't know what you two did, but it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarta fumed, but said nothing. Medea wasn't about to let her one moment go away. \"This,\" she said, holding up the last bit of lobi root. \"I used it in the stew. I think if I could go out and get some more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let HER put something in the food!\" Elsa screamed at Marta. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it wasn't my fault. She did it when I wasn't looking. You're just lucky you didn't poison all the patrons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was about to become yet another fight was broken up by the hobbling steps of Adela. \"Girls, girls, there shouldn't be any fighting tonight. You had such a great run. I've never had business that good. Now, what was it you were saying, Medea did something to the stew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea rushed to her, holding out the root. Adela held it and examined it, before letting out a roaring laugh. \"Well, I'll be damned. If it isn't a little Snakecoil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked confused. \"But, that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeep waved her off. \"Oh, I'm sure your people have another name for it, but this is what we used to call it back in my day. Used to spice our mead with it. Gave it a good warmth. I haven't seen this stuff in ages. Pretty rare, as I remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was pretty common back home,\" Medea answered. \"I'd have to get more, but I'd run the risk of getting caught by my people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela thought it over. \"Well, can't have that now, can we? I'm not about to lose my golden goose so easily. Daniela, Frenda, you go with her to keep her safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding,\" Daniela said. \"We're not adventurers who do quests, with all due respect. We're barmaids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last time I checked, you're barmaids who want to keep getting your tips, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women looked at each other. There was no getting old Adela to budge on this. They'd have to suck it up and go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Medea often wondered if humans were this prone to nervous breakdowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been filled with dread when Adela had essentially ordered her, the escaped Gorgon Priestess, to go with Daniela and Frenda, two barmaids who'd certainly never survive the trip to Sarkos and back with their sanity intact, all the way back to said dreaded caverns, risk capture and possible deadly punishment, all to get more Snakecoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA perilous journey from North to West and back, risk capture and maybe something worse, definitely risk the mental well-being of her new acquaintances, all for the sake of just one piece of ingredient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea would have been fine with taking the trip, provided she really had no choice in the matter. But bring along Daniela and Frenda? Or the other two? Gods, anyone at all? Medea would rather resign herself to the miserable fate of a Priestess than let others suffer for her crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to think, it had almost come to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Daniela had said once Adela had haughtily sauntered away to the bar to tend to other customers. \"You heard the woman. We might as well pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea, much as she wanted to object, could only bring herself to give her a look of shock and hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't!\" Daniela snapped. \"I'm not happy either, all right?\" she breathed out, her sharp features softening. \"What choice do we have? We must keep business going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that important?\" Medea muttered. \"Is it really worth risking your life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela chuckled darkly. \"I envy you, Medea.\" At the gorgon's confused stare, the barmaid continued ruefully. \"You clearly don't have a care in the land. What happened to you, exactly? You just got bored of living under a cave and decided to see how us lowly mortals struggle about in life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea winced, but remained silent, patiently waiting for the redhead to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of us have responsibilities to uphold. Need to make that living. We need the income. If we don't get it, then what of the people we do this for? Elsa has four sisters in Racovania, one with child and widowed. Marta and I have our own families to support with this job. And Frenda...\" Daniela's face softened considerably. \"Has only this. No family, no friends outside of us. She just came to us, alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea processed the revelation quietly, realizing how single-minded she'd been looking at them. She thought barmaids were just that, barmaids. Just pretty women put to work at taverns and earn their wages. She hadn't stopped to think maybe there was more to it than that. It made her feel deeply ashamed for having added that Snakecoil to the soup. She'd meant well, but now they had to take a dangerous journey to keep the supply coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And is business...not so productive in these parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We earn well, but not as much as some of us would like on some days,\" Elsa interjected, uncharacteristically somber. \"It's what we get for living out of the reaches of Racovania. Independence from the vampires, but our little town needs to fend for itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause hung over the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela sighed. \"I'll go prepare mine and Frenda's bags. How far can we make it to Sarkos if we go by wagon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea was about to respond, but her words died upon finally taking notice of the young blonde who had been quiet up until now when she'd let out a sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other barmaids whipped to the youngest in their rank, eyebrows raised and faces contorted with alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Frenda's blue eyes stared forward at nothing, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. She was shaking horribly where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea stared at the blonde, then at the others. Her mouth fell open. \"What...What is happening to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela ignored the gorgon, instead walking over to the near-catatonic girl carefully. \"Frenda, hey, listen...\" she placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. \"Remember what to do. Breathe. Think only of the garden. Remember the garden. Think on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eldest barmaid's words seemed to have the desired effect on the blonde. Her breathing grew more steady and she was blinking rapidly, snapping out of her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea took a step forward. \"Is she well now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then something horrible happened. Frenda's eyes registered the gorgon standing by, and at once she <i>shrieked</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing they were at the kitchen, and that Elsa and Marta rushed outside to tend to any late night customers outside, Medea reflected. Because otherwise any brave male traveler would have stormed the kitchen to find out what had made a young maiden scream so loud to the gods, and upon catching sight of the only gorgon present would have assumed the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela reacted quickly, clamping a hand over Frenda's mouth before her scream could reach an octave too high and attract attention from outside or, even worse, from Adela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frenda! Frenda! Hey, hey!\" Daniela had to wrap her free arm around the blonde when she started thrashing. \"Calm down, child! Frenda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde only let out muffled, wailing sobs from behind the older girl's hand, shaking her head furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to her?!\" Medea gasped, her scaly hands flying to cover her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a trauma!\" Daniela hollered back. \"None of us know, because she refuses to tell us! She always gets like this when told about the other regions of Yndyre!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea's hands slowly fell from covering her mouth, realization dawning on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frenda!\" Daniela snarled, glaring down at the girl. \"You have to calm down! Don't make me knock you--OUCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea didn't know what to expect in this situation. She'd never seen a case of one person holding down another overcome with hysteria. She especially didn't think sweet, friendly Frenda could be capable of violence. And here she was, proving her wrong by biting into Daniela's hand with all the force of a vampire on a blood feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you little BRAT--!\" Daniela, blinded by anger, raised her arm high, fingers completely outstretched, her palm glistening ever so slightly by the light of the moon through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda's hands flew to her head, she shut her eyes, and wailed, awaiting the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SMACK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea grit her teeth, her head swinging to the side as her cheek stung from where she'd intercepted Daniela's intended slap for Frenda. But she kept her knees rooted to the floorboards, her arms wrapped tightly around Frenda as the blonde buried her face into her chest on pure instinct, sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela only came to her senses when the snakes on Medea's head hissed in alarm, along with the fact that her palm had clearly not hit a cheek of soft baby fat, but rather one that felt like soft leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea turned her head to look up at Daniela, her arms embracing Frenda closer as the blonde continued to weep brokenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela blinked. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda jerked for a moment in the gorgon's arms, but otherwise did not move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going,\" Medea repeated, her words laced with firmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, the redhead scowled. \"Oh, so you'd have me go all by my lonesome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Medea stood up, gently guiding Frenda to her feet. \"The three of us will not go. We're not risking our lives for some stupid ingredient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, were the world that easy!\" Daniela snarled. \"How will we keep the men and women who come in for more of that damned soup satisfied? Next thing you will tell me is that you have a miracle solution for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I do,\" Medea retorted calmly. \"There's more to the menu than that stew, yes? We'll present something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I can envision it now,\" Daniela said sourly. \"Good morning and gods save you, kind sir! What will you have today? What's that, the stew from yesterday? Ohhh, so sorry, sir. We are all out of the need to make it. Yes, so sorry. Very tragic. Have you tried our steak with biscuits on the side? It is to die for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your confidence is impressive,\" Medea droned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was jesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Medea sighed. \"But I do have a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods, will you discover a gold mine for us next?\" Daniela drawled in sarcasm. \"But by all means, do share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We replicate the feel of the ingredient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pregnant pause as the gorgon's words seemed to echo around the kitchen area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I repeat my earlier statement. What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can't come across Snakecoil Roots here, then we'll have to use other ingredients that can have a similar effect on the food we serve. It's not that hard to create. And if that fails, well, with the gods' blessings maybe a merchant will have some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Merchants do come by often,\" Daniela conceded with a reluctant nod. \"But by all means, I think our solution lies in making these so-called 'similar ingredients', because I sure as hell cannot fathom numerous merchants carrying an herb that grows only near the Gorgon's den.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Medea nodded before smiling gratefully. \"Thank you for your faith in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe me, I don't have faith. I think we're doomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea pointedly ignored that, instead turning to look down at Frenda with concern. \"Are you well now, Frenda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde sniffled once, and then gave a nod. \"Y-Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea smiled and turned to walk away, but her arm was grabbed softly by the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea's warm smile morphed into a beam, feeling for the first time genuine acceptance by one of the barmaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go tell Adela,\" Daniela spoke up, grimacing slightly. \"Not like she'll be pleased, regardless of who tells her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods be with you!\" Medea smiled cheerfully, earning a giggle from Frenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And may Omes strike you in the foot,\" Daniela grumbled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day, another successfully turned in profit for the inn. The barmaids had run around all day, serving customers, entertaining the occasional flirt, and keeping the merry atmosphere going. The only slight bump to the mood would be that patrons kept calling for the stew from yesterday, and it eventually reached a point where Adela was forced to cave in and order her girls to give the people what they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were able to excuse the lack of extraordinary flavor well enough. Every establishment faces a shortage of ingredients from time to time. These things can't be helped! Though this meant customers were a tad disappointed, it didn't tamper with business. The bar was even more popular than ever, and if it wasn't bar patrons, it was new guests coming to stay at the inn. Why, just this very morning, a traveling Orc came up and checked in for one day's stay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, life was good for these North-border barmaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this plan of yours doesn't succeed,\" Adela's carefree smile would have looked a lot more inviting were it not peppered with a warning malice. \"Gods help me, scrubbing the floorboards and restrooms will be the least of your worries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela, amidst all the \"Yes Ma'am\"s and \"Understood\"s, kept exercising her \"Don't shoot the messenger!\" right; this was Medea's idea, not hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yes, the gist of it was they were pressed to find a solution. Replicate the delicious dish Medea had unwittingly created, or gods help them with whatever sadistic punishment Adela had in store for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought them all to their current team meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So to summarize,\" said Daniela. \"We make our grub as delicious as that one time--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Oh, shut it Marta! As I was telling, we make our food better, or the old witch will--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wooden door leading into the kitchen suddenly swung open with all the force of a hurricane, echoing as loud as thunder all over the bar. Marta, Elsa, and Frenda all jumped with a shriek. Daniela let out a \"By the gods!\" cry, and Medea swirled around in alarm, her tail coiling itself around her legs for fear of it being severed by the door, the snakes that made up her long hair hissing in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, silly me!\" Adela's youthful features were creased in an obvious parody of innocence. In her perfectly manicured fingers was a single envelope. \"I forgot to have this out for the courier! Would one of you be a dear and take it to him before he departs for Racovania? It would be awfully remiss of me to neglect correspondence to my dear cousin Helga!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could recover from the shock of being startled and volunteer, Daniela was already marching up to the inn owner, swiped the letter as politely as she could, and marched stoically out the door, towards the exit of the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medea, you tell them!\" the redhead drawled on her way out, sounding like she was very much done with life's immature shenanigans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" the Gorgon blinked, looking momentarily astounded as she registered that yes, Daniela, the Head Barmaid, had just put her in charge. \"Right, ehhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to face the uncertain looks of the other barmaids. Frenda's nervousness, Elsa's apprehension, and Marta's doubt. Medea felt unsure all of a sudden, to be faced with the expectation of others like this. But then her gaze focused more on Frenda's blue eyes; amidst the anxiety was clear hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope in her, the Gorgon. Medea blinked once, feeling a strange feeling of warmth rise within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's as Daniela was saying,\" the Gorgon continued with a renewed sense of determination. \"We may not have snakecoil root anymore, but we can come up with ways to imitate the ingredient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially as it was used just for a soup,\" Marta chimed in. \"Not like we got to add it to our steaks, chickens, eggs, bread...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get it, Marta,\" Elsa cut in sharply before the prideful cook could fully ramble on. The raven-haired lass turned her attention to the Gorgon. \"So how do we start? We go out to the market?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea noticed how the second-oldest of the barmaids seemed particularly excited at that option. The young Gorgon had the distinct impression that she was the type to really enjoy outings, especially if there was a reason to purchase from the marketplace. And yet, despite how superficial it seemed, Medea remembered Daniela's words about Elsa having four sisters to support back in Racovania, one of whom was with child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's the best place to start,\" Medea nodded. \"But at the same time, I'd like to fully inspect the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Marta said a tad defensively, earning her a scowl from Elsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There may be some things we can work with here,\" Medea explained gently, smiling politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarta huffed in response. \"Hoping to reap more success from blunders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea's smile fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the gods have truly forsaken us!\" Elsa bemoaned, rubbing a palm over her forehead. \"Marta, just listen to her. Don't make me get Adela in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Elsa, there is no need,\" Medea pleaded softly, holding her hands up amicably as she turned to Marta. \"I don't wish anyone harm. I only want to help. I would be honored if you granted me permission to work in your kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The day I let an outsider--!\" Marta started loudly, approaching Medea with the intent of jabbing a menacing finger to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was stopped mid-stomp by, to the great surprise of everyone, Frenda. The youngest barmaid stood between the redhead and the Gorgon, holding her thin arms wide at length as she acted the role of a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frenda...\" Marta murmured, shocked at the undeniable reality before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marta,\" the blonde's tone was soft and firm at once. \"Please stop it. You're being unfair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa and Marta were in shock. Frenda was always incredibly timid around newcomers, especially members of a different race. Combine that with the horror stories spread about Gorgons, and one would assume Frenda would never be standing where she is now, arms stretched out in defense of one of those humanoid reptiles. And yet she was. Elsa and Marta could only conclude that if Frenda was perfectly willing to come to the defense of the Gorgon, then perhaps she could be trusted after all. It didn't stop them from wondering what in Nilheia's holy name did Frenda see in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea, for her part, stared at the blonde's back in moved surprise. Until now, she had been used to the uneasy acquaintanceship vibe she got from the barmaids as a whole, but now with Frenda, she felt like just maybe, she was actually going to make a friend out of all this. The thought brought that warm feeling again. Her first friend outside home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of that felt...rather nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarta sighed, her disapproving anger fading. She looked straight at Medea. \"If Frenda speaks up for you, then I'll trust her judgment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" Elsa snorted. \"I trust Daniela's judgment. Shows what little faith you have, Marta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it,\" Marta glowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree,\" Frenda spoke up, giggling. \"If Daniela trusts Medea, then that should be good enough for the rest of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's...!\" Marta stared at the blonde, aghast. \"Oh, you've been hanging around these two for too long, Frenda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea smiled as the other two laughed at the redhead's outburst. They're all like sisters, she mused. Sisters that stick together through everything. Was this normal for humans, Medea wondered. It made her all the more relieved that she had escaped the isolated life of being a Priestess of Sarkos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then,\" Marta spoke up once the other two had stopped giggling at her expense. \"What do you need from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the redhead near-instantly regretted asking so casually, for the Gorgon took that as permission to go about the kitchen like it was suddenly bequeathed to her. Medea started by strolling over to the fridge, opening it for a moment to take note of the condiments and beverages inside. Next, she inspected the cabinets above and below, making a thoughtful noise all the while, her tail swinging in tune to her cheerful mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarta and Elsa shared an uneasy look, wondering just what the snake lady was up to. To their horror, they noticed Frenda look at the Gorgon with what could otherwise be called awe, the blonde's eyes glued on Medea as she went about the kitchen, taking only minor looks at ingredients that to the barmaids looked like they offered nothing. Frenda, however, had her hands clasped together as she waited with bated breath as to what the Gorgon would come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after finishing her mini tour of the kitchen, Medea crossed her arms and closed her eyes, humming once again. Her right toes wriggled upon the wooden floorboards, imitating the impression of a tapping foot. Her tail waved back and forth, conveying the sense of a tactician ready to think of a winning move and a predator eager to pounce on cornered prey. Medea's eyes shot open, and at once she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she pulled out the milk carton from the fridge, together with a crystal glass from the cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we only use those for wine!\" Marta protested, but was ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea poured some of the milk into the glass, which she then placed on the stove, lighting the fire beneath it. Next, she reached out and grabbed two peppers, hovering them over the warming milk and squeezing them in her hands. The red, spicy juice leaked from her hands, falling into the milk below. After tossing the pruned peppers away, Medea grabbed a raw potato, sliced it open easily with her claws, and dumped the raw mashed potatoes in the incredibly bizarre mix she was brewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Damus' name...?\" Elsa muttered in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finished!\" Medea declared triumphantly. \"Ladies, I present a popular beverage from my home: Gift of the Mamba!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oi, girls, what did I...miss...?\" Daniela froze upon noticing her fellow barmaids all gathered around a table, Medea standing opposite them. In the middle of the table stood a lone drink, looking nothing like any beverage she had ever seen. What sort of liquid was that...? And...did Medea do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her confirmation from observing how Marta and Elsa looked revolted, while Medea was positively brimming with pride. And Frenda...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was Frenda looking at Medea's creation with both awe and curiosity? Was that healthy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gift...\" Marta breathed, eyeing the pinkish-red beverage on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...of the Mamba...?\" Elsa finished, looking rather green as she took into account what was used to make the drink; milk, red peppers, and some bits of raw potato sliced into it. And it was named after a lethal type of snake. \"By Damus, just...what <i>is </i>this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a popular beverage from Sarkos,\" Medea recounted fondly. \"Ordinarily, it's first served to pubescent Gorgons to mark the transition to maturity. The warm milk represents maturing infancy, and the spices added to it refer to the jolt of growth. That sensation one gets when feeling no longer like a child. As though you have become aware of your new senses and how you perceive the world from that point on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea smiled as she tapped the side of the glass, as though prodding at a new life. \"It's a drink we share with the Naga. Named as it is in accordance to a tale on how Zolneas once happened upon a peculiar snake pinned to the earth by one of Ardoid's arrows that had accidentally veered off its intended path, thus striking the snake, which was not meant to die. Zolneas happened upon the snake, and, dismayed, removed the arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Zolneas' surprise, the snake's injury healed by itself, looking as though it had never been pierced by the arrow. The snake coiled itself in reverence to its goddess and humbly requested a chalice to express its gratitude. Zolneas produced the chalice, and the snake placed its fangs on it. To the increasing surprise of the goddess, rather than venom, out from the fangs came what looked to be wine. She tasted it, and at once blessed the snake, declaring the beverage to be the best she's ever had. And so it came to be known as the Gift of the Mamba, for it being a present to both the goddess Zolneas, and a great drink discovered for all to taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa, Daniela, and Marta looked slightly impressed by the significance of the drink. It's not often one gets to learn such fine detail from another culture. It made the Gorgon standing before them seem more...human, as bizarre as that sounded. But yes, she appeared much more approachable. It made the biased fear and uncertainty they had for her seem outright embarrassing and exaggerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda certainly seemed over that. She looked positively <i>captivated</i> after hearing Medea's tale, like she had been hanging on to every word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Marta spoke up after a moment of silence. \"If milk and peppers are the main components, why did you add that bit of raw, mashed potato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the great horror of the barmaids, Medea blinked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potato? That was a potato? I thought it was some sort of bloated, round sugar cane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela's hands floated in front of her, her countenance scrunched in a way that made her look like she was struggling from lunging at the Gorgon, or crushing her own throat. Elsa stepped away from the table, now looking at the beverage like it was a miniature volcano ready to erupt at a moment's notice. Marta...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ADDED A WRONG INGREDIENT?!\" the chef roared, possessing all the rage of a deity towards a blasphemous mortal. \"AND YOU DIDN'T THINK TO ASK ME FIRST?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea shrunk slightly. \"Ayyyyyyeeee...got caught in the rush of creativity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOT!\" Marta gripped and pulled at her long brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should still be good!\" Medea protested. \"One wrong ingredient doesn't usually--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-Ah! Say no more!\" Marta snarled. \"I'm throwing this...this...<i>liquid weapon</i> away before it destroys the bowels of anyone unlucky enough to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef froze in her angry rant upon realizing the wine glass containing the dreaded drink was not in its original position on the table. One quick glance to the side revealed the glass, held gently in the hands of the youngest barmaid, her lips coming into contact with the glass as she tipped it forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FRENDA, NOOO!\" Marta and Elsa shrieked together, the former making to knock the glass from the blonde's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda, however, was unperturbed by the hysterics of the other two, and actually raised a placating hand to stop Marta in her advance. She took a small, cautious sip of the beverage, a sip that soon turned into a generous gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on her, the barmaids looking with trepidation, while Medea stared in anxious eagerness, awaiting critique on her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Daniela leaned forward, placing a hand on Marta's shoulder to keep her from capturing the blonde in her arms and performing the Heimlich on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda hummed thoughtfully, processing the drink. Her cheeks turned rosy as she jumped a little upon feeling the spicy flavor hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooh! It's...spicy,\" she clicked her tongue, feeling it itch from the burning sensation. And yet, she brought the glass to her lips once more, taking a quicker sip. \"But...then it's...warm. Like tea! Or coffee, only spicy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you approve?\" Medea beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which the blonde gave a beatific smile. \"It's delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the other barmaids were floored would be a major understatement. Daniela recovered from the shock first, patiently prying the drink from the blonde's hands so she could sample it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she gasped involuntarily from the initial spicy taste before the warming aftermath settled in. \"What a curious drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give her too much credit,\" Marta groused, taking the drink to try it herself. And found herself liking it. \"Well, I'll be an Orc's aunt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you to say that, it must be quite good...\" Elsa agreed reluctantly as she was handed the drink. It took some self-resistance, but she managed to force herself to take a sip. \"Ay! A tad too spicy for my liking! But, ehh...it's not bad. I like the warm sensation afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's another benefit of the Gift of the White Mamba,\" Medea smiled. \"My people and the Naga drink it especially during the winter season. A chalice of this is enough to keep any being warm for at least two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, and all you need is milk, some peppers, and sugar?\" Daniela questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the sugar was just an extra addition. I thought it would lessen the spice effect for your human tongues,\" Medea scratched the nape of her neck sheepishly, her scales glistening under the sunlight from the window. \"Also, believe me when I say that this concoction is actually inferior to the original served back at Sarkos or the Motee Marshes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Frenda piped up, looking at the Gorgon like a student eager to learn more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, the dairy we use is of a special variety that's used just for this drink, and we don't use ordinary red peppers,\" Medea allowed a grin to form as she said the following. \"We use Mar Peppers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa spluttered upon hearing that. \"Mar, as in the single spiciest brand in all of Yndyre?! That which is said to turn your tongue into fire if ingested without proper care?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very same, although truth be told, I find that to be an exaggeration,\" the Gorgon shrugged. \"We've used Mar for a lot of dishes back home, and at worst all we get is a tickling sensation to the tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the barmaids stared at her in silent bafflement. A tickling feeling to Gorgons and Nagas, and yet to them, humans, this tame version of the drink burned their tongues slightly. They could only shudder at what might happen to them if they ever got to sample a legitimate Sarkos-made Gift of the Mamba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Daniela nodded sardonically. \"But this is only a drink. What about an actual meal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yes!\" Frenda chirped, smiling widely as she looked to the Gorgon with that same eagerness from before. \"Won't you share more of your amazing culture cuisine with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frenda!\" Marta cried, aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea felt her cheeks flush, her chest beating with joy at the notion of being accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frenda is right,\" Daniela shook her head, but smiled nonetheless. \"Not just with food, I'm sure you have other drinks in mind, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Daniela is fine with this, then I am too,\" Elsa said dutifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why not?\" Marta rubbed her temple. \"At this point, I might as well be open to a new experience in cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea did all she could to keep from showing how sentimental they were making her feel. She managed to keep the mist to her eyes still, but her tail was stretching and coiling in delight, and her snake-hairs moving about in happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" Medea nodded, a determined grin on her face. \"With your support, I'll do my best!\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, a consensus was formed amongst the barmaids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey worked in a team formation to get the best results possible for this ambitious endeavor. Daniela and Elsa took to the tables, writing down orders, delivering plates and cups, and keeping the patrons entertained via talk or, mostly in Elsa's case, flirting. Frenda worked in getting the ingredients organized and ready for use by Medea and Marta, who cooked and prepared the meals restlessly at the kitchen. Adela, as keeper of the inn and manager of the girls, helped where it was necessary, be it assisting in serving or barking at the other girls to not fall behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no friction. Well, Marta was still rather sour at the idea of handing the reins to someone else (a non-human, at that), but for the most part, she'd grown to her new role. Besides, she had to admit, experimenting with new meal formations was...kind of exciting! The inner professional chef in her liked the idea of preparing semi-foreign dishes from another culture, and Medea was surprisingly adept!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it should come as no surprise their teamwork yielded success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the...uff...next one...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarta's arms strained with the weight of the giant meat slab, big enough to have been literally a piece of a cow. Once she was sure she was hovering the meaty boulder over the table, Marta let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table sagged and creaked slightly at the heavy meat dropped upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Marta!\" Medea beamed, flashing her claws. \"I'll take it from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the meat was divided into smaller sections, ones that, while still big, weighed a lot less, allowing the table's leg to spring back to normal. Marta briefly marveled at the display; who needs knives when you have Gorgon claws?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head with an amused smile, Marta walked over to the counter, presenting one of the first of many dishes being served for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two servings of leg of lamb with cream and extra spices for table four!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela rushed to the counter and picked up the order. \"How's the other one coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medea is starting on it now,\" Marta replied. \"Who would have thought we would be delivering to the tenants in their rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a new business practice, or so Adela says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less mewling, more service, girls!\" Adela hollered from the other end of the counter. \"You want to earn those tips, or not?! And ELSA! Get back to the counter and await the next order, you little siren!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda, meanwhile, ran into the kitchen with a new bottle of season, fresh from the basement. \"Medea, I've brought it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" the Gorgon flashed a warm smile to the blonde, taking the offered bottle to pepper its contents over the cooking meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda's reply was a blush as she gazed in admiration at the snake woman's cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you...always do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Medea briefly paused as she considered the blonde's question. She chuckled softly. \"I did not. I only learned by watching others, whenever I asked for a meal to be prepared in front of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda's eyes flew wide as she processed that. \"Are you a royal where you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Medea laughed, which Frenda noted sounded a bit forced. The Gorgon's eyes looked slightly downcast. \"You could say I had everything I could want, but not what <i>I </i>wanted most...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda's heart dropped, feeling guilty for having brought up what were no doubt painful memories for her new friend. \"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be!\" Medea's downtrodden countenance shifted into her usual cheerful one. \"It's in the past now, so no reason to think too hardly on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still...\" Frenda muttered, dark memories flashing in the corner of her mind. \"I'd be willing to listen, if it would take it off your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea froze, looking upon the young human in wonder. Her facade of cheerfulness fell away, revealing a genuine, grateful smile. She reached a hand to the blonde's head, making sure to keep her claws stretched to avoid scratching the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Frenda,\" Medea murmured, her warm smile still in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medea!\" Marta yelled, scaring the two from where they stood. \"What's going on? The client in his room is complaining, and we have other mouths to feed at the tables! And Frenda! Get over here and help! There was a spill at table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes!\" Medea and Frenda chorused, hastily jumping back to their posts before Marta, or, gods forbid, Adela, could shriek at them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, through their combined teamwork and effectiveness in where they worked best, the Icy Arms Inn saw an increase in revenue unlike any it had seen in its twenty years. Travelers from the region came, many staying for three days to even a full seven days. The inn was already known for its comfortable accommodations for anyone this far in the North, but now its reputation of great rooms and comforts was preceded by the exotic, foreign cuisine it had added to its serving menu. And it all served to make the Icy Arms a popular site to frequent, whether to stay in a room or just to enjoy the pub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, even those in the tiny little settlement worked their dues early and quickly just so they could stop by the Icy Arms and dine on the interesting menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, things were great in the new (if temporary) life the Gorgon had established for herself amongst this settlement of humans in the North.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With all the success came a few hiccups. It was bound to happen of course. Nothing was ever perfect. With all the added attention and new customers, there were a few unsavory sorts that wandered their way into the tavern. Occasionally, a bar fight would break out, resulting in Adela having to pitch them out into the street. That was actually more entertaining to watch than the actual fight itself. But, along the way, a few new surprises were making some interesting changes to the atmosphere of the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elsa! Do you have those drinks or not!\" Adela called from the other end of the bar. It was an especially busy evening, and she had gone back behind the bar to alleviate some of Elsa's workload since she mostly handled her job on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp* Just a minute,\" the dark-haired barmaid called, shuffling behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela rolled her eyes. \"And what in the world are you up to?\" she said, turning around to see what was causing the holdup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really shouldn't have been surprised. The barmaid was hiding yet another plate of food she had gotten from the kitchens. True, their tough but fair manager had always been okay with the girls catching a bite here or there during their shifts to keep their energy up, she always stressed that it needed to be <b>not</b> when they had customers waiting. And, as of late, Elsa had developed a habit of snacking more often than she ever used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had led to a few other changes as well. For a while now, Adela had thought there was something different about Elsa lately, and now catching her in the act, she figured out what it was. Among the girls who worked at the inn, Elsa was probably the most average-looking girl there. She didn't have curvaceous hips like Daniela, wasn't busty like Marta, and wasn't as young as Frenda. No, Elsa had always been the \"plain\" one among the group, but that didn't mean she couldn't get male attention if she wanted to. She was still beautiful of face and fair of skin. Men noticed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Adela noticed something much different. All that extra snacking had given Elsa the start of a nice rounded belly. Her stomach looked wider, softer, and her apron clung much tighter to it. It wasn't much, but it was something the wise old tavern owner could pick up on. Not that she minded. No, up north, a girl needed a bit more meat on her bones, and it showed she was a fine and healthy woman. What bothered her was that she couldn't have a barmaid distracted by eating all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, what do you think you're doing?\" she bellowed. \"We got orders to fill. You can eat when you get them done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa groaned. \"But, we've been at it non-stop all day. I haven't eaten anything since...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour ago,\" she finished for her. \"You're not getting out of it that easily. Every time I turn around, you're eating something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl rolled her eyes and went back to work. \"Can't help it when Medea is such a good cook,\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that seemed to be a common theme around here. Everyone was getting hooked on the gorgon's amazing food, and now that effect was working on some of her own girls. Daniela had a habit of accepting a bite or two from the male patrons who wanted an excuse to keep her talking at their tables. Marta was, of course, cooking with Medea, and therefore needed to taste everything as they made it. And Frenda was just so fascinated by it all, she happily ate any new dishes Medea wanted to try out to see if it would go over well with the customers. And Elsa, it seemed, just liked to eat the food whenever she could get a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stick to the work, and eat on breaks, that's all I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry, I didn't mean to do that,\" Adela heard a small voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Frenda, Adela had also noticed that she too took a special fancy to Medea's cooking, and it was showing on her much more than it was Elsa. Frenda was just one of those girls that seemed to gain a little padding everywhere. She still looked to be her same old self, just thicker. Her young, baby face had grown fuller over the past few weeks, her limbs a bit puffier, and she had started to widen a bit. Just now, she had accidentally bumped a table with her hip. It seemed that she wasn't aware of these changes herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela shook her head and went back to serving up orders. She was thankful for this little blessing in disguise that was Medea, but her girls had better get their head in the game if they wanted to keep up with all this popularity. And, at the same time, she may want to keep a cautious eye on the girls. If they weren't careful, they might find themselves to round to get around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What have people been saying?\" Medea asked, her curiosity peaked. The day was done, the last patron had left, and Medea had heard the girls whispering about something and decided to poke her head into the conversation. Metra, Elsa, and Daniela gave each other looks as if asking each other, <i>do we tell her?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are talking about a cult having arrived here.\" Frenda piped up, making the decision for the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Medea asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetra tilted her head. \"You don't know what a cult is?\" she said, once again dumbfounded at how much and yet how little Medea knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea, having spent her whole life underground, shook her head. She looked at Metra, sensing something was off- and indeed it was. Metra had gained some weight over the course of the last week, and while she was busty previously, now her chest stuck out enough that you had to stand a foot back or else end up making contact. That's not the only thing: Metra had weight piling everywhere else too, although it was much more noticeable in her chest region. Not that Medea picked up on that <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cult is a religion which practices dark rituals and the like. Summoning undead, sacrificing to demons, those sorts of things.\" Elsa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, that sounds awful.\" Medea says, placing her hands to her mouth. Elsa noticed, with some frustration, that Medea had barely put on a single pound. As it turns out, gorgon food is designed to be very fattening because they have to go long periods of time with very little to eat, although Elsa didn't know this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of that, it's all just gossip. Who knows, right?\" Daniela butted in, not wanted to scare the poor gorgon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not like I'd give them the chance to sacrifice any of <b>you</b> to some dark god. They come after you, they're going to <b>wish</b> they had the chance to regret it.\" Medea said, taking a heroic stance. Frenda loved it, but Elsa gave her a look, asking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, <i>can</i> you gorgons turn people to stone?\" At that, the four humans tensed while Medea looked at Elsa, her snakes looking at the other three with, as they saw it, hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, actually. Not many gorgons have that skill, but I was taught it at a young age.\" Medea casually said. All but Frenda froze, Elsa averting her eyes immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? What, you think I'm going to turn you into stone?\" Medea asks, continuing to stare at Elsa. \"If I wanted to turn you to stone, you'd already <b>be</b> stone.\" She said, failing to reassure anyone at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, come on you three, snap out of it. At least say something to her!\" Frenda said, moving to stand beside Medea. Frenda reached for Medea's hand, who instinctively took it, not entirely sure why they were holding hands like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-r-right. Sorry... just... I was thinking that was all just myths at this point.\" Elsa said, breaking the tension. Daniela looked at Frenda, curious as to why she so immediately sided with Medea instead of them. She remembered Frenda's breakdown, and immediately stopped thinking about any of it, ashamed of her own action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetra said, \"Well, I'm heading up to bed now. Goodnight. Need to work that nightmare fuel out of my system. Sorry Medea!\" the last part she called as she went up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's go to bed. Come on, Frenda.\" Daniella beckoned, expecting the younger girl to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to bed, Medea?\" she asked, looking at the green gorgon with nothing but awe. \"No, I'm going to stay up for a bit. I could use some dinner.\" Medea responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm going to stay up a bit longer, alright Daniella?\" Frenda said, clearly not looking for actual approval. Daniella was shocked at how Frenda seemed to cling to Medea's shadow, almost worshiping her every movement. \"O-okay... then. Elsa, you-\" she started to say, before seeing Elsa had gone into the kitchen, presumably to eat something. \"*sigh* Alright then. Goodnight, everybody!\" Daniella called to the three girls downstairs. Medea nodded, and Frenda immediately asked what she was going to make. The two walked into the kitchen, talking to each other as if long time friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>News of the cult came and went, grabbing a few enterprising adventurers as it passed through, and soon things were back to routine for the barmaids at the Icy Arms. As Medea soon learned, such rumors were commonplace in this line of work; after all, when dozens of interesting travelers from all around the realm made camp for the night in one room, interesting stories were bound to spring up like weeds in an old garden, as Daniella explained to her. And they were lovely stories too; Medea, while waiting for a scrumptious meal to finish baking or a stew to come to a boil, had developed the habit of listening at the door to the conversations outside, gleaning new things about the world outside of her caves with Marta begrudgingly filling in the blanks when needed. She had always known there were other realms and places beyond the caverns she once called home, but to hear the stories and tales told over warm hearths every night felt like a whole new world opening up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust another wonderful thing about working here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medea, you're supposed to be watching the stew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am watching it!\" the gorgon insisted as she dashed over to the boiling pot. \"You have to leave it sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to sink to the bottom and coagulate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, exactly!\" Medea responded cheerily. \"It's the best way to get the niko fruit juice at its spiciest!\" Medea probably came across as condescending to the more experienced chef, but in truth she was just excited to be working with actual ingredients once again. With the huge increase in business, Adela had doubled down on the new selling point of exotic foods and ensured that Medea had everything she needed in the kitchen, even going as far as paying mercenaries and adventurers to travel south and pick up roots and spices that Medea needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarta gave the overeager gorgon a look before grabbing onto a ladle and scooping up a portion of the soup, sipping it delicately. Her expression immediately softened as the delicious flavor hit her, though she quickly hid it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you sure this isn't magic of some sort at work?\" Marta said grumpily, taking another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it was you'd be turning to stone.\" the Gorgon pointed out as Marta took yet another long drink of the cooling stew. \"That's the only real magic I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MARTA!\" Adela barked from the back room suddenly. \"Stop sampling and get to baking, we have a full house tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human chef yelped, dripping a little of the soup onto her double chin and immediately busying herself with the food prep. Medea dashed over to help her, tail swishing back and forth as the two of them prepped orders. The days of Marta griping about having a second hand in the kitchen were long gone, and the two of them now worked in tandem, bouncing around and pumping out tasty exotic cuisine at breakneck speed. And as indicated by Marta being told to stop sampling, they bounced around quite a bit thanks to the delicious new cooking; since Medea's arrival behind the stove the busty chef had grown even bustier with time, straining her apron and testing the limits of the buttons trying to keep her two best friends in check. The chef regularly complained about the stares she got when trying to go about town, and once relayed a memorable story where her top had nearly burst off in the middle of a crowded store and the chaos that ensued afterwards. At the very least, she went on, they were largely distracted from the rest of her, indicating the healthy potbelly drooping over her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackspice Ale is finished!\" Medea called out as she finished up another order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got i-oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have i-eek!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniela and Elsa bounced against the doorway as they tried to enter at the same time, before Elsa stepped back, red-faced, and let the senior server go in first. Even then, her hips still passed within inches of the doorframe as she retrieved two mugs full of the black, sparking liquor and turned around, walking right into Elsa again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, careful!\" Elsa yelped, clutching her stomach as it wobbled to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my way!\" Daniela snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in MY way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop arguing and get back to work!\" Adela shouted from upstairs. The two girls huffed, then squeezed past one another as they headed to their tables. It was a particularly busy night for the girls, so a little bit of snippy talkback was expected, especially when they entered the kitchen. To put it politely, Medea thought to herself, it was getting a little small for the girls. Daniela's hips had begun to flare out so much that they regularly bumped into walls and shelves, and her thighs and rear were starting to get in on that action as well. Elsa on the other hand was just getting meatier and thicker all over, catching the eye of some city slickers from the south who liked their women on the meaty side and finally letting her rival the wide-reared Daniela as the resident eye candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea couldn't help but feel a little wary, since it was largely because of her cuisine that her new friends were starting to put on some pounds. Not to mention that even she had started to feel a little heavier lately, having a bit of trouble tying her apron around herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're running out of boar strips,\" Daniela announced. \"Where's Frenda? I thought she was supposed to be running ingredients for us.\"</span></div></div>",

Catching a glimpse of a meaty rear end past a table of drunken orc mercenaries, Medea craned her neck, daring to open the door just an inch wider to catch sight of Frenda, facing down a beefy looking man with beady eyes and a large red nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck do you mean you don't have it, it's plastered on all the signs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we have Blackspice Ale, if that's what interests y-you s-sir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man huffed. \"Well OBVIOUSLY that's what I meant! Dumb wench...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea glared at the bullying man as the conversation carried on. Unfortunately, as she found out, customers like this were all too common, the folks who were too drunk, stupid, or headstrong to think they were anything less then deities and expected to be treated as such. She didn't know how the other girls handled men like this day in and day out, though this fellow was particularly unpleasant; he looked rather unwashed and punctuated every mean thing he said with a personal insult. Poor Frenda was shaking so hard that her flabby form was jiggling on its own by the time she was done. Maybe Medea could make her one of those tasty melon tarts Marta was teaching her how to make. Those always put a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gorgon nearly shut the door and turned back to start making the tart when the chubby barmaid, still not quite used to her growing size, turned around just a little too quickly and knocked over a stew right into the angry man's lap. His eyes opened wide as he leapt to his feet, howling and shouting as his whole face turned cherry red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigosh, I'm so sorry sir!\" Frenda yelped. \"I'll get-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU STUPID BITCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he drew his hand back and slapped her across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda had barely tumbled to the ground when the kitchen door suddenly slammed open. Marta called out in confusion at the noise, and Elsa went ghastly pale as something green shot past her. Daniella had rushed to Frenda's side but felt herself being shoved out of the way by a thick green tale swaying back and forth furiously. Poor Frenda, through her painful sobbing tears, caught sight of a flash of black as the figure over her raised a hand in the direction of the rowdy customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea brought her hand down in a flash of scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large man fell backwards, flailing like a madman. Blood poured from four long gashes across his cheek and nose. His screaming silenced the whole inn as he stumbled to his feet, blinded by fear, and ran headfirst out the door. Medea, her chest heaving, looked down at her right hand to see blood smeared across her hands, dripping from the talons that pierced his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of what just happened came crashing down like a cave-in. Medea stood in the center of the room, completely undisguised, drawing attention to herself in the worst way possible. She looked over at Daniella and Frenda, the latter of whom was so shocked she even stopped crying and looked just as pale as the senior barmaid did. Elsa stood nearby, gripping an empty plate so tightly her hands shook as Marta gripped the kitchen door so hard her nails were digging into the wood. Adela, quiet as a ghost, had even wandered out from the back, her lips tightly clenched and her expression unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea wanted to run, leave all of this behind, but she couldn't seem to muster the energy to tear herself away. Thus she looked around the room in horror, her Gorgon features on full, horrifying display as the patrons...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, Gorgon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this was it then. Medea turned to face the customer on her right, a swarthy human from the South with a deep scar beneath his eye patch who had been conversing with the customer. She winced at the sight of blood flecked across his leather tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y....yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took a deep breath, gently dabbing the blood on his face with his kerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can cancel his order, lass,\" he said, a twinkle in his good eye. \"Methinks he won't be coming back here tonight.\" A burst of laughter came from the surrounding onlookers as the usual din of the crowd started to become audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..of course, sir...\" Medea said, distracted by how utterly confused she was. Wiping her hand off on her apron, she backpedaled from the room as the one-eyed man got up to join another band of adventurers. Returning to her sanctuary in the kitchen, Marta slammed the door behind her the Gorgon as Medea fell into a chair. Marta opened and closed her mouth a few times as she tried and failed to form words until she finally found some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just...\" she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Medea said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And everyone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened again. Medea nearly leapt to her feet, thinking guards were coming to arrest her, but it was just Daniela, her arm wrapped around Frenda's chubby shoulders as the two waddled into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, tried to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, son of a...biscuit!\" Daniella griped, catching her language in time as those thunder thighs of hers blocked the doorway again, this time with the help of Frenda's pudgy form. Squeezing herself out again, she turned Frenda around and pushed her in front of her, successfully conquering the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no sitting around!\" the elder barmaid urged. \"We have business to take care of, girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I...\" Medea stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll discuss it after work, the customers aren't gonna wait for us to have a feel good conversation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate to say it, but she has a point,\" Marta admitted. \"Let's just get through today and see where that leaves us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, Medea got up again, brushing off her apron before remembering the blood. Ripping it off, she trotted over to the pile of laundry in the corner and grabbed a fresh one. She still remembered how the tavern crowd reacted with hostility that first night when she arrived. What had happened to make them change their attitude so suddenly? Did the good food help them tolerate a strange girl making it? Was the man she attacked just incredibly unpopular?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-medea?\" Something brushed against her tail, making her twitch. She turned around and was winded when Frenda grabbed her in an incredibly tight hug, burying her face in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you,\" she whispered through gentle sobs. Medea, totally blindsided by this move, patted the shorter girl on the back of the neck as she hugged back. After a few moments, Frenda finally broke away, rubbing away tears from her eyes. \"Well...better get back to work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" Thinking quickly, Medea grabbed one of the pastries sitting on a plate nearby and put it in the girl's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenda blinked in surprise. \"But this is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make some more,\" Medea insisted. Frenda smiling gratefully, stuffing the pastry into her mouth and trotting off to resume her duties. As she exited the room, Medea could make out the sound of a slight burp. Giving her a wide berth and heading in the opposite direction into the kitchen was the very person Medea had been dreading the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Adela announced, glaring down at the Gorgon with a serious expression. \"That little incident...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll just go then,\" Medea said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go?\" Adela raised her eyebrows a fraction of an inch. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea blinked. \"You're..you're throwing me out right? I attacked a customer, I exposed who I was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You defended your co-worker from a drunken brute,\" Adela recounted. \"I give you girls a hard time on occasion but I've never tolerated the patrons abusing my staff. What makes you think I'd be unhappy about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you revealing yourself...why don't you take a look outside, at the table in the back, near the window?\" Adela suggested. Confused, Medea tiptoed to the door and opened it a crack, peering outside at the table. There seemed to be a few explorers gathered around throwing dice, alongside a minotaur and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another Gorgon?!?\" Medea nearly shouted, drawing curious looks from the bar patrons. It most certainly was, an older woman with that unmistakable snake-tail hair. She wasn't even cloaked, and seemed to be laughing and talking amiably with her friends, including a rather pretty lady dressed in fashionable blues that she seemed to be sweet on. It was astounding and a little awe inspiring to see one of her own kind so out and in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, the thing about being a popular destination,\" Adela continued. \"Is that you tend to attract all sorts of strange and odd people from around Yndyre. To the locals, you're plenty unusual, sure. To this lot?\" She gestured to the crowd outside. \"You'd have to work to stand out from the crowd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea felt as though a great weight was lifted off her shoulders. She may have had new friends and a place to live and work, but until the moment where she ran out to defend her new friend from an angry drunk, it had been like she was in a cage. A roomy, pleasant cage, but a cage nonetheless. And to barge out of that cage and be told it was okay for her to leave...it was like the Gorgon spent her days on the run holding her breath and finally let go. In short...it felt like she was free. The fact that she wasn't going to get thrown out though did leave one important question, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...why did you come to talk to me, then?\" Medea asked. And when Adela smiled...it felt like this was a different person then the bossy woman who ordered her to hide in the back so long ago. She was strict, sure, but the smile confirmed something Medea sort of knew all along; for all the times she made the other girls gripe and complain, she really did care deeply about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Adela continued...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gruntilda made her way across the field of grassy hills far from Adinand she called. <i>This was the life</i> she thought to herself. Gruntilda was a... something. Standing twelve feet tall and nine feet wide, she walked on legs normally belonging to a gorgon with the nine tails of a kitsune, instead replaced with nine serpentine masses, trailing behind her. Her many, many arms stretched out as she let out a long yawn from her half feline, half canine head, reaching to scratch at the fur on her muzzle and no where else. Her stomach was a mostly muddled brown color with some hints of green, red, blue, and yellow, as well as a few others, visible around the edges. This pattern flowed up her chest and to the base of her neck, as well as down past her stomach and around to her tails and the inner sides of her legs. In almost every other place, scales of scattered patterns were visible, a veritable rainbow of colors spread across her back and around her being. If she were to look upon you, she would see you with her eight different eyes, each one serpentine in appearance. Her hair bounced all on its own, the thriving mass of snakes that it was. If it were to lay flat and still, it would flow all the down to her hips, but it instead dances around as though bored. Gruntilda, on the other hand, was hardly bored. She was enjoying life. One of her sisters came to sit next to her, saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever wish you could go and explore places like Adinand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, we'd probably be shot on sight with our monstrous appearance,\" Gruntilda replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but really though- do you?\" She asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I what, Saia?\" Gruntilda said with a laugh, confused about her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to go explore? Like, see Adinand or Pyknos Verge, or any of those places, you know? Get away from this simple farmer life.\" Saia replied, clearly annoyed with her sister's lack of attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaia wasn't the same as Gruntilda. She was only ten feet tall and had no legs but instead a tail, not unlike her sister's nine. Although she did have snakes upon her head, they weren't quite the same, instead being more like a mass of Black Mambas than her sister's more Gorgonian snakes. Her sister's stomach stuck out a good eight feet ahead of her, and she immensely obese. Her chest stuck out similarly, and her rump made it so that, while sitting, she appeared to be the same height as Gruntilda, if not taller. Her tail was quite thick, and was at least ten feet in length. She sported three chins and a puffy face which would have looked like it was made of dough if not for her fur. Her thighs were quite thick as well, and her arms where heavily padded with fat. Gruntilda noticed she was breathing heavily from the simple short walk between their home and the hill Gruntilda was stood upon. Gruntilda sat down and gave her sister's question some thought. After a long, long pause, she finally said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually. Not because I want to get away from here, but because I don't want to be <b>trapped</b> here, you know what I mean? I'd like to know I could have more freedom than just this farm.\" Gruntilda said, sighing but still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least things are peaceful here, right?\" Their brother, Mako, said as he walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner time, you three!\" Their mother called from inside their home. Mako watched as Gruntilda jumped up with ease, while Saia struggled due to her rotund form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little help?\" She asked her older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Mrs. Whale.\" He replied, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,-*pant*-at least I'm-*wheeze*-not as big as-*pant*-mom <b>wants</b> me to-<i>oh, jeez</i>-be.\" She said, panting after having barely lifted herself up at all, most of the work having been done by Mako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be if you keep eating the way you do. Besides, you can't fault her for it: it's the Naga in her talking.\" Mako replied as he began to head towards the house, the mouth in the back of his head seemingly licking it's lips, the scaled tendrils which comprised it twitching with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coming?\" He called back to her, his fish-like tail swishing up and down with calm anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... y-yeah, just... hey, do you think you could bring me my meal?\" Saia said, somehow exhausted from the simple act of standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna be the size of ten whales if I start doing that. That sound good to you?\" Mako teased, crossing both his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I get it, I'm a fat pig, just bring me my food!\" Saia shouted, exhausting herself to the point of needing to sit down again. Mako laughed as he jogged to the house, ready to carry vast quantities of food to feed his sister's ever expanding corpulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGruntilda was walking around their farm after a day's work when she saw something approaching. Coming over the hill, it was a traveling merchant. She sat down on the hill and waited, watching the merchant. Their home was not far from a village, though far enough as to keep them isolated. The merchant, seemingly a newcomer, stopped and gawked at Gruntilda. She waved hello, and the merchant feebily waved back. Gruntilda got up to approach, raising her hands as a sign of peace. The merchant, though clearly terrified, didn't run away. She got close and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there sir. How is your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi... there. Um... my day has been good, uh... y-yours?\" the merchant said, terrified of what he was speaking to. After some time and talk, the merchant warmed up to her presence, seeing she wasn't a threat. He thanked her for the nice conversation, and asked what she had come to see him for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just wanted to make you didn't think we were monsters. A lot of people do, and then things get messy from there. I figure you're going to be running this route more than once, right?\" Gruntilda answered, beaming as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, ma'am. Well, thank you for the, uh, heads up. Sorry folks treat you that way. You may be big, but 'at don' mean you're not nice. 'Don't judge a book by it's cover,' that's what me mama always told me. Guess I should be glad I listened to her, huh?\" he said with a laugh. He carried on his way, saying goodbye, and Gruntilda went back home, seeing only half an hour had passed- much less time than she had thought had passed. When she got home, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gruntilda went down the mountain and towards the door built into the hillside that was her front door. Opening it, she saw her mother on the other side, cooking yet more food she was going to try and feed to her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was the hybrid to rule all hybrids. You see, her family didn't get this way by simple chance of love, no, they came into being with purpose. Her family had been attempting to incorporate as much of the other species as the could into their genetics, a tradition in their family stretching back long before anyone can remember. It was something no one had ever questioned, or at least no one could remember it being questioned, and Katta'atta, her mother, was the culmination of that. She was a being who bore every trait possible. Many, many horns, wings, many tails of many different kinds, skin of all sorts of colors, scales of all different patterns, fur of all different feels, a mouth in the back of her head comprised of snake-headed tendrils, normal hair growing alongside it, large claws, a great bosom, fins on her back, both gills and lungs,  and, to top it all off, a body built more like a worm than a person. Her mother was a sight to behold, a one-of-a-kind abomination. The only thing she lacked was legs, something which didn't matter in the slightest since she had ten arms of all different genetic origins. Gruntilda knew that they had once been human, but had long since lost their resemblance to that, save for most of them being bipedal and standing upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why, hello Gruntilda! So good to see you! I must've missed you this morning. Did you enjoy breakfast?\" she asked, picking Gruntilda up and hugging her. Breakfast was more of a grand feast, as was every meal they had. Gruntilda often wondered where her mother got all the food that she did, but whenever she asked her mother would always say, \"we moms have our ways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast was delicious! I love your cooking so much! Say, have you seen Basilissa anywhere?\" She asked her mother, struggling to hide the fact that her mother's embrace was stifling her ability to breathe. Gruntilda did take comfort in how soft the embrace was. Katta'atta was quite large, and not just from being a hybrid. She was an avid cooker and gluttonous devourer. She would be cooking food all day, much of it going into her gullet. If it weren't for her serpentine means of locomotion, she would have been immobilized long, long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basilissa? Oh, I just sent her off with some food. She wasn't full from breakfast, poor thing, so she's been eating since.\" Her mother said with an endearing tone as she set down her daughter. \"I imagine she's in her room. Here, I'll-\" she then attempted to shift herself so that she wasn't so completely blocking the other hallway. Gruntilda just managed to squeeze past her before heading down the hallway to the flight of stairs and to her sister's room. Gruntilda knocked on the door, saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basilissa? Is it okay if I come in? Just wanted to chat with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,-*munch*-of course! Please,-*chomp*-come on in!\" <i>Yeah, that's her alright</i>, Gruntilda thought. Her sister Basilissa, seemed to be of near identical genetic composure to her mother, in that her physical characteristics were quite similar. Thinking about it now, Gruntilda supposed her sister also thought like her mother: endearing, gluttonous... Gruntilda opened the door, seeing her sister munching away on what seemed to be portion five of twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-*munch*-shish! How are-*glug, glug, glugl*-<i>ahh</i>-you doing?\" Basilissa said, not bothering to stop eating or even look her sister in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing fine, thanks. I figure your day is going well?\" Gruntilda asks, watching as her sister eats ravenously, as though having been starved for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-*gulp*-am doing okay,-*much*-but I could-*chomp*-ush shome-*gulp*-more food.\" She said, making Gruntilda roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always need more food.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-*munch, munch*-a-*chomp*-gro-*munch*-\" she stopped talking, overtaken by the desire to eat more and more food. Gruntilda sat down on her bed next to her, barely fitting. \"Hey-*glug, glug, glug*-can you-*chomp, munch, chomp*-\" she started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...bring you more food? Sure, be right back.\" Gruntilda finished, to her sister's delight. She was hoping to be able to talk with her sister a bit more, but all she ever seems to do is eat now. That's a problem she's running into with her whole family: all anyone wants to do is eat. All except Mako, who just wants to do his own thing most of the time anyways. After making twelve runs of getting her food, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moving can be a huge change for people; new locations, new people and a new way of life. For Creta it was more the middle area that was relevant to her, as she had grown up in the streets of Adinah. The minotaur had fond memories of running up and down the cobbled streets, playing with the local kids and hiding from her parents briefly when they called her home for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was all a long time ago, during which Creta had fallen in love and tied the knot with her significant other. Although Creta\u2019s new wife was not as familiar with all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou there Emra?\u201d The minotaur called out down the flight of stairs, as her spouse wandered up, crate in hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah just\u2026taking in the sights\u2026\u201d Came the reply. Emra was a minotaur, just like Creta, but with pale white skin that faded to a couple of brown patches; one of which was located on her muzzle-like nose. She had long ears that drooped across her cheeks, long brown that was mostly straight except for the tips and a pair of thin gray horns that jutted backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooooo how\u2019re you liking the big city?\u201d Creta teased as she leaned over the landing, big smile across her own half-muzzled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve barely been here an hour\u2026give me a little while to settle.\u201d Emra eye-rolled as she smiled back at her wife, before dumping the crate of her belongings in their living room. It wasn\u2019t the largest place around; there was a decent sized living room that led on to a single bedroom and another to kitchen. Inside the bedroom was another door to their bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmra\u2019s hooves clip-clopped loudly as she wandered around the perimeter, peeking into each room as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike it?\u201d Creta asked as she turned to her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmra stared as her partner entered the living room. Creta had perfect smooth coal-black skin and just as dark hair that curled naturally and laid across her shoulders. Her horns were short and gray, and her long ears flicked upwards, making her look constantly slightly surprised. Creta was also kinda chubby, with a rather pronounced bubble-butt and a belly that always just-about wobble each time she moved. This contrasted heavily with her muscular and toned wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like it has you in it.\u201d Emra teased with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooo you tease\u2026\u201d Creta purred as she drew close, muzzles nearly touching and her ropey tail began to slide up Emra\u2019s hoofed foot and on towards her tough-as-iron thigh. \u201cYou that keen to try the new bed out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmra kissed her partner on the lips and embraced her slowly. \u201cI would love to\u2026but it looks like it\u2019s a single\u2026and built for someone a bit shorter than us.\u201d Emra explained before nodding in the bedroom\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dung!\u201d Creta yelled, pouting something fierce as she went to check it for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmra chuckled, she hadn\u2019t heard her wife swear very often, so it was quite funny to hear the light-hearted minotaur curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told the landlord we were a couple!\u201d The darker-skinned bovine huffed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably thought we meant business partners or something\u2026probably isn\u2019t very used to modern life.\u201d Emra shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr he\u2019s a pervert who wants us to scooch up together real close on a small bed, probably likes watching girl-on-girl action from a peep-hole.\u201d Creta half joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like watching girl-on-girl action\u2026\u201d Emra butted in, \u201cfrom a first person perspective of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreta couldn\u2019t help giggle at that one. \u201cI love how funny you are! \u2026Now! Let\u2019s get us something to eat\u2026\u201d The minotaur remarked, changing the subject as she began to rummage through a crate of food supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chubby bovine sauntered into the kitchen, her wife called after her. \u201cDon\u2019t give me too much pork this time! You know what too much meat does to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women were all too aware what too much meat did to Emra. When the pair first met they were still heifers; Creta fresh out of education, and Emra learning her parent\u2019s trade. Emra\u2019s father had taken his daughter to the big city on a trip to see where he sold his goods, and how he bartered and haggled with other traders. Creta was looking for groceries when she first saw Emra, and she cut quite a different figure to how she looked now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur Creta saw that day was not the lithe toned woman she married, but a rotund fat teenager, with a gut like a sack of grain strapped to her waist and a face as round as a kart-wheel. They had quickly bonded when Emra subtly indicated she wanted to get away and do something more interesting; after that they exchanged addresses and kept in touch via letters, and the rest is history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmra had worked hard to slim down from her three hundred pound high, but it had left its mark on her. The pale minotaur\u2019s legs and arms had never gotten that big, plus when she began to exercise seriously all that fat under her skin was replaced with muscle. But no amount of muscle could replace her huge gut and blobby double-chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Emra had been left with a lot of excess skin around her neck and stomach. She was extremely sensitive about it, and even the carefree Creta didn\u2019t dare to try and comfort Emra about it; the topic would just upset her. And she certainly had to be careful with Emra\u2019s portion sizes; the poor woman had such a terrible metabolism that just a bit too much dessert forced her to train like mad for weeks to drop the weight it put on her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the muscular woman waited, Creta busied herself in the kitchen. She thought of herself as a not-too-bad cook, and longed to work in the kitchens of the tavern she worked in to improve her craft. But she did love playfully interacting with the patrons; she got on with them very well and would miss them if she was stuck in the back rooms cooking all day, so she took out her culinary interests at home. It was part of the reason why her uniform had been getting a little snug around the waist as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk hun, dig in!\u201d Creta beamed as she laid out her creation on the couple\u2019s small table. It wasn\u2019t anything fancy, just some grilled meats and vegetables, but she was proud of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair mostly ate in silence, with occasional words of praise from Emra. \u201cMmmm, love what you did with the pork\u2026\u201d The long-horned woman stated, filling her mouth with another forkful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, I just covered it in some simple spices before I cooked it.\u201d Creta laughed off modestly; \u201cBut if you really want to experience some fine dining, we gotta find you a job. My barmaid work will cover the rent and food\u2026but not much else. If we want to live as lavishly as the king\u2019s harem, we gotta really rake in the money.\u201d She wasn't lying, Creta had lived modestly after moving out of her parents house. Her clothes were simple and plain, but comfortable. Thankfully she saved money on shoes because of her all-terrain hooves, it made up for how expensive minotaur clothes were. It took a lot of material to cover an 8-foot tall person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be looking around town tomorrow as dawn breaks.\u201d Emra replied as she swallowed her mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd until then?\u201d Creta asked with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmra leaned in until her muzzle was against Creta\u2019s ear, and whispered \u201cWe shall enjoy the single bed\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the middle of a magnificent, large and well decorated room, above a heap of cushions, rested a large Kitsune, likely as soft as the same cushions she was resting upon. Her hair was fiery red, just like her tails. She was wearing an elegant pink robe with a design of golden flowers and a little bronze crown on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitsune in question was also very fat, with a big round gut that was pressing against the robe's belt, two legs as large as a slim woman's waist and a noticeable pair of pillowy breasts, whose cleavage was uncovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was Vuko, one of the king's first concubines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few servants entered the rooms with trays of food, which they laid next to Vuko, and then quickly retracted, as if she could eat them along with the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in stark contrast with her appearance, she ate with the same elegance of a boar, spoiling her dress and the cushions around her, all the while tenaciously shaking the fox-tails behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA maid rolled her eyes and sighed, thinking about all the mess she'd have to clean once the Kitsune ended her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished, Vuko leaned on her back and untied the belt of her robe, freeing her large stuffed gut.<br>\r\nThe servants proceeded with their job; some cleaned what food stains and crumbs they could, and others massaged Vuko's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitsune belched, not caring about the poor servants who were about to lose their senses standing near here. They were insignificant compared to her: The King's favorite concubine. Though, recently he hasn't been visiting her for a while. Thinking of this made Vuko angrily but delicately place an hand on her belly and a frown appeared on her fat face, much to the terror of the servants, who feared she wasn't satisfied with their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all the women of King Roland's harem, Vuko used to be slim...ish.<br>\r\nShe was one of the many Kitsune monks that lived in the temples but, unlike them, she wasn't very devoted and was actually pretty bored with her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for her, she had heard of the king in the central regions who collected only the most beautiful women, and the elegant living conditions they received under his care. Thus, a young Vuko didn't waste any time traveling to Adinah to seduce him and conquered Roland with her already curvaceous body.<br>\r\nSince then, these had been wonderful years. She's been pampered and treated like a queen, more so, she considered herself the queen. She was the King's favorite and the mother of his eldest child, therefore the future heir, or so she would like to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was satisfied, she put on a new fancy dress and left the room to explore her castle, only to remember that walking was really tiring, so she opted to visit the concubines main room. She might as well concede them the honor of her presence once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening the two double doors, in front of her there were masses of fat, though in different sizes. The king was known for his peculiar taste in women, and it was no wonder he had a harem of women of different kinds of that, but hardly anyone could have expected he would've started collecting women of all races. <br>\r\nAnd he got a wide assortment: merfolk, gorgon, djinn, orc and, of course, a Kitsune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, she noticed there had been no trace of Mitera for a while, not that she minded. The castle had been quieter without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVuko considered herself superior to all the other concubines. In fact, she thought that she was the original and the others some mere copies to entertain the king while she couldn't. She looked with superiority at the orc and the djinn, who were both smaller than her, a sign that they'd been there for less time, while she looked with disdain at that whale of a mermaid and that incredibly fat gorgon. In their case, the logic was that they were too lost in food and couldn't contain themselves, in particular the mermaid, whose only time she wasn't eating was when she simply had no food to reach. Vuko wondered if she'd make the floor collapse under her if she kept growing like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what makes you come all the way here?\" Jamila asked sarcastically. \"Boredom or hunger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say both,\" replied Vuko, grabbing a plate with sweet treats, and then picking a handful of them and devouring them like they were the last ones left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe djinn stepped back, avoiding the crumbs and said, \"Hey! Watch your manners. You make the whale right there look like a proper lady.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the word \"whale\", the quarter- ton mermaid briefly interrupted her never-ending lunch and asked, \"Were you talking about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, about the king's dog,\" replied Vuko sarcastically, spitting drops of cream everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I didn't know the king has a dog. I wonder what it tastes like,\" muttered the mermaid. Wondering about the taste of a dog made her hungry again and went back to her main activity: eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVuko was too busy to deal with how strange that was, and, despite eating less, she was much messier, and once she was finished, she left colorful drops and crumbs on all the carpets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I think I\u2019m going to have a bath,\" muttered Vuko, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ordered a warm bath, and a massage on her back. Once immerged in the water up to her chest, a servant gently stroked her fat shoulders like two rolls of bread, and the Kitsune was munching a few sweet fruits kept in a golden bowl. She loved her concubine life and all the comfort she got. The only price was to eat as much as possible to gain weight, and Vuko considered it a fair trade, though she disliked those who ate to the point of hindering their mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a servant entered in the bathhouse and interrupted that moment <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam, you're wanted outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, call me your highness. Second, I hope it's someone important!\" grumbled Vuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, it is,\" replied the servant hesitantly</span></div></div>",

They were no longer under the canopy of the forest, but now out in the sun, bound for the capital city. Coming back to consciousness, she remembered the chains that bound her wrists. The humans had captured her nearly two days ago. All she knew now was that they were taking her to Bosch Keep, the massive castle that lay at the center of Yndyre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was stiff and sore after having been jostled around in the cart for that long, and her wrists were starting to chafe. Still, her fear at the fate that awaited her at the castle made her forget about all of her discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she awoke, her other senses returned to her. Her tall ears flicked as she heard the sounds of her captors chatting among themselves, though she barely paid attention to what they were saying. She had learned quickly that it was better for her to not appear to be listening or to even be moving. They taunted her less when they thought she was sleeping. How had she gotten into this mess anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia was stirred awake by the same noise that had woken her for the past two months. \"Shh, it's okay. Mama's here,\" she cooed to her newborn son, who was whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was beautiful, she thought, as she gazed down at his big brown eyes: his father's eyes, she reminded herself. She stroked the side of his head, near his little elven ears, which hadn't quite opened up yet. And he had the sweetest smile. How she wished his father could see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just over three months, her mate, Inaril, had been sick with an unknown disease. The healers knew it had come from exposure to humans, but had yet to find a cure. He had gone into a fever-induced coma just before their son, Rhalas, was born. Since then, she had been on her own while he was slowly dying in the healers tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rhalas finished feeding, she sighed. \"Maybe he will at least be awake today,\" she said to him, trying to convince herself more than anything. Poor Inaril had not even been conscious to know he had a son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled Rhalas onto a sling strung around her back and began her walk to the healers' tents. Several neighbors stopped to ask how she had been since Rhalas' birth or offer condolences about Inaril. She hadn't been out too much in the past few weeks, trying to avoid this exact situation. She hoped she could hold it together today. Between all the changes to her hormones and all the strain she was under, she had been an emotional wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia was halted as she neared the healers. \"I'm sorry,\" Lemill, the healer elder, told her sorrowfully, \"he's still not well and likely contagious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been hearing the same thing day in and day out. She was just lucky they were able to still keep him alive at this point, she knew. \"And you have found no cures?\" she asked in an accusatory tone. She didn't mean to sound like that, but she was getting exhausted by all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed a hand on her shoulder. \"We are trying everything we can, Isallia. Believe me. But with no one returning alive from the scouting parties, there's very little we can learn about this disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia fought back tears and only nodded in agreement. \"We will let you as soon as anything changes. You and the little one take care for now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a weak smile and decided to head back. There was always tomorrow, she had to keep telling herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost bumped into Silra, one of the village elders. Hm, she seemed a little larger since the last time Isallia saw her. Course, she was one to talk. Isallia was still a quite plump after having her child. Plus, they had been at peace with the satyrs now for a couple of years. Seemed natural that people were able to rest and eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isallia, I see you're out and about,\" Silra said, not really seeming all that concerned with her. \"Seems that you're doing well then. Listen, our last scouts have gone missing, and your family is next on the rotation. Since Inaril is still sick, and you seem well enough, you'll have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel Rhala's tiny little hands tapping at her back as these horrendous words tumbled out of Silra's mouth. \"You can't be serious,\" Isallia sputtered. \"Rhala's still too young for me to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilra only rolled her eyes, not really listening. \"Look, it isn't our first choice either. But, these humans keep getting closer and closer to us. We have to watch them. Plus, you were one of the best. You'll be fine to scout for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but that's final. Make arrangements, and meet the scouting party in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia had recruited the help of her friend, Niyi to watch Rhala while she was gone. \"Silra is just being ridiculous,\" Niyi said. \"How can she think to do this to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reluctantly handed Rhala to her. \"Yeah well, I'm not getting much of a choice in this. I promise, I'll be back by nightfall.\" She gently kissed Rhala's forehead as she said this. She hoped she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not at all what had happened. Some human hunters had found their party just before the sun had set. They had slaughtered all the others, but for some reason kept her. She hadn't figured out why, and she dreaded to find out the answer. They were getting close to the keep, she could tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell your king, he'll learn nothing from me,\" she spat. \"I'd rather die than tell him the secrets of the elves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spear prodded her in the side. \"Shut up, elf whore!\" one of the hunters shouted. \"You'll do what we say, and right now, that's shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prodded her again to punctuate this sentence. Yva help her, she prayed to herself. She could only imagine what horrors awaited her at the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dragged in to the great hall by three of the hunters. Two had proven too few when she put up a good fight to get away. The king, a tall and imposing man sat at the head of the table, clearly uninterested in this party disturbing his feast. Upon first glance, he seemed like a round, jovial sort of fellow with dark-red hair. But when she gazed into those eyes that looked at her like a predator eyes a meal, she knew that was not the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia could not help but notice the large proportions of the women in attendance at the feast. They were all varying sizes of \"large,\" some were downright immense. Many of them were too busy greedily devouring their dinners, brought on by a small platoon of servants. Only one or two bothered to look up at the strange, exotic creature before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty,\" the lead hunter said, \"while traveling the Pyknos Verge, we encountered the rare and beautiful creatures known as the elves. We were able to capture one. Perhaps she would make an excellent addition to your harem? For a price of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tall, pointed ears perked. What had they just said? Harem? They were sorely mistaken if they thought she would willingly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" the king said examining her with keen interest, \"you know, she would do well here. I could use...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I could use another woman for my 'collection,'\" he said with a laugh. Isallia did not find it so amusing. \"Yes, I've never had an elf among my women. Quite frankly, I've never seen one this up close before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped down from his spot at the head of the table and came close to examine her. She refused to meet his gaze. She was not some wild animal to be gawked at so. The king circled around her, like a wild cat watching his prey. This greatly unsettled Isallia. At first she assumed him to be a child-like fool who was only amused by the newest \"toy\" to his collection. The look he was giving her now told her there was something darker behind that gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very charming features,\" he said, completing his examination. \"You know, I imagined them a little shorter, but this one's actually quite beautiful. A little bony, sure.\" He pinched her side, which caused her to bolt around, and give him a fierce look. \"But she'll be presentable in a couple months,\" he finished, chuckling. \"I like the fire this one's got in her eyes. She'll be a real treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You so much as touch me again, and you will find limbs ripped off,\" Isallia spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king seemed hardly fazed and laughed again. \"Oh, yes, quite a bit of fun indeed. However, I think it's time you started getting used to the rules around here, little elf. From here on out, you will address me as 'your majesty' or King Roland. Are we clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damus has a special place for people like you when you die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's friendly demeanor shattered as he grabbed her by the throat. She never realized how quickly his personality could turn around. She suppressed the urge to quiver with fright. Only now had she come to realize what a dangerous situation she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have guards here, a great many actually, who would love nothing more than smashing your pretty body bone by bone. I'd watch how you speak to me. Now then, I imagine these fellows here have not properly taken care of you on your journey here. You must be tired. My servants will show you to your chambers.\" He tossed a small bag of gold to the hunters, who greedily snatched it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia was meanwhile halfway down the halls, following the servants. While it would have been easy to overpower them, she knew the king was right, and that with his masses of guards, she had no hope of escaping...yet. She would take the time to figure out the layout of the castle and plan her escape from there. It was not like that would be hard. With her only being a member of his slew of women, she'd probably get free range of exploring the castle. Plenty of opportunities to watch guard shifts and figure out the best time to make her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed chambers she was given were quite elegant, she had to admit. She was a little surprised with how big they were. It made her wonder if the king treated all his women this well, or if this was only small lodgings and there were grander rooms for his favorites, or even the queen, if there was one.<br>\r\nStill, she had to admit, she was tired. She climbed in to the massive, but incredibly soft bed. She was a little disturbed by the animal fur blankets. Not that she was unused to having animal hides for coverings, but just not this much of it. She wondered how many animals had been slaughtered to make something like this to cover a bed this big. Still, the castle was much more drafty and cold than her snug hut in the forest, and decided that beggars could not be choosers. Isallia did not realize just how tired she was as she almost instantly drifted off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke to a cheerful voice greeting her. \"Ah, did I disturb you, miss?\" the serving girl said as she set down the last of several trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia sat up to find that a more than hearty breakfast had been set out. More like a small feast, she thought. Something like this could've easily fed all the elders in the village back home. The girl must've noticed her wide-eyed look. \"Oh, no one expects you to eat all this,\" she said, \"at least not yet. No, his majesty just didn't know what sort of things you would like. We've never had an elf before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly got up to survey all that they had brought. One thing she immediately noticed was the overpowering, and sometimes conflicting smells of all the flavors. \"There seems to be an awful lot of meat just for breakfast,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl wilted a little, feeling as though she had done something wrong. \"Oh, a thousand apologies, miss. Do elves not eat meat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine. We sometimes do,\" Isallia said, trying to make her feel better, \"just not so much at one time. It seems like an awful waste to kill so many animals for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded. \"Noted. I'll let the cooks know by this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia sniffed at what appeared to be a familiar smelling berry smell coming from what looked like some sort of gelatinous spread. She began to put some of it on a piece of bread. She had to admit, she had never eaten this well back home, and for the odd assortment of human cuisine, it wasn't all that bad. Plus, her captors had practically starved her for the past few days. Anything would\u2019ve tasted good at this point. \"Will there be anything else, ma'am?\" the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, no I guess, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Tevi, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Tevi. No, I plan on looking around the castle some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's eyes went wide, thinking that was the silliest thing she had said. \"Oh, no, miss, you're not allowed to leave your chambers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia's eyes narrowed. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTevi shifted nervously, trying to find the best way to explain. \"Well, you see, miss, the king entertains a great many lords and such from neighboring lands, and he is very particular about showing off to these visitors. Since you're one of the new girls, you're well...not suitable to be seen yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it seemed to register. The other women she had seen, the food, it all made sense now. \"He wants to fatten me up, doesn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, his majesty does clearly have a type, miss. Oh don't worry. It isn't all bad. Some of the girls really do like being here, and the cooks are excellent. If it's boredom you're worried about, I can make some arrangements. Do you like sewing? Reading? Wait, can elves read?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl babbled on, it was all Isallia could do not to vent her frustrations in the slew of curse words she wanted to say. That bastard was smart, smarter than she gave him credit for anyway. It was a perfect way to keep her from escaping. Keep her locked away in here until she was too big to really get out. Hm, she'd have to get more creative if she was going to get out of here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isallia was inconsolable for several days after that. She was truly and utterly trapped. There was no reason for her to live anymore, she thought. She would never see her son or Inaril again. She could never go home. She would be forever locked in this prison of twisted torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTevi had tried desperately to make the poor elf comfortable in her new home, but knew that nothing she was doing was helping. She could not possibly know why Isallia was so sad, but she could only imagine. She was probably scared and alone and the poor thing probably had someone back from wherever it was she was from that she was hopelessly missing. Unfortunately, Isallia had let this sorrow manifest in another way. \"Please, miss,\" Tevi begged quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry,\" Isallia snapped for the dozenth time. \"I'm not giving in to your king's despicable 'tastes.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, miss, his majesty has very explicit instructions to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he can kill me if he wants to,\" Isallia snapped. \"I don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTevi shook her head. \"Oh, he's not going to be pleased about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left, leaving Isallia with her own thoughts. Well, screw him if he wasn't pleased! That odious and disgusting man, and his harem. She wondered how many of them were there by choice, and how many were prisoners like her. Finally, she could hold back tears no longer. These were the tears only a mother could weep. Isallia wanted nothing more in that moment than to see her son, her baby, just one more time, hold him, and tell him that everything was alright, that she was not dead and gone. How alone he must feel. Her heart was breaking just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to her chambers opened once more. \"Tevi, I swear, if you try again, I will throw something at you,\" Isallia growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now that's a horrible way to greet someone,\" a masculine voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia jumped, when she realized it was the king. She quickly scrambled to the corner of her enormous bed that was farthest away from him, and held the quilt close to her, as if it were some sort of protective shield. \"I want nothing to do with you,\" she said, even angrier knowing who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Roland set down a silver platter on a nearby table and that sat on the opposite end of her bed. \"I understand you're not adjusting well to your new home,\" he said as sweetly as possible. \"Tell me about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king snapped his fingers. \"See, you're going to have to get used to the idea that saying no to me is a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the king's hulking knights loomed behind her. He could have easily snapped her in half if she wasn't paying attention. Isallia remained resilient and only crossed her arms. \"What do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first thing's first,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took one of the pastries off the platter and handed it to Isallia. \"You are out of your mind if you think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah,\" the king taunted. \"Elves must have terrible memories, because I could've sworn we had an arrangement about saying no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia looked at the knight behind her, who was cracking his knuckles menacingly. She tentatively took a bite. It was indeed a delicious and sweet-tasting thing, and considering she had not eaten for a couple of days, that made it all the better. But she felt like it was poison, knowing its purpose. \"Now, I'll level with you, my dear,\" King Roland said, \"you've rather captivated me when you first came here. I've never seen your kind, and you are incredibly beautiful. I don't think you realize the advantageous position you're in. You see, I'd give you just about anything to see you comfortable here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia swallowed a second bite. \"What are you saying?\" Her eyes narrowed, her mind working a mile a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king traced circles with his finger on the quilt. \"Give me your demands, and perhaps we can come to an arrangement. I had thought you would find yourself happy here on your own, but I see there are some things I just can't give you to make you feel this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment. \"I can ask for anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded graciously. \"Within reason, my dear, within reason, but let's hear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up straighter. \"First, I will not be your concubine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a disgruntled sound. \"Sorry, that part stays on the table. You're here for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia tried again. \"Fine, you have concubines to settle your certain 'needs.' I will have no part of that. You may converse with me, you may hold me, and I may even let you kiss me on occasion, but you will not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up a hand to silence her. \"I think I get your point. Physical to a certain degree. I might be able to work with that, though it will be tempting.\" He eyed her with a hungry glint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all she could do to suppress an eye roll. \"We will have all of this in writing, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king was surprised. \"I didn't think elves could read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your people invade my land. We wanted to learn about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Roland laughed heartily. \"Clever little elf, aren't you? Very well, yes, I will have my scribes draft something up. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia sighed as she tried to utter the next bit out. \"I have a family: a mate, a son. I wish to see them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched his beard, thinking deeply about the idea. No wonder she didn't want a more physical relationship with someone as rich and as handsome as he, he thought. Hm, he could use this to his advantage. \"We can arrange something,\" he said at last. \"Provided, you meet certain demands of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finished eating the pastry, and he handed her another from the plate. She saw how many more were there, and became quite worried. \"How much?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devilish half-grin spread to his face. He had her. \"Let's say, for every stone-worth you gain, I'll let you have a day to see them. Reasonable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia's face fell. She knew she might have some freedoms while she followed his demands, but for how long? Would he forget his promises after a few weeks or months? Would he live up to them at all? She sighed, \"Yes, I understand.\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Isallia didn\u2019t entirely trust the king to live up to this agreement, she did at least comfort herself knowing she could have some leverage in the situation. She would see what would happen at first, and if she discovered he had been lying, well, then he could kiss his \u201cwilling\u201d participant goodbye. Then again, he could just find a way to force her to eat if she still refused, and she hated to think of that possibility. For now, she still had to have hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king, in his eagerness, had plied his new acquisition with lots of food, but Isallia only ate what felt comfortable. Yes, she was eager to see her family again, but she also wasn\u2019t going to give the king the satisfaction of watching her stuff herself like one of his other prized \u201chogs.\u201d She still hadn\u2019t had a chance to meet any of the others, still confined to her room. She was genuinely curious to know what some of his other concubines were like. She wanted to know if they saw the monster she saw in the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had figured out that, at the moment, Isallia weighed almost exactly eight stone, and the king quickly whipped up a document with their arrangement. As part of it, she had agreed to let him feed her on occasion. He had practically strong-armed her into that piece of the agreement, but if it got her back to her family for just one day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just hadn\u2019t accounted for how zealous or sometimes forceful he would be during these times. At the moment, she was nursing her swollen, and painfully stuffed stomach from her latest encounter. It seemed, as she understood it, that he made time to see each and every one of his concubines, and that her being a new and fascinating catch for him, she got just a little more attention, or at least more frequently. He at least saw to feeding her once a week. She rubbed the tight curve of her belly, suddenly being reminded of the last time she looked like this, when her family was whole, or at least as whole as it was ever going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm sunlight hitting her face finally caused Isallia to stir. She stretched her arms a little, and tried sitting up. That was getting harder these days. Inaril was at her side in an instant. \u201cDecided to sleep in, did we?\u201d he asked playfully, stroking her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned. \u201cWell, had to when your child decided to spend most of the night kicking my organs. Course, now that I\u2019m up, they want to make sure I haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed Inaril\u2019s hands on the lower part of her rounded belly. He could feel a few punches knocking at his fingers. She was truly content in this moment. Everything was perfect. She was with a man she cared about very much, and they were going to have the family they always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \u201cOkay, okay, I get it. You and mom are both probably hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia\u2019s stomach growled in response. \u201cFood does sound good,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helped her quiet down the aggressive movements in her insides, and kissed her cheek before rising. Isallia made an attempt to get up as well, before Inaril gently coaxed her back into the bed. \u201cInaril, I\u2019ve still got a few weeks. I\u2019m pregnant, not invalid,\u201d she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you ought to at least take rest where you can. Really? Only a few weeks? Is it that soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia had loved his child-like wonder from the moment they found out they were to have their first child. He had been incredibly attentive and wanted to know just about everything that was going on as their little one continued to grow. He had proudly bragged to all their friends about how they were going to raise a large family, and she loved how joyful he had been about the news. \u201cYes, only a few weeks,\u201d she answered, rather excited just saying that herself. She rubbed her belly and whispered to it, \u201cAlthough, I think you\u2019d better get here sooner before your father drives me crazy trying to keep me on bedrest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot more than a few days after that, Inaril had gotten sick. The worst part was how alone she felt without him. She had to go through her last few weeks of her pregnancy on her own, and when the time did come, she really only had her friend Niyi to help her. Inaril wasn\u2019t even conscious when Rhala was born. He had been so hopeful, and now he didn\u2019t even know he had a son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia tried her best to roll over in her current state and go to sleep. She groaned as her stomach protested to the slightest bit of pressure. This was going to be harder than she thought. Sure, she was going to be fine for a little while, but what would happen as she continued to get bigger? Would she reach a point where she couldn\u2019t even get up? What then? Would the king let her see her family at all at that point? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to try and not think about that. Right now, she had to focus on the now. Surely, by now she\u2019d be getting close to having her first day to spend with her little boy. Surely, she had met the first of the king\u2019s demands to earn some time back among her people.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A hair above nine stone,\" the king crowed, as Isallia went through the demeaning process of being weighed once a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, if she was being honest with herself, that wasn't all that bad. Considering everything, being starved and later coming here, she had pretty much ended up no bigger than when she had first left. But, she wasn't going to show any sign of relief at that. There was no way she was going to give the king even an inch of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As promised, little elf, I will give you one day back in the Verge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was actually surprised to hear this. She had been waiting for the moment for the king to double-cross her on this little bargain. Then again, it wouldn't have been to his advantage to go back on their deal so soon. He might still hold off on that idea, when she wouldn't be in a place to protest. \"Really?\" she asked, having trouble concealing her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"But of course, I am a man of my word. I will arrange for a carriage to take us tonight. We should arrive there by the first light of morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arched her eyebrows. \"We?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Roland chuckled. \"You didn't think I'd just send you there on your own did you? No, no, then you'd have a chance to get away. I will be attending with you, along with a few of my guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The elders aren't going to be pleased with that. You'll be lucky if they even let you anywhere close to the Verge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put an arm around her shoulder, giving it a light squeeze. \"That's where you come in, my dear. You'll meet with your beloved elders and tell them that I will be coming with you one way or the other. Or, perhaps you'd rather not take the chance, and you could just stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed, weighing her options. In the end, anything was worth it to see Rhalas again. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" he said, gently poking her side. \"Now, best you go to your room to prepare. I had something extra special brought up for you to celebrate. Might as well get a jump on that ten stone, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to resist the urge to throttle him. But, she had to keep reminding herself that she was doing it all for her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia was surprised to discover that by the next morning, they were indeed in the Verge. He must've ran his horses ragged to make such good time, she thought. Still, it was good to breath in that fresh, natural air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sense of relief was short lived. Fairly soon, she and the king found themselves at the ends of spear points from her own people. No surprise there, she thought. Humans were still not to be trusted. However, one of the warriors recognized her, and though he considered it against his better judgment, led her and the king to the elven king, Orym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd King Orym was not pleased...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you thought that you would just bring a human to the Verge and everything would be fine?\" he asked incredulously after she had relayed most of her story. \"Do you realize what a danger you've brought here? Did you even think of the consequences to our people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElven politics were slightly different than that of humans. Hierarchy and status was mere formality. Conversations were held with everyone being considered equals. Votes were taken among the elders, true, but only based on what they believed the people wanted. King Roland had to admit he was impressed that Isallia held her ground. \"I did it for my family, for my child. If it was your child, wouldn't you have done the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's only daughter, and heir apparent, Princess Dhasca was sitting beside her father when Isallia said this. She placed a hand on her father's. \"We can't blame her for her reasons,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant. It's that... Oh, fine, you may go back to your family as of now, but we will be keeping a sharp eye on your guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia nodded. \"Believe me, I don't trust them either. These unfortunate circumstances have made it so that I have no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no words to express the joy Isallia felt when she was at last reunited with her son. He gurgled and gave a happy squeal when he was able to be held in familiar arms once more. \"I missed you so much, my sweet, baby boy,\" she cooed, holding him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Roland had insisted on following her to ensure she didn't run away, but in that moment, he felt a bit out of place. \"I'll just, leave you to catch up,\" he said in an embarrassed whisper. \"I expect you back at the carriage by morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hardly heard him, so focused on making the most of her time with her family. She began retelling her tale to Niyi, leaving nothing out. \"You can't be serious!\" she said. \"He...he does that to those women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Yes, though some of them may be more willing than others. But, if I want to keep seeing Rhalas and maybe Inaril one day, I have to go along with this. It's not so bad right now. I mean, I haven't changed all that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no,\" Niyi said, \"but pretty soon, you will. And then what? You're just playing into his hands right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That maybe, but right now, I just want to focus on being back here. Is there any word about Inaril?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Same as always: no change. The healers can't deal with all these new human diseases. I don't know what we're going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Roland had been listening just outside the door to this conversation. So, that's why she hadn't seen her mate yet. Though he wasn't about to give up his newest acquisition, perhaps there was a way to make her more complacent.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to memorize every bit of him before she had to leave. It had been far too long since she had seen him last. He was now starting to crawl, and she was missing his entire life being trapped in the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhalas had fallen asleep holding her finger, and she didn't dare move, wanting to enjoy his touch for as long as she could. She had no idea the sun had risen when she felt King Roland's hand on her shoulder. \"It...It's time to go,\" he said quietly, trying not to sound mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia fought back tears. How could anyone be so cruel as to take a mother away from her child?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute more,\" she pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you can see him again in a very short time. You've already overcome the first hurdle. It'll be much easier after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit back her lip, refraining from uttering the curse on her lips. Was that all he cared about? \"Very well,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia refused to speak to him the entire carriage ride back. Instead, it was he who tried to make conversation. \"So, I was thinking that I might be able to forge an alliance with your people,\" he began. \"I've been having a lot of trouble reaching the gold deposits near the Verge due to your scouts getting in their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms, and decided to watch the landscape outside instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I think there are some things that we can arrange to make sure all parties are satisfied. I think if I offer the possibility for some of my human physicians to help your people through the disease epidemic, we might be able to strike a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears perked at the mention of that. That could...that could help Inaril. \"Why are you telling me all this?\" Isallia asked, finally breaking her silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so now you'll talk to me,\" the king chuckled. \"Well, it's not like I have my advisors here to talk about this with right now. Just my own ridiculous musings. Anyway, my plan is to offer this arrangement to your king the next time you meet my...demands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said this word as if it were dirty. He really didn't like thinking of Isallia as his prisoner. He hated her thinking she was forced into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia was thinking quickly. \"So, the quicker I...put on weight, the sooner we can go back so that you can make this offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it. Though she knew this was just another way for the king to get what he wanted out of her, there were a lot of benefits to meeting those demands for now. It would mean she could get back to Rhalas that much sooner. It also meant she could help Inaril, maybe even save his life. In the meantime, she needed to still find a way to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to make one change to this plan,\" she said carefully. \"I'm growing tired of being confined to my quarters. I'd like free range of the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoland scratched his beard, thinking it over. \"I suppose there is no harm in that. I don't have any plans of entertaining any guests any time soon. And so long as we're not using this as an opportunity to get in a lot of physical activity...\" He gave a gentle prod to her middle. \"I see no reason not to grant your request. Perhaps it is time that you start familiarizing yourself with my castle, and my harem. You may want to start getting acquainted with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was perhaps the furthest thing from what she wanted to be doing. Still, there was a chance that some of them may know a few secrets about the castle. Plus, she was curious to know how many of these women were there of their own accord and how many of them were prisoners like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to the castle, the king released her back to her room to do as she pleased while he started making plans for their next trip to the Verge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia wasn't surprised in the least to find a large meal prepared for her in her room. Well, she did have to actually try this time if she intended to help her family, she reasoned. She couldn't avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really tried to push her limits this time. The sooner she could put on enough weight to please the king, the sooner she could get back. Despite the signals in her brain to tell  her she was full, she pushed on to eat a few more bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating, she was tempted to go straight to sleep. She hadn't slept much in the past few days, and all the food made her lethargic. But, she really wanted to take advantage of her new freedom about the castle. There was so much to learn and so much to do. She needed to learn as much as she could if she had any hope of escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like being freed from a prison cell when she first stepped out of her door towards the halls. She wasn't sure where to go first, or where to even go to find anything. She had never seen anything of the castle since they first led her to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to go to the right, and hoped that if she followed it as far as she could, she would find something. As she continued walking, she eventually found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, she wasn't entirely sure where she was. Human customs and homes were still so new to her that she didn't know what every room was used for in the palace. Though, truth be told, having not seen any of the castle, she wasn't sure what she was supposed to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, here she was, in a dimly-lit, but cozy room. Beautiful, exotic rugs lined the floors, and over-stuffed cushions and pillows lined nearly every corner. Women of all species and various sizes were lounging on these cushions, conversing with each other, some gossiping, others giggling among themselves. In the center of the room was an enormous glass structure filled with water, where an enormously obese merfolk woman was floating about, resting on her plushy sides. She waved playfully at Isallia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take a genius to realize who these women were. Given that they were all various sizes of round, it was pretty clear that she had found some of the other members of the king's harem. There wasn't a single one as thin as Isallia was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of these women stared at her, curious about their intruder, but most went about their conversations as though nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia was about to turn around and try to go back to looking around when a soft hand grabbed her shoulder. \"Oh, you must be that new one the king's been talking about,\" a voice said. \"I'm surprised that he let you wander over here. You're such a bony thing. Ha, have a lot of catching up to do, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman holding her was a beautiful and enticing creature. She was a woman with magenta skin, smooth features, and was a tad wide in the hips and busty. She didn't seem too afraid to show off her figure either. She gave a seductive smile and her dark eyes seemed to smile with her. Her dark, raven-black hair fell naturally, as she made herself relaxed in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I...\" Isallia didn't really know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed. \"Poor thing, shy too? Well, come on over here, I won't bite, I promise. Come on, sit with us. I'm Jamila.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamila lead her over to a pile of cushions near the glass structure in the center of the room. The bloated merfolk was waiting over nearby, heaving herself up enough to be partially out of the tank to talk. She waved again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is Morfil. Look who the king finally decided to let us meet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia sat down on the cushions nervously, not sure what to do, but the two women were extremely pleasant and conversational, putting her at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, she's cute!\" Morfil squealed. \"You can tell she's new around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, knowing how odd it was to actually be embarrassed about being thin. Almost immediately after sitting down, a servant brought them a plate of delicacies. Morfil quickly began stuffing her chubby cheeks with food, crumbs spilling down into the water. Jamila was more subdued, but she wasn't afraid to indulge either. Isallia didn't want to be rude, and took some as well. Plus, it couldn't hurt to keep working towards her goal of getting back to the Verge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing to think we now have an elf among us,\" Jamila said. \"You know Roland; won't be satisfied until he has a woman of every species practically.\" She ate a sweet doughy treat with slow and seductive bites, moaning with ecstasy at the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Isallia said, \"but I'm afraid I don't know what either of you two are. We don't see a lot of foreigners in the Verge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamila was happy to answer. \"Well, I'm called a djinn. Unfortunately, my fate has me bound to a magic bottle. I must serve whatever master possesses the bottle. The king just happened to find me. Lucky him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she was a prisoner like her. But, the djinn woman didn't seem to distressed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can complain,\" she continued. \"I get free food, I get to pretty much laze around all day, and I can kind of do as I please. Probably the best situation I can think of for my kind. Sure, the king has his tastes, but that's not all that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorfil finally stopped gulping down food, probably because there wasn't any left. While they waited for another servant to come back with more, she decided to speak. \"I'm a merfolk. We're from all the way south. I sort of came her by accident. Slavers. I was given to Roland as a gift. But, he's actually been very kind. I've never been treated so wonderfully, and the food's far too good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you've never skimped on a meal before,\" Jamila chuckled. \"What about you? Oh, I don't think we ever got your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isallia,\" she said in a hoarse whisper. \"I'm Isallia. I, suppose my story is similar to yours. Hunters caught me while I was on a scouting mission and sold me to the king. But, I guess I'm having trouble getting used to it. You see, I have a family back in the Verge. I want to get back to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relayed her story to the djinn and the merfolk who looked at her sorrowfully. \"Oh, dear,\" Jamila said, wrapping Isallia up in a hug. The elf nearly suffocated as the djinn's ample busom was pressed to her face. \"That's awful. But, Roland's at least helping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, only if I get fatter,\" Isallia said, turning bitter. \"How can you live under such an odious man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's really not as bad as you say,\" Morfil said. \"He's at least very sweet to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is very kind,\" Jamila added. \"I know it's hard for you to see because of your situation, but I'm sure if you just told him how you felt, he would understand and would help you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant had returned with more food. Morfil seemed to go through it pretty quick, whereas Jamila and Isallia had really only eaten a third of it between the both of them. No wonder the merfolk was nearly a quarter ton in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Isallia said. \"I'm trying. Really, I am. He's promised to help my husband the next time we go back. I...I really should go now. I'm feeling very tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Jamila said. \"But, feel free to come see us anytime. You know, half the fun is having each other around to talk to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Morfil added. \"The food's the other half. Jamila, would you be a dear and help me rub my stomach? I think I ate too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe djinn smiled wickedly. \"Oh, but of course. Morfil, you really need to stop overdoing it so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia quietly got up and left as quietly as she had come. While she was happy to have someone sympathize with her, these women clearly couldn't understand her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One turn led to another, and another, and still another. Honestly, Isallia wasn't sure she could find her way back at this point. It never occurred to her how big the palace was, or how many different rooms a single home could have. But, she hadn't seen any doors to any other rooms for quite some time, so she wasn't sure where this corridor was leading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe debated stopping and turning around, but once she had gone down several flights of stairs, she felt like she had to find out where this was going. It was starting to get darker and cooler the further down she went, and she was certain she was hearing dripping coming from somewhere. Eventually, she found a large, wooden door at the bottom of the last set of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia looked around to make sure no one was watching, and she tugged on the iron handle. It was heavy, but she managed to open it. Slipping inside, she left the door open a crack. She didn't want to take the risk of being locked in. It took a moment for her eyes to adjust to the darkness, but as she did, she realized what she must've found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had somehow reached the castle's dungeons. Dark dank cells were on either sides of the walls. A few loose chains hung from notches in each cell. Over in a corner, she spotted a room with various devices she assumed were for torturing prisoners for information. Isallia didn't want to think about that. Stranger still was that the palace dungeons seemed to be completely empty. True, she knew that Adinah was in a state of peace, but wouldn't there still be a few dissenters who needed to be put in their place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for Isallia, this was a golden opportunity. Her heart filled with hope at the prospect of finding an escape route here. She began to comb through the dungeon, looking for loose bricks or secret entrances. For a moment, she was afraid she wouldn't find anything. It occurred to her that they would likely not want anyone being able to escape from a dungeon. But, she had to believe there was a way out, a secret tunnel or something for emergencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, at the very end of the hall, she found a door in the floor. Upon opening it, a horrid smell hit her nostrils. It smelled like something had died down there. She assumed it must be some sort of catacomb under the castle. This gave her hope. She had heard about human cities having catacombs that wound under the very feet of its citizens. This might be her way out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before she could start to climb down, she felt a pair of strong hands clamp down on her shoulders. \"I had a feeling you might abuse your new freedom,\" she heard the king say as he came around to face her. It was one of the big hulking guards that had ahold of her. The king shut the door and stood within inches of her. \"And this is the thanks I get for trying to be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia awoke with a headache, but that was the least of her worries when she discovered that she could hardly move. She had been chained to some uncomfortable, metal bed down in the dungeons. She struggled against her bonds for several minutes before giving up in frustration, for the time being. It was only then that she noticed the king sitting just across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed rather bored with the whole situation. \"I tried to be reasonable,\" he said calmly. \"I even tried to help you because I genuinely felt bad for your family. And yet, you still go and do something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a sick monster who takes pleasure in watching women submit to you,\" she spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Now, that is an interesting way of putting it, but I don't think you understand me at all. Over the next few months, I think you will start to understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the cell opened as several servants came baring trays of steaming foods. Isallia glared at him. \"You wouldn't dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Oh, I would. You see, I tried it your way. I tried giving you the freedom to eat of your own free will, but you've just proven that that's clearly not going to work. I'm not a cruel man, really I'm not. But, I can be when people go back on their promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not going to be feeding you. Do you honestly think I'm stupid enough to put my hands anywhere near where you can bite? No, no, I'm content just to watch this time. Trust me, there are other ways I can enjoy this little punishment of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the servants roughly pushed a thick pastry past her lips. She shouted a string of curses between bites, trying to keep from choking. The king seemed to ignore her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see what you have to say after a few hours. Gentlemen, you stop when I tell you to, and may the gods so help you if you do so any sooner. Trust me when I say I'm not going to let her die, but when we're done today, she's going to feel like she could.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The days started to blur together now. Isallia had stopped bothering to count long ago. Each one was just more of the same living nightmare anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always the same every day. The king's servants would proceed to stuff her full of food, often to the very verge of bursting open her stomach. She could feel it, and it seemed the king knew exactly where her breaking point was every day. Still lying there, writhing in pain as her filled stomach pressed hard against her organs, the king would finally get involved, poking, prodding, and taking his time to feel every inch of her. She couldn't struggle, even if she wanted to, her body pinning her down. And he wasn't gentle either. He made sure it was the most painful experience she could ever feel as his fingers jabbed into her flesh or squeezed at her sides. A few times he would compliment the progress she had made, but most days he spat insults at her, trying to get her to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia considered fighting back, but she was truly and genuinely afraid of what would happen if she did. After all, the only step left they could take to punish her would leave her dead. She didn't want to take that risk. At the same time, she wasn't about to show him that. If she could keep up the visage of being stoic and unfeeling through this, maybe it would take away his enjoyment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the days passed, he didn't seem inclined to leave her alone. And every day, Isallia noticed that her view was slowly being obscured by her ever-increasing belly. Despite the fact that she was indeed getting fatter, he still fed her more and more, ensuring that every day, she was painfully stuffed. She wondered how long this could go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly nine months later that the king finally released her. She finally heard the click of her latest, and widest set of shackles yet, were opened, not being replaced by another set. The king ordered his men to help her roll up to a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've reached an understanding,\" he said with a grin. \"I don't think you'll dare to try to escape again.\" He chuckled. \"Rather, I don't think you even have the ability to escape anymore. Come, let's take a look, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at him, but also daring a glance at her own body. She honestly hadn't seen much of it, being forced to lay there for all that time. She gasped a little as she saw her now round and enormous gut spill onto her lap. Hands exploring its plush softness, she now realized this was real. It hadn't been just a horrible nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia tried to stand, but found that near impossible. Not only was she dealing with the extra weight, but having laid there for nine months, her muscles were all but completely useless. The king's grin broadened. \"I figured that might be a problem, but never fear, I always have a plan for such things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of his fingers, four strong guards came into the room with a large litter to carry her. With a heave, two of them got her up to her feet and placed her in. This was so humiliating, she thought, but she knew she couldn't give him the satisfaction of knowing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he took her to be weighed. \"Twenty-one and a half stone,\" the king said. \"That's certainly an improvement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia couldn't hid her own shock hearing that for the first time. She had more than doubled in weight during this long and enduring torture. \"How about a look?\" the king said, leading her before a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to sob right then and there. She didn't even recognize herself there anymore. All she saw was a fat, round ball of flab. Her body had merely distributed the weight evenly, leaving her in a near-spherical shape with pudgy, pillowy arms and legs. She couldn't stand to look at herself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it?\" the king said maliciously. \"Some of my best work in so short a time. And I must admit, you carry it well. This delightfully round gut alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me,\" she said, venom dripping from every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You no longer get to call the shots, my dear. You are mine now, and I will do as I please. But, I'm not a complete monster. A deal was a deal. Let's see, that's twelve stone more than the last time we weighed you, so that's twelve days you will get to spend back at the Verge. I'm sure your husband will be eager to see what's happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's...he's alive?\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I still went through on my deal with the elves, and I think I came away with a pretty good bargain. But as I understand it, you're people are doing well for themselves, thanks to me. I believe he may have lived. Exciting isn't it. We'll get you ready to go. In the meantime, I'm sure you'd like a little time to get settled back in. Gentlemen, to the living quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe litter whisked Isallia away to the concubine's quarters. But, Isallia could hardly think about that now. Inaril was alive? She was both angry and excited, and also a bit terrified. What would he say when he saw her? Would he even know who she was? Would he still love her? Her anger with the king could wait. She had to see him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hardest part was getting used to how heavy she was. Without having any opportunity to walk as her weight slowly increased, Isallia was constantly frustrated by how her body resisted her every time she tried to walk. Not that the king encouraged her to do so anyway. He didn't stop her, but that was mostly because he knew she was incapable of it. Every time she tried to stand, she was left out of breath, her wobbling knees screaming for her to sit back down. And what few steps she could manage, she required something within reach for her to use as support, or she ran the risk of falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted nothing more than to just give up, to sob and beg the gods for a merciful end. Every day she woke up, feeling her rolls of flab, realizing it wasn't a horrible nightmare. How could she possibly see her family like this? Yet, the thought of being reunited with her son again and seeing her husband alive and well for the first time over two years pushed her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at the Verge and her fat bulk was squeezed out of the carriage she only took a few shaky steps before she had to sit down on a nearby stump and catch her breath. She felt pathetic. Honestly, she had seen a few of the king's women who were bigger than her and could still get around. Of course, they hadn't been chained to a bed for months unable to use a single muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia's face turned a light shade of red as she noticed the looks the other elves were giving her. Chances were an over three-hundred pound elf before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, Isallia!\" a voice said breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a dream to see him standing in front of her. Inaril actually looked like his old self, full of life and energy. His stare was what was foreign to him. It was a mix of shock and something she couldn't identify...disgust maybe. She felt ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that look quickly faded as he realized it was really her. He ran up to her and threw his arms as far around her as he could. She felt embarrassed as his hands squeezed tightly into her fat. But before she could stop herself, tears began streaming down her cheeks. \"You're alive!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Yes, I am. But, it was horrible. They told me what had happened to you, that the king kept you prisoner. What has he done to you?\" His hands were still exploring her rounded form, as if expecting it to be some sort of trick of the mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia began to cry again. He held her, not asking any more questions, and let her get it out of her system. \"It's okay,\" he said. \"We can talk when we get back to the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Rhalas there?\" she asked between sobs, eager to see her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. To be honest, I was shocked when they first handed him to me. The healers said I would have some memory loss, and I had forgotten you had been pregnant when I first became ill. But, Isallia, he's beautiful. I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much struggle, he was able to help his wife to her feet and they slowly made their way back to their home. By that point, she was out of breath and heaving as though she might die right on the spot. \"Are you sure you're well?\" Inaril asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"I'm sorry, it's just...I haven't had a lot of time to get used to all of this,\" she said, gesturing to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a frustrated sigh when she saw their home. The door clearly wasn't wide enough for someone her size to get in. With much shoving, squeezing, and sucking breath in, they were able to get her in eventually. And that was when she saw him. Her little boy had grown up so much. He now had a full head of hair, his eyes shone brightly with curiosity, and she almost broke down again when she saw him start to stand up and walk. But, despite how overcome with motherly love she was, her son only looked at her with confusion, and her heart broke. He didn't recognize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInaril picked him up and placed him in her arms. \"See, it's your mother,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy didn't know what to do. He looked up at the round, puffed-up face of the unknown woman with curiosity, but nothing more. Still, he wasn't going to deny that the woman who held him was like a giant pillow, and he warmed up somewhat to her, snuggling. Isallia was doing her best not to show how upset she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him time,\" her husband said. \"He'll remember eventually. You were gone for so long. Now, come and sit. I'm afraid you're going to pass out. If you can, I'd like you to tell me what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their son napped in her arms, she began to relay the entire story of what had happened since the day she left the village. He listened intently, his brow furrowing as she explained each detail. When she had finished, she hung her head in shame. She knew it was a lot to ask. How could Inaril love her like this? How could she expect to have any kind of a normal life if she had to be taken away from it until she could get fatter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he didn't say anything. He got up and put Rhalas to bed and then came back to her. After a few seconds of standing there, he hugged her once more. \"I've missed you so much,\" he said. \"I just...I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's a lot. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry? Why would you be sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inaril, look at me! I'm this fat, round ball who can't even get up anymore. You don't need that kind of a burden to deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, I love you no matter what. You're everything to me, Isallia. You're the woman I fell in love with and the mother to my child. I couldn't ask for more. And bigger or smaller, you're still that woman who means everything to me. I'm just angry with the king. How could a person be so cruel? And then he has the gall to go and help our people out, marry our princess, and still treat you so terribly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marry our princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brow raised. \"You didn't hear? He arranged a deal where he married Princess Dhasca and gave our people aid in exchange for him having free range of the Verge to mine for gold. But, knowing this, knowing what a monster he is, I can't live with that Isallia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you saying?\"</span></div></div>",

The words rang through Isallia\u2019s head. Was this king so terribly cruel that he treated sentients as mere beasts? What were these concubines like if he spoke this way? They must be emaciated and downtrodden. As the elf contemplated her fate, the humans \u201ctalked business\u201d; once a deal was struck the king spoke again. Not to Isallia but at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuards, escort this newest purchase to my most treasured concubine\u2026she should be most pleased by this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the king returned to entertaining Isallia felt once again a rough set of hands around her upper-arms and she was soon frog-marched towards a side-door. From there the elf was led through a serious of winding corridors before finally was escorted into another large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not as vast as the throne room, but still far greater than the previous corridors or even than the houses she had spied from her kart window. The room was tall and constructed from alabaster-white marble, with spiral stairs at the back and a massive fountain in the center surrounded by a huge pool. Settled around this structure were many women, all scantily clad and in conversation with each other. It seemed Isallia\u2019s assumption was wrong\u2026the concubines were anything but emaciated and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair that seemed the most familiar with each other was an Orc and a Djinn. The former green-skinned woman was well-muscled like almost all of her kind, but seemed to have a little bit of softness to her form.  Meanwhile the azure-colored Djinn was a much more classical idea of a concubine. She was stunningly beautiful, with long dark-blue hair running down her back like a waterfall; her huge heaving breasts were kept in check by her glittery brassiere, and meanwhile her lower-garments were hidden in her firm but plump behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other women were better fed though, much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on the edge of the pool of water was a human woman, Isallia would describe her features as cute but modest, which contrasted heavily with her extremely revealing attire. She was also immensely fat, far fatter than even anyone at the king\u2019s table earlier. Her huge gut sat on top of, between and overwhelmed her thighs, while her hands gently rested on its massive surface. She seemed to be a little overwhelmed with the situation, keeping to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, settled in the middle of the pool was what Isallia could just about recognize as a Merfolk woman. Just about as this woman was clearly more lard than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer great body was coiled slightly as she rested on her side, one pillow-shaped arm propping up her head as she beamed a dopey smile whilst her tail tried to splash in the water, but seemed pinned down by its own weight. Her face was swaddled by her cheeks and chins so much that her eyes were forced into a squint, but she seemed perfectly happy with her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia stared in awe, there was just no way a woman of such extreme girth and obesity could even move under her own power! Was this what the king did to his women then? Fatten them up like hogs for the for his own sick pleasure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, as Isallia was led across the hall she saw another monumental woman. To her horror the elf realized she was staring at a gorgon! But the massive reptile was also in no position to actually get up and harm anyone. The obese glutton was nearly as fat as the immobile merfolk, her obesity pinning her in place as she barked at various maids to fetch her more food. Was this \u201cVuko\u201d that the king had spoken of? Gods, Isallia wished to the heavens that she did not have to serve such a creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed fate had something else in store for her that day. The guards led Isallia past the monstrous serpentine women and up the marble staircase. They pushed open the door and made a nod to indicate she go inside. Her bindings were cut and she felt the base of a spear push against her back as Isallia entered a third room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not as grand or as well-lit as any other the others, but it was still just as occupied. Most of the women inside were not more concubines however, most seemed to be nurses running back and forth helping the other two women, and these two were clearly part of the king\u2019s harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a Satyr, this already made Isallia a bit more nervous. While aggressions had ended between the elves and the satyrs in the Verge, it was a very tense peace. She did not trust a satyr as far as she could throw one, and in this one's case, that was not at all. The satyr was laid on her side with her gigantic backside jutting up like a mountain. Her predicament though was quite different to the women outside, for this goat-legged woman was not settled down due to her swaddling adipose, but because her stomach was stretched and swollen with child. Her pale belly jutted outwards massively; with a little bit of fur on the underside, she must have been near-to-term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman though was a more imposing figure. She was laid back in a regal position, her long orange hair flowing over her back and touching the floor, her hands here held out as nurses filed her long claw-like nails as she gave them a haughty look. Like the Satyr, this woman was also heavily pregnant, her massive belly sat neatly on her extremely thick thighs, with her huge breasts in-turn resting on that gravid sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly not human though; sticking out of the top of her orange hair were a pair of triangular orange-furred ears, her eyes were a vibrant yellow and trailing out between her legs were no less than nine orange-colored tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia had never encountered a race like this before, and was initially curious. This was banished in place of fear when the woman spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou there!\u201d The woman barked, baring a set of sharp canine fangs. \u201cCome here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia did as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you the new slave the king has bought?\u201d The stern woman asked. Isallia simply nodded, even if she wasn\u2019t this did not seem like the kind of person she would like to see angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, the king has promised me that I would have someone of my own who shall do as I say\u2026I am Vuko, but you may address me as mistress.\u201d At this point the maids seeing to the woman stopped their pampering and began to help the satyr instead. Clearly they were not under direct control of Vuko, just instructed to help all the concubines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak up! Or are you dumb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, mistress.\u201d Isallia quickly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. And you are obedient to a fault, I like that.\u201d Vuko then picked up a small fruit from a nearby bowl, dropped it into her mouth, swallowed it and then continued. \u201cI am the most powerful person in this castle after the king\u2026and since I have control over his majesties\u2026appetites shall we say that makes me the most powerful person in all of Yndyre. I simply have to ask and the King does whatever I please, that is why you are here before me. So take one step out of line, disobey me for one single second and you will wind up under the headsman\u2019s axe\u2026or worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf gulped and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, as to what I want to <i>DO</i> with you\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

I will be in need of another nurse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confinement room?\" So many things outside of the verge were so strange and new to Isallia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitsune rolled her eyes. \"Leave it to Roland to send me the most daft of creatures to serve me. Confinement is the period just before a woman has a child. She is shut off from the rest of the world, kept in a dark room, and attended by only her closest nurses, maids, and midwives. Here, is where the king keeps us during confinement. Now, as I said before, you will be serving me, and only me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do what exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, must I teach you everything? You do what I tell you, when I tell you. And when the time does come, you will serve my children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia took another glance at the voluptuous kitsune. It was hard to tell if she was having twins or if she was just large. \"Children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my future child, and my daughter, Kimiko. She is probably around causing a ruckus in the palace, no doubt, such a willful child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt now occurred to Isallia that the king probably had had several children through these concubines. In fact, it wouldn't surprise her at all to find several of them wandering about the castle, and she wouldn't have known in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia nodded. \"Yes, mistress. How may I serve you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least this way, she might get some freedoms about the castle: a perfect opportunity to find a way to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are elves always this stupid? Go to the kitchens and bring me my midday meal, of course. And tell those wenches in the kitchens that they had better not have burnt the lamb again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia let out a small squeak and left the room quickly, not even the slightest bit sure where the kitchens might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so hard on her,\" Mitera, the satyr woman on the next bed over said, doing her best to roll over, given her girth, to face Vuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitsune waved her off. \"You can't go easy on the help. Makes them soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitera only sighed, rubbing her bump as several strong kicks disturbed her. Satyr children were incredibly active, and often restless. It made it even less enjoyable considering that they had hooves and sometimes the start of their horns. \"Poor thing,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the bleeding heart starts again,\" Vuko grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't act like you didn't see it. You made her your nurse for your child after all. You can see it too. She's more than capable for the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitsune rolled her eyes as some of the attendants went back to rubbing her feet. She purred. \"Well, why not use her where she's most useful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satyr continued to muse. \"You know what that means though, don't you? Breasts all swollen like that? She's had a child before, fairly recently actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Lots of our nurses have had children before. How else did they get the job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitera shook her head. \"You don't understand at all. Elves don't just bring their families to the city. That poor woman was taken from her home, her child, and ended up here. She's not just a servant; she's a prisoner! Roland...Roland wouldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVuko fell back onto her pillows, crossing her arms over her belly, which made her look very squished when she pouted. \"Look, it's not our job to question him and his decisions. He knows what he wants, and he takes it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose... Still, I feel bad for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a shrill laugh. \"What do you care? Last I knew, you're people hated elves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitera sighed and tried to roll back over. \"I don't know why I bother talking to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Isallia was still in search of the kitchens. The castle was incredibly big, and there were rooms everywhere. There were also many twists and turns in the halls, and several times, the elf became unable to backtrack her way to where she was before. If she had any hope of ever escaping, this wasn't helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a frustrated sigh as she turned down the wrong hall for the fourth time. \"Lost?\" a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia turned around to see one of the other serving girls. In some ways she was surprised to see just how round and plump this girl was, but then again, it made sense. The king saw to it that everyone stayed pretty well-fed in this place. Odd, and slightly disconcerting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes. I'm looking for the kitchens. Lady Vuko...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shook her head and rolled her eyes. \"Of course it's Lady Vuko. She always wants something. Demanding thing, isn't she, even more so now that she's expecting. Acts like she's carrying the future prince or princess or something. Hmpf, she knows Roland isn't going to let Kimiko rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump girl said this all rather fast, and Isallia had a hard time following everything. \"The kitchens?\" she reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'll take you there. Come with me. My, my, you're an elf aren't you? Oh, how fascinating. Do you really hear from a mile away? Do your people really live in huts made of animal skins? My, but you are a bony little thing. Aren't you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response, Isallia's stomach began to growl. The hunters had practically starved her while she was in their captivity, only giving her enough to get by. For several days now, she had learned to ignore the hunger pangs. \"It's fine, really,\" Isallia lied. \"I...really must get to the kitchens to get Lady Vuko her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry about that. We'll get you set up for her in a moment. Enormous thing could stand to wait for a meal. Come now, let's get you something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsallia wanted to resist. She didn't want to know what Vuko's wrath might be like. Yet, she was quite hungry.</span></div></div>",

Many envision what life at the royal palace might be like, and how blessed the King and his court are to live at the highest stack of the social pyramid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the minds of everyone, none are more blessed than the King's harem. It is made up of women from every known diverse group found in all of Yndyre, inspiring rumors that King Roland aspires to be a collector of his kingdom's numerous cultures. Of course, there is plenty of whisper amongst commoners as to the real reason the young ruler eagerly courts so many women to be his concubines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides rumors of the king having a notoriously strong libido and taste for particularly shaped women, there's the undeniable truth in how the selected harem females live. They come in to the palace, usually thin as rails or pleasantly plump, and next thing everyone sees or hears via word of mouth, the women in question have gotten too big to stay on their feet for long. But of course, most don't think too much about it; royalty folk are expected to have well-fed figures, the ultimate proof of good-living and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it's clear that when it comes to the court ladies, it's more than just simply living the good life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone exemplify that better than Morfil, the resident mermaid of the King's concubines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Sooooooooooooooo. Booooooooooooored-dah,\" moaned a massive, wobbling mountain of flesh floating in the middle of the room. The jello-like being floated spread-eagle on the water surface, resembling a buoy shaped like an over-inflated and very round life raft. Every bit of her quivered ever so slightly as the water carried her lazily around, but none wobbled as strongly as the surface of the towering belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorfil's eyes were glazed and unfocused, seeing nothing past the giant swell of her middle or even her bloated breasts. Not that she cared, because at the moment all she really focused on was the imaginary abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bored. Booorrrred. Boring. Borrrrrrrrrrring. Borrriiiiinnnng-gah,\" she droned, her chins flexing and folding with the effort of moving her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far side of the room, the shallow spot of the massive pool tank that made up the entirety of said room, stood two plump handmaidens, ever faithful to their ladies desires. Actually, only one of them stood. The other was apparently sharing in her lady's boredom, bare feet dunked in the water while she balanced a game board on her lap, playing idly with the pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you would like, my lady?\" the dutiful of the handmaidens asked, shooting a disapproving glance at her more laid back counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmmm...\" Morfil thought long and hard, tilting her head as best as she could in her floating position, and as much as her swaddling fat allowed. \"Nah, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to eat, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could eat, buuuuut...\" the massive mermaid brought one fattened hand to stroke idly at her closest belly roll. She was not one to turn down food. In fact, she practically lived by food. It was one of the reasons she had ended up captured and sold to the king in the first place. Yet as much as she could stuff her gullet endlessly, she wasn't feeling the want for it at the moment. \"Meh. Even food sounds boring right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely there is something we can--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, give it up, Mila,\" the more laid back of the handmaidens spoke up, her eyes not lifting from her game board. \"If Lady Morfil wants something, she will let us know. Don't stress about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>one </i>of us has to stay on duty, eh, Lina?\" the brunette responded sternly towards her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Gods,\" Lina rolled her eyes. \"Live a little, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you, you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we would never do our work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls, peace,\" said Morfil, fighting back a yawn for the sake of speaking in a matronly tone. \"Don't fight, please. You both do plenty for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lady/Sorry, my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorfil hummed back in response, resuming staring at the ceiling. <i>What to do, what to do...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when it seemed she was about to drown out the world in another bout of boredom, the merfolk's eyes grew wide as an idea suddenly came to light. If she were able to in her present position, she would be slapping herself in the forehead for not thinking about this sooner. How could she have forgotten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I know--glrrrggh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her excitement, Morfil had attempted to lunge forward, and was immediately reminded by the mighty, unconquerable mountain that was her belly. She only got half a second of a craned-forward position before her lesser stamina and aforementioned gut pushed her back with enough force to dunk her head backwards into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila and Lina stared, the former keeping a perfectly schooled expression while the latter quirked an eyebrow in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, my Lady?\" Lina asked in a lethargic, uncaring tone, earning a kick-splash of water from her sister that drenched her upper body. \"Oh no, my game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then pick up the pieces,\" Mila snarled, keeping her eyes on the blobby shape of her mistress as she pivoted herself circularly on the pool's surface so she could look at them properly. \"What do you wish, my Lady?\" she asked once the mermaid's eyes were locked on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorfil's bloated face lit up with child-like excitement, her massive form quivering uncontrollably as she giggled. \"Wasn't there supposed to be someone coming in today? I seem to recall just now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin handmaidens blinked together, and then smiled slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, indeed! I remember writing it down. A moment, please...\" Mila spoke, walking off and stepping out of pool, her feet making wet smacks upon the marble floor as she neared a table with a ledger scroll upon it. \"Let's see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Morfil asked with a wide, innocent smile, rubbing what little she could reach of her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila held up the ledger and cleared her throat. \"It is...\"</span></div></div>",

We ask that you enjoy your reading and writing experience within this writing interactive, but there are a few rules that we would appreciate you follow before you set off on your journey. First and foremost, if it isn't obvious enough, this is a fic with the focus on weight gain. If that is not your cup of tea, that is you choice, though we do feel you're missing out on all the fun. But, more importantly, if you don't like, then definitely don't read. If this is something you'd be interested in, then it's great to have you aboard, but unfortunately for you, that means more rules. Don't worry, they're simple to follow:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1.</b> While men and women do exist in this fantastic land, the weight gain will be kept to the women only. Sorry if that does not seem fair.<br>\r\n<b>2.</b> Yes, magic, to an extent, does exist in this world, it is very limited. In other words, there is no \"magical\" gains in this world. Everything's just going to have to happen the old-fashioned way (over eating and laziness).<br>\r\n<b>3.</b> Minimum age for our gaining characters is 15. No exceptions.<br>\r\n<b>4.</b> Please check your submissions for basic grammar and spelling before posting, at least to the best of your abilities. We will maintain some quality-control to fix typos, but you are on writing.com after all. You should use your best writing skills.<br>\r\n<b>5.</b> This is as much your story as it is ours. Make as many or as few submissions as you would like. Oh, and please feel free to add new characters, regions, and even species to fit your desires, but we would appreciate some notification to either Trampltrum or myself, at least for now. After all, we believe you should write the story you want to read. If you do create a new species or region, please notify Trampltrum or myself in an email with a basic write-up of your species' culture or your region's history/layout so that we may add it to the field guide for others to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b><div align=\"center\">Yndyre Field Guide &amp; Mythology</div></b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince we've brought it up, we highly recommend consulting our field guide before entering this realm. It will provide a lot of useful information about everything you can find in Yndyre. It'll also help you avoid contingency errors with already established canon. Or, if you want something just for fun, there is also a collection of myths and legends about Yndyre.
