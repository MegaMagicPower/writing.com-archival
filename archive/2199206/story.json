            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>His life sucked. There was no question about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon had such high hopes when he graduated Highschool and had went out into the real world. Six months later he was living in the basement of  a school in a town  halfway across the country barely making ends meet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They say you have to start from the bottom and work your way up. Well it couldn't get any closer to the bottom than he was in the basement of  that school. He couldn't afford a real apartment and his employer had allowed him to set up a couch for himself  in the basement of the school out of \"the goodness of his heart.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Above him Students were leaving. Tomorrow would be the last day of school. It was the beginning of the Summer Vacation. A month  earlier he'd wondered would he still be allowed to stay in the school during that break. The answer, as it turned out a month later, was a definite NO. Jon had done his job to the best of his abilities and just like that,  for his hard work he was homeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the opportunity to achieve his greatest fantasy arrose he decided to take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken almost all of his savings to acquire the vial of chemical that would shrink him down. It came in a EpiPen type applicator for quick injection. Holding it in his hand, he almost didn't think it was real. Maybe it wasn't. After all, there was the possibility that he'd been scammed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit too good to be true. But there was the assurance of the 100% satisfaction.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt least didn't have anything in the way of worldly possessions to take with him. The only thing he really had was an computer that he'd found down in that basement and he would leave it there for the next sucker to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe School was your typical high school that you might see anywhere. About a hundred and fifty students, and X number of teachers. Jon unlocked a side door and locked it behind him. There was something eerie about walking through the empty building. Like tomb in many ways. Hell, the building was so old Jon wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if there was more than one Ghost floating about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed a row of lockers he noticed a pair of worn gym shoes setting on top of a locker as though a student had put them there as he was getting ready to leave and had forgotten them up there instead of locking them away. What caught Jon\u2019s eye was the size of the shoes. They were enormous by human standards. Clearly the owner wasn\u2019t human. He picked one up off the top of the locker. Felt its weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, old Noah could\u2019ve used one of these.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at least a size 20 and must\u2019ve been 8 inches wide. Jon looked at the insole taking note of the wear pattern and indentations. A Bear wore this from the looks of it. The indentations were a dark black compared to the grey color of the insole. How many hours of wear did it take to make such an imprint? In his mind Jon envisioned himself exploring the indentations like an astronaut on the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of the injector in his pocket.  Maybe he could. Then again, there were other potential locations he could try. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then went back to the lockers.  Because the chemical would only shrink his body and not his clothes, he stripped off and tossed his clothes in a waste basket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the plastic tip, closed his eyes, and drove the injector home. The needle penetrates, he felt the chemical enter his body. Removing the injector, he quickly threw it in the garbage as well. He counted backwards from ten as he walked over to the about to be much larger footwear. He stood over it and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. He waited to a count of twenty  Still nothing. He'd blown it. All his hard earned cash he'd spent on---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his body began to tingle all over. Something was happening. His breath caught as there was a sudden wave of vertigo and the ground rushed up to meet him.  Everything went dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuuuuuu---\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What the hell happened to my voice?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was his first clue that something was different. He sounded like he\u2019d been sucking helium. He opened his eyes and found he had trouble focusing. He looked at himself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n What happened to his skin? Instead of a healthy tan he was pasty white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed his pubs that fallen out. He touched the top of his head. He was Bald! He stood up. As his eyes began to focus he was able to see where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart leaped in his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked! Around him were the towering walls of the size twenty runner. Beyond  the ceiling was hundreds, Maybe thousands of feet above his head. The lockers towered over him like skyscrapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHoly shit!\u201d He Squeaked. After all these years his prayers had been answered! Of course he could be hallucinating all of this, but it looked too real! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow small was he? He couldn\u2019t say for sure but at that point he didn't care. He took a deep breath and noted the smell. It was stronger than it had been when he was taller. it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning from Ear to Ear, Jon looked about. The walls were stained and worn, as was the \"ceiling\". The insole was littered with debris and flakes of dead skin. There was also hairs. Proof that the wearer always wore it without socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the highlight of the whole thing were the craters in the insole. They varied in size and were darker than the surrounding material of the insole. They of course had been made by toe pads. Jon thought of the owner of the runner. A Jock perhaps. Bears were big to begin with, imagine how big he'd appear now? How big his meaty paws would be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon lay down on his stomach in the spot where the center pad would rest, and proceeded to do what he normally would never consider doing. But who was going to know? After he expelled several times and had spent himself, he rolled over on his back. With a goofy smile on his face , and after having the greatest orgasms of his life,  he felt quite content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He couldn't wait for the morning. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curiously he stood and craned his neck so he could see the clock on the wall. It was 11 when he shrank himself. Now the clock read 8:30. There was a loud bang as the front doors of the school opened followed by the chatter of students. The floor shook so much that he could barely stand. This was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's heart leaped in his chest. The owner of this runner would be wanting to put it on whether he occupied it or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good. I want to touched by such gigantic flesh....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon shook his head. Why wasn't he thinking straight? If got that close he'd be good as dead. It was as though desires he'd locked away were now almost beyond his ability to keep in check. He saw Students walk by the runners. A mixture of Arthros and humans. Some chatted and laughed while others busied themselves getting ready for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he saw a student he knew walk by. He tried to cry out, his words were too small to be heard. A shadow fell over him. Instinctively he knew, and looked up to see...</span></div></div>",

Like a lot of furs Jim, \u201cBig\u201d Jim to his friends, preferred to walk barefoot. For a Bear the feeling of cool soil under his paws felt natural. But school policy stated it was that all students who were not of the human variety had to wear footwear, whether they liked it or not. Jim was one of the few students who had learned to get use to wearing them. Well, school would be out in another month and he could throw these in the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped one runner on, and then began to slip his foot in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jon, it was a sight that was both awe inspiring and terrifying. Towering above him was a Grizzly Bear. How old he was Jon couldn\u2019t say for certain. He wasn\u2019t exactly athletically built but he wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call chubby. He was looking down but not seeing him. Jon knew why, oh boy did he ever know. He saw the bear lift a thick furry leg and he saw for a brief moment the padded underside of a furry foot before it filled his vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon started to run. At least he tried to. Two furry toes landed on either side of him and he found himself shoved among thick brown rope like fur. He was caught up among the strands and entangled as the toes wiggled and the foot made its way further into the runner. The Grizzly of course did not put any care into his unknown passenger, and Jon was lucky not to have had a limb broken. Or worst, ripped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the foot settled into the runner. His entanglement in the fur kept him in place; trapped in the space between the toe pads and the center pad. This was not like the stories he enjoyed reading online. He thought things couldn\u2019t possibly get worst. Then the Grizzly began to walk. His world suddenly shot upward, then forward, then straight down with a bone jarring THUD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver and over again; as the Grizzly walked to his classroom. </span></div></div>",

One of them was a small Raccoon. He smiled and waved at her. She smiled and returned the gesture. Jim had trouble in math last year and Lisa had helped him after school. Were it not for her, he wouldn\u2019t be in the graduating class this year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Jim\u2019s right runner, Jon was grateful that the movement had finally stopped. He was breathing heavy. The air was thick with an odor that wasn\u2019t exactly pleasant but at least he was alive. Up to this moment he\u2019d never though how dangerous it could be to be so small. All he thought of was the fantasy aspect of it all. He was still thinking it, even then. Strange that he thought that way now, even though a well delivered toe scrunch could pulverize him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever had was he as close to living out a lifelong fantasy like he was at that moment. Maybe he could have some fun, but Jon\u2019s current situation was less than ideal. Light from air holes above seeped through the fur above and gave Jon just enough light to see. He was good and tangled all right. Given enough time he could figure his way out---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toes around him twitched. He immediately ended his efforts to free himself. He waited a few moments. They did not move again. Obviously despite being so small, this Grizzly\u2019s sensitive enough to feel the slightest movement Jon could make. So much for getting free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon sighed. An average school day was six hours. Six hours tangled up in the underside of a Paw he couldn\u2019t even touch. Well, he might as make the best of it. Through the cloth canopy above he could hear the teacher\u2019s muffled lectured. Good heavens was it a bore. The subject matter wasn\u2019t even remotely interesting. Despite the heat and the odor Jon fell asleep. Well that was one way to kill time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was jarred awake when the Grizzly began to walk. </span></div></div>",

Charlene thought as she stared down at the runners. Like a lot of furs, well in her case reptile, she preferred to walk barefoot and feel the cool soil under her feet. However school policy stated that it was mandatory that all students had to wear footwear whether they liked it or not. Charlene definitely did not like it. At least the runners were broken in enough to make them comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped one runner on, and then began to slip her foot in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jon, it was a sight that was both awe inspiring and terrifying. Towering above him was a female dinosaur of the order ceratopsidae* She was looking down but not seeing him. He saw her lift a thick leg and heard the sound of scaly flesh rub against cloth as she slipped her foot into her left runner. Then the underside of a three toed foot filled his vision as she began to repeat the process with the runner he was in. Jon started to run. It was futile of course. He was far too small now and too slow compared to the wall of flesh bearing down on him. The foot caught him and pushed forward. It almost rolled over him. But when it finally stopped, he was laying face first in the worn insole and the foot was above. His life had been spared only by luck as he was in the empty space between toe and the ball of the foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his world went up, sideways, and down. The down was the worst as it ended with a bone jarring THUD. Over an over again as she walked to her classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlene walked into her history class and sat in the only desk designed to accumulate her wider body and thick tail. She was a bit self conscious about her size, but considering her species and the fact that there were several other species bigger than she was, she was rarely picked on for it. When she was, she was always quick to defend herself with a witty comeback. Today, the teacher was giving a boring lecture. He had even said it before class started as a warning, \"This is going to be a bit boring, but I have to give it.\" She tried to pay attention, but after awhile her attention turned to an unexpected development in her right runner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlene began to notice a tingling sensation from under her toes, had a bug crawled into her runner? She was impressed it survived the walk to History class. She normally would've stomped her foot, but at that moment the \"Bug\" in her runner was more interesting than the lecture being said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*(which included the triceratops and pachyrhinosaurus and bagaceratops).</span></div></div>",

She just wanted to play with someone though but I guess this bug in her shoe is going to get punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her three toe foot, she begin to raise it up and back down with a slammed. She is repeatedly tapping her foot rapidly. Without her knowing at all in her shoe, there was someone indeed is in her shoe, a living human being which is Jon. As Jon was trapped between her toes, Jon that he was safe until the toes around him lift it up in the air in the shoe before bringing it down with a huge thud. Jon almost got pinned by the toe but lucky it missed by few inches. Not only her foot is moving up but it is sliding as well as the foot brings up and down like it was tapping. Almost like an impatient person waiting in line or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon knew he was in trouble as the tapping becomes more like sonic booms and that he got squished in between her toes, pinned by her toe or even pushed it around. It was like the feet is acting like a game to him. Jon is being bruised by it but at the same time he was having fun with it and getting his exercises as he tries to dodge those huge meaty toes of this dinosaurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the shoe, Charlene was actually enjoying herself as she felt the tiny bug in her shoe as she continuously tapping her foot and that she actually got the bug a few times with her tapping her toe on it. It felt so good that she wanted to pinned the tiny bug for awhile as the lecture in her class is still going. This is her entertainment and that feeling the struggling against it made her felt powerful. Maybe this could be her fun time for all the classes by just playing with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jon, he got stuck under her toe after she finished tapping her toe and that he struggle to get up but her weight is just too heavy.

As much as this Dino's toe flesh was feeling pretty damn good against his naked body he had to admit that this wasn't the most ideal place to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he'd been bounced around among her chubby toes he'd  remembered where he saw her before. He'd been mopping up a floor mess and she had walked by talking to her friends. Now he didn't  take out a tape measure and checked but she was probably around Five foot something. Petite by Dinosaur standards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, to Jon's perspective, She was big enough to give any  Kaiju a run for their money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant being directly under a toe was not a good idea, especially if the class bell were to ring and she stood up. Oh sure there would be some give at first but then her full weight would bear down one him and he'd be instant paste. Provided he didn't suffocate from the rising heat first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Jon decided that it was best just to get away from her  feet. there would be time for fun later. Right now he had to get out from underneath this toe and out of this sneaker. He was almost immobile, but there was enough space for him to slowly inched his way out from underneath. Occasionally the dinosaur would help by slightly raising her toe. The film of sweat that was building up aided him as well. Who knew Dinosaurs could sweat through their soles? Jon certainly didn't. But then it wasn't exactly something he'd ask about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him ten minutes or carefull wiggling to maneuver out from under the toe. Looking up the thick scaly incline of the foot to the ankle  Jon could see light shining in from the outside world. The only way to go was up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing wasn't as hard as you might expect. The scales made things easy to grip and the incline wasn't  that steep. The Hardest part was not causing an itch. The last thing he wanted was to be crushed by a claw tipped finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the tongue of the sneaker Jon was momentarily blinded by the brightness of the class. When he could see again, he followed the thick leg up the length of the Dinosaur. She wore no pants. That didn't mean however that her genitals were exposed as she wore a garment  that was akin to a bikini bottom. Beyond that was a jacket of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon thought for a moment. There should be enough time to climb her leg all the way to her jacket. Hop into a pocket and go home with her. Then he looked about the class room. Say, there were other potentials to have fun with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a Rabbit. With exceptionally big and wide feet/paws. A Large Grizzly Bear sat next to the Dinosaur, he wasn't really into males, but maybe his mother. Or he could have a sister.  Looking past the Grizzly was a rather petite Racoon that Jon knew very well. 'Lisa!' Jon thought.  He wouldn't mind being with a friendly giantess. There was also the female cougar with sandals. Her thick paws looked inviting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind Jon could almost hear them say \"Come play with us. Come play with us , Jon. For Ever and Ever and Ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have a lot of time to think it over so Jon decided to</span></div></div>",

Not only that, but he didn't wanted to get crushed since he didn't know how long the lecture is going to be. So it is best to start climbing her before the end of the class. Jon is sure that he will get to other people soon since she is going to be in the same class again the next day. Jon put his arms on her legs and start climbing like an insect he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jon was climbing her leg, Charlene was kind of paying attention to the lecture a little bit more since it got interesting. The teacher was explaining on how and why the world it is now and how anthro and humans become part with each other. Charlene haven't known about the past on how this all started  between humans and anthros and that she kind of forgot she was playing with a bug few minutes ago. Somehow the bug has escaped her prison as the teacher in lecture got boring again. She tried to find the bug in her runner shoe by just moving up and down with her foot. She even tried to lift her leg up and stomp back down with a thud. Still she couldn't find the bug in her shoe while still looking ahead at the direction of the teacher. Maybe after class she is going to check if she has squished it somewhere in her sneaker or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jon, he was still climbing the leg of Charlene and that he was basically at her knee before things got chaotic though. What he means by that is that she was moving her feet around in her shoe which makes her leg to vibrated around him. One of his hand slip from her scale legs and that he almost slip down from her but he manage to put his hand back since it was a little vibration. He looked up to see if she knew there was a bug climbing her leg or something to shake it off. Her attention was actually looking ahead straight which she is unaware of him for now he thought. Jon was about to climb up her leg again, but she move her leg up without looking down meaning that Jon hands is slipping from her scaley body and that without warning, she brought it down with a huge thud making floor shake and the leg shake as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Jons hands has slip from his climb and that he was falling from her. His whole progressive seems to be lost but he hopes that he can find grab her leg before he impacts her shoe or the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Jon thought he is going crack his head to floor but a little shift from Charlene's sneaker replace the floor and that Jon is actually falling back into her shoe. Jon yelled as he hit the green foot of the dinosaur, bouncing down the hill before he was sent twirling back to the front of her shoe.

I can't take this anymore.\" She said in her mind and that she starts to get frustrating as she is moving her sneaker around on the floor and moving her feet too within the sneaker. She just wish the bug is under her toe again and that she can play with it when she goes to her next session. Unaware to Charlene, that the bug is back in her sneaker and that he is in between her toes avoiding getting pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again, I don't want to be here.

Not only that, but the smell in her sneaker is started to heat up and musk is building up. Jon is sweating in her sneaker and that her toes is working up a sweat too.. Jon wanted to go but then again maybe fate wants him to play with her toes a little longer to entertained his Goddess maybe.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Charlene tried to listen to the dull and boring lecture, Jon contemplated his current situation. For the moment, in the space under pudgy toes, he was safe. But even as exciting and arousing the  situation was to him, Jon had to admit  this wasn't the most ideal place to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, to Jon's perspective, This Dinosaur girl  was big enough to take on a Kaiju. That meant being directly under her toes was not a good idea, especially if the class bell were to ring and she started walking again. Oh sure he'd been lucky thus far but suppose when her foot swung forward he somehow slid under the ball of her foot, and then her foot touched the floor. With her full weight bearing down on him he'd be instant paste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Jon decided that it was best just to get away from her feet and out of the sneaker. There would be time for fun later. Right now he had to get out from underneath these toes and out of this sneaker. There was enough space for him to slowly inched his way out from underneath. Occasionally the dinosaur would help by slightly raising her toes. Whether  it was conscious or unconscious decision Jon really couldn't tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA film of sweat that was building up aided him as well. Who knew Dinosaurs could sweat through their soles? Jon certainly didn't. But then it wasn't exactly something he'd ask about. He didn't exactly have the nerve to go up to a dinosaur and ask \"Excuse me, but do you sweat through your feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him ten minutes or careful wiggling to maneuver out from under the toes. Looking up the thick scaly incline of the foot to the ankle Jon could see light shining in from the outside world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like the only way to go was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing wasn't as hard as you might expect. The scales made things easy to grip and the incline wasn't that steep. The Hardest part was not causing an itch. The last thing he wanted was to be crushed by a claw tipped finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the tongue of the sneaker Jon was momentarily blinded by the brightness of the class. When he could see again, he followed the thick leg up the length of the Dinosaur. She wore no pants. That didn't mean however that her genitals were exposed as she wore a garment that was akin to a bikini bottom. Beyond that was a jacket of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon thought for a moment. There should be enough time to climb her leg all the way to her jacket. Hop into a pocket and go home with her. Or maybe he could make his way further up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Jon Charlene at this point was following every movement he made. From the outward appearance a Dinosaur had thick scaly skin, an evolutionary throwback from millions of years in the past, but that didn't mean it didn't make it any less sensitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Felt the \"Bug\"struggling to get out from under her foot and so she aided  it in it's efforts. She had felt it climb up onto her Ankle, so she glanced down to see what kind of a bug it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the....' Charlene thought. It was bug size, but this creature wasn't a bug. It was pale, and it had a human shape.  More importantly it was starting to climb up her leg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlene glanced back up to listen to the teacher, but her attention was focused on the creature. </span></div></div>",

As she carried them in one hand and chatted with her friends. The one who spoke, An athletic looking Tiger who happened to be the Principle's daughter, pointed at  the runners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom insists I try to get one more school year out of them.\" She explained, then changed her voice mimicking her mother \"Young Lady those sneakers were not cheep!\" which caused a fit of silly laughter from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one more who was glad she wasn't wearing the runners anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon lay there in an indentation of a toe print gulping in the fresh air coming from the outside world. He had though being in a runner being worn by this Dino girl would be fun, what he got was a lesson in expectation vs reality. The reality is when you try to pleasure your self on a Dino girl's foot she's most likely going to feel you. First there had been a twitch, then there was a Stamp of her foot. It had been discreet from her perspective but it rattled every bone in his tiny body. Then her toes squeezed around him. Being pressed into supple flesh felt amazing but it was also crushing. He had to play dead before the grip was released and had to play dead for the remainder of the school day. All the while trying to avoid ending up into the ball of the Dino Girl's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings hadn't been working out as he had planned, not that he had much of a thought out plan to begin with. Well, he'd just have to put more thought into his plans. That's all. At least from listening to  the conversation from above he learned the Dino Girl's name. Charlene. At least now, if he ever needed to, he could  call out her name rather than yell \"Hey You!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I caught the Janitor examining your runners last Friday.\" said the other friend, a shorter bunny with large round glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" said Charlene and the Tigeress together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was! I saw he though the window of the school as I was walking by.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon could feel his face get red with embarrassment. He was so careful not to get spotted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he's got a...You know, a <i>Foot Fetish</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlene thought for a moment, then shrugged \"That, or these were the biggest pair of footwear he'd ever seen in his life.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case\" said the Tigeress \"He'd have his mind blown if he saw what your Mom sometimes wears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later the conversation ended when Charlene and her friend walked off in separate directions to their homes. Charlene, having  said her \"See you laters\" to her friends, looked down at the worn footwear in her hand. She was so tempted to throw the runners into the nearest dumpster, but her Mother had been right, they were expensive to make. So in stead she would exile them to the darkest recesses of her closet. Maybe she would out grow them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the House she noticed the note taped to the refrigerator. Mom was out shopping. Walking into her bedroom, Charlene opened her closet to toss the runners inside. </span></div></div>",

As much as he would've wanted to he really had no idea whether or not the student would come in tomorrow. And he'd be trapped inside the shoe if  the injection was to make him as small as it was supposed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead he grabbed the other shoe off the top of the locker he placed both shoes on the floor in front of the locker door. School policy can be stupid when it came to certain things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo take his mind off the footwear, Jon performed his obligated duties as Janitor. Hours later he dropped off his keys to the principal's office, made sure the front doors to the school were locked, and  left his old life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night time. The perfect  time for what he had planned.Twenty minutes from the school was a neighbourhood and Jon focused on one particular house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa went to the same school Jon did janitor work, and she would often meet him at the school as he was getting ready to begin his cleaning duties and she was leaving to go home. At first they\u2019d just wave and be friendly toward each other. Later they became friends. To Jon, she was like the younger sister he never had. Lisa was 17, almost 18 and would be graduating in the spring if everything went okay. She wasn\u2019t very tall, just less than five feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was a Raccoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon remembered the previous month when She had visited him down in the basement after he'd gotten the news he was out on his ass after the semester. Her visit had cheered him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Lisa, came by for your locket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad you found it, I thought it was lost forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a seat, I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon opened his lunch box and took out with an object wrapped in tissue. Lisa sat on the battered sofa that doubled as his bed. He sat next to her and handed her the object which, upon unwrapping, was revealed to be a heart shaped locket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t find the chain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Okay; I can get another one for it. \u201cLisa leaned forward and hugged Jon. He was a bit surprised by the act of affection, but didn\u2019t reject it. After all, this was a family heirloom he had recovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the day she mentioned it as she\u2019d leaving the school. She had lost it in the school and had been quite upset that she had lost her grandmother\u2019s locket. He had promised her that he would do his best to find it. It had taken the whole night, but he managed to track down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she hugged him, his eyes were drawn to the shoes Lisa was wearing. She wore shoes but no socks. They were small but at that moment he was imagining what they\u2019d look like if they were the size of a house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had  acquired the injection, Lisa was the first one he thought of. He would rather do it around someone he knew and trusted rather than  some stranger.  But what if she said no? What if she thought he was some weirdo? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is she home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jon! Nice to meet you.

The house would seem small for anyone like Jon, but for a raccoon family it was just right. The furniture were all to scale of the raccoons, with the exception of one couch that was apparently for guests. Karen offered it to him and he sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I do, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream and Sugar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her walk away, her tale swinging lazily behind her. He towered over her, and he wondered what would it be like to see him tower over him. He felt the injector in his pocket. He would find out soon enough. Karen returned a few moments later carrying a small  steaming cup. He thanked her, then Asked \"Will Lisa be gone long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she'd be back in an hour or so.\" Karen answered. \"She tells me you found her locket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jon sipped his coffee \"Luckily for her I found it in the changing room near one of the shower drains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned her not to take it to school, but she had to show it off. How's the coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, thanks.Where is everyone? If you don't mind me asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No at all\" Karen answered \"My husband is at work and my oldest son is out with his friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you in the house? You took a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I  Poisoned your Coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon stared for a moment before Karen burst out laughing. \"Kidding ! Just kidding! but seriously, I can take care of myself. Besides, I could tell you're not a threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No.' Thought Jon 'I guess I wouldn't be, considering I plan to be bug size by nightfall.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Jon asked if he could be excused to used the washroom. There was only one in the house and it was upstairs.  After being warned the toilet might not be able to handle a Human size Number 2, and after assuring Karen he only had to do Number 1, he ascended the stairs. Though he wasn't completely lying about needing to go, He also wanted to have a look around. There were four rooms. A Bathroom and three bedrooms. The Bedroom across from the Bathroom belonged to Lisa's mother and father. Further down the hall was a room that looked like it might belong to her Brother, and at the very end of the hallway belonged to Lisa. Her bedroom door was wide opened, and he looked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a typical teenage girl's bedroom. She might've been a raccoon, but there were some things that were universally common among the species. Jon noticed a picture on the mirror. It was of Lisa and himself. He remembered that picture. It had been  around thanksgiving and she had given him one of the few decent meals he'd received since he'd left home.  The first time he'd ever done a selfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter using the washroom he headed back downstairs, a plan coming together in his mind. At the same time though, he felt kinda guilty. Lisa had treated him like family, did he really want to risk ruining that friendship over a fantasy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, Lisa once told me you lived in the school.\" said Karen as he walked back into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down in the basement\" he said, then added 'Up until today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schools out for the summer. And so am I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. Then she asked \"Why don't you spend the night here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon couldn't believe his luck. \" I would like that very much. Thank You.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night</span></div></div>",

Her voice was gentle, but firm \"Whatever it is, just tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jon told her everything. The fact that he was now homeless, his crazy desires and his insane plan.

Small, at least bug size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, at least you'll be able to look up to me for a change\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon gave her a hug. \"I have always looked up to you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She might've been a raccoon, but there were some things that were universally common among the species. Jon noticed a picture on the mirror. It was of Lisa and himself. He remembered that picture. It had been around thanksgiving and she had given him one of the few decent meals he'd received since he'd left home. The first time he'd ever done a selfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we do this, lets go over those ground rules.\" Said Lisa breaking his line of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule Number one. You have to remain in my bedroom at all times unless I'm with you. I wouldn't want my little Jon accidently stepped on or mistaken for a bug and stepped on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, That sounds reasonable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule Number two. We Raccoons have very good hearing. So If I can hear you at your new size, so can anyone else. So you'll have to stay quite when I'm not around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. Important safety tip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Rule Number Three\" Lisa Smiled and winked \"Don't climb on my Body while I'm asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I \" Jon sputtered to which Lisa giggled . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with the rules established she said \"Okay, how do you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jon began \" I'll need to remove some clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Jon was in his boxers and laying on the hardwood floor. He held the injector in his hand. \"The instructions say I need to inject it in my thigh. You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \"Ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one quick breath Jon drove the needle into the meat of his thigh . He winced as he felt the needle pierce skin and pushed the plunger with his thumb. He felt the chemical enter his body. He handed the empty injector to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" A moment or two passed. Jon shook his head. A wave of disappointment fell over Jon. It looked as though it wouldn't work, that this was a scam. Then he spoke \"My thigh is getting warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa knelt down next to him, her heart racing. She wasn't sure if she was ready for this at all, but it was too late for both of them to back out now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah, it's ... it's starting to tingle...Okay... it's spreading to my back... like, like a fever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's Back suddenly convulsed and he cried out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh god. It hurts. I didn't think it would hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the world faded away, the last thing Jon saw was Lisa's face. It was growing larger. Taking up his field of vision. </span></div></div>",

It was only when he opened his eyes and saw the ceiling hundreds of feet above his head did he remember where he was and what he'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" he exclaimed. Then added \"What happened to my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice had gone high pitched. Almost like a chipmunk in that cartoon show he'd watched last week out of boredom.  There was a sudden groaning noise, like a  wooden chair on wooden floor, then the sound of giant foot falls that Jon could feel through his body. Suddenly an enormous fur covered face filled the sky, dark brown eyes focused on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raccoon smiled  revealing teeth that were once considered cute but now were bone crushing. As she spoke her hot humid breath blew over his naked form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You're awake! I was starting to worry.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Jon covered his ears, his hearing had either become sensitive or his Raccoon friend's voice had gotten louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so sorry!\" said Lisa in a whisper, \"Is this better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well except for my voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shrugged \"Tiny lungs, tiny voice. I think it's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long was I out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at her watch \"Give or take, two and a half days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon sat up, feeling a little dizziness that soon passed \"Two and a Half Days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best I could do was to make you comfortable and out of sight.\" Lisa explained. Jon carefully stood up and looked about. He had been laying on a think cotton like material surrounded by what looked like walls of corrugated cardboard. \"Jon, may I pick you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a silly thing to ask, under normal circumstances, and it wasn't like he could say no. But Jon appreciated that Lisa felt the need to ask permission. Not that she had to, he was in her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask.\" said Jon with a smile. This was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's hand came into his view, outstretched fingers reaching for him. Moments later he was being gingerly held between finger and thumb. The flesh of her digits molded around him. For Lisa it was an equally amazing experience, here was a human who two days ago was so tall she barely stood past his navel and now was no bigger than a gummie....She felt something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, is that your....It is isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, morning wood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa cocked her head and gave him a look \"It's three in the afternoon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon shrugged. Or at least he tried to given that his arms were pinned to his side. Lisa just smiled and shook her head, this was going to be interesting.</span></div></div>",

It was a video of a woman in the role of a giantess. She looked down at Jon with a puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like this sort of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon looked at the video \" Not this in particular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded and looked back at the video, then noted \"She's not a very good actress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon couldn't argue with that. \"I would think most of the women are hired because of their beauty and it doesn't matter if they can't act their way out of a paper bag. The majority of them don't even try to act or get into character, they just recite what they've been told to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is she stomping on that toy man so much? If  I were to stomp you,  <i>which I won't</i>, I'd only need to do it once. Who is she trying to kill, Superman?\" Lisa blinked \"Now she's switching to the <i>other</i> foot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon Chuckled as he made his way to a cap of water. \"If you think this is bad, you should've seen the one I saw. Twenty minutes of the camera being moved up and down a middle aged woman's body while she ate potato chips. Then the camera gets dropped into the chips, and there's a shot of her eating with her mouth open. A waste of twenty bucks that I could've spent on food. Talk about False advertising.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is the appeal? Lisa asked \"Surely not in videos like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are better Videos out there.\" Jon explained \"Most of the best ones I've seen involve 3D models. Skip the frustration of trying to direct someone and rely on your own imagination and skill. I always preferred a really well written story over a poorly acted video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa brought up the search engine \"Got any favorites?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon listed them out. As well as some 3D content he'd mentioned. later that night, when everyone slept,  Lisa started reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might actually be fun,\" she thought. She was beginning to understand the appeal for this. Or at least  what appealed to Jon, which was nothing like what appealed to her friend's boyfriend. In his case, it was mostly cruelty, rampage and destruction. Abuse of power. While for Jon it was gentle interactions and the cruelty was unintentional. Maybe it was different between individuals with macrophilia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon slept in the Box she had repaired for him. At least she thought he might be. After two days of unconsciousness Lisa  couldn't understand how that was possible.  Something concerned her. Though he'd been warned of the dangers  she wondered if he would risk carrying out his fantasies unsupervised.  But he couldn't be that foolish. Was He?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something she'd talk to him tomorrow. For now it was of to dream land for her. So, shutting off the computer, Lisa crawled into bed. As the light went out, Jon waited a few moments before sitting up. He had tried everything, but after two days of unconsciousness how could anyone fall asleep? He didn't want to sleep. He wanted to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble was, he'd given his word. He couldn't break his word, or could he? How was she going to know? Jon peered over the side of his box. his heart sank. Nope. He wasn't going to be doing anything this night except watch Lisa sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich he did.</span></div></div>",

As much as he would've wanted to he really had no idea whether or not the student would come in tomorrow. And he'd be trapped inside the shoe if  the injection was to make him as small as it was supposed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead he grabbed the other shoe off the top of the locker he placed both shoes on the floor in front of the locker door. School policy can be stupid when it came to certain things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo take his mind off the footwear, Jon performed his obligated duties as Janitor. Hours later he dropped off his keys to the principal's office, made sure the front doors to the school were locked, and  left his old life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night time. The perfect  time for what he had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself up by an apartment building. It was a two story \"Ladies Only \" building. The only apartment he'd heard of that ever did that. He'd seen a few of the women who lived there, as a result This was a potential location for his fantasy come true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem of course was how to get inside. Obviously he couldn't do that. But he could shrink himself and wait for someone to enter and he had to do was hitch a ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around to the back of the apartment building. It was super dark there. Perfect for what he had to . He took out the injector. He thought about ditching his clothes, but if it didn't work he'd be a naked guy with a needle in his leg. And if all it did was make him pass out  he'd be an unconscious naked guy about to be arrested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the plastic tip, closed his eyes, and drove the injector home. The needle penetrates, he felt the chemical enter his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe removed the injector. He counted to ten. Still nothing. He'd blown it. All his hard earned cash he'd spent on---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a sudden wave of vertigo and the ground rushed up to meet him.  Everything went dark. He may have blacked out, for the next thing he remembered was opening his eyes and staring up at this cloth canopy that he soon realized was his shirt. standing on wobbly legs, Jon staggered out toward the light. Outside was an alien jungle. It was the lawn. It had worked. He smiled and let out a loud \"Yah Hoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice didn't sound right. It was all high pitched like he'd been breathing helium. He didn't care. Now all he had to do was.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. That front door was a very long ways away.  A lot further than he would've wanted it to be.  No point in staying around though. He stepped out, completely naked, and headed out into the strange new world that awaited him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking about he noticed a guy in overalls heading in his direction. The Giant walked passed him to the shed located in the corner of the lawn. Jon hadn't noticed it last night. He watched as the Giant paused to gather up Jon's discarded clothing before unlocking the door to the shed. Something about that shed and the man made Jon uneasy. He decided to quicken his pace even though going faster really wasn't going to make much of a difference distance wise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard something behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his horror a Preying Mantis stood over him. Instinctively Jon picked up a stone to try to defend himself. At that moment a there was a loud fluttering of wings and something big pitched down behind the Mantis. He managed to catch a glimpse of a yellow beak and the Mantis was gone. A moment later the huge bird was airborne again. Jon was beginning to regret shrinking himself. The lawn was full of dangers, and it was about to get even more dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden roar of an engine. The ground beneath him began to shake; the wind began to pick up.  It reminded him of the sound of a\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawnmower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Why the hell didn\u2019t I consider someone might mow the lawn?' Ash soon saw the giant pushing monstrous machine. Straight toward him. He started to run but it was already too late. Hurricane like winds lifted him off the ground and Jon was sucked towards the blades of the mower. It was like being picked up by a tornado. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mower was old, and as a result the rock guard was missing. Jon was spat out and upward. Unharmed but tumbling head over heels through the air, he had no idea where he was going to land.  His upward momentum was sending him toward the opened windows of the two story building.

He was confused at first because of the bown monoliths all around him. It took a moment to realize they were cardboard boxes. Getting to his feet, Jon decided to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever was living in this apartment hadn't been living there very long. While there were some furniture set up and some personal belongings most of it looked to be still in the cardboard boxes. From what he could see, two people lived there. Who they were Jon had no idea. Unbeknownst to him he was about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and daughter walked side by side toward their apartment. The \"Haunted\"Apartment according to their neighbor Terri. They had moved in two days ago, so far no appearances of grizzly apparitions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If there is Ghost to be seen, maybe I could sell the story to Paranormal Witness.' Janet mused. ' Maybe then I could afford to send Penny to collage one day.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept that bit of info to herself. No point in having Penny scared of something that might not even be there. It was bad enough that she was a new kid in school with all the troubles that can cause. She knew the move hadn't been easy for her daughter. Penny had made it clear that the apartment wasn't exactly to her liking. Janet had to admit the dust and the musty smell from being unoccupied for a while didn't exactly make the place feel like home. But she had assured her daughter that it was only until she could find something better. She thought about the waitress outfit she was wearing. That day might be a while coming. But for now the two bedroom apartment was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the key in the lock and they stepped inside. It didn't quite look like home, what with the still unpacked boxes of their belongings all over the place. But she was determined to change that. 'Maybe with a new coat of paint and curtains.' she thought. At least the rent was cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wash up and I'll get Supper ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mac N Cheese sounds good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColossal sock covered feet thundered past Jon missing him by inches. It was the first time he'd ever been afraid for his life  It was also the first time in his life that he had pissed himself. Up until that very moment he had no real realization of the gravity of the situation. To think, just a moment ago, had the Teen tread just a step to the left and he would've been nothing more than a stain on her sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It could still happen' he thought as his attention went back to the mother who also removed her footwear as she closed and locked the front door. She padded on Stocking covered feet toward the small kitchen, the floor shook with every footfall. He darted to the safety of a towering cardboard box to observe her better. \"Mom\" had taken a box of Mac and Cheese from a cardboard box of food that was yet to be put away and emptied it's contents into a pot of boiling water. She lifted her left foot off the floor so that Jon could clearly see the sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a sole it was. The toes were short, and round, and well proportioned. He was scared, he was man enough to admit that. A huge difference between fantasy and the real thing. And yet he had a desire to get closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the water shutting off in the bathroom and the girl emerged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny, the cable is hooked up now. Why don't you see what's on TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny, a nice name. Jon watched her walk past toward the couch where she plopped down and reached for the remote. The TV came to life.Jon found himself making his way under the couch and looking out from under it at a TV screen that was bigger than any movie theater screen he'd seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a thump and the floor vibrated. Penny had tapped her foot. Jon walked right up to it, confident that he'd be unnoticed. He reached out a hand and touched the sock covered extremity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what he should do. What could he do. Giving it some thought he decided to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite his diminished size he recognized a bedpost when he saw one. The landscape was a vast burgundy colored blanket. To his left he saw a towering dresser and to his left--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart skipped a beat. To his left the blanket rose upward like a mountain. He stood up and looked behind him. Someone was in the bed. A very big someone. He saw the enormous fur covered, but slender, hand followed by an arm and then a face. It was a woman. A Husky. She was laying on her back, her exposed arm and hand laying limp beside her. Jon didn't recognize her. Granted he hadn't seen all the  neighbors who lived in the building. He walked toward the hand,his heart beating loudly in his chest. Tentatively he reached out and touched a finger pad. She felt warm, the texture of the pad was like leather and yet was not. Jon looked at the face. He couldn't see all of it from where he stood, but he could see the jaw and the locks of dark curly hair. Almost on impulse he embraced the flesh and breathed in deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he backed away. Stupid! What if she had felt that? He looked at the woman husky. She didn't move nor had she seemed to even felt his touch. He brushed his hand against the flesh of hers. Not even a twitch.Just the rhythmic rise and fall of her chest. She was sleeping quite soundly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought crept into his mind and he fought to disregard it. Yes, this is what he fantasised about.  That didn't mean he felt comfortable about advantage of someone when they were sleeping in their own bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was going to know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody would know. She didn't look like she was going to wake up anytime soon. Still, he was determined not to be some crazed predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was peacefully in her bed when the speck of a man was blown into through her open window and onto the bed. She was in the kind of deep sleep that was unique for her. Having been born deaf she couldn't hear the mower or anything else of  the outside world. As a result she wasn't aware of the speck of a man who had touched her and was now contemplating an expedition to mount Linda. What the little man didn't know, and would have known had he landed near her other hand, that the vibrating wrist alarm she wore was set for seven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was eight minutes away.

Normally when she smiled her dimpled little smile, the whole world lit up, and people always went out of their way to keep that smile on her face. That was easy, though; she was a cheerful lady, always happy and always caring for those around her. She was the kind of person who wouldn't harm a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'l kill the fucking lot of you.\" At the moment Her lovely smile was nowhere to be seen; instead, her face had a terrifying snarl about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the kind of person who <b>would</b> only harm a fly. And a spider. And a bee. Really, anything smaller than her with an exoskeleton was fair game. She could not stand bugs, to the point where she transformed from pretty little neighbor to deadly assassin whenever one came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had found her target. Smack! Smack! Smack! The fly swatter came down, hard, then came down again, and again, and again. The little black fly was killed, then flattened, then smashed into component atoms. When Terri finally finished, panting with exertion, almost nothing remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spat on the corpse. \"That'll teach the fucking bugs.\" She set the flyswatter down on the table. \"Oh, that's right,\" she said. \"I was going to bake some cookies for the new neighbor. She's such a sweet lady.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri walked passed her full length mirror and paused to look at her self. Not bad for her age. She'd be turning 49 this year, but she considered herself to be one good looking cougar, even though she wasn't physically a cougar. Well, she certainly couldn't call herself a MILF since she had no kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a bit sweaty now. Let's turn on the cool air.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the AC and pushed a button. Nothing. Great, she'd have to get the superintendent to look at that. She walked over and opened the window, at that moment Jon was spinning out of control straight toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scream, he landed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was none of these things. He was walking for hours, bare foot in muddy and rocky ground had made his feet ache and he was beginning to limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst yet was the sun that beat down on his naked frame. In order to avoid getting a serious burn he had avoided areas that would expose him and had stuck to the ticker growth. He was confident that he was heading straight for the apartment, However the realization that he wasn't hadn't dawned on him until it was nearing dusk when he happened to glance back and notice the wooden fence that towered over him like an abandoned skyscraper. His heart sank once he realized his mistake. If he turned back now there was no way he'd make it by nightfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jon, you're a real lunkhead.' he thought to himself. Now what was he going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer his question the ground began to shake. The tremors were increasing with intensity, then he began to hear footfalls and female voices. He walked out to the less thicker area of grass and had a look around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were still a distance away, but that gap was closing very rapidly. Three of them, each holding drinks walking toward a fire pit and lawn chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was human, brunette, and under normal circumstances would've been described as \"Petite\". Another was Feline, but Jon couldn't tell what her species was. Unlike most, she had long hair on her head that matched the color of her tanned fur. The one that walked between them, holding a drink that could be barely seen, was colossal even if Jon had been looking at her from his old height. A dragoness. Her skin  a shade of green with an athletic build. She too also had a head of blond hair. Her footfalls shook the ground the hardest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat at the fire pit and the Dragoness lit the fire. With a Bic lighter. Contrary to popular belief her race did not breath fire. From what he could gather she lived in the house behind them. They would be there for a while, long enough for Jon to reach them he was sure. But which one would he head for?</span></div></div>",

As much as he would've wanted to he really had no idea whether or not the student would come in tomorrow. And he'd be trapped inside the shoe if  the injection was to make him as small as it was supposed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead he grabbed the other shoe off the top of the locker he placed both shoes on the floor in front of the locker door. School policy can be stupid when it came to certain things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo take his mind off the footwear, Jon performed his obligated duties as Janitor. Hours later he dropped off his keys to the principal's office. He was about to leave when he noticed a pair of Stiletto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me out, Principle Allen?\" Jon spoke to himself  \"Fine, I'll just come and live with you instead. You wouldn't mind that, would you? Little o'l me wouldn't take up any space.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon walked down the hallway and removed his clothes. Then he went back into the Principle Barbara's Office. He held the injector in his hand. Removing the plastic tip, closed his eyes, and drove the injector home. The needle penetrates, he felt the chemical enter his body. Quickly he tossed the empty injector into the wastebasket. To anyone finding it, it would look like a spent EpiPen and nothing more. He closed his eyes and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe counted to ten. Still nothing. He'd blown it. All his hard earned cash he'd spent on---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a sudden wave of  Pain. If you've seen films like Ant Man or Honey I shrunk the Kids, they portray the process of shrinking as painless and quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jon was 14 his appendix exploded. His parents had just got him to the hospital in time. He thought THAT was the most pain he could feel. When he was older, he developed a jaw infection . He thought That was the most pain he could fee. Those pains were nothing but a drop of water in the vast ocean of what he was feeling now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came like waves crashing on a beach. Waves of agony. Each wave worst than the last. He would've screamed but he could barely breathe, much less scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery muscle contorted uncontrollably. Every Muscle. Including the ones in his eyes. How he didn't lose control of his bladder and bowels, who knows? If he had, it wouldn't have been aware of it anyway. He couldn't see, he couldn't hear, he couldn't think; all he knew was pain. He wasn't aware of his decreasing stature or the passing of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the pain did ease off and Jon was able to breath. He took deep breaths and as the last remnants of agony fell away, so did his consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remained unconscious until the next morning when Principal Barbara Allen stepped into her office. Barbra was a tiger. She was in her forties but she still looked pretty good for her age. Wide hips and a pretty big bust. Jon opened his eyes just as he closed the door behind her. Jon inadvertently screamed in shock of seeing the towering feline before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara's ear flicked from the tiny shout. <b>\u201cWhat the heck.\u201d</b> The massive tiger walked further into the room going over to....</span></div></div>",

With a puzzled look on her face she took a step forward, her foot paw just barely missing the now ant size human that lay sprawled out on the hardwood floor. With a shrug she walked toward her desk. As she sat her lunch down next to the desk she noticed the spent EpiPen in the wastebasket. Curious, she had emptied the waste basket before she\u2019d left. Where had that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara noticed the keys on her desk; could the spent EpiPen belong to John? She never knew him to have a food allergy, it certainly wasn\u2019t in the employee records she had on file. Oh well, it didn\u2019t matter now anyway. He was gone now. She might\u2019ve been stern with him but it did bother her to notify him that he couldn\u2019t continue living in the basement of the school after the school closed for the summer. She\u2019d been bending school policy just to allow him to stay down there during the school year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of school policy, she decided to slip on the Stilettos before she forgot. Like almost every student that wasn\u2019t human in the school, Barbara hated wearing footwear. If they were not slippers they were just uncomfortable. Even these Stilettos she had custom made to her paws. But it was school policy, and she had to keep up an example for the students to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point John had recovered from his initial shock of seeing Principle Allen towering over him and then just barely missing stepping on him. When she had looked into her waste basket and paused he thought the gig was up, but she didn\u2019t even bother to remove it from the garbage. He watched as she slipped the Stilettos on her paws/feet and sit behind great mahogany monolith that was her desk. He stayed perfectly still until he was certain Principle Allen wasn\u2019t going to stand back up. Then he ran toward the desk. It took him longer than he\u2019d first thought it would but eventually he made it under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was greeted by the amazing sight of Principle Allen\u2019s bare muscular shins. John lowered his gaze down to the Stilettos she wore on her paws/feet. They had looked big when he was at full size, now they were enormous house size structures. As he approached them reverently he wanted to cry out with glee but he had to remain quite. Principle Allen\u2019s sensitive ears had picked up his earlier outcry. He wouldn\u2019t want her to discover him now. That would not do at all.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Last day of school meant that that it was only a four hour day. He had four hours to come up with a solution or spend the summer trapped in the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour or so John passed two and fro in front of Principle Allen\u2019s huge feet/paws.  He still hadn\u2019t come up with a plan and he was beginning to worry. He stepped away to relieve himself on the hardwood floor. Not that it mattered. At his new size the contents of his bladder didn\u2019t even make a drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden movement, then a wave of musk and heat. He turned to see that Principle Allen had slipped her Stilettos off her paws/feet.  He was instantly aroused at the sight, more than he had in years. There was a sigh of relief and He watched as she flexed her toes, the claws extending out toward him.  He fancied that with those claws, and those muscular legs of hers she could am a kick to a man\u2019s head and take his face clean off if she chose to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John noticed on Stiletto was on its side.

Slippers were okay, and she had a pair of runners that were comfortable enough, but there was nothing comfortable about those damn Stilettos. But even she had to abide to the schools regulations, as ridiculous as they were. Why couldn't they wear Sandals? Or Flip Flops? It was an argument she'd had with the school board over and over again. There answer?

The closer he got to her, the bigger she appeared, and the more his excitement grew.  His first thought should've been to make a straight line to her bag, find a way in and wait until she was home. Instead he made his way to her Stilettos. Large before, now they were like monoliths.  Extending a hand, he touched the leather surface.

She'd been principal for five years and it still made no sense to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked about and cocked her ears.

But regulations are regulations, he had until the end of the semester to find other accommodations, and there's no way she could've allowed him to stay inside the school after the semester. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know Jon was focusing on other accommodations at that very moment, right under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon had watched that massive paw swung forward and touched the ground in front of him  with enough force to knock him off his feet. This time, though he didn't know how, he managed to stay silent. He watched the now giant Tigeress walk toward the window and peer outside, assuming his little outcry was from somewhere out on the premises. Those sensitive feline ears had picked up on his voice. He'd have to remember that. He didn't want her to know he was there. Not yet. If he were discovered he needed a story that was believable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her powerful frame pause at the desk to pick up the keys he had left there the night before and watched as she placed them in a drawer in the desk. She sat down and started ruffling through some papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well Jon O'l boy' he thought 'I guess you got what you wanted.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite, not just yet. He needed to hitch a ride on her, or something she would carry. Obviously her Bag would be the proper choice. When he was sure she wasn't looking he made a run for it. As soon as he was able to catch his breath he made his assent. Fortunately for him, the zipper wasn't quite closed all the way and he was able to slip inside. He free fell maybe ten feet before landing on Barbara's lunch bag. He took a sniff, curiously. What did a carnivore like Barbara have for lunch? There were carnivore versions of popular foods out there, but he'd never seen them up close. Maybe he could take a sneak peek?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, and maybe he could get himself killed. There would be other times to find out. After all, once he got to her home he'd need to find food and shelter. It was tempting though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So far everything was going according to plan. Unaware of her passenger, the Tigeress passed the students who where emptying out of the school for the summer  and made her way over to her car. It was an older car, but due to her size, it was the only one she could fit her frame into.Humans made modern cars so small, thank the goddess that size wasn't an issue for her 75 delta 88 with genuine Saskatchewan seal skin leather seats .

He had only one chance and one chance only and he couldn't risk being trapped in that gym shoe if it's owner decided not to come in on the last day of school. In which case he'd die from starvation or dehydration, and he would've wasted his opportunity.  Placing the Gym Shoe in its proper place he continued to clean; all the while thinking of where would be the best place to live out his fantasy.  Most places he immediately ruled out.  He considered a nude beach but there were no such places nearby. And such a place would be too out in the open. Someone would see him shrink. He then considered maybe a movie theater. He could shrink in the bathroom and make his way into the auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon considered it. That might work, the only problem would be his clothes. Deposing them would be difficult and if his clothes were found in the waste there would be questions and possible investigation. What he was doing couldn't be exactly legal or they'd be selling it in every corner store. Still, he kept it in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a house, Jon remembered, that was just behind the school. He could see it now as he looked out through a window. He could see a family of apes living there. He could see the Mother and Father outside a Gorilla and a Chimpanzee. There were homes on either side but of their occupants he couldn't say for sure. Still, they were options as well. He estimated that if he were to inject himself at night fall and started walking, there was a chance he could make it to any one of those homes in reasionable time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Jon had finished cleaning the school for the last time, he had made his decision. </span></div></div>",

It took a tremendous amount of skill and cunning to get to this moment. You'd think that the hardest part was ditching his clothes and injecting himself without being seen, but the hardest part was actually the act of traversing the space between the shadows and the front door all the while dealing with the effects of shrinking. Trying to focus on one direction while the world grew around him. He could barely reach the knob of the door by the time he got there and was thankful to discover it to be unlocked. He slipped in unnoticed and continued to shrink in a darkened corner behind a coat rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon could hear voices of conversation. When he felt he was ready to get up and explore this strange new world, he traveled across the floor toward the voices. The conversation led him to the dining room where the ape family was having their meal and talking about the day.  There were four of them, the two adults he had seen previously and two daughters. The Daughters were not a mix of Chimpanzee and Gorilla as one would expect. One Daughter's heritage was dominantly Chimpanzee while the other was dominantly Gorilla.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed down at their feet. Unlike their feral relatives, the Ape family had feet that had more human characteristics. One broad sole was pointed in his direction. Even from a distance he could see details that would've gone unnoticed were he still five foot eight. His loins ached to get closer but he knew that now was not the time and place. He had all the time in the world to get top know this family more intimately. A part of him felt like a cad, but hell who was going to know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving he turned to explore this new world, his new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*For Reference I've  decided to base the Mother, Daughters and Father off Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes remake. So for reference just google images of Characters such as Ari and Attar. As a matter of fact, lets name the Mom and Dad Ari and Attar and the Daughters Nova and Leeta<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With nothing to lose, he acquires the one thing that  will make his Macrophileic fantasies come to life. But things don't always work out as they are planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo skat and water works. That's pee and crap for those who don't know the terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo kids. Anybody character under 18 isn't allowed. However, if the Character is 17 turning 18 in a few chapters I'll allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman and anthropomorphic characters are allowed. Male and Female<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoot/paw stuff, unaware, vore, etc. Whatever you want to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne sentence chapters only for choices, but don't do twenty \"How about _____\" chapters. Nobody can do anything with that. There's not enough there to work with. Try to do at least a paragraph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's about it. </td>",
