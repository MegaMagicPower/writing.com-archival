            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a long morning, so Estelle was more irritated than usual. The servant styling her hair had pulled and tugged at the knots more than the princess believed necessary, but that wasn't the beginning! Her bath had been far too hot, her clothing just wasn't fitting exactly as it should, she ruined one shoe by stepping in a puddle that was the result of a leak in the palace ceiling, <i>and</i> she missed breakfast because she took too long in that too hot bath. Granted, she was very aware that she was a princess and could order breakfast whenever she wanted it, but they should have <i>waited</i> for her. She was the most important in the family, after all! At least - in her mind, she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was with a very bad attitude that the princess stepped out of the palace doors that morning with a new set of shoes on, sliding her way into the garden. See, usually, the garden could calm her down when nothing else could. In her opinion, the gardeners were the only servants of the palace that did <i>everything</i> right, as per her expectation. The roses were perfect, the tulips were beautiful, and the arching weeping willows were always casting sufficient shade over the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bench in the center was her favorite place to settle, and so she made a bee-line toward it, then plopped down rather un-princess-like before spreading her skirt out to cover her feet, then setting her hands within her lap. Her face still looked quite irritated, but was slowly calming. That is, until she felt a tug on her recently fixed hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" she demanded, whipping her head around to look toward the direction of the tug. There was no branch to cause it, no person - in fact, there was nothing. Shrugging and thinking nothing of it, she turned back around and set her back against the bench again, looking toward a bush full of roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came another tug - this time on her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unladylike growl touched the princesses lips as she whipped back around, sure that she wasn't imagining it this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying in the air with petite little wings, and blinking at the princess quite innocently, was a tiny little girl. Judging by the pigtails in her hair, she was quite young. Her overall appearance was rather odd: her skin held a pinkish hue, her hair was quite blue, her eyes blinked at the princess in a pale purplish color, and her clothing consisted of only a simply-stitched dress made from what was likely a discarded swatch of cloth. When faced with the angry princess, the small fairy winced, then lifted a hand to offer a little finger wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess' first reaction was to stare at the small figure, nostrils flaring as she sucked in and released breaths quickly, anger still on her features. It takes some time, but eventually she simply growls, \"<i>What</i> do <i>you</i> want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this didn't help the fairy at all. She pointed her tiny little finger toward the princess, then squeaked out, \"You're pretty,\" before curling herself into a tiny little pink, blue, and purple ball, her translucent wings still flapping behind her to keep her in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes, the princess turned her back on the fairy again, lifting a hand to wave her away, nearly smacking the small figure in the process. \"Be gone. You're not worth my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filling the small fairy's tiny eyes, she squeaked, then zipped away after uncurling from her little ball, obviously distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle known to the princess, however, the two hadn't been alone in the garden. Peeking out from behind a tree, watching the entire scene, was an older fairy. She had the same colorings as the younger fairy, but far more lines on her face, showing physical evidence of her experience. With each passing moment, the fairy's face became more and more tight with her anger, and once the young one had darted away, she reached out a tiny little wand to point toward the princess. She uttered a few murmured words, and then with a flick of her wrist, she turned the princess into...</span></div></div>",

I'm a frog!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy who had changed Estelle into a frog stepped out from behind her tree and laughed. \"That will teach you to hurt the little people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't hurt anyone!\" Estelle croaked. Then remembered. \"Oh, you mean that annoying little fairy? It was HER fault for getting all up in my face like that! Surely you can understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pshaw!\" said the older fairy. \"Us fairies stick together and we protect our young. If you are going to be a princess in a fantasy kingdom then you should read and understand the rules and regulations regarding fairies, their powers, and the respect due to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zheesh!\" Estelle said. \"Are you some kind of fairy lawyer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" Estelle said. \"Let's take your case before the fairy court. I wonder what they will sentence you to? Probably worse than being a frog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's worse than that?\" Estelle sputtered. \"Yes!

He might not like Estelle complaining about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your honor,\" Estelle said. \"This fairy turned me into frog for no good reason.

I searched the garden for the most beautiful dew drop, for dew drops are one of the main ingredients in dreams, but the fountain was turned off.  When I saw the reflection of the moon and the stars in the basin of the fountain, I turned and looked up to sky.  The moon was so clear and bright, I felt as if I could reach out and touch it.  I flew up to the sky, higher than high, reaching for that untouchable beauty, but the higher I flew, the colder I felt.  Still, I kept trying, I kept flying, higher and higher until a sudden wind blew a set of clouds over me.  At first I thought the clouds were beautiful too, so I paused for moment.  As the clouds washed over me, I got lost.  It was cold and wet.  I no longer knew which way was up or down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess sat captivated by the story, hanging on every word.  She reached for the child fairy\u2019s hands and they resumed holding hands as the child fairy continued her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe clouds grew darker and darker until there was no moonlight at all.  I panicked, for moonlight is another important ingredient for dreams, especially happy dreams.  I was so cold that I started to shiver.  I held my wings close, they wrapped around my body for warmth and I started to fall to the ground.  I plummeted through clouds for what seemed like an eternity.  When the ground finally appeared I opened my wings and got caught on a wind that carried me far away.  When I finally landed, I was so tired that I lay down on a rock next to a stream.  The babbling brook swiftly put me to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child fairy paused for a moment, then started again.  \u201cI awoke to the Song of Dawn.  The babbling brook sings it so well.  It was beautiful, but I had no time to listen.  The sun was already creeping over the horizon and I had only a short time now to reach you and bring you your dreams.  I tried to fly, but my wings were still tired from my journey toward the moon, so I had to run on the ground.  By the time I got to your bedroom, you were already awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child fairy started to cry again.  The princess reached out and held her in a hug.  The princess said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.  I forgive you.  It wasn\u2019t your fault.  I think the moon is beautiful too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child fairy trembled and cried for a few moments and finally said, \u201cThank you.  Thank you for being so forgiving.  I promise, I will never again fail to bring you your dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess looked at the child fairy and said, \u201cI just realized that you probably know me as Estelle, but I don\u2019t know your name.  Call me Stella.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child fairy smiled the most beautiful smile.  Her pink skin seemed to sparkle as it glowed.  \u201cMy name is Amethyst.

Max, this is Stella.\u201d  Thysta curtsied as she introduced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax stood up straight on his rear legs, stretched his wings out into the air, as if to show them off to her, then bowed, tucking his right wing forward underneath his body with a flourish.  \u201cPleasure is mine, to meet of thine, a girl so fine, and so divine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Max, you\u2019re such a flatterer,\u201d said Thysta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure,\u201d said Stella as she returned his bow with a curtsy.  \u201cTell me, Max, do you always speak in rhyme?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, always is, as always was, this is a quiz, for what Max does.  He speaks in rhyme, now all the time, but for young Max, it was not rhyme,\u201d Max again replied in melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please don\u2019t get him started on recounting his youth!\u201d  Thysta interrupted. \u201cYes, Max, we know, when you were young you would sing.\u201d  Thysta tugged on Stella\u2019s arm.  \u201cCome on, time to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls started to flutter into the air.  Max slowly followed, saying, \u201cBut wait, there\u2019s more, there\u2019s so much more.  Just wait, there\u2019s more, to butterfly lore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella turned her head back to look at Max, but Thysta hastened their flight and said, \u201cNo, no.  That\u2019s enough butterfly lore for now.  Goodbye Max.  Goodbye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella said goodbye as well and looked at Thysta with a questioning look.  \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let him tell his story?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThysta got them flying in a direction away from Max and replied, \u201cYou know, Stella, I love the butterflies, their beautiful wings with brilliant colors and patterns, but there are only so many hours in a day.\u201d  She glanced at the sun.  \u201cMax is a wonderful butterfly, but once he starts a story, it just never ends.  And we need to find a way to get you back to being a princess again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can we do that?  I don\u2019t even know how I got here,\u201d Stella replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here\u2019s the thing.  Healing and creating happy dreams are not the only things that fairies can do.  Sometimes, they, well\u2026\u201d Thysta stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  What else do they do?\u201d  Stella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sometimes they get angry\u2026 and do things that\u2026 are not kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying I angered a fairy when I shooed you away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Thysta answered.  She looked a little bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, who was it?  Was it you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.  But if we do not find the fairy and convince her to reverse the spell before dawn tomorrow, then you will be forever\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She held Thysta\u2019s hands and looked into her eyes.  Thysta\u2019s eyes were a deeper purple now.  It was a dark purple, an almost black purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, there is more to this spell than just you becoming a fairy.  Fairies aren\u2019t born.  Fairies were children once.  All of us were children.  We were children who needed some help finding our kindness.  Those of us who found it before the following dawn were allowed a choice.  We could choose to remain as fairies or return to a mortal life.  With either choice, we must also promise to practice kindness every day.\u201d  Thysta paused and looked off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella thought for a moment.  She thought about kindness.  She thought about her own choices and how she had treated everyone that she knew.  She wondered which she would choose: the endless days of a fairy or the numbered days of a human life.  One question remained unanswered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about those who do not find their kindness before the dawn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThysta replied, \u201cThey do not have a choice.  They return to being the children that they were, only they never know kindness ever again.  They spend their entire lives with cold hearts and closed minds.  They never again know wonder or beauty or joy.  They never find solace in any corner of the world, not in any garden, not in any flower, not even in a rainbow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella was mortified.  She shivered at the thought of never again seeing beauty in the garden flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must find her, this fairy, and prove to her that I can be kind, that I will be kind.\u201d  Stella shivered again.  \u201cI promise I will be kind.  Please help me find her!  Where should we look first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThysta straightened her back and arched her wings.  Her eyes brightened to a brilliant, glowing purple.  \u201cI believe you.  You do have kindness in you.  Come.  Let\u2019s start with the caterpillars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith renewed hope, Stella followed Thysta to the milkweed outside the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should warn you, while the caterpillars have wisdom and they know just about everything going on in the garden, they are a little,\u201d Stella rolled her eyes, \u201c\u2026difficult to talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the milkweed meadow, Thysta heard music.  It was a choir of singers each singing their own song.  Once in a while, a small group would collaborate and sing the same song.  The harmonies would find new notes and then one caterpillar after another would drift off to a new song.  It was a cacophony of a cappella chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThysta touched Stella on the wrist to signal her to stand back.  Stella waited and watched as Thysta cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHello, my friends, my sweet, beautiful singers.  How are you today?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThysta\u2019s voice varied through a range of notes as she tried to match the current song of the closest caterpillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhy, sweet Thysta, sweet Amythysta, we are good today.  And it is, we see, that you have brought us a child, a child that lost her way.\u201d</i>  The caterpillar rose up on its hind body and its voice reverberated with operatic volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThysta replied, <i>\u201cOh good, you know what we seek, we seek what can be true.  We seek to find the good in all, we seek some help from you.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther caterpillars took notice of Thysta\u2019s voice.  She sang with the soft notes of a piano.  The notes had a calming effect on Stella, who now just watched and listened to the musical exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other caterpillars provided a chorus to the response from the closer caterpillar who switched from an opera to a doo-wop tempo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cSweet Thysta, Thysta,<br>\r\nWe know your need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Thysta, Thysta,<br>\r\nThe one you seek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was mad,<br>\r\nShe was sad,<br>\r\nNow she hides,<br>\r\nWhere you had,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Thysta, Thysta,<br>\r\nWe know your need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Thysta, Thysta,<br>\r\nThe one you seek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMade her glad,<br>\r\nSuch a cad,<br>\r\nFroggy knows <br>\r\nLilly pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Thysta, Thysta,<br>\r\nWe know your need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Thysta, Thysta,<br>\r\nThe one you seek.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you so much,\u201d Thysta replied.  \u201cYou are wonderful!

The pond was tiny but deep.  The water was dark.  There was no seeing the fish below.  Stella knew the only way to attract them to the surface was to toss a few bread crumbs at the spaces between the lily pads.  She and Thysta landed on a nearby rock and sat down to rest their wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the center of the pond was the only lily flower in bloom.  The pink petals provided a great contrast to the green lily pads and dark water.  As Thysta and Stella sat scanning the pond for any sign of the older fairy, two large eyes popped up from just beneath the surface of the dark water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Mister Frog,\u201d Thysta spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog climbed up on a lily pad and returned the greeting, \u201cHello Thysta.\u201d  The voice had a deep, booming sound to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen Thunkadunk?  The caterpillars said that she may be able to help us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrog replied, \u201cAre you going to introduce me to your friend first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, how rude of me.  Mister Frog, this is Stella.  Stella, this is Mister Frog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella stood up and curtsied, then sat back down.  \u201cPleasure to meet you Mister Frog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it is a pleasure to meet you, young Princess Estelle.  It seems that shrinking to the size of a fairy has helped you to do some growing up today.  Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know me, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I know you.  I have watched you visit the pond many times.  You have a special way of smiling when you feed my friends, the fish.  Lately, that smile has turned to a frown.  Do you think you could smile again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella was not sure how to feel.  She felt a rush of emotions, from shyness to awkwardness to a flattered blush.  She glanced down at her feet and then looked up with her eyes.  She touched her cheeks with her hands and then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the smile I was hoping for.  That is the smile of kindness and wonder.  Now, I think you might have a question for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.  We are looking for the fairy that transformed me to this size.  I must apologize to her, for my behavior.  Do you know where she is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.  And what will you say to her when you find her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will tell her how awful I was and how much I regret it.  I know now that I was being selfish and unkind.  I never should have swatted at Thysta when she was only trying to help me.  I never should have been so demanding of the house staff.  They do everything for me and all they ask in return is a bit of kindness.  I must tell her these things for I truly feel them now.  My eyes have been opened to a beauty that I never knew was there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink flower at the center of the pond began to glow.  A bright pink light rose up out of its center and hovered above the pond.  When the light diminished, there hovered the older fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept your apology,\u201d the older fairy said to Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Stella and Thysta stood up and bowed before the older fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!  Oh thank you so much!\u201d  Stella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have learned your lesson.  Now that you know of our world, you have a choice to make.  You may choose the manner in which you will spread kindness to the world.  Will it be as a fairy, or as a human being?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes watched as Stella pondered the consequences or her choices.  As a fairy, she could be kind forever to countless people, but as a human being, she could apologize to those whom she has wronged with her selfishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish to be a child again,\u201d she spoke with great resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older fairy raised her hands to the sky.  Stella looked up and squinted as her gaze crossed the sun.  She felt herself being lifted into the air, spinning and turning with her eyes closed.  She became dizzy and soon passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, she found herself lying on the bench in the center of the garden being shaken awake by the cook.  She was her normal child size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou missed breakfast,\u201d the cook said to her while handing her a small bowl of porridge with strawberries, blueberries and cinnamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you!  It is so thoughtful of you to remember me.\u201d  Stella stood up and hugged the cook almost knocking over the bowl of porridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!  My, you are in a good mood today.  I\u2019ll leave you to your breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stay and sit with me.  Let\u2019s watch the water spray from the fountain together.  If you look at just the right angle, you might see a rainbow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cook sat down and together they watched the water, they listened to the breeze shuffling the leaves in the trees, and Stella could almost hear some distant singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Epilogue</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe outcome was good, but do you not think that you may have over-reacted when you turned her into a fairy?\u201d said Mister Frog to Thunkadunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I over-reacted!  My name is Thunkadunk!  What kind of a name is that for a fairy?  I over-react to everything,\u201d said the older fairy to Mister Frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a large orange and white koi fish breached the surface of the pond and Thunkadunk was splashed in the face with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!  How dare you?  I\u2019ll show you what happens to fish who splash water at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMister Frog blinked his eyes and settled into a comfortable spot, hoping Stella might visit today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End.</span></div></div>",

The knight's armor converts into shining silver scales, his amber colored eyes gain a reptilian appearance, while his neck elongates and a pair of silver wings protrude from his back. By the end the transformation he is two feet taller than Estelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is strange. I don't think knights are supposed to do that. I'm starting to think that this knight may not have been human at all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a lovely dragoness doing under a moat like this?\" The knight who transformed into a dragon asked Estelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... You may find this hard to believe, but I was a human who was turned into a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable. Fairies are crafty creatures. If you get one mad they'll definitely curse you. The name's Sir Remus Dragonblood, both dragon and knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Princess Estelle. Do you know what dragons eat Sir Dragonblood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born a dragon so I should know. Dragons usually eat all kinds of wildlife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we find some wildlife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus looks at Estelle as if she was joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be joking. Didn't your parents take you anywhere when you were a little girl? There's a forest not too far from here where there's more than enough food for dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is? I've never left the castle grounds before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to leave anyway. If more knights show up who aren't dragons see you you may as well kiss your kingdom goodbye. Also it seems that the fairy who transformed you left her spell incomplete. It's only a matter of time that your hands and arms are fully transformed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstelle looks at her arms and hands in horror as she spots a few new scales growing on top of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you have a week before you're a full dragon. If we can find the fairy and sort out whatever you did I'm sure you can become human again. If not, I could teach you how to shapeshift at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Remus. but wouldn't people spot me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you...</span></div></div>",

While I will begin the story in the first chapter, there are a few requests I'd like to make before we go in, if you are wanting to contribute to this story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">1. <b>Please don't kill off everyone.</b> Without characters, there is no story. While it may eventually make sense for a character to die, let's not just kill everyone off with machine guns for no reason, mmm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. <b>Each direction might take a different set of characters.</b> And that is fine! The beauty of an interactive story is that you can choose the way you'd like it to go, and then add in things you'd like to see if it hasn't been written yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. <b>Let's keep to the setting, please.</b> This one will be in a fantasy setting with princesses, kings, carriages, servants, and other things. (Yes, I know I'm a grown woman, but I think these can be amusing for everyone. See the overall positive opinions about \"The Princess Bride\" for proof that these sorts of settings CAN be amusing for all ages.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. <b>There's an ASR rating - I'd like to keep it that way.</b> Anything that would pertain to a higher rating shouldn't be added. And if it is believed that it makes sense in the story, feel free to email me about your idea! I'll take a glance. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlrighty!
