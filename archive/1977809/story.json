Murdoc was up in the recording studio, Cyborg-Noodle in her charging station, and 2D was left wandering the island out of boredom. Eventually, he made his way to the office, where a strange package sat on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Wot's this?\" the blue-haired male muttered to himself. Glancing around to make sure Murdoc wasn't looking, he tore the box open. Inside was a book, covered with strange runes. \"Wow...\" Stu muttered as he cracked it open and examined the contents. \"A spell to make the speaker bigger...\" he read aloud after a page caught his eye. \"This spell can cause the user to grow larger every day. Simply speak the words. Looks interestin'. Wonder if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2D snuck back down to his room at the bottom of the 'island' opened the book again. Lost in imaginary scenarios of a muscular version of himself throttling Murdoc for all the crap the bassist put him through, he rapidly recited the spell aloud, his thick Cockney accent mangling several words. Looking down, he expected it to do something, waiting for something to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nothing happened, 2D sighed. \"Shoulda' known it was a dud... better put it back 'fore Muds sees it's gone...\" Stu did just that, carefully closing the box, unaware that the spell had indeed worked, just not quite as intended. The singer went to his bed, and soon drifted off to sleep, not hearing his stomach gurgle or feel his lanky 150-pound body swell with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen 2D woke later that night, he weighed...</span></div></div>",

According to a clock, it was just past midnight. Yawning and absent-mindedly scratching his stomach, he walked to the bathroom for a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, he glanced at the full-body mirror on the door and did a double-take. \"Wot the?\" 2D muttered, stripping off his shirt, hoping he had imagined the bulge underneath. He hadn't; his pale body had grown visibly larger. Stu's face had filled out, giving him chipmunk cheeks. A potbelly was pushing against his waistband, which explained the pain from earlier. His formerly twig-like arms now had definition, though not with muscle, he noted as he gripped a meaty forearm, but with soft fat. \"Wot 'appened to me?\" he asked himself, turning to the side to examine his larger rear. Grabbing it and giving a squeeze, the singer recalled the spell he had clumsily recited the previous day. \"It worked... not the way I wanted, but it worked!\" Stu frowned and put his other hand on his belly, noting how squishy it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tink I sorta... like it...\" he smiled, unbuttoning his jeans and allowing his belly to swell out another inch or two.  2D patted and rubbed the swell happily and stood on a scale. \"200 pounds? I put on 'bout fifty in a few hours!\" he exclaimed happily before yawning and going back to his bed, sitting down in his undies.</span></div></div>",

His face had swollen considerably from its angular boniness to a soft puffiness. He had begun to grow a second chin along with it. 2D's arms had filled out their sleeves almost to bursting. After shucking off his rather tight shirt, he found that a pair of moobs had sprouted from his chest and were splayed over his ginormous belly, which was the focal point of his body and hung over his waistband. Lifting up the soft flab, he found the origin point of the button: his fly had exploded open from the quickness of the gain, sending the button away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the side and dropping his stomach, 2D noticed a pair of lovehandles had developed and hung out from his sides.

The spell was intended to increase how fast the swiftly swelling singer would gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2D sat on his bed, which was a mass of hollowed-out plastic containing a mattress that emitted several creaks when he sat down or shifted his rear, tapping out a melody on his keyboard. Focused on his music, Stu almost didn't notice the energy hitting himself. \"Hmm?\" he looked around the empty room. \"Guess it was nothing.\" he muttered, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2D stretched his arms, loving how the fat weighed them down, before resting them on his plush paunch. \"Can't believe Muds wants me to hate this or whatever...\" he muttered, playing with his fat. \"'cause this feels great! I'm so warm and soft...\" 2D hugged himself, squishing his arms into his belly, which gurgled loudly and hungrily in response. He chuckled. \"Okay, okay...\" 2D said fondly as he reached for the never-ending donut box and pulled it closer, snatching a pastry as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell Murdoc had cast doubled the amount 2D would grow from eating. He managed to eat...</span></div></div>",

Slowly the seams snapped apart one by one, revealing pale tree-trunk thighs. His belly inched outward, covering more and more of his lap. His long sleeves began to go the same way as his jeans, tearing apart starting at the wrists then moving upward. The front of his shirt slid upward toward his growing pecs and exposed his increasingly cavernous belly button. 2D kicked off his too-tight sandals as a second chin inflated beneath his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe singer's goal of 400 came and went, and 2D continued to grow. His clothes grew more and more tattered, stitches popping along his sides. Love handles drooped over 2D's waistband, which was beginning to cut into his sides. However the singer was too hungry to do more than grunt in pain and shift off the edge of his bed. He slid to the floor with a thump, and the waistband of his trousers burst open, revealing a butt that was squeezed into a red pair of too-tight undies. His hunger finally began to slow to a halt and 2D set the box aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" he moaned, slowly clambering to his feet. \"I'm stuffed...\" 2D huffed and puffed as he pulled all 500 pounds of his body upright. The singer wobbled slightly as his girth readjusted to the new position while the torn remains of his pants slipped to the floor. Carefully stepping out of them, 2D experienced the sensation of his fat thighs rubbing against each-other. \"Well, that's something new...\" he admitted, waddling his way to the bathroom, still panting slightly from exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2D squeezed his way into the now-cramped lavatory, his hips brushing the doorframe. Standing on the scale revealed that he had nearly grown too big to see the glowing red digits. \"Whoa...\" the singer commented, slightly shocked. \"I gotta weigh a quarter-ton. Certainly feels like it!\" He patted his belly, which jiggled and rippled in response. \"Hehe! Though I might need some new clothes...\" the male added, feeling the cool air on his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2D took the elevator up, pulling his belly close to him, with the intention to find either Murdoc or the spellbook and get them to give him bigger clothes.</span></div></div>",

Nothing stopped the constant pain. He was out of ideas. He turned over onto his back and looked down at his bare chest. So fucking thin. Why? Its not like he had to be. Ya know food was an option for after bad break ups. He knew that. He had called Paula and asked why she did it she said she wanted someone with more to handle her. Well if he was bigger there would be more of him. Yeah! It already lightened his mood. He wouldn't want to do it alone... And he's definitely not gonna ask someone from the band. Talk about Awk-ward. Time to go to the next source. The internet. He found a site and found a specific profile. It had a phone number and he dialed it quickly. <br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Answered a sweet sounding girl voice. <br>\r\n\"Oh, uhmm Hi.\" 2D replied in an awkward tone<br>\r\n\"Your looking to get fattened up huh?\" <br>\r\n\"Uhh yea. I mean... Well.. Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Great I'll come over tonight could I get an address?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh Kong Studios.

Before he knew it it was 8:00 and the door to his room was getting knocked on. <br>\r\n\"Coming one second!\" He said pulling on a Hello Kinky T-Shirt. He swung open the door to reveal a thin, busty, and beautiful girl with big blue eyes and blonde curly hair. She had a blue tank top and grey shorts which were a bit to short.<br>\r\n\"Can I come in?\" She asked in the same tone she had on the phone.<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh yea!\" <br>\r\nShe stepped in the room and looked around,<br>\r\n\"So um. How is this gonna work?\" 2D asked scratching his neck.<br>\r\n\"Well I have loads of food in the Semi Truck outside, you just go ahead and make your self comfortable I'm gonna bring in the first course. She said with a wink.<br>\r\n\"O-o-okay.\" He said his voice breaking. He went over to his bed and laid down. In a minute or two he saw her coming back in with 2 big boxes. <br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" She said setting them on his chest. He licked his lips and tore open one of the boxes. It had 2 dozens of Chocolate cupcakes. He grabbed one in each hand and horfed them down.<br>\r\n\"Might I ask the starting weight?\" The girl asked sitting on the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n\"190\" He said through loud bites of cupcakes. <br>\r\n\"Ok and your goal is?\"<br>\r\n\"Until you run out of food.\" She looked at him and raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"I know what I'm doing trust me.\" She chuckled and looked back to the clip board.<br>\r\n\"Ok... So do you want to include... sexual activities?\" She asked looking back over to him.<br>\r\n\"M-m-maybe...\" He said winking. <br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" She said looking back to the clipboard. <br>\r\n2D gobbled down the rest of the cupcakes and went to the next box. He ripped it open to reveal a huge tub of rocky-road ice-cream. He grinned and grabbed the spoon connected to the box. He swallowed bite after bite. He could feel his belt and t-shirt slowly getting tight. He grinned. The whole situation was turning him on. The woman hovered above him. <br>\r\n\"Could ya go any faster?\" She said looking bored. 2D looked at her questionably.<br>\r\n\"Uhhmm... *Smack* I Think *Slurp* So.\"<br>\r\nHe put the spoon to the side and stuck his face in the ice-cream forcibly eating large amounts. He was about halfway through and he could feel his shirt ridding up to reveal a pale doughy flesh beneath it.  She felt warm hands pushing up against his stomach lightly and then they began rubbing around in circles. He pulled his face out to watch her for a second but she grabbed his head from the back and pushed it back down into the ice-cream. She straddled him and began massaging as his T-shirt went up higher and higher and the doughy stomache slowy spread out on his lap.</span></div></div>",

Decent grammar and spelling are required. I'm not talking English major, just... it won't be a story if you can't read it!<br>\r\n2. Any form of weight gain is permitted! Science, magic, or even classic over-eating. Heck, even a combo is allowed after you progress far enough!<br>\r\n3. The Blue whale is the heaviest animal on earth, weighing in at 300,000 pounds (150 tons). This is the weight limit. Do not exceed it! Chapters that do will be removed!<br>\r\n4. Any \"suddenly [character] weighed 10000 pounds!\" like chapters will be removed. This is not debatable and is bad story-telling.<br>\r\n5.
