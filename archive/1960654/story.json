So he gets dressed and heads downtown to one of their favorite places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gets there he gets a table and begins looking over the menu, moments later he gets a txt saying, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looks up to see her walking in the door with a big smile on her face, but he cant help but notice that she has ah\u2026 put on a little weight here and there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then tries not to look surprised as he gets up to give her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, ah it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah good to see you too, you haven\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d She says, \u201cAh thanks, ah neither have you\u2026\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sit down and begin talking, you know the usual small talk stuff, and then the waitress comes to take their order. Michael orders a burger with fries while Lilli orders a salad. Which he thought was weird because he had never seen her eat a salad before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After the waitress leaves the conversation shifts to the salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I never thought I\u2019d see you eat a salad.\u201d He says jokingly, \u201cYea me neither, but as im sure you\u2019ve noticed I could stand to lose a few pounds.\u201d She says with a sigh looking down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh no you don\u2019t you look great to me.\u201d He says trying not to look directly into her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on you have been looking at me funny ever since I walked in.\u201d she says, \u201cAh yea because I haven\u2019t seen you in a while\u2026\u201d he says, \u201cDon\u2019t even try that Mike, and this is all your fault!\u201d she exclaims quietly as to not draw attention from other tables, \u201cWhen we broke up I was in my apartment for a month eating ice cream, and since I wasn\u2019t working out like normal this happened!\u201d she said gesturing down to her belly, hips, thighs and butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow hey I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says taking a deep breath, \u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating because I can\u2019t eat what I want anymore and no matter how hard I try the weight just won\u2019t go away.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll get there.\u201d he says, \u201cYea I know, but the reason I came is to give you this.\u201d she says handing him a small box out of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks, \u201cNothing much, I just saw it and thought of you.\u201d She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he open the box there is a blinding flash of light and when it clears he is sitting across from an unfamiliar guy smiling at him. He then notices that the seat feels softer and cushier then before, he then looks down to see that is because of his larger thighs and butt! He then turns to the window to see his reflection, he is now a woman!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see within that flash of light we traded pretty much everything about us, and reality changed so everyone thinks this is how it\u2019s always been. But you will figure all that out later the important thing is it is a temporary situation based swap, in our world breaking up with you made me gain all that weight, but now in this world you are the one that turned to ice cream and microwave dinners after we broke up. So if you stick to YOUR diet and exercise you will lose the weight for me then we swap back.\u201d He says as the waiter brings a burger and fries for him and a salad for Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow this looks great, I haven\u2019t had a burger in weeks.\u201d He says, \u201cWait what?\u201d Michael says confused, \u201cYea in this world you ordered the salad, you\u2019re on a diet remember.\u201d He says<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stephanie, however, is in danger of failing both science and math, and she thinks that by trading with Mark until after graduation, he'll be able to pass her classes for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2) Jessica Keller has been her husband Tom's trophy wife for years. As Jessica approaches her mid 30s, her husband has been pushing her to consider plastic surgery.... she's put on a few pounds, and he's always wanted her to consider a few other 'enhancements.' Jessica finally agrees to it.... but he has to live her life through the surgery, and until she's completely healed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3) Susan Douglas has been having a rough time of it. She's spent the past several years doggedly climbing the corporate ladder, and at last her dream job was in sight. Only two things were in her way... first, there was Alan Rand, who was competing for the same job. Second was Martin Ross, the Executive VP who was in charge of the job. He'd been dropping hints that she would have to sleep with him to beat Alan out, and she didn't want to do that. She wants to swap with Alan... if he can get her the job, then they will swap back, and he can at least have his life back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 4) Vivian Lee is a hard working single mother of two school age children. Her boss, Aaron Hall is not only five years younger than her, but lives a playboy life style, dating frequently and moving from one beautiful woman to the next. He keeps telling Vivian that she should put herself out there more, and that her life would be less stressful with someone to share it with. She plans to swap with him until he can find a decent boyfriend for her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica had finally reached the point where she'd had enough. Enough of Tom's nagging, enough worrying that he was banging secretaries and floozies on his 'business trips.' Enough worrying that she'd find herself and her son out on the streets with a freshly signed divorce decree and a prenup that she wished she'd never signed shoved in her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwelve years ago, when she'd been twenty two and foolish, she'd though Tom was the greatest catch in the world. Sure, he was ten years older than her, but that only made him seem like so much better of a catch than the losers she'd been dating. He'd been strong, confident, independent and already wealthy. He'd taken her to nice restaurants, bought her nice things to wear, took her on fancy trips, and he always told her how beautiful she was. When he asked her to marry him, less than a year after they met, she'd been too over the moon to worry about the minor legal details that 'his lawyer insisted on.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, slowly, things had changed. Oh the first five years had been wonderful, and he'd said that he was in no hurry to have children. She'd been slim, athletic with perky B-cup breasts and a figure that came from a love of active hobbies. He'd delighted in showing her off, taking her on cruises where she soaked up the sun until she developed a pleasant bronzed tan that complimented her naturally wavy dark hair. He'd reveled in taking her dancing, where she could show off her long legs and 5'9\" figure as they strode across the floor. Those had been enchanted days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he'd started to feel his age a bit, and the desire for a child to pass the family business on to was becoming stronger than the desire to have a trophy wife with a figure unspoiled by pregnancy. Even then, it had taken two years of trying, with business trips constantly at war with her own cycle and the best times to conceive. Finally, at twenty nine, they had conceived, and she gave birth to their son Hamish. That had been five years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, she'd felt more and more like a trophy mom than trophy wife. The pregnancy had been hard on her, and she'd spent too much time on bed rest, both before and after delivering. Then, during Hamish's first two years, she'd insisted in taking care of him directly, and refused Tom's offer to hire a nanny. Finally, she'd given in on that, and taken some of her own time back. But... the years had done their work, and she wasn't the stunning slim woman at thirty two that she was at twenty nine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when Tom started dropping hints. He had an old college buddy who was a surgeon, he'd say, who could set her up with one of those 'mommy makeovers' and help her get back on track. Jessica had refused. She'd begged off, saying she just needed to get back out to the tennis court, and work on her diet more. The taste she'd acquired while pregnant for things that were both deep fried and salty hadn't left her after Hamish was born, and that too had had an impact on her figure. The excuse worked for a time, but six months later, when she'd made little progress towards 'getting back into shape,' Tom started hinting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time though, it was a little worse. He'd mention the 'mommy makeover,'  and then he'd follow it up with a casual statement of something more. \"You know, while he's at it, he could probably do a little work on your breasts.... fill them up a little more...\" Or he'd make another comment: \"Did you know they do permanent makeup now? I bet that'd save you some time in the mornings....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor over a year this had gone on. Meanwhile, his business trips became more frequent, and when he came home, he seemed even less interested in sex. She couldn't prove he was having an affair, but even if he wasn't, how much longer would it be until he was? She had to do something. Finally, she'd found her answer. A magic that would let her put him in her shoes. She'd found her way out of the pickle, one way or another, things would get better.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In this story we will be using either a fairly original TG concept or a far underutilized one, which will first require one of my long detailed explanations.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nIt all started when I was discussing ideas for a TG comic with an artist friend of mine on deviantART. I didn't want a standard body swap or transformation, though both of them are classics and the very foundation of TG. But we decided to combine both of them and take it a step farther, calling it a transformation swap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example take a guy and a girl. The guy is a 15 year old high school student and the girl is 22 year old college student. If the two of them were to transform swap then the guy would transform into the 22 year old female version of himself and the girl would turn into the 15 year old male version of herself. Not only that but as far as the rest of the world is concerned this is how things have always been and they pick up each other\u2019s lives were they left off. If she had a tattoo, now he has one, if he has a part time job then they will be expecting the new her to show up for it. And just for fun let\u2019s say the two of them are connected now, if she losses her job while they are swapped then he will not have it when they swap back, or if he gets his nose pierced as here then she will have it when they swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally I love this idea and can\u2019t believe it isn't being used more, and if it is I haven\u2019t seen it so I\u2019m going to be the first that I know of to bring this kind of swap to Writing.com. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not going to worry about rules this time so just have fun with it, though I reserve the right to delete anything that I believe to be inappropriate or a pointless filler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy :)<br>\r\n</td>",
