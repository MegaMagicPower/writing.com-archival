He would only grow to a maximum height of 6 inches tall, the doctors had said. His parents didn\u2019t want to believe them, but it turned out to be true nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout most of his life his parents kept him home for fear of what might happen to him. It wasn\u2019t until he was fifteen years old that they decided to let him go out and experience life. They signed him up to Brookesville High School. You might think that sending a 6-inch kid to a public high school is just asking for trouble, but there were a few things going for the little guy. His physical condition came with a couple perks. As far as he could tell, he could not be harmed. He\u2019d fallen into water before he could swim, but didn\u2019t drown. He had been crushed by heavy objects multiple times, but was never injured. Nothing could hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, to add on top of that, he was very good looking. He had perfect complexion and a face that looked like it came straight from Hollywood. He thought that his looks alone would send him through high school with little to no issues. And he was right to begin with. He made sure to say exactly the right thing in just the right way to get people to like him. He was one of the popular kids, despite his size, and that was all he cared about. His reputation was everything to him, but it was only a matter of time before everything got ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so begins this story, with Jack waking up and getting ready for school, completely unaware of the terrible things about to happen to him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack opened up his closet to get dressed, scanning the options. Much to his disappointment, the only shirts that were clean were black or grey. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t mind wearing these, but not in public. He strictly only wore bright eye-catching colors, which let others see him more easily and avoid causing any sort of accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe guessed that his mother must have forgotten to do his laundry last week. He\u2019d have to make sure she stayed on top of that, but today, there was nothing else he could do about it except wear what he had. With a sigh, he pulled out a plain grey shirt and put it on, along with his other clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything was packed and ready, he marched up to the front door. Down at the bottom, there was a small cutout where a miniature door, more his size, was installed. This was built once his mom decided he could have more freedoms. He never used the door, other than to head outside to the bus stop, but he was still glad that he had the ability to leave whenever he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling open the door, he wandered out into the driveway and onto the sidewalk. From here, it was only a fifteen minute walk to the bus stop. He picked up the pace a little, not wanting to miss the bus. He\u2019d made that mistake once, and his mother was not very happy. She was always looking for some excuse to keep him at him and take away all of his responsibilities. If he missed it a second time, she could very well pull him out of school and force him to stay home. And he couldn\u2019t have that. The only friends he had were from the school. If he had to stay home, he\u2019d only have his mom and sisters for company forever. Now that sounded like a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about a minute away, he could hear the bus pull up to the stop and the doors open. Jack instantly started sprinting the rest of the way. He couldn\u2019t see the bus, since the sidewalk was lined with relatively tall bushes. \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d He cried out, hoping that the driver could hear him. \u201cDon\u2019t leave, I\u2019m almost there!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The driver inside tapped his finger on the steering wheel impatiently, frowning at Jack as he approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaking your time today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving his hand in dismissal after he pulled himself up the last step. \u201cI\u2019m always on time. You\u2019re just early.\u201d Jack continued down the isle until he reached his regular seat. Throwing his back up, he then climbed up the side to join it. Once in place, the bus started moving again to the next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few minutes later, the bus cam to a stop again and the doors opened. Several kids entered the bus, chatting noisily to each other. Most of them sat down in the first empty seats near the front, but one of them, a young blond girl was walking right towards his seat. He cleared his throat subtly to draw her attention, just in case she didn\u2019t see him, but she made no indication of noticing him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The massive jean-clad butt presented itself above him. He\u2019d almost enjoy the view if he wasn\u2019t so scared. Luckily for him, though, the girl continued shimmying down until she reached the adjacent seat by the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed heavily, glad that this didn\u2019t turn into a situation. Once his hear rate had slowed down a bit, he turned to say high, but immediately saw her purse rushing towards him, falling directly on top of him. He didn\u2019t even have time to say a word before the bag dropped down and smothered him. He had no idea what was inside the bag, but it was heavy. He couldn\u2019t even shift his arms underneath the weight. He tried yelling, but barely any sound made it through the thick fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack cursed under his breath. This was all his mom\u2019s fault for not washing his bright shirts. At least this was better than being sat on, but it was still unpleasant and a little embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid there, unable to move, and grumbling to himself about how ignorant his mother was, the bus hit a rather large pothole in the road and the whole bus lurched into the air, sending the purse almost a foot off the seat of the couch. Jack initially though that he was free from underneath, but then, as the purse fell back down, it tipped over and the open bag fell mouth-first back on top of him. All the contents fell and battered him from every angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d He heard the girl next to him say. \u201cLearn how to drive!\u201d The bag was then pulled off of him, but now his situation was even worse. Nearly his entire body was covered by the various contents, obscuring him from her vision. He could just barely see the giant hand come down and start brushing him, along with everything else, back into the purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait a second!\u201d Jack tried to tell her, but she shoved him into the bag and piled more stuff on top of him. In just a few seconds, everything was back inside and she zipped the bag shut to avoid the spill from happening again. \u201cGreat. This is just great.\u201d He groaned. Not only was he trapped underneath a heavy pile of stuff, which was a little painful on its own, but he was trapped with no way to get out. There was no way he\u2019d be able to operate the zipper from this side of the bag, even if he could manage to find a way out from underneath all this junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, he knew that struggling would be completely pointless, just serving to waste his energy. So he stayed still in the pitch black confines of the purse, every once in a while screaming as loud as he could, hoping to get the girl\u2019s attention, but as far as he could tell, not a single soul heard him. All he could do was wait and hope she opens the bag and lets him out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack could hear the sounds of students talking and laughing in the halls of his high school, all of them preparing for class. The bag that he was stuck in was swinging back and forth to the girl\u2019s movements. All of the sudden, he could hear a door being pushed open and then all the voices disappeared. What was going on? Jack wondered. Were they in a classroom? No, that can\u2019t be it. He should still be able to hear classmates talking if that were the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed still, trying to listen to what was going on. Before long, the mouth of the bag opened up and revealed the girl\u2019s massive hand reaching in. She rummaged around in the bag before finding what she was looking for. Her fingers curled around the object and began pulling it out, but she was unaware that on the underside of the object, she had accidentally grabbed him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what was going on, he decided to stay still and wait. As she was lifting he out, her hand slipped and both he and the thing she grabbed began falling. He winced as he prepared for a hard impact with the floor, but that didn\u2019t happen. He landed on a soft elastic surface and the other item from the bag landed right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack saw her hand reaching down from above to grab what she dropped, so he quickly crawled to the side and waited until her hand disappeared. The girl pulled her hand away and everything went quiet. That was a close one. He didn\u2019t know what would have happened if she grabbed him, but whatever it was, it couldn\u2019t have been good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to take a look around at his surroundings to figure out where he was exactly. Instantly, he realized and he became very uncomfortable. He could tell by the thin walls that he was in a bathroom stall. Turning around, sure enough, he could see the girl\u2019s legs on both sides of him leading all the way up to the top of a toilet where her vagina was unknowingly exposed to him. He was sitting in her panties that were currently around her ankles and the girl had no idea he was there. She was too busy with a little mirror, touching up her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, he had to get out of here now. Things could go really wrong really fast. If she found him, he\u2019s pretty much dead. She would think he was a pervert and punish him. Not wanting to find out what kind of punishment she was capable of dealing, he quickly tried to push himself up onto his feet, but something was wrong. His foot was caught on a bunch of loose threads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack quickly tugged as hard as he could, trying to get free, but he was really tangled up. To make matters worse, the girl finished what she was doing, tossed her makeup kit into her purse and began lifting panties back up. You could now see the entirety of her huge ass moving towards you at an alarming rate!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
