Has white hair and purple eyes. <br>\r\nPersonality: A kind hearted soul with a philosophical, inquisitive view of life. He feels tremendously guilty for what happened to his home and thus will be the first to spring up to defend the downtrodden, often disregarding his own life's safety in the process.<br>\r\nOrigin: A distant Outrealm, now destroyed.<br>\r\nBio: His home world was destroyed by a horde of dark dragons when he was in his younger teens. His hair and eyes were once both brown but were mysteriously changed when he barely escaped a dark dragon's breath. He found an Outrealm gate and ran through it, never looking back at his destroyed home. He's been wandering the seemingly infinite Outrealms and the various worlds that are attached to them ever since.<br>\r\nRace: Human<br>\r\nClass: Tactician (Level 18)<br>\r\nUses: Swords (Level C) and Tomes (Level D)<br>\r\nAsset and Weakness: HP and Resistance, respectively<br>\r\nEquipment: Killing Edge, Elfire, and a Concoction or two<br>\r\nSkills: Ignis<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTactician's Companions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Roy<br>\r\nAge: Unknown; looks to be about 17 years old<br>\r\nAppearance: Approximately 5 foot 10, on the thin side but rather muscular nonetheless. Has bright red hair and azure blue eyes.<br>\r\nPersonality: A thoughtful, just, and cunning fellow. He often has to be the one that holds Tyre back from running headlong into danger like a crazed maniac.<br>\r\nOrigin: Lycia on the continent of Elibe<br>\r\nBio: He was once a great hero and king of his homeland who saved his world from a tyrant and a demonic dragon. Tyre knew very little about Einherjar cards when he chanced upon one of Roy's cards, accidentally summoning Roy's soul from across great chasms of space and time. Though Tyre had been told that Einherjar were merely husks of the people they represent, Roy seems to be as rational and engaging as most people. His body is flesh and blood and indistinguishable from any other aside from the odd bluish glow. Tyre considers him a real person and Roy considers this the opportunity to start a new, adventurous life. The two have been traveling together for about 2 years.<br>\r\nRace: Einherjar<br>\r\nClass: Mercenary (Level 16)<br>\r\nUses: Swords (Level C)<br>\r\nEquipment: Roy's Blade, Steel Sword, and a Concoction<br>\r\nSkills: Sol, Aegis<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Anna<br>\r\nAge: Unknown; looks to be in her twenties or so<br>\r\nAppearance: Approximately 5 foot 11, athletic and curvy. Has brick red hair and red eyes.<br>\r\nPersonality: She has two sides; one side is mysterious to a fault, the other side has a greater lust for gold than a leprechaun. She's quite clever and has a knack for coming up with massively punny catchphrases. Buried beneath her greedy, cocky, cute exterior is the sense of justice of a saint, though she will never admit it.<br>\r\nOrigin: Unknown<br>\r\nBio: She is one of the many, many Anna's running around the various Outrealms. The reason for the massive number of Anna's is, as she says, \"a Secret\". She took a liking to Tyre and Roy when they saved a number of villages she was doing business in on multiple occasions. She joined the two in their travels because \"There's profit in following you boys.\" Both Roy and Tyre agree that it is incredibly handy having an Anna around and Tyre secretly has a massive crush on her.<br>\r\nRace: Human (supposedly)<br>\r\nClass: Trickster (Level 1)<br>\r\nUses: Swords (Level C) and Staves (Level D)<br>\r\nEquipment: Steel Sword, Mend, and an Elixir<br>\r\nSkills: Open locks, extra movement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, where are we this time?\" asked Tyre to his friends after stepping through the blue portal and thereby completing his transit from another Outrealm. He surveyed the land around them. There were mountains in the distance and trees in groves separated by long, large fields of grass. They were not too far from a well worn stone road. In short, there was very little to tell this realm from the countless others the three of them had visited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps a place that isn't overrun by Risen for once?\" asked Roy hopefully, \"or Entombed, or evil dragons, or bandits, or tyrannical empires that we just <i>have </i>to save the world from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we helped those people,\" protested Tyre, \"what would you rather do, leave them condemned to follow a guy who liked to wear pink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not,\" replied Roy. His azure eyes studied the world around them, \"It's just, for once can we please not get involved in the affairs of this Outrealm and just enjoy it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyre laughed a little, \"Sure, Roy, I'll try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna put each her arms around the two guys. Her left arm wrapped around Roy and the attached index finger still managed to glue itself to her chin. \"If you boys are done arguing, why don't I suggest we try this road up here? It looks charming enough, all open and oozing the potential of leading to massive profits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyre barely suppressed a groan at the mention of the word \"profits\" but still realized Anna had a point. Roy seemed to agree, \"Sure, seems the easiest direction if we're to find out the lay of this land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them then started walking down the road... </span></div></div>",

They'd not seen much on the road yet aside from a picturesque natural landscape and found little reason to stop their travel thus far. \"Hey look! There's someone on the road ahead,\" pointed out Anna in her usual peppy tone. Roy and Tyre followed Anna's well manicured index finger (her other index finger, as her left was still on her chin) and saw the figure, still a good quarter mile distant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we know this place is populated still,\" said Tyre, \"that's a good thing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends,\" said Roy, \"on whether this figure is friend or foe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, c'mon, Roy,\" said Tyre, \"bad guys hardly ever travel alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think he's alone?\" asked Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy, you worry to much,\" said Anna cheerfully, \"must be that old age of yours!\" Roy cocked an eyebrow at this but Anna continued, \"Whoever this guy is, I'm sure I'll make him a happy customer one way or another, hehehe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That only makes me worry even more, Anna,\" replied Roy to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drew closer to the mysterious person, Tyre got a glimpse of his weapons. He had a killing edge, modified quite a bit, a brave sword, a tomahawk, and Tyre could feel this man's aura, strong in the forces of magic. Tyre perceived him to be very powerful, more than enough to pulverize both Tyre and his friends easily. Tyre decided to be friendly for now, hoping that this man wanted no trouble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hail, traveller!\" greeted Tyre warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious man looked at the threesome, \"Well met,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone else could say anything, Anna blurted out, \"Ooh, nice weapons!\" Her friends gave very dirty looks to her, making her blush a bit when she saw their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed at this, \"Yes, I suppose they are,\" he said at that.</span></div></div>",

So what are you doing here?\" Jacob then felt something on his belt move as he turned to see Anna poking the Brave Sword he had there. He pulled it out, causing each of them to tense up as Roy almost attacked him, when Jacob then turned the handle of the sword to Anna. \"Here, it's yours.\" Anna took it and started looking at it's quality. \"So, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

What can you tell us about this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyre,\" warned Roy, still not libel to trust the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy,\" responded Tyre, \"Jacob here just gave away to one of the greediest people in all the Outrealms one of the rarest sword types, worth a good 3000 gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tyre,\" said Anna, \"you sly me! Besides, you know I'm going to charge 6000 gold for this... or 7!

He rummaged quite a bit, shifting around Vulunaries, Concoctions, and the Miniature Lance Tyre found randomly one day a few weeks back. \"Oh damnit, I'm out of Rift Doors!\" he said. He turned to Jacob, \"Is there an Outrealm Gate in this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Jacob.

Business opportunities!!\" cried Anna with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" said Tyre, side glancing Anna for a moment, \"provided Anna doesn't anger the village chief by making him pay way too much for a 'variety pack' of Vulunaries and Sweet Tinctures...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, his loss, my gain,\" pointed out Anna with a particularly devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and we had to hop three Outrealms to loose him,\" said Roy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob laughed at this, \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nodded, \"It may be funny now, but it wasn't then.\" Jacob laughed even harder...</span></div></div>",

He'd been traveling through gates like these for 4 years or so and he still didn't have quite a full grasp of how they worked or how to control them. Sure, there was an entire guild of Outrealm Gate guides, but a lot of them were either Anna's or extremely old. Tyre only knew the basics of the operation of the Gate. Pondering, he tried to choose something in particular the way Old Hubba had once showed him and he crossed the blue threshold, soon followed by Roy. A small way afterwards Anna and Jacob entered as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that?\" asked Tyre discreetly to Roy as the two floated through the streaming blue vortex that traversed the various Outrealms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Roy, \"Anna hugging Jacob?\" Tyre nodded, \"Oh, right, you have a crush on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she and him...\" he raised his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's a human being, isn't she?\" asked Roy, \"I mean, supposedly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I... I've had a crush on her for the longest time,\" Tyre lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't fast enough,\" said Roy, \"it doesn't help that you've never bought anything at her shop either... Don't worry, there's other Anna's in the sea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyre laughed, \"Thanks, Roy,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other side of the vortex to another Outrealm approached. They crossed the threshold into another, new Outrealm...</span></div></div>",

He looked over to Anna who was looking over her multiple pouches and packs when they finally exited the same way Roy and Tyre did. As soon as Jacob landed, he was caught by a breeze of a Risen swinging a sword near his face. Jacob stumbled back for a moment before launching himself into the air, unsheathing Muramasa, and bringing it down on him, destroying him as he dissipates into a purple-dark smoke. Anna landed behind him as she came through the portal and he turned to see he landed between the Risen and Roy. \"I must say this is already some fun,\" Jacob said humorously.

He picked up the ranged axe off the ground soon thereafter at the spot where the fallen Risen had previously dissipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyre pulled out his Elfire tome and watched as two more Risen were annihilated by fire elevating seemingly from the ground below them. He looked to his side and found Roy had paired himself up with him. \"Not bad, Tyre,\" he praised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be protecting the others?\" asked Tyre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna's paired herself up with Jacob,\" stated Roy idly. He then dealt death to a Risen with his signature blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" asked Tyre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to where Anna and Jacob where. \"We're on commission,\" stated Anna proudly to Jacob before he lit a Risen ablaze with what seemed to be a bolt of fire from the sky. Anna then attacked another Risen but fumbled and missed. The Risen then lunged at her. Jacob at that point pushed her out of the way and saved her from getting hit. \"You get a discount!\" she cried happily at Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuugh,\" Tyre groaned, \"she's supporting him. This really sucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyre, do I have to repeat myself?\" asked Roy, slicing another Risen that tried to lunge at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" replied Tyre, \"'There's other Anna's in the sea' or whatever... But do any of those Anna's swing a sword all sexy like that?\" He torched another Risen, this one an archer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy laughed, \"How much you want to bet? Just how many Anna's have we encountered, Tyre?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost count at 53, I think,\" answered Tyre honestly. \"Yes, Roy, I get what you're saying. That doesn't change the fact that it makes me sick in the worst way to see the girl of my dreams hitting on another guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, you've got it bad, Tyre,\" admitted Roy. The two friends came upon an Entombed. Its dour look upon its almost fake looking face and yellow body seemingly made of canvas or something similar confirmed its identity. \"Man, I hate these things,\" said Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love them,\" said Tyre, \"lots of experience fighting them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you say,\" said Roy. Both held their swords tight at the sides of their face before lunging identically towards their adversary. It dodged the attack but it's own pathetic attempt at slicing the two of them failed when they themselves dodged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyre felt an increase of power as again his Killing Edge trailed purple light. He came around behind the creature and called to Roy, \"Here's how it's done!\" before he struck the creature square in the back before it could turn to face him. Dissolving into purple, the creature was ended. \"Right,\" said Tyre. He felt a surge of strength, skill, speed, and luck wash over him once more but he felt as if he'd reached the pinnacle of his talents at that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you've maxed your abilities out?\" asked Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyre looked over, \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have too, I think,\" said Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it looks like it's time for those seals,\" said Tyre with a smile. He went into the 'convoy' bag and pulled out two Master Seals. They looked like golden gyroscopes and were about the size of a grapefruit. Tyre handed one to Roy and another to himself. They both held the seals in both hands and concentrated hard; Roy on being a heroic warrior and Tyre on being a grandmaster tactician. The seals lit up and flew out of the two's hands. Light engulfed Roy and Tyre and when it died down, Tyre was dressed in a more regal looking version of his hooded trench coat and he sported some armor pieces. Roy now had an extension to his arm mounted shield, looking stronger and larger, and he sported a chest plate and shoulder plates over his tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! It's been far too long since I've felt this sensation!\" cried Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so awesome!\" cried Tyre. He was giddy with excitement. When he finally calmed down, he noticed how quiet it was now and found after quick investigation that the entire army of Risen had been vanquished. \"Wow, that was quick,\" he remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were dozens of them,\" said Roy, \"it shouldn't have been that quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We took care of the rest,\" called Jacob as he and Anna went to meet Tyre and Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them?\" asked Tyre. Jacob nodded. \"That's intense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I don't know my own strength?\" asked Jacob sheepishly. Anna giggled at this. \"Ah, you've promoted,\" added Jacob, \"congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Roy and Tyre in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in any case, thank you for finishing the battle so quickly, Jacob,\" said Roy, \"now we can find out where we are, if possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" nodded Tyre, \"let's spread out and see what we can find in these ruins. If anybody finds something... or ends up unlocking a whole army of bad guys, <i>please </i>call for back up. Nobody needs to be the hero here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except me,\" stated Roy with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a little different,\" retorted Tyre. Roy laughed. The four of them split up and soon discovered...</span></div></div>",

He soon found a large doorway midway through the hall. Jacob approached it with Muramasa unsheathed and looked around the corner. He saw a small girl, 7 or 8 years old, pick up a small wooden-looking box. Jacob knew already had this story ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged in to try and stop her, but she already opened it, and was immediately attacked by a Risen with an axe. Jacob jumped inbetween the two and blocked the attack. \"Checkmate!\" He yelled as he drove his sword through it's chest. He looked over at the terrified little girl and looked at the corners of the dark room to see the eyes of more Risen. \"You remember the way you came through kid?\" She nodded and didn't need to be told what to do as she ran away. Jacob quickly dispersed the few Risen archers and Barbarians in the room. \"Hm. I thought a reeking box would've summoned more.\" Jacob said questionably. Then one more Risen appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe towered over Jacob, he had a blindfold in his face, armor strapped across his body, painful shards of misc things sticking out of him as this Risen carried a Brave Lance. \"Could use some help here!\" Jacob yelled through the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they didn't hear me...But I can probably kill you still.\" Jacob said, acting somewhat cocky. He jumped above the Risen Chief and brought the blade down on it's chest in a slice that left a large wound in his body. Suddenly, Jacob's body lit up in pain. He almost fell as pain shot across his entire body. He looked at his chest and saw a wound identical to the one he just inflicted on this Risen. Jacob then realized this Risen Chief had Counter. The Chief lunged his Brave Lance at Jacob, who dodged the first one but his hit near the hip on the second try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob fell back as the Chief got closer readying his lance, he raised his lance for the finishing blow. But Jacob already raised his hand and the tome as a fireball struck the Risen Chief as he burst into flames and disappeared in a misty fog. Jacob barely made it to his feet as he left, holding the wound on his chest with his entire arm. Jacob had no vulneries, concoctions no elixirs to heal himself with. \"Should've stayed a trickster...\" Jacob thought to himself as he passed through the halls holding onto the walls for support as he looked for his party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob wandered and stumbled around until...</span></div></div>",

Who knows if this place could get attacked again, and I'd say we're not in proper fighting shape for something right now.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" said Greg. After that, the two of them started walking off. Jacob couldn't get over a slight limp, but it wasn't too serious. Greg on some occassions had to keep him upright. After they got a good ways from the village, they were about to go over a hill. However, Jacob suddenly stopped and pulled Greg down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! What the?\" started Greg before Jacob shushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet. Look over there.\" said Jacob, pointing forward a bit. Greg looked in that direction and nearly gasped. It was a group of what appeared to be Risen, except these were of a darker color. There weren't many of them, but you could tell they were strong from the aura around them. Next to them was an Outrealm Gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow. What are they?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I think they got to be related somehow. That's the only logical explanation I can see.\" said Jacob. Suddenly, Jacob pulled them both down, as he appeared to see one of the Risen briefly look in their direction. After a second, Greg heard the sound of the Risen entering the gate. Gently looking over the hill, he saw exactly that as every one of the beings jumped into the gate, leaving a bunch of destruction behind them. After they were gone, Jacob pulled them both up, walking slowly towards the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least there wasn't another village here.\" said Jacob. Greg nodded in the affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I wonder where they went. Outrealm Gates are random at best. Who knows which one they are at now.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but there is no other choice.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking at Jacob, Greg looked around the site, seeing bits of pieces of rocks and wood everywhere, like those Risen liked destorying anything even remotely alive. However, as he walked through, he felt his boot step on something different. He looked down to see what appeared to be a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's this?\" he said as he took his boot off the card and picked it up gently, brushing it off lightly. Right as he did, he knew what it was, as he heard legends and rumors of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Einherjar card.\" said Greg in fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the card?</span></div></div>",

However, the books described them as imitations of those people, so they weren't really real. They thought of themselves as the real hero, but they were just copies, losing any experiences they gained when they return to being a card. Greg felt incredibly sorry at that.

He thought back to a while ago when she was summoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Flashback******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg held the Einherjar card up high, trying to fill it up with power. Suddenly, the card began glowing and it flew out of his hand, hovering above ground.

There was Micaiah, wearing her traditional red dress, a light blue aura eminating from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, Greg was captivated.

However, unlike the usual blue hue of the gate, this one was kind of a light red instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got any idea that does?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue.

They had no idea what had happened to him after he went into the Red Gate first. They were running on adrenaline right now and passed right through the gate to a new realm, although Greg passed down to the ground soon afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...that was a bit nasty.\" Greg said before gasping and covering his mouth. Looking down, he saw how much smaller his hands looked. He looked further down, seeing a dark blue and silver assassin's outfit, showing off parts of new assets on his chest. He could feel longer hair, still red, tied at the back of his head. Looking around from \"her\" sitting position, Greg saw that Micaiah had a surprised look and was coming over to help. Shonku on the other hand....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahaha!\" she started laughing, holding her sides in laughter. Greg almost immediately got angry at her, until she saw what she was also laughing at.

Did that red gate do something?\" suggested Micaiah. As Greg shrugged, Jacob was coming to. Long story short, Jacob had the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could destroy that gate for doing this.\" seethed Jacob, not hiding her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be a bad idea. For all we know, it could be your only way back.\" said Micaiah. Then, Greg turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, why are you two still the same?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it only works on guys, or the really reason you experienced.\" said Shonku, having calmed down and helping out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldn't get any wierder.</span></div></div>",

She used one of her thin arms to cover them and pulled a leg across the other, crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, relax. You should get used to it,\" Shonku said helping Jacob stay balanced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob, not enjoying this, decided he should try to if he's gonna be stuck like this for awhile. \"Fine,\" Jacob finally said in her new high, somewhat low-toned voice, \"thanks Shonku.\" Jacob looked over as Micaiah was helping Greg with her new body. Jacob looked over the weapons he brought and saw they were replaced.

Micaiah giggled a bit at Greg's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can look on the bright side, most girls would be envious of you now.\" she said, still giggling. Her sincerity allowed Greg to relax a bit, even laughing a bit herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite what I was hoping to be envied for, but I guess it's a start.\" said Greg, which got both of them laughing. Once they calmed down a bit, Greg spoke again. \"Thanks for the help Micaiah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I'm always happy to help.\" smiled Micaiah. Greg was happy to know that she cared this much, even in the oddest of situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I still look kind of cool in this get-up. But hopefully Karen won't see me like this. That could be bad.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicaiah laughed some more at Greg's statement. \"She'll probably be jealous.\" she said, almost laughing even harder now.

Anyway, let's go in a bit more.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them went a little deeper in, Greg feeling the cool water on her mostly exposed body.

Not nearly like this though, but there is an ocean for swimming and whatnot.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice.\" said Micaiah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg liked seeing Micaiah happy, although she still dreaded the thought of her just being an Einherjar. Greg honestly didn't want her to forget. Honestly, she had grown a bit attached to Micaiah (as a guy to clarify).

Essentially, they were looking for anything. Either they come to the town or the next Outrealm Gate. One or the other anyway.

Jacob's had a shining star on the inside, while Greg's had a mug inside, and they both looked quite perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need some privacy, I'll leave for a bit.\" said the man, who walked past them and out the door, although he was probably waiting just outside. Jacob turned to Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these? I've never seen these before.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. I always knew of special seals that include dread fighter and bride, but these don't seem to go with any of those. I imagine it has something to do with what he said about working around.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are a bit short on coin, although I do have worries.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These female forms are almost becoming too comfortable. What if these seals do something really good?\" asked Jacob. Greg gave her a look of understanding. She often had the same fears lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe something good will come of it. You first.\" said Greg. Jacob sighed, but nodded anyway. She firmly grabbed the star seal and it suddenly began flashing. The light engulfed Jacob, although it wasn't enough to blind Greg. Greg could see shifting around Jacob, and when the light died down, she almost gasped. Gone were the war cleric clothes and now Jacob was wearing a traditional dancer's garb, showing off most of her assets. Each of her clothes were white, and the cloth she now had was white too. A white hairband was on her head as well. She even had two big rings now around her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" gasped Greg. Jacob came back to her senses, and almost immediately tried to cover up, as you could say that the wardrobe was barely more than a bikini in some areas. In addition, Jacob now noticed that she had some better swords: namely a Silver Sword, Killing Edge, and a Brave Sword. Not a bad trade off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, now your turn.\" said Jacob, a little reeling from the change. Nodding tentatively, Greg did the same to her Serve Seal. A light engulfed her too, shifting around her. When the light died, Jacob gasped as well. Greg was now wearing a blue tavern-like dress (that was only knee-length like a Cleric's), some brown boots, a white undertop that covered her breasts where the dress didn't, and some white gloves  that went up her forearm with a gold clasp, similar to the Dancer garb. In addition,Greg noticed some lances in his inventory: a Spear, Silver Lance, and a Beast Killer. Another good trade-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" breathed both of them. They just stared at each other for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....at least you look good.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad yourself.\" said Jacob. Both of them felt awkward at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, might as well head out and do this. That guy is probably tired of waiting by now.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jacob agreed, they both began to walk out.</span></div></div>",

Shonku began laughing and Micaiah giggled along as Greg stopped for a moment to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob wasn't sure how to start, but he suddenly felt impulsed into dancing. She began twirling and jumping as the people cheered more. Jacob concluded as she danced that the seal allowed her to do this. She was incredibly nervous yet able to preform such tricks. After a few minutes she finally ended as the tavern roared cheering. Jacob smiled nervously to the crowd then disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's how it was the rest of the day. Greg served food out to people and Jacob danced for them periodically. Finally Jacob caught a break and was able to get a drink with Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work,\" Greg commented as Jacob smiled and thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the man who hired them walked forward with large bags of gold, containing a few gold bricks and coins. \"They're yours,\" he said, \"you deserve each bit of it.

I've heard of many classes, but I don't think I've ever heard of a Waitress class. Don't think I've seen them often.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I.

Micaiah gave the two a tender smile, happy to see Greg finally reunited with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group settled down there in the ruins, with Karen snugging tightly with Greg.

He walked by Greg and Karen to see Greg with his arms wrapped around her and Karen resting her head on his chest. Jacob smiled at the heartwarming scene, but they would need to keep moving in order to lose the Risen. He walked over and shook Greg slightly, causing him to wake up but not Karen. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should find somewhere else.

His body felt...different unexplainably. He looked at his chest to make sure he wasn't a female. After looking past the new grown fur, he saw he was still a ma- \"F-fur?!\" Jacob yelled as he fell back again. He looked at himself to see he was wearing grey plated armor that didn't cover much of him. He then looked to see the Outrealm Gate and another Taguel in red armor with a small patch of red fur on his head, who he assumed to be Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg awoke dazed and immediately saw Jacob staring at him. Both of them now had large amounts of hair/fur on their heads and bodies. \"This is new...\" Greg added as he looked at himself. He turned and saw the three that were with them were now Manaketes. Karen had a yellow cloak, Micaiah a red dress similar to Tiki's, and Shonku a white dress. The three woke up and long story short freaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they panicked, Jacob reached into a pouch and pulled out a small stone, \"What's thi-\" Before he could finish, a large dome of stone caved above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob!\" Yelled Greg as the stone shook and broke and in it's place stood a Taguel now known as Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" He said as he looked at his rabbit-like form. Everyone was in awe, while Shonku...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh Jacob! You're so cute!\" Shonku ran over and jumped on Jacob's head. Jacob grunted as Shonku petted his fur. And a minute later she had Jacob laying down with her petting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled while Karen and Micaiah laughed. \"Why don't you try, Greg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg transformed a moment later as Karen jumped on his back playfully and Micaiah simply petted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Shonku said, \"We have Dragonstones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three transformed into powerful dragons a few moments later. Karen was a green dragon, Micaiah a pink one, and Shonku a blue one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at each other. \"So what do you think?

A few minutes passed when Jacob appeared on the stage yet again. Karen laughed when she saw Jacob's garbs. Jacob was just as shy as before, bit she just let the uniform do the work as she danced again. They stayed there a good amount of time until it was sunset. Finally Jacob made her way to the table and collapsed in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it,\" Micaiah asked, just out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob just groaned as they finished eating and collected the gold from Jacob's performance. They reached the campsite as Jacob collapsed in the sand. Karen giggled and knelt next to her and tried to massage her shoulders, \"Thanks Jacob. I had fun today. Especially when you danced!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob let out a slight groan and looked up at Karen and smiled,  \"Thanks Karen...feeling better already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

However, he looked down to see that, instead of his Hero outfit, he was wearing a Wyvern Lord's outfit, only it was dark blue like normal. Stumbling around a bit, he saw his friends over to the side. Shonku was wearing a light blue Pegasus Knight outfit. Karen was wearing a dark pink Falcon Knight outfit, with Micaiah having a reddish Dark Flier outfit. Looking to Jacob, he had grey-like Wyvern Lord armor, and he could see all the respective mounds wandering around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother quick look around showed that they were on top of a mountain.

Karen approached the Falcon slowly as she placed her hand gently on it's head. The horse let out a low noise in content as Karen began petting it. Greg had a meeting similar to Jacob's, although his seemed more aggressive than Jacob's as it quickly dug it's head into Greg's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at the scene awestruck when Karen jumped on top of her Falcon. \"What are you doing?!\" Greg yelled in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should ride them and at least get off the mountain.\" Karen replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you aren't going without me,\" Greg countered as he climbed on his Wyvern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob shot a glance to Shonku and Micaiah who were looking at him.

He has short dark brown hair and almost completely white eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Has a real problem with his anger when someones talks badly about his family, but always gives one warning about it whit a glare that could kill after the first bad thing is said. The second time it gets ugly. Only very few friends can talk about that matter freely with him. Apart from that he's a quiet und friendly person. Apart from his friend he barely shows his true emotions to anyone. Has an extrem and unreasonable kindness to children and cant be mad at them (or anyone else when their around), no matter what they do(Also goes for children of manakete even if they are a thousand years or more older than him). He is also unforgiving to those who actully inflict harm to them. Helps everyone aslong as they are willing to ask for his help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrigin: A hardly known village in a distant Outrealm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Lungulus grew up in on of the very few villages where manakete and humans live together. HIs life was like one of the people in books that had a hard time but always ended happy. He had trouble with most other children since they where almost only manakete or a lot older. Since his father was out working almost all the time and his mother had a grave sickniss that would kill her in a few years, he took care of everything regarding the house and other problems which made him far to mature for his age. He always studied inhis free time or learn a little swordsmanship from a friend of his father. When the village was attacked by bandits he was one of the first to show up and help fight them of where his magic tallent was uncoverd. But as fate was never kind the bandits took a girl from the village as a hostage and gave thier demands in return for her. The villagers call for help from the royal army, but they would have taken two weeks to get there. For some reason or another Lungulus felt responsible to help her so he set out finding the bandits hideout. He was able to convince them to believe he wanted join thier group since no one remembered a child fighting them and was taken in. He almost instanly was chosen to take care of the prisioner and gladly did so. Whitin the two weeks bevor the armys arival he threated her as good as he could without the bandits noticing that he was looking for a way to get her out, while they were training him. After a few days of helping the girl he found out she was actully a about 800 years old manakete and her dragonstone was with the bandits stolen treasures. Lungulus got the stone back as the bandits leader allowed him to pick one of treasures for his great learning and keeping the girl quiet fo a while. As the royal army finally showed up at the hideout to get the manakete girl back, Lungulus set the girl free gave her the dragonstone back and they helped defeat the bandits. While the manakete girl was doing most though. In the end it went well and everyone got away alive, but Lungulus was still being lectured by the armies captian for his solo act to save the girl, but got a special skill-teaching book as a reward for his bravery and smart actions. After the whole incident was over and the army group returned to other matters, everything went back to the way it was for Lungulus. For the exception that the manakete girl was trying to befriend him. NO ONE had ever even went to talk with him if it wasen't necessary. But to him she was more like a big sister he could look up to and always rely on. After he opend up to her as time passed and the next years were a time where he was actully happy. A few days befor that all was torn from him, she gave him something no other manakete would do if they didn't trust someone from the heart. It was her dragonstone that she had since her birth, along with the promise to always keep it safe till he would give it back to her. The thing that confused Lungulus about this action the most was that she never told him her name even when they became friends. The next day Lungulus wanted to know what the meaning of this was and went to look for her as a brigth shine came out from the ground and he was suddenly pulled in a wierd blue stream like portal. After a mere few seconds he hit the ground hard and could barely stand up. He saw that he was on an island he didn't know and an old bald man looking at him. The old man was kind and introduce himself as Hubba who had accidently opened a Rift Door and through some magical mishap brought Lungulus to this island. Still completely confused and undeniable suspicious of old Hubba, Lungulus backed off but still keep a conservation going. Hubba wanted to use the Rift Door to summon the mystical cards of the Einherjar, which were the spirits of warrior and heroes of the past. He was suppose to keep them safe, but most of the cards fell in the wrong hands and are now scattered over many outrealms and if the Einherjar are summoned in the wrong way they could, in somekind, go on a berserk like killing spree. As he couldn't gather them all alone he asked Lungulus for help who, even tough was most likely about to go at Hubbas throat, agreed under the condition that Hubba would give him some traveling equipment. After Hubba gave Lungulus some fitting clothes, a little gold and knapsack with a vulnerary, Hubba told Lungulus to wait a minute or two and pulled out one of the few cards that were still in his possesion, giving it to Lungulus. This Einherjar should help him on the task as it was the card of a man named Leonardo, which after old Hubba summoned him for Lungulus has saved his life far to often and held him back when ever he snapped, being the one voice of reason in Lungulus head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Human<br>\r\nClass: Tactician (Level 12)<br>\r\nUses: Swords (Level E) and Tomes (Level C)<br>\r\nAsset and Weakness: Magic and Defense<br>\r\nEquipment: Bronze Sword, Dragonstone, Vulnerary, Celica's Gale, Elthunder<br>\r\nSkills: Despiol, Limit break, Solidarity<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompanions Profiles:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Leonardo<br>\r\nAge: Looks to be just about 17 years old<br>\r\nAppearance: Approximately 5 foot 7, an average build.

He's from time to time the only thing that keeps Lungulus from committing a murder in bright daylight. Always willing to help the weak. Also has taken a liking at making unnecessery, sarcastic comments about Lungulus's sudden personality change when there are children around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrigin: Daien on the continent of Tellius<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Leonardo an archer was of noble birth, who became a member of the Dawn brigade to free the people of Daein from Begnions forceful rule. After Lungulus first heard of Einherjar and recieved Leonardo's card from old Hubba, who also summoned Leonardo. Though Lungulus had read that Einherjar were supposedly mere husk of the person they once were, Leonardo seems to be acting no different than you would normal people would. His body is flesh and blood. The only difference was that he had a barely noticeable bluish glow that only the card holders or other Einherjar could see. For Lungulus Leonardo was a real person and for Leonardo it was a new life with new goals to achieve. The two have been traveling together for about 2 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Einherjar<br>\r\nClass: Archer (Level 16)<br>\r\nUses: Bows (Level B)<br>\r\nEquipment: Steel Bow, Innes' Bow, Pure Water and a Concoction<br>\r\nSkills: Skill +2, Prescience, Discipline<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Anna<br>\r\nAge: Looks to be in her twenties<br>\r\nAppearance: Approximately 5 foot 11, athletic and curvy. Has brick red hair and red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Anna is a mysterious merchant with a greater lust to hoard gold than any dragon. She also has way too many secrets. She takes almost any opportunity too make profit. That she's clever enough too pull off most deals with a happy customer and a bag of gold in her hand. But underneath that greedy, clever and pretty cute exterior, Lungulus believes there is a saints justice since she never tricks commen villagers or steals from someone else than bandits and thiefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrigin: Unknown<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: She is one of the many, many Anna's running around the various Outrealms. Nobody knows why there are so many Anna's and not even Anna herself knows how many there are, but at least she knows she's one of the younger ones. How she knows that? \"A Secret\". Lungulus and Leonardo met Anna when they were chasing a thief that stole some of hers and other merchants goods. As her thanks she gaven a golden card but without tellnig them the use of it. Of course she tried to get them to buy some of her goods with special \"discounts\". After another ruin with the two at a thieves den and Anna seeing the dragonstone Lungulus was carrying around, she immediately was hoping to get it off him to make a little fortune of it, since they were extremly rare in this Outrealm. In the end there was no real deal, but some remaining bandits coming out off their hiding place knocking Lungulus out almost instandly and injuring Leonardo badly. Anna of course took the chance to make profit and convinced Leonardo to give her the stone for some items to fix them back up. Even though Anna went ahead right to one of her sister shops, with a head start of a whole day on Lunglus and Leonardo, to tell her she got the dragonstone she was asked for the moment she had put down the stone in front of her sisters hand a sword was rammed into the counter before she could grab it. Barely missing her hand at that. Lungulus took his dragonstone back before any of the Anna could say a word and replaced in with three small and a medium bullion. The Anna who kind of stole the stone chased after him out of the shop. With bullions stored away of course. She took a liking to his determination and joined them to make some profit. To Leonardo's surprise Lungulus accepted her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Human (supposedly)<br>\r\nClass: Thief (Level 18)<br>\r\nUses: Swords (Level C)<br>\r\nEquipment: Steel Sword, Levin sword and an Elixir<br>\r\nSkills: Locktouch, Movement +1</span></div></div>",

Lungulus and Anna both knew quite a bit of the Einherjar, but this one was new. \"He doesn't seem like a normal Einherjar does he?\" Leonardo inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Lungulus said, \"It does seem odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we gonna do with it?\" Anna said, curious if she made the right choice buying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Turning his head, he saw a man in Tactician robes, a woman with red colorful hair, and a man with yellow hair and archer uniform, who seemed familiar to him. He looked back at the man in tactician robes standing over him and reached a hand out, and said in a raspy voice \"H-help me...pl-please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

After pouring some in Jacob's mouth his - for some reason still existing - wounds healed quick, but he was still too weak to get up on his own. With a little help from Leonardo he moved Jacob up to the fire and laid him against a cliff side they used as cover for the camp. Leonardo handed Jacob a flask with water, while Lungulus tried prepared something that Jacob would be able to eat with what little they had. Anna while smileing counted the gold she made from some deals in town and handed Lungulus some ingredients, when he asked for them. Jacob wanted to help them in someway, but as he tried to stand up he felt Lungulus pushing him against the cliff again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy. Once you had a little rest you can think of a way repay us, 'kay?\" said Lunglus while giving him a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, on the note of pay...\" Anna joined the little conversation with a devious smile. \"You owe an elixer now, Lungu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The most you'll get from me is Concoction. Your elixer still has two uses left you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, but you got your first Einherjar cards! I even let you guys have them for free...\" she said in a sad tone and putting on a heartbroken face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long sigh, disappointed for falling to his own little weakness for Anna he responded: \"Okay, okay, when you our friend over there you get the elixer AND the next bullion i get off an enemy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a complete change in expression and voice Anna gave Lungulus a quick hug and went on too Jacob askin if he needed anything, handing him a blanket and doing whatnot. From the other side of the camp the was a little chuckle heared from Leonardo, who was standing guard scanning the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was amused at the scene, but also startled as he heard about the part with the Einherjar Cards. Not that he could pay it much mind, while Anna was constantly askin how he felt or what he needed. It was a little irritating at the beginning but he got used to it fast. But he couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling he when the cards were mentioned, since he remembered the Einherjars attacking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't took long till the soup Lungulus ended up cooking was finished and they sat down to all eat their share of it. Since Jacob had regained some of his strength he took his part, before sitting down leaning against the cliff again, but didn't eat anything for now.</span></div></div>",

He looked at his body to see his armor and clothes with tears across it. He sat there, not having enough feeling or motivation to eat when Leonardo turned his head toward a forested area. This caught Lungulus's attention. \"What is it Leonardo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo stood and grabbed a bow he had out. \"I'm going to recon out here again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" Lungulus said,\"I'll head out with you. Anna, can you keep him company?\" Lungulus added motioning over to Jacob. Anna nodded smiling and continued eating. Jacob was already tired again, and closed his eyes for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flew open to see a bandit in tattered clothes had Anna down and was frisking her for any goods. As that happened, Jacob saw a larger man with a pelt on his back and a skull of some animal on his head. The man got closer and pulled an iron axe out. Jacob managed to stand with his back propped against the cliff wall. Jacob was ready to just take the blow when he realized there was a weapon on his back, hidden under his coat. Jacob knew what to do that very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited until the man lunged forward and lifted the axe. Jacob then reached from behind, pulled the sword out, threw himself into the bandit chief, stabbing him through the gut. The man fell with a disturbing gurgle of blood as Jacob yanked the sword out of him. Jacob's vision was hazy as he looked at the next man, who let go of Anna and charged at him with a sword. Jacob waited then dropped below his swing and brought the sword through his chest. The man fell next to the chief dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna got up, a scared look crossing her face, \"Wait, if bandits are here then-...Lungulus! Leo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob didn't know where this strength was coming from, but he ran off into the forest as Anna called after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob saw a small opening where Leonardo laid against a tree severely wounded as a man with a bow held an arrow to his neck. Lungulus was down, unconscious. The bandit just finished looting him and was moving towards Leo when Jacob brought the sword down on the archer's neck, lopping his head off. The other man though had been quicker and dug his axe into Jacob's shoulder. Blood squirted out in a stream as Jacob still through his sword at the man, impaling him. The man fell over dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob approached the body and yanked the sword out. He then saw the man holding something in his hand. Jacob took it and recognized it to be a Dragonstone. He slid it into his pouch, thinking it could be important. Anna quickly ran from behind as her and Leonardo stared at Jacob. \"H-help...them,\" he said pointing to Lungulus and Leonardo, \"h-help them f-first....I-I'll...\" That's all he finished with before he collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob awoke to be covered in bandages as he laid...</span></div></div>",

The thing that stopped Anna from catching him was that before Jacbo even got near the ground it looked like some blue streaks wrapped around him like chains and his body dissolved into air. Leonardo and Anna were frozen in place by the sudden disappearance of the Einherjar or more the WAY he disapeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA painful sounding moan got the two back to their senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus was moving a little. He barely felt anything, his whole body numb as if it wasn't his own. He opened his eyes a little only to see everything in a blurry vision. He heard voices sounding like they were miles a way. They were hollow and muffled. But slowly he stated to understand them. Sounding lively and familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann...a? Le...onardo...?\" Lungulus asked in a voice that seemed so unfamiliar. It was dead and still. So different yet, exactly like he felt. Empty. Like his life before the start of his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... Lungu... Get up, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese word stuck in his head Lungulus felt something. Somebody was worried. Someone cared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he picked himself up from the ground or at least tried. His arms and leags gave away and he fell back un a small puddle, but felt like he had to get back up or he would lose something that grew dear to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... stronger than... you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he got up a bit further and before he fell to the ground again was caught by something. He looked over his shoulder and saw two blurry images come clear. Two people. His... friends. Leornardo had a serious face on and a look of concern in his face, despite himself being in a bad condition too. Anna looked worried and had watery eyes like she was about to break down crying. Lungulus couldn't stand the fact that they felt bad just cause of him. Inside he was screaming in hatred for himself for never even telling them the reason, why he kept the Dragonstone all this, no matter how often they asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Anna again Lungulus said: \"Stop giving me that look will you? I always take care of my part of a deal... You get bullion back at camp 'kay.\" with a sly warm smile, hoping to keep her from crying just cause of him. And he could be happy, if he would be in better shape she would have hit him for that smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back with living as it seems. How do you feel? Can you stand?\" Leonardo asked after a reliefed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I' feel just fine...\" was the awnser before he almost fell down back on the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. Let us... help ...you...\" the instand Leonardo saw Lungulus's front he his expression turn from serious and concerned to the one of terror while Anna could do nothing, but let out a  scream in a moment of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lungulus looked down on himself, he saw what startled Leonardo so much. An extremly deep cut of in his stomach region and his entiry front was full of blood. He was starting to get some feelings, but he wished he didn't. Cause he felt noting, but a throbbing pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMNIT! I knew you shouldn't have taken that blow for me! We've got to get you back to the camp NOW!\" Leonardo shouted as he and Anna got to Lungulus's side and tried to get going, but were stopped when Lungulus started coughing heavily and fell to his knees, resting one hand on the ground holding the other in front of his mouth. After a few seconds Lungulus vision started to get blurry again, before he threw up a mix of blood and his last meal. He felt something under his hand and slide it into a pocket of his coat while the others got him back up and started moving back to the camp. He was already unconscious again, before they started moving him towards the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus wasn't aware that what he picked up was Jacob's Einherjar Card, neither that he had lost the Dragonstone. And broken the only promise he ever made with it. At least for now...</span></div></div>",

His condition was critical, and only getting worst as more blood poured from the gash on his chest. Leonardo and Anna then propped Lungulus agonist the cliff the same way they did with Jacob. Lungulus, still unconscious, as his head lolled from side to side. Anna was scared on the verge of tears and Leonardo held a face of serious concern. \"Wh-what are we gonna do Leo?!\" Anna said, her voice wavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo didn't answer until he spotted something. There was something in Lungulus's hand. He walked over an bent next to him and slid it out between his fingers. He looked and realized that is was the Einherjar's card. Blood from Lungulus's hand had smeared on the card as he wiped a bit away with his thumb. He looked it over and looked back at Anna, \"Maybe he can help,\" he said, trying to give her hope. Quickly, the card flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob laid on his back, the situation replaying over and over again in his head. Who were those people? Where was he? Were the other two okay? Jacob thought about that until something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt sharp pain in his shoulder and heat rushed through his body. Jacob's vision flashed and went white. He regained vision as he was coughing up blood that landed on his chest. He looked over to see he was next to a fire and realized it was the camp from before. He then looked up and saw the archer, Leonardo, standing above him. He quickly bent down next to him and helped Jacob sit up. \"Can you help us,\" Leonardo said urgently, not hiding the worry in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-? What do you-?\" Jacob's voice trailed off for two reasons: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. His body was still primarily weak from the recent battle. And...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. He then saw Lungulus' body. Blood was puddling up on the ground as it was now slowly pouring out as bandages from Anna slowed the bleeding, but didn't stop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw the merchant girl, Anna, right next to Lungulus. Tears rained from her eyes as she sobbed. She turned and looked over to Jacob. \"Pl-Please...You have to help him! Please!!\" Anna said, tears rolling down her face. Jacob didn't know what he could do, when he then remembered something. Lungulus, the man who healed him, had given him he elixir after he was healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob reached into a pouch around his belt and pulled out the elixir, still having two more uses. Jacob held to Anna, who wasted no time snatching it out of his hands and pouring the rest of it down Lungulus' throat. His wound began to close until a large, faint scar appeared, but that didn't compensate for blood loss. Jacob rolled himself onto his knees and hands and crawled next to Lungulus and placed a hand on his head. He was sporting a fever slightly. \"G-Get him water...\" Jacob said plainly and weakly. Anna sprang into action and returned with water and a blanket as she covered him up and poured water down Lungulus' throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked back at Jacob in shock of the save he made with the elixir. Jacob looked back at Anna and said, \"D-Don't worry...I'll pay f-for...it...\" Jacob then fell on his side unconscious again, although not disappearing. Leonardo grabbed his blanket and covered him as they bandaged the axe wound on his arm. The day passed as they tried to keep their conditions stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The night was almost over and the sun would rise in a few hours as Lungulus slowly came to his senses. It was still dark and the fire was slowly dying down. As he looked around, he saw Jacob lying next to him against the cliff. Lungulus saw his bandaged shoulder and wondered where he got this injury from unaware of him having saved them all. Next he noticed both of them covered in blankets that had several dirty spots from some sort of food or water. After feeling something give him a nudge, Lungulus looked to his other side and to his surprise found Anna sleeping next to him. After seeing this he couldn't help but smile and stroke her head a little not to wake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must have been watching over us the whole time.\" Lungulus thought. Looking around to see if Leonardo had seen him wake up, Lungulus noticed he wasn't to be seen anywhere. \"Must be on guard duty...\" Lungulus knew the morning must be near due to the slightly brightening sky and the fire. Something made Lungulus feel uneasy, though he couldn't point his finger on it. Like he forgot something important. As if had lost a part of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to distract himself with something he could do so he, under some pain, got up and covered Anna in the blanked he they had use to keep him warm and moved over to the fire bringing it to life again with some wood. As he looked around the camp he found some fresh meat Leonardo must have hunted while he was out. After taking some of it and a few spices and vegetables he started to prepare something for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the food was ready dawn was but a few minutes away as Lungulus sat back and relaxed a little. Sadly the feeling he was trying to shake off bugged him the entire time he tried to get the food to be something of great taste, this time it was somewhat okay if not barely edible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus heard footsteps and turned his head to the side, grabbing his elthunder tome he toke back while he looked around the camp. Luckily he saw it was Leonardo who had come back and wanted to greet him, but was silenced by a gesture from Lungulus pointing to Anna and Jacob. After walking up to the fire, Leonardo put his bow away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling? Anna and I thought you would never wake up.\" Leonardo asked happy to see his friend moving and not painfully turning in his sleep, while he took some of the meat Lungulus had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving hurts still hurts but other than that I'm fine. What did you do to keep me from dying anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't do much other than feeding you two the soup and made you drink some water for the last two days. Three with this one.\" Pointing over to Jacob, after sitting down next to Lungulus and added \"He was the one who poured some of the elixer you used to help him, down your throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus was feeling uncomfotable about the part off being fed by his friends, but got over it quickly since everybody in his condition would have had to be. \"Remind me to thank him for that after he wake up or I might forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I don't have to do that. He's coming to it.\" Leonardo said hearing Jacob grunt and seeing him get up on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was hearing voices. They were  that seemed familiar. He didn't want to move, but he could smell food and felt like he hadn't eaten anything real for weeks. Forcing his eyes open and moving his body to keep himself from falling back to sleep, which -despite the fact that it hurt his shoulder like all hell- wasn't that easy. He let out a few grunts cause of the pain and forced himself on his feet. He looked to the side as he heard a yawn and saw the merchant, Anna if his memories weren't totally screwed, waking up. Then he noticed he was still in the camp of the group that were attacked by the bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back with the living just like myself, huh?\" said a voice near the fire place. It as the tactian of the group, Lungulus was it, sitting next to the archer, Leonardo, who still looked extremly familiar. \"Thanks for saving my life by the way. Guess were even now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. What smelling so good?\" Jacob said, for once seeming quite rude to just ask for food instead of introducing himself or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting out a little laugh the awnser was: \"Breakfast. Can you get your share yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stumbled over to the fire place and found some vegetables and meat fried with help of the fire. He toke a good portion of the meat and started eating. It was not that great but he couldn't care less about it's taste right now. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the calm expression on Lungulus's face suddenly change to to a the one of a paniced animal after, he seemed to fail at finding something on the inside of his coat. Jacob could hear him curse quietly to himself over and over again. After he wispering something Leonardo, who just shock his head to say no, he turned to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me you took the stone while I was out, Anna. Oh by the gods PLEASE tell me you did!\" Lungulus almost shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna who was still half a sleep didn't quiet get why Lungulus was so panicked and only really understood the word stone, so she replied: \"What about the stone? You have it since we travel together, remember? Or did you decide to sell it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this Jacob understood that they must be talking about the Dragonstone that bandit had in his hand back at the forest clearing. \"But selling it? Who would even buy something like that... or could they be...?!\" Jacob had heard of some groups that were hunting manakete for their Dragonstones to sell them like jewelry to nobles or keep even them as trophys! Before he could react though Lungulus had already jumped up and was ready to run towards the forest, but after a few steps already started coughting heavily and fell to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo hurried over to him. \"Hey! Don't try something like that just after you recovered from such an injury!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I care right now?! I'll have to find it no matter what!\" Lungulus shouted in Leonardo's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna who had only seen such an outburst from Lungulus and never any hostile reaction towards his friends was shocked at that. \"Calm down, Lungu! What's the matter in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The matter?! It's GONE!\" Shouted Lungulus back trying to get Leonardo off of him. Thankfully to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this, you won't find it anyway. Lungulus! Calm down and when the suns up we go looking for it, okay?\" Leonardo who was still keeping Lungulus from running in the forest tried to talk sense into him. After a little bit of more struggling Lungulus gave up and started to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long silence in the group Jacob finally asked the question that was burning inside him: \"What's so special about a stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and Leonardo looked at him like he was a mad man after having seen Lungulus pretty much explode like that and were ready to hold Lungulus down again if needed. But he merly looked at him, with the expression of a broken man who you kicked after taking everything he had left away from him and let out a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have told you guys much earlier about this. I knew that, but something always told me to keep quiet about it, so I did. It was just so much easier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and Leonardo were surprised by the sudden change of Lungulus a few days ago refused to awnser any of their question regarding the Dragonstone now was willing to tell them everything about it. And that even to someone who they just met, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you want to talk about it now? I mean you were always so edgy when that came up...\" Anna asked worried about how bad it must be for him, to change from a strong person who was there for everyone and helped them with their problems, to like a child who had lost it's mother and no one to care for it while it was crying in the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've kept this to myself for to long already.\" Lungulus said this with his lifeless eyes staring into what was left of the fire. \"As I told you I lived in a small village in one of the Outrealms. What I didn't tell you that humans and manakete live together in my village peacefully. I wasn't having it really easy. Mother deadly sick, father working all day - mostly mercenary jobs as an escort where he was out for most likely weeks- , and the other kids were either manakete or four to five years older than me. No one wanted to have much to do with me and I kept to myself, mostly reading books or learning swordsmanship. That was my all day life until bandits kidnapped a girl of our village. For our village it would have been to dangerous to just try to free her ourself so they hoped for help of the capital and its army. Since I felt like I couldn't just wait for them to arrive I went to help her myself. Tricked the bandits and got in their group helping her. When the army arrived I finally got her out off the cell and got her her Dragonstone back and everything went well with us escaping. For some reason, that I still don't understand, she tried to become my friend after that, I mean yes I helped her, but that act of me was actully more dangerous than it helped. She visited me daily, help me with chores... Hell we even played games together! It was the first time I felt truely happy. And when ever the manakete or others were picknig on me I could cry myself out on her shoulder. She was like a big sister. The day before I met you, Leonardo, SHE GAVE ME her Dragonstone and I made her the ONLY promise I EVER made. To keep it until I can give it back to her as soon as I have the chance starting the next day. When I went to look for her, I got torn to another Outrealm through Old Hubba's little accident. And now I don't even have a CHANCE to keep that promise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally telling them everything Lungulus just started cring curled up in a ball with Anna and Leonardo trying to comfort him.</span></div></div>",

Jacob remembered the stone, but needed to calm him down or else Lungulus might think he took it. Jacob knelt in front of Lungulus, curled up like a kid crying into his arms. Jacob reached into the pouch on his hip and cupped the Dragonstone in his hand. Leonardo and Anna didn't see what was in his hand, however. Jacob grabbed one of Lungulus's hands and held it palm up. Jacob slowly let it roll off his hands into Lungulus's, whose eyes looked up to see the Dragonstone in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna let out a quiet gasp while Leonardo had a look of shock, along with Lungulus. Jacob then closed Lungulus's hand over the stone. \"I found a bandit nearby who had this after he frisked you. I took it not knowing what it was.\" Jacob placed one hand on Lungulus's shoulder, \"That promise...I'm gonna be sure you keep it.\" Jacob said with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus fell, his face in Jacob's shoulder, still sobbing. He tightly held the Dragonstone, not wanting to lose it again. Jacob help Lungulus stand as Leonardo and Anna both held Lungulus, who's tears had slowed. \"Th-Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smiled when all of a sudden, his vision turned to a blur. His world began spinning and he felt himself falling. Jacob's body yet again felt cold and weak all of a sudden. When his vision returned, he realized he didn't fall since Leonardo, who gave Lungulus to Anna as she placed him by the fire, had caught him. Leonardo carefully laid Jacob back down on the ground. As he laid there, he heard it. Anna leaned over and said to Lungulus, \"For an Einherjar, he falls a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Einherjar? But he was a human, flesh and blood. He turned his head to face Anna, \"W-what did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna glanced at Lungulus, who's calmed down a bit then said, \"Your...your an Einherjar. We found you on a card and summoned you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob laid there as his words reached his ears. How could that be possible even? Then he remembered. The Einherjar attack. Jacob slammed his fist into the ground angrily. This got the other there's attention again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was breathing heavily when he slowed and said, \"I'm...My name is Jacob. I came from a small Outrealm village. I traveled around the Outrealm until about two years ago I traveled around other Outrealms. Then, I was attacked and beaten by Einherjar, who preformed some ritual on me and...\" Jacob had progressed himself as he was sitting up on his hands and knees. \"I'm stuck to a card?! And the life I had to rebuild for myself is gone again?! That I'm just a husk of a man?!\" Jacob looked at Lungulus, his eyes with despair. Then it was Jacob's time for tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob let it his head hit the ground, falling between his arms as his sobbing quickly turned to crying. He just laid there, a shell of himself. Jacob couldn't even know how much time has passed since the attack. Days? Months? Years? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid there, tears pouring from his eyes, when he felt a hand grab his shoulder. The person raised Jacob to his feet slowly an slung his arm over his shoulders. Jacob turned his head to see Lungulus. \"You said that I'd fulfill my promise. You gave me another chance to fulfill it. Now I'm gonna make sure your life doesn't go to waste.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded, \"Thanks...\". Lungulus smiled back warmly. Two broken men working to try and fulfill their life. Lungulus sat Jacob next to the fire as Lungulus sat by Anna again, Leonardo standing over Jacob. They all sat there quietly when Jacob finally asked, \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We should get moving. We've lost to much time already and if the bandits from a few days ago had friends, they might be looking for us for what happend.\" Lungulus concluded. \"In the state Jacob and I are in it probably wouldn't end good for us.\" They could all agree on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we still have time for breakfast, right?\" Anna said in a joyous mood before grabbing some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do.\" Leonardo took the chance to enter the conversation. \"At least if you enjoy the taste of old leather.\", was added by him after trying some of it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that comment Anna slowly passed what she took for herself to Lungulus, who, just like Jacob before, dug into it like it was the last meal he would ever get. While Lungulus was eating Anna went to prepare her goods and Leonardo started to take down their the camp. After feeling better Jacob wanted to help Leonardo with the a tent, but Lungulus grabbed a hold of his arm, forcing him to sit back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him do it alone. If we have another little blackout we just lose more time, than we would gain from helping him.\" He said quickly. \"Also I would like to talk to you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What is it?.\" Jacob replied understanding his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were attacked by Einherjar, right? Do you remember who they were or why they did it?\" Lungulus seemed really serious about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob had to think about this for a little while, but all he got from it was a headache and no awnsers. \"Sorry, but I can't awnser either of those questions. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus' mood changed a bit grim after hearing that awnser. \"We're helping someone named Old Hubba, the man who was keeping the Einherjar cards save, get back the cards that he lost for some reason about 2 months before I met him. He told me that if someone summoned Einherjar wrongly, they would go berserk. I thought that might be the reason why they attacked you, but also performing some ritual? Seems not like it in that case...\" Lungulus grew silent for a bit eating up what he had left of his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was confused after hearing what Lungulus just said. Why would they perform that ritual on him if they went berserk? Wouldn't they just want to kill him and go on to someone else? But he had an idea jump in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then why would they attack me then? Except someone was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Controling them.\" Lungulus cut him off, having the same thought process. \"And if that's the case, maybe that someone is trying to force people into card hoping to create Einherjar that follow the orders of the one who summoned them.\" Then suddenly a smile crossed Lungulus' face. \"You know what that also means? That, even if this isn't the case, the most you could have been stuck in that card would be about 2 years by now, since they only went missing for about 2 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made Jacob feel extremly relieved, since it also meant that his friends would be still alive and not everyone he knew would have died off old age before he even knew what happened to him. But that also meant he and his new friends had a great problem they had to deal with, if their theory was correct. But that fact washed away for the moment as he there was actually a chance he could return to his life. \"If this binding to the card is really forced, then there probably is a way to break it. You think this Old Hubba guy could help us if it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably, but there still is a chance that you are a true Einherjar now. So don't get your hopes up to high. Just in case, 'kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jacob could think of how to respond to that, Leonardo called them over since he and Anna had finished packing everything. After Lungulus and Jacob walked over to them, they told them of the theory of how Jacob became an Einherjar. Leonardo was silent thinking seriously about the odds of them retrieving the rest of the cards, while Anna was worried what would happen to the people, and her customers, that ritual was performed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breaking our heads about this problem won't get us anywhere right now. I suggest we think of a way to deal with it, when we get the chance to. For now let's go through the Outrealm gate of this place. If I remember correct it was just a few hours on foot from here, right Leonardo?\" Lungulus said determined to get moving the sooner the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. If we keep going along the edge of the forest we should find it.\" And after checking if they were okay, Leonardo added: \"Can you two carry your stuff on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure can. Just worried if that goes for you too, Jacob.\" Lungulus said grabbing his weapons, the knapsack and a blanket. Jacob just nodded and took his tome and swords, as well as grabing one of the tents so Leonardo did't had to carry both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire way to the Outrealm gate, there was not a single spoken word. Everyone had other things on their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo's on the task from Old Hubba and what other problems may occur.<br>\r\nAnna on which goods she could sell and what she needed to restock for the group.<br>\r\nJacob on his friends and why all of this had happened to him.<br>\r\nAnd Lungulus on where their next destination would be and when he would ever retun home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the Outrealm gate Lungulus was struck in awe. Even though this was the 5th time he saw an Outrealm gate, they still fascinated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were giant, white gates seemingly bathing in light, no matter if day or night. They were the connections between the realms, but always would lead somewhere else. You could sent in two random people through it and they would probably never see each other again. But if you were traviling as a group and wanted to stay with someone else they would sent you to the same realm, as odd as it may sound. Once they opended and you went through them it felt like you were swimming in a river and looked like you were flying trough the clear blue sky. When you would exit the gates again, you would never know where this place was, since it put you at some completely random point in the realm they lead you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the group came out on the other side of the Outrealm gate, they saw they had landed in a thick forest that was flooded with light and the live of it could be hear everywhere. It had a calming atmosphere that could ease all the worries they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for a distorted feminine voice shouting something they couldn't understand followed by what appeared to be a growl. As the group turned around they saw what looked like some kind of giant rabbit like beast starring rigth at them ready to jump any second. Lungulus and Leonardo (who mistook it for a laguz at the moment) had never seen a Taguel before and backed away a bit as the ceature in front of them spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You human scum are not welcome in this forest! This is OUR home! Leave now if you want to, ever see to your rotten families again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis warnig was all it said, but the last part was enough for Lungulus to get over the shock of what this being might be stepping in front of the rest of the group looking directly into its eyes. After a second or less of his stare the Taguel felt extremly uneasy and was ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may call me what ever you want to, but if you say a single word against my familiy again, none of gods will be able to help you then.\" After saying that he turned to the rest of the group and they started to walk in the opposite direction of where the Taguel was standing.</span></div></div>",

It jumped out of the way as the lightning leveled a tree. \"You dare face a Taguel?!\" The voice said angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo and Anna tried to hold Lungulus back, not realizing that the Taguel was charging. Before Anna or Leonardo could react to Lungulus' warning, Jacob moved in front and stopped it's claw. It held there until it jerked it's hand away. Jacob, still not in peak physical form, brought the guard down as his sword was pushed away as the Taguel dug both feet into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob flew backwards until he bounced off a tree and hit the ground. Lungulus snapped. As the creature pulled away, Lungulus shot Elthunder at a tree as it fell, almost hitting the Taguel. Lungulus already readied a second strike, and when the Taguel dodged the falling tree, Lungulus shot the spell hitting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a whimper as she flew back a little ways. Lungulus breathed heavily as Leonardo ran off to Jacob. Anna and Lungulus walked closer until they stood over it. It's side was bleeding as it's ears hung. It looked up at Lungulus, but he couldn't read them. \"Help her.\" Lungulus finally said, breaking the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You wanna help it?\" Anna said, surprised that Lungu wanted to heal what he just hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I want to heal her.\" He knelt beside the creature's head and pulled out a concoction, as they were low on elixirs. \"Here. I didn't mean to hurt you like this. I'm sorry...\" He poured it into the Taguel's mouth as the wound healed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus then heard the Taguel mumble something. \"What was that?\" Lungulus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayra, human. My name's Ayra. And...thank you...\" Ayra the Taguel said as Lungulus scratched her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo finally found Jacob's body as he laid on his chest. \"Jacob! You alright?!\" Leonardo asked obviously concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob rolled over, his chest was a little bloody but not too bad. \"Yeah. Don't worry, I'm fine...Could you just help me up?\" He reached it out as Leonardo took his arm and slung it over his shoulder. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" Leonardo said, \"Now let's get back to Lungulus and Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

All those other times he let his anger controle himself, he NEVER felt so depressed and angry with himself after he got a hold of himself. He looked over to Anna who, since she had no idea what Lungulus was up to at the moment, just shrugged. With a depressed sigh he turned back to the Ayra who was getting back up on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're good to go?\" asked Lungulus as Ayra tumbled a bit. \"Still... I'm sorry for hurting you. How can I make up for that one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Was all Ayra said with a little growl towards Lungulus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Why' what?\" Now Lungulus was confused. \"What's her problem now? Probably still mad for hitting her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you finish me human? Why let me live and even help me? If you would have killed me, I would at least kept my honor by dying for the clan!\" Ayra was filled with rage feeling taunted by Lungulus and his will to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all? Easy.\" Lungulus now wasn't concerned for Ayra that much anymore, if she could stand again and show that much agression, so his expression had now turned completely serious. \"I let my anger control myself and reacted to someones immature taunt, that way letting myself down on the level of a child. If one can't controle their emotions, then they don't have any honor. AND by helping you I'm willing to accept the consequences of my actions.\" While saying this Lungulus sounded like an experienced fighter, but also making sure that it was clear he lectured both of them with his words. \"But you, Ayra, also shouldn't forget. There is no honor in death. Asking for something like that is only running away from your responsibility. If you care so much about honor you have to work hard to restore it and nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had finished the last part, Lungulus knew there were two out comes for this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenario #1: Ayra would take this as an insult and pick another fight wiht him.<br>\r\nor<br>\r\nScenario #2: She would understand his intentions and calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily it was scenario #2 that unfolded. Ayra was backed down and released the tension in her body, taking a few deep breaths. The three turned their heads to the side as they heard someone approach, just to see it was Leonardo helping the slightly wounded Jacob. At the sight of Jacob Ayra's eyes went wide and whimpered. One of her most force full attacks BARELY SCRATCHED a human. After the two walked up to the rest Leonardo threw a dirty look over to Lungulus for losing his cool, before he turned to the Ayra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for my friends behavior just now. He tends to lose his temper when it comes to his family.\" Leonardo said bowing down a bit in front of Ayra. \"Please don't mind if I ask, but I must say I have never seen a Laguz like you before. Could you tell me what tribe you belong to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra looked at him for a moment confused by what Leonardo had just called her, but in the end just said: \"I don't know what these 'Laguz' are, human. But to awnser your question, I'm a Taguel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You'll get one of my special discounts!\" Anna proclaimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't trust her on that.\" Lungulus whispered to Ayra, while making sure Anna didn't hear him. \"It's still gonna cost you more than 3-times it's worth. Anyway...\" Lungulus raised his voice, for everyone to hear again. \"To get back on the toppik, the blond archer's called Leonardo and the man who blocked your attack to help me is Jacob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra was about to say something in responde to the friendly instrucktion from Lungulus, but was stopped by something before a single word would leave her throat and her exprssion changed far from the clam and collected look she had so far. Her ears perked up and she looked in a few different directions, before finally setting on one. While starring that way he face showing a serious, and for a second worried expression.She was able to hide the last part quick, but not fast enough to go unnoticed by Lungulus. Whatever caused her to raise her guard like that had to be something bad. Lungulus faced the same way that way Ayra looked and prepared an Elthunder spell in case they were gonna attacked by something. Jacob also noticed the tension in both of them and prepared himself, while carefully looking in all directons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if it would only HAD been an attack. If it would be something simple that you learned to shake off. What hit them and to what it would lead was far worse and much harder to get over. the sight they would see at the end of this day would be disturbing to the core, beginning simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it sounded more like a call from the depths of hell. It seemed so unnatural, like it didn't even belong in this world. It was a mixture of hatred and terror. Pain and despair. Agony and suffering. And it wasn't truely alone. Many other screams followed, only a lot more distant, but not in anyway nearly as disturbing or as loud. Any sane person who heard this would run. As fast as they can, never looking back. But Lungulus couldn't. He had nowhere to run, but that wasn't the true reason why he stayed. He didn't run because he wasn't the kind of person that would go on and ignore it if something was obviously wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus wasted no second thought on this matter, threw his knapsack on the ground and headed in the direction the screams came from, before the others even knew what just happend. However, they realized it in a matter of seconds put down their own pieces of the camp equipment and chased after him, weapons ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra, who almost seemed to be frozen in time if it wasn't for her deep breaths, just looked after them with a shocked and paniked expression on her face. This state didn't last long though. Hear ears went back down towards her back and the only thing left on her face was pure hatred, while in her eyes raged the fury of a hundred storms. She started to growl like mad and bolted down the path the others had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lungulus got closer to the area the screams were coming from, he noticed black strips in the treetops. and the smell that reached him soon after made it clear it was a forest fire. Knowing this would have calmed him down a bit, if it wasn't for a certain stench in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurnt flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus stopped for a moment behind a huge tree, which was large enough for five grown man to stand side by side bhind it and someone on it's other side wouldn't even see them, to catch his breath. He didn't know how far he had already gotten and started to walk around it. When he saw what was on the other side his eyes widened in disbelieve, shock and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a village burning like hell. The people, who he assumed to be Taguel from their rabbit ears and them being covered by much more hair (or was it fur?) than humans with surprising agility even the older people had, were running from something. As he looked in the direction they were coming from he saw a battlefield that more looked like the inside of a slaughterhouse. About 50 or so Taguel were trying to fight an army of barely trained soldier, which in itself would be hard for them if it wasn't for the sheer amount of humans outnumbering them 5 against 1. Still, those who tried a breakthrough were almost taken out in a single blow by any of the Taguel fighters. But there were still a lot of humans who got through every possible gap, chasing after the fleeing poeple and mercilesly cutting them down. No matter if it were the old, the injured or the weak. And even if the Taguel were far superior to most human soilders, they didn't see the far more experienced fighters in the mix. They attacked everytime a Taguel had just struck down one of their comrades and if they failed just waited for the next to go in and then try again. The thing that was the most surprising, was the fact that there weren't any archers or mages or any kind of ranged fighters with the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lungulus got a far to good look of the massacer on both sides he heard a rustle in a tree nearby and instinctively got down. This just saved him by but an inch or to from getting impalled by the lance of pegasus knight. As Lungulus turned around an Elthunder ready he noticed the confusion on the peg. knight's face who had stopped in mid air. What caught Lungulus' eye was the lance that had nearly torn a hole in him. It was completely red, with a shared spearhead that seemed to have some kind of fangs inbetween it. Most likely to tear appart whatever it dug into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of the two could continue, Jacob, Leonardo and Anna arrived a the scene, all with weapons in hand. As the peg. knight saw them approach, he let out an annoyed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys were suppose to tell us, if you set up an ambush for the beast!\" the peg. knight said, clearly angry and mistaking them for someone else. \"I though you were one of those! Do you mercenarys never follow the orders of your employer?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus was quick to pick up on this. They would need as much information as possible. \"Look man, I'm sorry 'bout that one, but we need to get info on how the fights going and you guys never tell us anything. We can't work like that, or what do you guys say?\" Lungulus said, before turning to the other to tell them to play along for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! You what more do you guys need to know, than what the commander already told you?\" The knight didn't even try to hid his annoyance. \"You should do your work instead of ask for unnecessary details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just ran around the entire place as your 'commander' told us to.\" Jacob said putting on a grim face. \"If you wanna cause touble, go ahead. You will know understand your mistake then. Also that paladin said one of you would tell us what going on right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What paladin? The commanders a general, remember? I can belive he's letting your kind fight along side us in such a battle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you that was another one of these 'quick cash makers'! Those guys have no respect for our work. They don't know what fair deal is.\" Anna said sulking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if YOU would know what a fair deal is...\" Leonardo mumbled a bit. Looking at the peg. knight he added. \"So your gonna tell us what going on or what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight was clearly starting to get pissed at them now. \"Fine. Those peasents we put in most of these armors will all play meatshields for you, while you take care of most the beasts. It's not like they can do anything else anyway. Hell they barely know how to hold their weapons right!\" After saying this the pegasus knight started to laugh like a saddistic maniac. \" And don't worry ybout them running or betraying us. They wouldn't dare. Even if they did, the commander would set their fields ablaze and kill their families. Oh and us pegasus knights make sure non of these beasts escape. Why else were we trained to fight in such wild forests and given these lovely Beast Killers.\" The knight said, more likely making a statement, than asking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this would be the best that they would get to know from this guy, Lungulus jumped back in the conversation. \"Well, I guess that's all then, right guys?\" He turned to the group and they all got what he meant. Jacob and Anna just nodded, while Leonardo raised an eyebrow in a questioning manner. Lungulus nodded. and turned back to the peg. knight, with a smile on his face that would perfectly fit a madman. \"Then let's join this slaughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peg. knight was happy to be able to get rid off these freaks, but wouldn't go nowhere. As soon as Leonardo was out of sight he shot an arrow in the pegasi's wing which caused it to crash in a tree crushing it's rider beneath itself. After the crash Lungulus turned back to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we all can agree on the thought, that they could use our help.\" He said plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra, who finally caught up to the group heard the last part and saw the dead peg. knight lying beneath his pegasi. She was still burning with fury. \"If you want to help get rid of these flying rats!\" she growled and continued her march to the battlefield helping her poeple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus was about to shout somthing at her came up with the an idea. \"Jacob! You go after and tell her to get some good fighters to get away from the rest of the Taguel. This will most likely get the peg. knights on your tail, so lead them to an open area. Leo and Anna, you make sure our 'mercenary comrades' have some accidents, while you flow Jacob and Ayra. Make sure no one sees you. And Leo. You will have to shot down the knights too. Make every hit a kill. I'll take care of the General somehow. Objections? No? Good. Move it!\" And with that he ran of onto the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other didn't have much of a choice now, since Lungulus was already gone so they had to do as he said, if they atleast hoped to get a chance to survive.</span></div></div>",

He was only able to run so fast compared to her, but somehow ran beside her. \"Slow down!\" Jacob called out over the roars of the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?! I don't have time while my people are suffering!\" Ayra yelled, still enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! But we have a plan,\" Jacob yelled. This caused Ayra to look at him. \"We need a few fighters to draw back from the battle and lead the Pegasi away. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra continued to run. Jacob at first thought that she would not answer until she turned and nodded to him. She ran toward the line of Taguel and looked for a few fighters. Jacob followed around and attacked one of the Barbarians trying to break through. He then saw Ayra returning with a few other Taguel. Jacob couldn't tell male from female now beside armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Follow me and Ayra!\" Jacob yelled. He then made a sprint out of the village as the Taguel ran all around them. Jacob ran but then fell. He thought he would hit the ground, but he was actually picked up and placed on Ayra's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep up Jacob!\" Ayra yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob realized all the other Taguel were extremely fast alongside Ayra. Jacob nodded back to he and turned around saw a few Pegasus knights flying over toward them. He pulled out Katarina's bolt and struck one down as they finally pulled a good number away from the battle and turned to fight them, Jacob dismounting Ayra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was within a mass of warriors. She snuck around the army's lines when she saw a large group of knights who seemed to be at the back waiting for a moment to charge. They all were off their mounts however and a few were unarmed. Anna smiled as she pulled away and found the row of knight's horses tied up. She smiled and cut the ropes as the horses bolted in all directions away from the battle. She hid again before the knights saw her and as a few tried to chase their mounts down. \"Another satisfied customer,\" Anna said to herself as she went toward Jacob's position for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo was hiding in a large mass of trees as he waited for a moment to attack. Then he saw the other Pegasus knights that did not head off toward Jacob and Ayra were attempting to flank the Taguel line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knocked an arrow on his bow and raised it as he hit one of the riders in the neck as he fell from the Pegasus. He continued until a few of them were left an finally found him. But before they could reach him or alert anyone else, Leonardo already shot them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus had made his way around the enemy to where he was hiding behind a boulder behind the Enemies' General. The man wore large black armor with a ragged condition shown on them. Lungulus also saw that there were a few Great Knights ahead of him. The general was too close to them that if he was taken out they would be alerted of Lungulus' position. Lungulus had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took Elthunder and launched it out into the distance letting it explode. This caught the General's attention and it drew him away from the battlefield. He looked around as Lungulus jumped from the boulder, aimed, and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElthunder broke through an opening on the General's helmet, killing the man inside. This caught the other men's attention, but they did not notice Lungulus but saw their employer dead. No employer, no pay. No pay, no reason to fight. Many turned and ran as others were killed off fighting or trying to retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and the others survived the onslaught as they finally finished their fighting. \"We did it Ayra! We-\" he stopped and saw Ayra on her side, a gash in her side left by a beast killer. He ran to her side. \"Ayra! I need you to turn back to normal for me! Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to her normal form and laid there. Jacob's face went red seeing Ayra so fragile, but snapped out of it and bandaged the wound as best he could then picked her up as he went to find the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacob was lucky. Ayra's injury looked worse than it actually was and the bandages he applied were enough to stop the bleeding, though he himself didn't know that Ayra was completely aware of it. That the wound wasn't to great was most likely only due to the fact that Ayra was a taguel and used to fighting. Still, she was breathing a bit heavily, but most likely able to walk on her own, if unsteady and slowly or at least if she put her arm over Jacob's shoulder for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were only a few minutes of walking from the, still like all hell blazing, village, Arya sunddenly signaled Jacob to stop and put her down. Jacob hesitated a little, as he was for himself still unsure about her condition. It didn't help his mind ease up that Ayra's human from looked like the body of an at most 14-year old child, but he still did what Ayra wanted from him. She stumbled a little, though Jacob was already by her side to help her keep standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt truly hurt Ayra's pride as a taguel that she needed help to walk and even stand straight. Even worse for her was that she showed her weakness to a human, who, yet again, was the providing help. There was one fact though, that eased this pain greatly for. The fact that Jacob was an experienced fighter, which didn't take a single hit in even such a chaotic fight and his strength in battle that surpassed most humans and was among the strengh of the best warriors of her clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis for Ayra extremly unpleasant moment was to her relieve cut short, as about seven unclear figures emereged from the shadows of the trees around them. After they got a little closer, before they stopped it became clear that they were taguel. All except the one in front of them transformed, looking around like they had no idea what was excatly going on and what they were donig here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one in his human form had a muscular build tall build and seemed to be about 20. He was probably 7ft. tall, but most likely taller. His face was cover in many scars, which made it extremly hard to make out what was his mouth, what just another scar and what everything else. The only feature that truely stood out were his eyes. They almost seemed to be glowing in the same blood-red Ayra's eyes had just a shade darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked a bit confused at Ayra, but his expression changed as he noticed her bandages with Jacob, a HUMAN, giving her hold. His face went red with anger at the sight of Jacob, while his expression showed the disgust about a taguel who would throw a way his honor and accept the help of something that was in his eyes lower than dirt. As the rest of the group had kept their eyes more one, apparently, their leader they startded to back of back into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra shivered a bit from this guys apperance. Jacob could feel her shivering while he helped her stand, before she could get a hold of herself. \"You know this guy?\" He asked quietly so the other taguel didn't hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response he got was Ayra spitting towards the taguel. She definetly didn't like him, considering how much she seemed to respect experienced fighters or people with greater knowledge and understanding than her, like Lungulus and most likely the elders of her clan. Jacob was getting ready to fight. He could almost SEE the tension between the two exspecting the taguel around them to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't went the way he had expected though. Instead the taguel in front of them let out a short low growl. This didn't help ease the situation much, but it got the rest of the taguel group bolt into the forest, tails between their legs. There was a good part and a bad part about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood Part: Jacob had now only one enemy if it comes to a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad Part: This guy was going to be one hell of an enemy, if he scared the rest of them away with only a little growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the stared down between the two parties continued the taguel finally decided to speak up, rather than to go at their throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you look at that! Little Ay's getting friends with humans when she's a little hurt. From you I would expected to have atleast enough dignity as a fighter to die instead off begging for this guys mercy.\" His voice was deep and sounded a bit rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk! At least I fought for the clan! you were nowhere to be seen even near the battle, brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra spit that last word out like she was about to throw he last meal back up. Or blood considering her wound. Jacob took a few seconds to realize exactly WHAT that last word was. \"Their not really- I mean- WHAT?!\" Jacob though. \"HOW by god are they related? They look nothing like each other...\" It was true while that guys was a GIANT, Ayra seemed just far too small in comparison, despite the age differnce. Her body build was very fragile, while his looked like a normal iron or steel sword would just shatter on it. By the heavens, even their hair had a different color. The only thing they had in commen was the eye color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE'S your brother?\" Jacob asked out loud, without realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is none of your buisness.\" Snapped the guy back at Jacob. \"But yes. This unworthy excuse of a taguel is my sister by blood.\", he said every word filled with pure disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If one of us is unworthy of our bloodline it's you...\" Ayra responded with calm voice, while on the inside she was ready to fight the taguel. \"You abandoned the rest of the clan and hide from anything that could, become a challenge to you! You're afraid of loosing more than I hate being related with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought Ayra's brother to the edge. \"You should watch your every word from now. You don't get anywhere near my skill in combat. Only the elder surpass \"Tronger, the Blood Wolf\". And they aren't around and that petty human ain't gonna keep me from getting you.\" He pressed out between his gritting teeth. He continued in a little less threatening voice. \"Also, I was with the rest of the fleeing clan, protecting them from the scum YOU let through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra was taken aback at her brothers words. Not at the threath, but more at the fact that she herself hadn't considered Tronger to be with the rest of the of the clan, as well as having to admit her failure to keep the humans away from the group. She sunk her head in shame. Tronger smile with glee, knowing there was nothing she could hold against him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad for him Ayra wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a the best excuse you the \"Blood Wolf\" got?\" Jacob asked in an aggresive and downgrading tone. Ayra turned her head up to Jacob's face having no idea, what he was aiming for. Tronger on the other hand formed fists with his hands, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you just said there human?\" The smile on his face disappeared. His voice shaking with anger, disgust and the need for blood. Yet it seemed quiet calm for his state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth.\" responded Jacob. \"IF your really that great of a fighter, why weren't you holding the line while telling Ayra to protect the other? If you're as strong as you claim, you could have kept any human from getting through, couldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob knew it was a bad idea to piss this guy off, but Ayra was, atleast kind of, his and the others friend and he would not let this guy harm his friends. He could see Tronger shaking with rage, ready to attack any moment now. Ayra for her part couldn't believe what Jacob just said. She knew he was still exhausted from the just recently ended battle, yet he was willing to fight someone, he knew he had little chances against at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTronger transformed into his beast-form and got ready. As he was about to go at the two...</span></div></div>",

What appeared to be a miniature tornado came up from underneath him and tossed him off his feet as he crashed to the ground again. \"You alright?\" A voice yelled from behind where Tronger was. Lungulus, Leonardo, and Anna emerged from the forest the other Taguel fled through and stood ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded to Lungulus as a reply as he turned and saw Tronger begin to stand back up. Jacob ran towards him and lifted his blade as he swing in a downward, diagonal motion. However Tronger didn't dodge it, but traded the blow with a claw that dug into Jacob's leg and chest. The two fell again as Jacob fell to his knees holding himself up with one hand. His vision had blurred, and his world was spinning. Jacob was ready to fall when he felt someone catch him. He looked over to see Ayra holding him up as she helped him stand with his arm around her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTronger got back up and stared furiously at Ayra as she helped a human. \"Why Ayra? Why throw away everything I've done for you for this...pathetic excuse for being?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra turned back at her brother, \"Because, this \"being\", has done more for me than you have my whole life!\" Ayra screamed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ouch.' Jacob thought in his head as he saw Tronger obviously taken back by her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTronger was about to begin another charge as he moved but felt something pierce his leg. His looked and saw an arrow sticking out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about,\" Leonardo said as he nocked another arrow into place ready to fire. Leonardo was ready with his tome and Anna was with her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTronger probably would've fought them, but decided to return to the elders. He turned and let out a low growl, dripping with malice, and ran into the forest. Ayra knelt down and laid Jacob down as Lungulus came over and Anna readied a Concoction and handed it to Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob tasted blood in his mouth and felt the first drop trickle down the corner, but managed a grin. \"W-what took you guys so long?\" Jacob asked jokingly as he began to drink the Concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I just saved your hide from that charge,\" Lungulus said. \"You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob laughed hoarsely, \"Just joking around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that anyway?\" Anna asked. Ayra explained that it was her brother, his position in the clan, and their history of hatred. No one wanted to ask anymore about the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The forest here could be a nice spot to rest up at. Let's find a spot and settle for a bit.\" Leonardo said. The others nodded in agreement, all of them wanting a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra helped Jacob up to his feet and toward the forest. \"T-thanks Ayra.\" Jacob said to her as she helped carry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Thank you. For standing up to Tronger.\" Ayra said somewhat somber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, glad-\" Jacob stopped as more pain came up in his leg. \"....alright, \"semi-glad\" I helped fight him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

There was little news the group could talk about so an awkward silence spread over the group, while they treated Jacob's and Ayra's injurys with what little the group had on them. Which reminded them, that they still had to cover a good distance back in the direction they came from before nightfall just to get their equipment back, they dropped before running to find the taguel village under attack. But at the moment they needed this rest and they had earned it. The silence was finally broken, when Lungulus walked over to Anna and passed two things to her. She let out a happy squeal as she recognized the itemsand gave Lungulus a quick hug, which caught him off guard causing a quick smile to run over his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure doing business with you.\" Lungulus said, copying Anna's usual devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You now that's my line, Lungu.\" Anna said sounding a little sad. But in a much more cheerful tone she continued. \"Good to see your deal is one to be kept though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts me to hear, that you think any less of me Anna.\" He said, dropping the smile and leaving to the serious expression that almost never left his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't happen to be a bullion and an elixer you just gave to Anna there now, did it?\" Jacob asked sarcastic raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if it was? You two will be doing fine without one.\" Lungulus awnsered giving Jacob an annoyed look, while pointing at him and Ayra. Before he continued, Lungulus raised his voice a bit to make sure all heard him, even Anna who was counting the gold in the bullion already. \"Also you want to make sure you finish a deal with Anna, and her sister too in my opinion, as fast as you can. I for myself don't want to find out WHAT THEY will come up with to make you wanna pay your dept with them, as fast as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna took no offense to his comment, since she knew that a few of her sisters were commonly tring out new items they made themselfs by letting unsuspecting, mostly new, customers test them without warning. She herself though would never do that, unless they agreed on testing something of course! But considering how serious Leonardo is all the time he wouldn't agree to anything she would call fun and Lungulus had a problem with most of the things she brought back from a town, when he didn't know what it was. But despite this she still couldn't help, but to play along to get Jacob of the toppic, so she gave him a mischievous grin with a dirty look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob backed off seeing Anna's face like that, and sat down next to Ayra, who had just watched the scene unfold. She was unable to understand how these people could travel together and trust each other, if this was the daily basis. Though she could only laugh at how easely Jacob was scared by this one woman. Leonardo on his part could only let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey might have known Ayra only for a day and knew very little about her, yet, it felt like she had been a part of their group for months and the same was the case for Jacob. This thought forced another smile on Lungulus' face, but it disappeared just as fast as it came, when he stared into the forest, his toughtssettled on something completely different. The images of the destroyed village flashed back in his mind. Not while it was burning like a Bolganone spell, but after he used Celica's Gale to choke the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was gruesome, disturbing, helllish sight that was burned deep into his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestroyed houses, dismembered limbs, blood all over the place, halve burnde bodies, the stench that was clinging to everything and that taste that made one want to throw up that, yet was only in ones mind. But that wasn't the worst. This picture was only the thing that made you realize what the worst part was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing you could feel, touched you this deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing you could smell, reached inside you so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing you could taste, was so tasteless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing you could see, opened your eyes like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only thing you couldn't do, that scared you and yet was the same as all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Silence. No life. Only death. The dead silence that could only be heared, after the last scream of life ended. The silent desparation of the ones who died, just after their last hope of life had been shattered. This silence was the kind that killed off all sound, before it was created, even ones own breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus spaced out for a little while, not even hearing the others anymore or the forests wildlife at that. For a moment he was back in this silence. He felt alone even though he knew the others were right next to him, they seemed like they were further away than ever. He felt a weird cold come over him and his body was once again numb like a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus was torn out of his trance, when he felt a hand on his shoulder shake him. It was Ayra who looked at him concerned. The others were almost ready to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lungulus. You okay? You haven't said anything in the last hour.\" She said dark, as if she could feel his depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it really been an hour? Him just sitting there, starring into the nothing and kept to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just tired. Probably still from this battle and an injury from a few days.\" He replied with a forced smile. He was extremly good at faking his emotions and lying. It was like a natural gift he didn't want, but had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Lungulus hated himself for lying to her and the others, but he didn't want to bother them with this. Jacob and Ayra hadn't been in the village since they lurred the peg. knights away and Anna with Leonardo were already on their way to them and hadn't been there since the flames went out. Also he couldn't break it to Ayra that her village was nothing, but a graveyard anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\" Ayra asked once again. Now with a more disappointed look on her face, than sad. She probably expected him to be tough considering their size differenz, But it wasn't much of his fault, that his body lacked physical resistance. He was born with a weak body like his mother completely diffent than his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think, you would feel great after not even a half a week recovering from some thing like this?\" Lungulus asked in an annoyed tone, showing her the scar that the wound that almost killed him had left. Ayra's eyes widened abit, but she had nothing more to say after seeing this and just went over to the others.Lungulus got back up from the ground and walked over to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should find our stuff, before it gets dark. It will be a hard for us to find it, when it's dark.\" Leonardo pointed out and all agreed on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say after we find it we set up camp and continue traveling tomorrow. We won't get far in these woods at night and the rests of that army might be lurking around outside the forest so we have to wait with gathering some info on the cards and this realm in certain.\" Lungulus said commonly. Everyone agreed, but Ayra only gave him a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need cards for? And what do you mean with gathering information on this 'Realm'?\" She asked, her ears moving up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to come with us on our jurney, I'll tell you tomorrow.\" Lungulus said in a complete neutral tone. The others didn't understand why he was making such a secret out of it, but just went along with it, thinking he must have got a good reason for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no reason to return to my village and no other place to stay, so what other choice do I have? Tell me that.\" She hissed a bit, clearly not liking what Lungulus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to tell you anything, while you have that attitude. But you'll get your other questions awnsered tomorrow 'kay? I'm tired enough as it is and I don't want to have kid all over me that doesn't even shows any respect.\" Usualy he would be nicer to Ayra cause of her age, but she was different than others her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end the others felt a bit left out at the scene, but were more focused on finding their equipment.</span></div></div>",

Anna packed most of her things in a pack as Leonardo remained watchful that night. Lungulus seemed to have slept a little bit away from the group. Jacob would've asked him why, but felt that he had been through enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially Ayra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stayed around the Taguel girl a little while longer in silence. They sat there, when Ayra broke the surrounding silence. \"Jacob, I've noticed that there's an odd...glow, around you. Why is that? Are you not feeling well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed, now realizing he would have to explain to Ayra what happened. So he kept it simple, told her about Einherjar and cards, then about what happened to him and how he was found by Anna. \"Odd.\" Ayra replied afterword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there longer, when Jacob broke the silence this time. \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's obvious. Your village was attacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra turned and looked at the floor. \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't feel sad?\" Jacob said to Ayra, not showing much sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My village doesn't matter anymore. I've been dishonored by my brother. I'll be remembered for my failure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Failure? You protected your village!\" Jacob said, is voice raising, but not enough to catch the others attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was doomed from the start! You saw how many there were! If every man, woman, and child stopped to fight, that wouldn't have been enough! I-I....\" Ayra looked down, obviously still tired, when her eyes began watering. She held her tears, but was obviously hurt at how weak she was when she was supposed to defend them. Ayra then felt something wrap around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob draped a blanket around Ayra and helped her lay down. \"You were the bravest one there...If what you said was true, that you have nothing in that village, then why risk so much to protect it? That's real courage. You were the strongest one there.\" Ayra was going to reply, but sleep took her and she fell to sleep, as did Jacob a minute later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--The next day--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were traveling again. There was a somber mood collectively in the group. They were silent all the way to the next Outrealm gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group had just reached the edge of the forest with Anna and Leonardo in the lead and Jacob, Ayra and Lungulus in the back. Just before they left the cover the last trees provided them, Lungulus let out a long sigh. It wasn't very loud and Jacob barely noticed it, but it still caught his attention. When he looked to his side he realized neither Lungulus, nor Ayra were next to him anymore. He looked a few steps behind him and saw Lungulus had put his hand on Ayra's shoulder and stopped her. He was giving her a look that showed his sympathy, but also a certain disapointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra was confused, not knowing why Lungulus had suddenly stopped her. His look was warm and friendly, yet it seemed sad about something. She could guess, what made him look at her this way, but she just couldn't understand Lungulus. She looked over to Jacob who had stopped, in hope he would know what Lungulus was thinking. Though all Jacob could do was shrug as he had also no idea what Lungulus wanted from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned her attention back to Lungulus, she finally decided to ask: \"Do you need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus replied in a serious and strong tone. \"It's nothing I need, but rather what you need to do Ayra.\" This confused her even more and even Jacob was giving him a wierd look. As Lungulus saw both their reactions, before once more he let out another sigh and continued. \"I am NOT going to tell you what you have to do, but you hav to remember we won't be coming back her anytime soon, Ayra. That is, if we ever come back here at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra lowered her head as she started understand the meaning of his words, but tried to remain her self-confidents before she spoke up again. \"I told you already. I made up my mind nothing will change that. I WILL go with you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I mean and you know that as well.\" This sentence was hitting Ayra hard. She was tring to stay strong, but in a great struggle with her emotions. She felt her legs giving in and falling on her knees, she started to tear up and sobbing a bit, while she lowered her head. She couldn't ignore it anymore. What it truely meant to leave now.  She felt a hand on her shoulder again, holding her with in a tight grip hearing Lungulus voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let it out. When you're done and feeling better, we'll be moving on.\" With that Ayra finally gave in and started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus walked over to Jacob, who was giving him a harsh look for being so hard with Ayra and was about to go cheer her up. Though before he even got close Lungulus stopped him, looking him dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her be. She needs to get through this on her own.\" He said in a cold voice. Jacob had seen Lungulus in many different situations by now, but how unheeding he was with a friend, started to disgust Jacob. He could easely force Lungulus to let him through, though that would be something he could do for Ayra's sake, as she was already in tears, so instead he was willing to try, to talk sense into Lungulus. Even if he was only willing to give Lungulus one chance for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me one good reason for that and I will think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you two. First: It is hard enough for her to let her emotions out even when she is alone. To her it's a weakness that she doesn't want to admit to anyone else or even herself. When you interrupt her know she will most likely just hold most of it back again and it will slowly eat away at her from the inside. Second: She's leaving her home behind. I heard you two last night. She has nothing that keeps her there, yet she refused to just give it up. And now she is leaving it behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob didn't like it, but he had to admit Lungulus had a good point with what he said first, but the second part Jacob had something, he could render that argument useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ALL left our homes behind. But we don't try to deal with it ourselfs, but together as a group, Lungulus.\" Lungulus had to see the truth in what Jacob just said. He was sure of that. Yet Lungulus still stood in his way, before he awnsered once again coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes for you and most likely Anna and Leonardo too, but the reason for that is simple. YOU GUYS COULD SAY YOUR GOODBYES AND MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR HOME. You knew there was a chance you may never return, but you still left. You had the support of your home, am I right? My point is that she doesn't have this kind of support, but is still going to leave. If she can't make her peace with this place alone, it WILL slowly tear her apart on the inside. I know that, cause it's happening to me. I couldn't make my peace with it and even though I've been talking over this with Anna and Leonardo, the regrets of what I left behind ain't leaving. The wound that left in my heart is one that won't heal until I've return to it and probably not even truely heal then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lungulus finished his little speech, Jacob knew neither what to say, nor what to do so he just stood there looking at his friend. But he knew how much it must have taken from Lungulus to reveal what's inside him. He was also a bit stunned a how understanding Lungulus really was and how easy it was for him to argue with someone, while he kept cold as stone. That was something about Lungulus that seemed like a blessing, but was also a thing to fear, as could almost read one like an open book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind doing me a favor?\" Jacob was surprised to hear Lungulus talk again all of the sudden and just gave him a nod, so Lungulus continued. \"Get after Anna and Leo. They don't seem to have noticed us fall behind. Tell them to wait for Ayra and me 'kay? If they ask why we're still here tell them Ayra's putting her regrets behind and makes peace with her home. We'll catch up with you guys when she's done.\" Jacob didn't bother to ask why Lungulus was staying. He knew Lungulus was going to awnser that question, so he did as he was asked off, though he still could hear Ayra crying, which hurt him, though he knew he shouldn't stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacob left Lungulus turned his attention back to Ayra , who was still crying a few feet from him. It took about ten minutes, before Ayra's tears started to slow down. Lungulus didn't know if stopped crying, because Ayra had let all her emotions out or she just ran out of tears to shed, but in the end it didn't matter. He started to walk over to Ayra, who to his surprise was smiling as he helped her stand back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I think...you were right...I needed that.\" Ayra said in between the last of her sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can only truely see the joy in our life and future, when we were able to let go of our pain and sorrow. I'll make sure to remind you of that.\" Lungulus said in a soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well said youngster. It's good to see that our child will be in good care, when she leaves her home.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden voice startled Ayra as she tried to find it's source. Lungulus for his part though immediately found it as he saw an old taguel approached them. He seemed to have grey hair and didn't look like much of a figther either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see that you finally decided to reveal yourself, sir. It ain't nice to follow someone through the woods and then listen in on their private convesation. Espacially if that goes on for an entire day.\" Lungulus greeted the man in an for this kind situation, unnormal calm manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm did not expect for you, out of your group, to notice me, youngster. But I hope you will be just as cautious in the future.\" The taguel spoke in gentle and confident way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't intend to do so, until I fulfilled a friends request. But I believe you wish to talk to Ayra, so I'll with draw from this conversation.\" That said Lungulus took a small step to the side so he wasn't in the way of the two taguel, but still able to intervene if anything happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra for herself could barely understand what was going on. First she found comfort in the presents of humans. Then she cried for the first time since long ago. And to top of it all, one of the clan's elders followed her through the forest. She at a loss of words for a few moments, before she found words that were at least somewhat fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm deeply sorry, if I worried you, elder! Please, if there is anything you need from me, just say so!\" Ayra was extremly nervous in the presence of an elder. That was nothing to blame her for though as they were the most respected members of the clan for their wisdom, strength, skill or another reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to be worried child. We know you well and aren't fooled by your brothers words. The clan respects him, but we are all well aware of his hatred towards humans. You are still welcome in the village.\" Ayra was enlighted to hear these words, but was now unsure what to do. She didn't knew if she could leave her village behind, but she also couldn't just abandon the other. She looked over to Lungulus for help in this decision, but then saw he was reading in one of his tomes uninterested in the conversaion only giving her a quick glance that pretty much said: 'Your choice'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry elder, but I've made my decision. I will go with my friends.\" Ayra anounced proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't expecting any different of you. You're parents will be proud of you. But we all want you to know that if you ever wish to return, you are welcome home.\" After he finished and Ayra once again show him her respect, the elder turned to Lungulus once more. \"And youngster. I would also have a request for you.\" After Lungulus put his tome away, he turned his full attention to the elder and simply nodded in response. \"There is a family of human nobels that lives about a month of travel from this forest that has always been on good terms with our clan and I want you to tell them what happened..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elder, you don't mean...\" Ayra suddenly interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, child. The family of the little boy, you used to play with...\" Ayra was left in thought after that. Quietly the elder hinted to Lungulus that said nobles, possesed some of the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile Lungulus replied. \"We'll let them know.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Lungulus and Ayra regrouped with the others outside of the forest and told them of the taguel's request, which Lungulus accepted without even asking for the others opinion and that was really to everyone liking. Nonetheless he for his part, and Ayra probably too, were set on fulfilling this request even if he had to go there alone and the others were fully aware of it, which left them with no other choice but to go with them. They couldn't just let their friend run around this realm alone, especially since one of them has a temper worse than a wyvern's and the other still looked and acted like a child most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the short discussion the group got going with Ayra taking the lead, since she vaguely remembered the way. She also wanted to take some of the equipment of the others, but Lungulus kept her from taking anything with two reasons. First was that everyone carried their own stuff (except for Jacob who had taken one of the tents for the others), she wasn't going to play the pack mule for the group and Second, if any strangers saw her carring some of the stuff for them, they would most likely jump to the conclusion that she was some kind of slave. Ayra started to get angry at how little respect Lungulus seemed to have for her and her own decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob kept her calm for the time being and later asked Leonardo, if he knew why Lungulus treated her this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A golden cage is still cage, Jacob. He is fully aware, that's where Ayra wants to be put the least and wants her to understand that a cage isn't just to keep away her freedom, but also to protect her from the outside.\" Leonardo replied.\"Though he better has something in his hand to keep her from breaking out or he's gonna reap what he sowed.\"It wasn't really all clear what Leonardo meant, most of it was easely understood by Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next week the troop did not come across many other travelers, but those they did come across were giving them a wierd look or more likely Ayra. They probably had heard of what happened in the forest and didn't want to have anything to do with a taguel. The fact that the news about the incident had spread so fast wasn't helping them. Especially since the group was almost out off supplies and there was only one town anywhere nearby from what Ayra could tell them, so there was no way around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ayra! Come here for a sec 'kay?\" Lungulus called out to Ayra who had gone a bit ahead of the others, as soon as the town got in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather annoying to her. 'What does he want now?!' she thought as she walked over to Lungulus. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus reached in his knapsack and pulled something out. \"We don't want any trouble in town, so I thought it would be better if you wear this to cover up your taguel features, at least for now.\" What Lungulus pulled out was actually a second tactian cloak like his own. The only difference was that it was made a bit tighter so it would fit her. It would still drag on the ground a bit though due to the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" replied Ayra enraged, which caugth the attention of the others. They were slowly having enough of the arguments of the two. \"You really think I would hide my origin?!\" her anger was clear in her voice and Leonardo and Jacob took a step in their direction knowing when that became the subject of conversation with either of them, they were almost unreasonable. Anna for her part backed off though, not exactly wanting to get dragged into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus let out a short sigh and hid his face behind his hand for a brief moment, thinking about how to get what he meant into Ayras head. \"Okay, hear me out on this and don't interrupt me, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra was in the mood to tear him to bleeding shreads rather than listen, but he had proven to be understanding, despite the fact that he was sometimes rather blunt in his choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are proud of your blood and I understand you don't want to hide who you are, but as I said this cloak is just to hide your Taguel feature, more clear your rabbit ears and tail. You know most humans are scared of Taguel like us the first time we saw you too, but for these guys on top of that, there was a slaughter on both side initiated by humans. If they would see a Taguel anywhere near to a town, They would most likely think your want them to pay with blood. Clear so far?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra could help, but let out a little growl. 'Does he think I'm that dense?!' she thought. \"Yes...\" was the only thing she had to say at the moment though. Lungulus relaxed a bit seeing that Ayra was willing to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then the rest isn't so hard anymore. Also I'm not asking you to deny that you ARE a Taguel and that if someone asks you, you can tell him the truth. If your already inside the town, they will care far less, as they would expect you to be in there for a while. Now in the end the thing is, you saw we are all most out of supplies. Especially food and tents. The two tents we have are almost breaking down and it would be far less cramped in them if we got a third one. Also I, for my part at least, need a new tome or else I'm almost useless in combat, since I can't just use a beast- or dragonstone like you and my own tomes have only 3 uses for the wind one and about 10 uses for the thunder one left. But the main problem is we need to find someone who knows the way to your old friend. You said yourself you <u>vaguely</u> remember the way. That alone could take a day or two and to be honest... I fear you would get in unnecessary danger if we left you alone for the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was taken aback at the last part. It hadn't been often that Lungulus said something nice to Ayra. But suddenly going as far as freely saying he didn't want her to get hurt or even putting her in any kind of danger as long as it wasn't necessary, even if he had to get in another argument with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra herself was at first mistaken it for an insult, meaning she was able to defend herself, but it took no two seconds before she realized what he actually meant. Or rather how much she and the others meant to him, which caused her to blush a little and hide her face by moving her ears slighly in front of it as she started to apologize. \"Sorry, I didn't thougt... I mean I wasn't aware you... no I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't thnk I cared about you. It's the simple truth.\" Lungulus cut her off, before he gave her a smile to cheer her up. \"Don't think bad about yourself cause of that. Most people would think like that, judging by the way I act. So would you be willing to take my spare cloak and safe us some trouble, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea-- hold on, your spare cloak? Then how come it looks like it was made for some one with my build, just a bit taller? Wait, did you wear this before?\" Ayra asked a bit confused as she took the cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, yes, my spare cloak. Second, because I customized it a bit. Did all the housework at home. Third, no, I did not wear it before. Anymore questions before we go visit the town?\" he asked everyone at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore.\" replied Ayra, while everyone else just shaked their heads still stunned by what just happend. With that Ayra put on the cloak to find it fit surprisingly well and pulled up it's hood over her face, so the group could start to walk towards the town again. There was a feeling of ease spreading over the group that, together with the silenceof the field, letting everyone think and made the soon following conversation much happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived at the gates of the town, they had a short run in with the guards which were a bit hesitant with letting them in the town. They wanted to for Ayra to take of her hood, but Lungulus was quick to convince them that she and him were on a pilgrimage and Ayra had vowed not to take her hood off before they had reached their destination. After that they had no trouble getting inside the walls of the town with Anna as a merchant and Jacob and Leonardo as bodyguards for their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Ayra was amazed at the size of the houses and overall the human town. She had been to the one human friend she once had a few times, but she remembered it to be just one mansion. She had never been to a true town or city. It ws far larger than her old village and everything was far more lively. There were far more poeple than she had ever seen in one place. She was torn from her thoughts when something touched her on the shoulder. When Ayra turned around, she had barely enough time to react to what was thrown at her. But she somehow managed to catch it and saw it was a small purse with some gold at it. When she looked up, she saw that Lungulus was the one who threw it adn Jacob was the who to tapped her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize we are here too, right?\" Lungulus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra started to blush, yet, again, before she noticed Anna and Leonardo were missing. \"Sorry. Where did the other two go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna ran straight for the market to make herself some profit and I asked Leonardo to go after her, just in case she finds something that sparks HER interrest. And to get the food and other supplies. I'll be going and look for an armory of sorts and head for the local pub for information after that, so if you need me look in there. Would be nice if you guys could get us two rooms in one of the inns. Jacob has the gold. See you at sundown.\" With that Lungulus turn and started to walk of in on direction, after which he made a short stop to turn and add: \"Oh, and spend the rest of the gold on what you want. Good children should get a little treat every now and then don't you agree!\" After that he laugthed a little and ignored Ayra's angry shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who do you want to follow now?</span></div></div>",

Jacob walked along with Ayra before Ayra started a conversation. \"Why do you have that...stuff, around you?\" Ayra asked pointing her finger at him while spinning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked back confused, wondering what she meant. \"What stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...kinda like a blue fog or mist...\" Ayra said, trying to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since Jacob was released, he took a good look at himself. He noticed a turquoise-ish haze outlining his body. He moved his arm as the color followed. \"Hm. Probably cause I'm Einherjar now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra looked toward him, her eyes glistened curiously. \"Einherjar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob turned and looked back. \"I um....I was a normal human, but then these other Einherjar trapped me into a card. Einherjar can only be summoned by card. And when they are, they have this mist around them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra still spoke up. \"Still, what is an Einherjar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed. \"Guess I should've started at that. An Einherjar is basically a ghost. A person who once was. Einherjar don't age, and can be used over and over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra felt the grim situation Jacob was in and turned back to the street in front of them. \"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyra's ears perked slightly under the hood. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felt good to say that. Kinda like I needed to. Thanks Ayra.\" Jacob said smiling back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightest blush appeared on Ayra's face as she smiled just barely. \"Oh...y-your welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob found a suitable inn and walked up with Ayra to the counter. After a bit of negotiating, they finally snagged the two rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the others were most likely minding their own business, Lungulus was still looking for an armory. \"Isn't there even a SINGLE shop left that sells tomes I can use?!\" he thought. \"Sure, most people around here wouldn't be able to use anything better than the basic spells, but every last one up to and including the Arc-spells?!\" He let out a long sigh. It was obvious that the people would try to arm themselfs in fear of what might happen, but to this extend just seemed ridiculous! He was about to give up, when a sign in front of a run-down shop caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All seals for half the normal prize! Take three and have a forth for free! Got old, used weapons you don't need anymore? We buy them from you for their full value! Lottery for new customers included!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the shop Lungulus wasn't sure if this was worth a try or some stupid joke. It didn't look like the place was still suit-able for being used as a shop. Lungulus thought about it if he should give it a shot. In the end, with out much hope, he decided to go inside and take his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Anna was selling her goods like fresh, warm buns, despite her ridiculous prizes. But now that she was almost already out of healing items, there was barely anyone who even looked at her little self-made market-stand. Leonardo had finished buying all the supplies and was checking the condition of his bows, while observing Anna. As Anna noticed Leonardo with his a bow in his hand, immidiatly a sly grin came across her face. As she waved Leonardo over he already knew from the look on her face, she thought of another way to make some easy gold and that he wouldn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the little shop, Anna had already prepared everything she needed for her little idea. The moment Anna turned back from her preparations, she was met with the strict look on Leonardo's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mind doing me a favour Leo?\", Anna asked with an innocent look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends. If it means using me as some kind of advertisement of cheap mascot for your stand, then I'm sorry, but no.\" He replied, not really wanting to have to work for her in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, silly!\" Anna said giggling. \"We offer the people a little game. They pay some gold, then you and them compet in hitting something I throw in the air. The one who misses first loses. It's as simple as that.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, If I win you keep the money. But why should they even try? I'm sure you wouldn't give them back their gold or even twice of what they paid.\" The doubt in Anna's idea was clear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me to well at times, Leo.\" Anna awnsered, like it was some kind of compliment. \"But IF they win, They can choose a prize from the stuff over there.\" She said pointing over to the goods she just prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leonardo looked over to what 'prizes' Anna had in mind for the winners to choose from. Quiet a lot of things were of no use for him or anyone at all. There were a few useful things like a Sweet Tincture or some high quality dishes to get the first customers attention. Still he knew Anna would be able to keep this little shop turned archery booth running even when those things were gone. Also they could use the money...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll play along. How would you want to share the profit?\" Leonardo said, accepting the fact that even if he tried to decline Anna's \"request\" or whatever you would want to call it, she wouldn't stop bugging him until he agreed to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we know each other for so long I'll say 70:30. For me that is.\" She said, her voice sounding as sweet as she could possibly make it sound. Though Leonardo wasn't going to fall for her tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, you just said yourself, I know you to well at times and so do you know me. That means I'm not going to fall for you're tricks and you know what I think about this waggger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Anna replied a bit annoyed. \"65:35 in my favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"50:50 and nothing else. If I don't shoot an arrow, you don't earn a single coin from this and you know it.\" said Leonardo as emotionless and cold as Lungulus was whenever he was dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne look at Anna's face showed, that she was completely dumbstruck, but that changed quick and it was clear she felt badly insultedby him. Her voice was also a bit shaking as she told him to wait, while she was getting someone willing to test his or her skill at her shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he waited Leonardo got the feeling hw ahould keep a safe distance from Anna for some time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't fear the Taguel at all, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's there to be afraid of, ehh? They aren't some mindless beasts like most of the townfolk think. I'm surprised you even know their real name. First of all they won't be dumb enough to just kill a person on the street or attack the town. Second: Their home's gone. Got to rebuild that or find a new home over all and last... their elder remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus had made his way to the the local pub after Lady Luck has been on his side for once. Back at the store he was able to trade his Celica's Galeagainst an used Elthunder with 20 uses left, which he used to repair his old one with. On top of that the prices for the seals were compared to the other realms almost nothing so he bought two Master Seals for Anna and Leonardo as well as one and one free Change Seal for Jacob if he wanted to try another class and Ayra if she was willing to try out how the others fight. If she didn't though he could still use it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for him, the best was the fact that he actually won something in the lottery. A special forged weapon. It was a rare thunder tome called Superior Jolt. It was meant to be used in fight against other magic users, since it let you read the enemys magic flow. Usually this skill was only learned by Sorcerer or Sorceress of a high rank. Also the normal flaw of all thunder spells, the lacking accuracy, was slightly corrected in the forging process. Though 'forging' may not be the right term for the alteration or in some cases, simple translation of a spell to increase it's power. But the thing about it that was strengthened the most was it's ability to inflict critical damage to the target, when it hits. It would take a while till Lungulus would be able to use it since he just learned how to use C-rank tomes and this one was a B-rank one, he didn't wait to give it a fitting name, after all thunder magic was his favorite kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raiden's Wrath\". A perfect name, cause of the power this spell contained and the meaning of the first part. Translated it would be \"The Tundergod's Wrath\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally having arrived at the pub, he met the leader of a trading caravan. It was a man with a lot of experience in both: His job and drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus himself was quiet resistent to the efects of alcohol and was, when the others weren't there of course, always a good drinking companion. Mostly he used that to get information out of the people there, since he drank with them until they didn't even knew what they were saying anymore, or just didn't care. From time to time though, it was his way to forget what happend, if only for a short time. This time he did it for both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man and his caravan was just like Lungulus' group, headed towards a family of nobels that lived in the same direction they had been going so far. The only questions were if it were the same nobels and if they were willing to let a Taguel like Ayra travel with them, but the man didn't seem to have a problem with her people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind telling me, WHAT they remember? This head of mine isn't the best after a good 20 beer.\" Lungulus said having a hard time keeping his focus. The stuff in this pub was stronger than what he was used to and he had already drunken more than the other times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame your head for it boy. Most people don't even tell their kids what happend. They want to forget it.\" The man took a sip from his mug, before he scratched his beard, which was quite glorious. \"In simple, the hunt for the Taguel was cause of some of the high'n'mighty wanted to turn the fun around. Around my grandfathers time it were the Taguel hunting us, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So basicly, you they don't want the past to live up again and bite their asses.\" Lungulus said. \"Anyway you said your group was headed towards some nobles in the area?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a good memory boy. Yeah we have had some big orders from them for food and everything. They're also on good terms with the Taguel. Heck, we've been trading with the Taguel, too.\" The man said, falling silent after what he just said and having finally given Lungulus enough information, to get the conversation in the direktion he wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, mind taking a few more guys with you for a while?\" Lungulus said as friendly as he could sound. \"My friends and I are headed the same direction and I'm not really as confident with the travel.\" The man looked him over for a bit, before he smiled a little as he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well as long as you have what you need for yourself, you could tag along I guess. You're an kid and I see that. Name's Leroy.\" Leroy said while reaching out with his hand. Lungulus was glad that things were going smoothly for a while and shook Leroys hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine's Lungulus. My friend are probably going to come pick me up later, so tell them the detail about when we depart. I doubt I'd remember.\" Lungulus said, before raising his own keg. \"Cheers, Old man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth downed their keg in one go. For these two it would be a long evening, if not a long night.</span></div></div>",

Jacob and Ayra wandered aimlessly for awhile, looking around the town. \"Feels different from your village?\" Jacob asked, trying to start a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few. The buildings here are MUCH taller than what we had in the village. Many more merchants than the usual one or two we would get from travelers...That, and all the man-spawn...\" Ayra said, she spat out the last word like it was pure evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob chuckled lightly. \"You'll get used to it...Well at least I HOPE, you do.\" Jacob looked back at Ayra, still in the cloak Lungulus gave her. She seemed a little on edge, but was fine besides that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob wandered until he heard the sound of a familiar merchant. Turning the corner, Jacob and Ayra saw Anna talking to a Knight, who seemed to be wondering if he should buy one of Anna's Steel Lances. Leonardo was leaning on a post next to her stand. Jacob walked over to Leo as Ayra began looking at what Anna had. \"So there you guys are. We're gonna meet with Lungulus soon. You coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo sighed. \"I would, but Anna is bartering like a madman! This has been going on for about ten minutes.\" Anna glanced at him and just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed as he walked behind the Knight and tapped his shoulder. The Knight turned halfway as Jacob managed to slide a Buillion in his hands out of Anna's sight as he nodded and turned around. The Knight finally agreed to Anna's price as she handed him the Steel Lance. The Knight left as Leo pulled away from the post. \"Now, Anna?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping the gold in her hand, she nodded. \"Alright, alright...\" She said as she packed her things up. \"You bartered that guy to near-death!\" Leo exclaimed as she continuing packing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A merchant has to be as fierce as the client...or even more so.\" She said smiling devilishly. The three thought that they should just refrain from speaking to Anna right now and continue to the pub Lungulus was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's exactly what they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four entered the pub, they saw Lungulus and another man sitting at a table having a conversation. Jacob walked over as Lungulus spotted him. \"Oh, Jacob. And the others, this is Leroy. We'll be traveling with him since he's going where we are. Leroy, these are my friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man raised a mug of some drink. \"Greetings!\" The man roared cheerfully. Jacob nodded to him when Lungulus handed Jacob a bag. \"Here, I got some Seals you can use if you want.\" Jacob set the bag on another table and pulled out a Second Seal. Ideas for classes rushed through his head. After some thought, he decided to be...</span></div></div>",

Is there a room I could have some privacy?\" Jacob asked. The bartender nodded his head in the direction of a door leading into what would seem to be a restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded back to the bartender as he walked toward the door, leaving Anna, Leonardo, and Ayra with Lungulus and Leroy. Jacob entered and latched the door. Jacob then looked back at the Seal, his class in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always heard of Assassins but had never seen one...For good reason. Shadowy thieves and warriors with the ability to strike at  an enemy's weak point. He felt as though this class had a calling to him, being good with a blade and knives, and having some experience with bows. He soon focused and let the Seal float above him before the Seal released a bright light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it faded, Jacob wore a tight black uniform, with an odd chest plate and a dark hood. He had knives on his hips and arms. He had a quiver on his back along with a Silver Bow as he had his Killing Edge in his sheathe. He felt as though the uniform was tight, but that made sense. You needed little drag when sneaking. He then entered the main bar floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five turned and looked at his class as he moved a little uncomfortable from the stares. \"What?\" Jacob finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just a interesting class choice. I've never seen one really.\" Anna said. Jacob sighed and looked back at Lungulus, when he realized that his face looked kinda flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed, knowing what that could mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Lungulus drunk?</span></div></div>",

What Jacob couldn't see was that Lungulus was barely even sure of his surroundings anymore and just managed to keep up the charade towards the others. He was about to ask him how much he had drunk, but Leroy took the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're his friends? You sure are quite young to be traveling around these times.\" he said, raising an eyebrow. \"Ah, damn me if would try to tell you what to do and what not. That's you're families job.\" He emptied his mug after saying this and didn't see how Lungulus and Ayra lowered their heads a little, before looking back up at him. \"I guess I should tell you lot now when we depart, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be good to know.\" Leonardo said. \"And would you mind telling us if there is anything we should know about you, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man who was taught manners I see. Can't say that it worked with this guy to well.\" Leroy said looking directly at Lungulus who only smirked and took a sip from his mug. \"Departure is tomorrow moring, two hours after sunrise. You should know it's not only me, but my caravan you'll be travling with.\" The others were sure Ayra wouldn't be to happy about being around many humans for to long, but this was something she would have to deal with. \"The others may seem a bit hesitant in trusting you and... different about their ways, but aslong as you don't start trouble, there will be no problems.\" Leroy just then abruptly changed from his nice and friendly attitude and was suddenly completely seriuos and his voice seemed as sharp as a swords edge. \"We have 3 major rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1# Don't even dare thinking about touching something that doesn't belong to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2# Pick a fight with one of us and we're all gonna be you're enemys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd 3# Talk bad about us or make people think badly about us in any other kind of way and we will make sure to hunt you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about something like that!\" Anna said smiling innocently. \"I would never let anyone steal someone elses stocks. Merchants honorable word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest goes for us to.\" Jacob said. \"So I don't think there will be any problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to make it clear for you. Guess everythings settle now.\" Leroy said back in his friendly mood. It was surprising how fast his attitude could change completely. \"See you tomorrow then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet, old man.\" Lungulus suddenly said, his voice seemingly a bit unstable. \"You didn't forget what you said ten minutes, before the came in did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was looking at him wierd, except for Leroy looked around the room a little and over to the barkeeper. Lungulus just put on a sly grin, before he emptied his mug. Jacob wanted to keep him from it, but Lungulus was done with it before he could even react. \"You're paying, Leroy. I told you I could take this stuff.\" Lungulus said, before laughting loudly like some maniac which Leroy joined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are toughter than I thought, boy. I have no idea how you did it, but a deal's a deal.\" Leroy turned over and yelled to the barkeeper. \"I'll pay for the boy here too buddy!\" The barkeeperjust looked over to them and prepared the bill for what Lungulus had drunk. \"Though I think for today we had enough fun. I don't want to be waiting for you boy, so you and you're friends should get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, guess we should.\" and with those words Lungulus stood up and walked outside while trying his best to walk straight. He had the feeling, he would throw up at any moment now and didn't want to do so inside when the others were there. Neither did he want to pay the bill after Leroy had to pay now, nor did he want the others to see how much he had drunk in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was outside around a corner, spitting back out whatever he had eaten and drunken the last few hours, the others were saying goodbye to Leroy after making sure the marketplace was going to be the meeting place, before they leave the town. Once they were outside Lungulus was already waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling ok?\" Jacob asked as they started walking towards the inn where Jacob and Ayra rented their rooms. \"How much did you drink in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't much honestly. The 'normal' stuff is just a whole lot more intense than anything I had before. And that last one? Hell, I don't even know what that stuff was but... I think even if the inn gets torn down and I sleep on a pile of rocks, I don't think even a dragon burning my behind would wake me up.\" Lungulus said just following the silhouettes of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. As long as you get moving tomorrow morning I guess it's alright.\" Jacob replied. He was just happy he didn't need to carry Lungulus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were at the inn, Lungulus gave one of the Master seals to Leonardo and the other seals to Anna and Ayra, before guys and girls got in their separate rooms.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't too bright out, so he knew he had time to get ready to go. Jacob stood and entered an empty conjoining room and began to re-equip his new armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to get on at first. The armor was tight to help silence his movements, but did they ever think of allowing the person to breathe? 'Maybe I can lose a few pounds from this thing,' he said, finishing equipping his armor. Jacob looked in the mirror and decided to get rid of something on his new armor. His gauntlet had curved spikes, maybe to act as a weapon, but they seemed to bulky for him. After a bit of work, he managed to remove the spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob finally began to equip his new weaponry. He had a quiver of arrows on his back down by his hip, his bow attached to it. On his side pouch he had a Killing Edge ready. He knew this weapon an his new class would allow him to strike fast and hard. Jacob sheathed his weapons and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob walked out of the room to see Lungulus in the hall. \"Hey, ready to go?\" Jacob said, walking down the hall toward Lungulus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus turned and nodded to him. \"Yes. I was just going to get Anna, Ayra and Leonardo.\" He said as the two walked down the halls toward the rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob thought in his head. 'I wonder if they used the seals they got...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The others had used their given seals, too. Well at leastAnna and Leonardo did, while Ayra still had to think about her possible classes and if she was acrually going to use the seal at all. The thought of learning new skills and ways to fight was something that made her curious, but that also meant giving up the only way she learned to fight and she would have to start from the humans most basic form of fighting. As a Taguel she hasn't been in many fights, but it was her way to live, the way she hunts and the way her heart felt and was beating for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob could see in Lungulus' face, that he was a bit happy about Ayra not having used the Second Seal yet. Though Jacob wasn't sure if Lungulus was happy because Ayra was thinking this through or simply because he could still use it himself, if he had a reason to. The classes Anna and Leonardo picked were pretty obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna became a Trickster like most of her sisters that weren't purely focused on merchants business of buying low and selling high, but were OK with almost every way of making money. ALMOST every way. Her new leather armor was tight and very form emphasizing.  The parts around her side were red and more elastic tp allow free movement all the time. The middle of the front was in a neither bright nor dark yellow and made of a sturdier material than the rest. Her Levin sword was in it's shaft on the right side of her hip. This was also the first time that Lungulus noticed that Anna didn't have a little charm for good luck, or whatever they were good for, for her swords like all her sisters. Well, at least all he had met so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo had promoted to a Sniper. It wasn't much of a suprise for Lungulus, as for from what he knew of Leonardo's first life, he had also been a Sniper and he wasn't any good at riding horses. His new armor was part leather and metal in almost equal balance and looked the most protecting out of what everyone else in the party was wearing. The shoulder armor on his left shoulder also seemed to have gained an extra plating. Leonardo now also had to keep his quiver like almost all other bow users a bit over his hips in a horizontal position, instead of straight over his back like he prefered. That was something his new armor didn't allow or he would have to give up on a lot of mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had collected all the things they needed, the group made their way to the market place where they were suppose to met Leroy and his caravan. Along the way they were given a lot of wierd looks and while Lungulus was always able to shrug such things off and Anna and Jacob didn't even notice them, Leonardo and Ayra felt uneasy. Leonardo was always the most careful of the group and was 'cause of that from time to time a little paranoid in these situations. Ayra's problem was that the stares of the humans were different from the looks of her friends or her kind. These were looks of distrust and hate. At this point she was happy she had the cloak from Lungulus and hid her face deeper in the hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they spot a caravan packing it was obvious this must be Leroy's group, since there was no one else in sight. It was bigger than Lungulus had expected, when he convinced Leroy to let them come for the trip. It were probably 75 to 100 people in this caravan. What was a bit surpising was that there were a few groups, over all Lungulus spotted about 20 people, that wore cloaks or something else that hid everything about them, just like Ayra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone the less they would most likely have to report to Leroy and the fastest way to do so was to ask around for him. There was another person wearing a cloak walking by, though the woman wasn't wearing a hood. She had long hair that was black as the night and seemed to have a thin build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss?\" Lungulus said as he walked up to the woman, who immediatly turned around in suprise. She had dark blue eyes and a soft face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how can I help you sir?\" the lady said with a friendly voice and a smile on her soft face. Lungulus knew she was actually happy to see him. Her eyes showed disgust and annoyance, while she was trying to hide black feathers from his sight, but in the end failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, if I interrupt anything important, but is there a man named Leroy part of your caravan?\" He asked friendly. He just hoped Leroy  and his caravan didn't leave town yet and he was talking to the completely wrong person. His worry was without reason though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mister Leroy is the head of our caravan. Do you have any business with him?\" she asked raising an eye brow a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, WE do.\" Lungulus said pointing over to his friends. The woman looked over them once before looking back at him. \"Could you please bring us to him or tell him we're waiting for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Please wait for him here.\" she said, before turning around and leaving in towards one end of the caravan, all while quietly cursing Leroy from what Lungulus still heard from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her. Guess it's time for the old waiting game.\" Lungulus said back to the others. As the others started to chat a bit again Lungulus looked after the woman and thought he saw movement under the back of her cloak. Though what made him really suspicious of her was the fact that after whatever moved under her cloak there were more black feathers droping out from under it. He took the few steps the lady had gone so far and picked them up for a closer look. The were like large feathers of a raven, and they were suprisingly tough to damage, so he hid them in his own cloak, while waiting with the others for Leroy.</span></div></div>",

All of them. And we're all merchants and got a thing for getting coin.\" Anna finished off with a devious smile.

Not dangerously, but just in a sense of format, why she looked like that on a caravan trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungulus soon initiated a conversation with Leroy. Soon after, Leroy began to yell out to others to get the caravan moving. Lungulus approached the group. \"Alright, let's get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonardo walked up front near Lungulus and Ayra. A little ways back was Jacob and Anna, who continued conversing, Ana asking the questions now. \"So, what's it like?

However, only one skilled in the Swordmaster's Art can use them. Jacob saw this as a chance. Activating the Seal, it hovered and spun above him before shining light down.

Jacob looked in his inventory to see a Sol Katti, an Amatsu, a Killing Edge, and Mystletaiin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the room and approached the others in his new class. \"Swordmaster...Good choice.\" Leo commented.

She smiled at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't ill prepared, as she was a War Cleric, so she had decent armor on. She was given a forged Bolt Axe, which she called Advent, which took advantage of the magical prowess she was gifted with at birth. She always had a talent with magic, although she wasn't into anima spells or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after she left her village, she had traveled to the outskirts, where she came across a towering blue gate, obviously an Outrealm Gate. She had traveled through it to this realm, pull of wide and open plains.

He managed to become a holy warrior (Samurai) and emigrate to other realms before splitting away to explore.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob opened his eyes to see two of his weapons broken in front of him. A Killing Edge in pieces and a Micaiah's Pyre tome split in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Just great.\" he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could already see a pool of blood forming around him. He made a quick attempt to get up and move forward, only to stumble back to the ground. Unfortunately, that only served to open the wound even further. Unable to do anything, he laid on the desolate dirt road, when he saw a silhouette coming down from the plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is....\" he muttered before passing out on the ground, the wound getting more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise merrily walked down from the plains, hoping that she would make some way in her little journey. However, as she neared the dirt road, she saw some items off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Is someone there?\" she asked as she gently walked forward, gasping as she saw the form of a man badly wounded. \"Don't worry! I'll heal you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whipped out her Mend staff, letting it work its magic over the man, who she recognized was wearing clothes in a somewhat similar fashion to her own. She had seen them before. They were the clothes of a Samurai; in other words, a member of the Samurai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did he get a wound this bad?\" she asked herself as she kept tending to his wounds, not stopping until she closed the wound completely. It wasn't easy, as it took much of her strength to do so. However, it was successful as she soon saw the man breathing soundly. She smiled at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness.\" she sighed in relief. It wouldn't do to leave the unconscious man there, but she couldn't lift him up. Guess she knew where she was setting up camp for the night.</span></div></div>",

Something seemed off, but he ignored it. He sat up and noticed two things:<br>\r\n1. Was that his pants seemed to be replaced by a skirt of sorts.<br>\r\nAnd 2. Was a weight in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to see two bulges under his Samurai garb on his chest. He also saw his legs seemed a bit slender and smaller. He looked up and saw Denise, with a shocked look on her face. \"Ugh...What just-\" Jacob's hand flew to his mouth. His voice was higher pitched now, it sounded quite feminine, like it had a small dignified tone to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob scrambled for his sword and looked into the reflection to see a girl's face looking back. Her face seemed to keep it's composure, but had a more feminine bone structure now. Her hair was a dark brown, short down the sides as the back reached to the base of her neck. Jacob looked back up at her friend. \"Wh-what just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise replied quickly. \"I don't know. Maybe it's the realm or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed as Denise held her hand out to pick her new friend up. Jacob stood and wobbled with the new leg shape and weight on his chest, Denise catching her. \"It could take getting used to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob finally got it down, and now stood, blushing with her legs crossed slightly and a hand over her new assets. \"Th-thanks...\" Jacob replied with her new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was gonna be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

But she assumed that when they left, he would be back to normal. The two went toward the Outrealm Gate and left the Anna realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Besides, I think I hit my head somewhere, and wandering around aimlessly wouldn't do me any good.\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good points.\" nodded Greg. \"Well, you can come, at least until you think you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" smiled Sam as the two shook hands briefly. After that, Greg immediately urged them to get to the next town. Along the way, Sam asked him if he knew what realm this was. Greg shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I don't. I haven't met many people since I left Kirada, my hometown. There aren't a lot of maps for this kind of thing.\" Greg chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of easy-going for someone who's lost.\" muttered Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself.\" Greg retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not easy-going, just a little cautious right now. Like I said, I don't remember what I was doing before.\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at least you remember home and all that, right?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those are good.\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Greg left it at that. He wanted to find the next town before nightfall. Luckily for them, the town soon came over the horizon, and not a second too soon. It was an average town, nothing too out of the ordinary there. People were still bustling along the streets, getting any needed supplies for the day. Sam flinched a but at the large amount of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shy?\" smirked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manaketes don't generally hang around in human cities. We kind of stand out.\" said Sam who put his cowl over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you would. If the ears don't stand out, the lack of aging would.\" chuckled Greg. \"Hey, how old are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over 1000. Why?\" asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason. Just curious. Manaketes really do age slowly, just like the books said.\" nodded Greg to himself. This little journey was already off to an interesting start, and it would only get weirder with these two.</span></div></div>",

You two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel double-checked both ways as Greg and Samuel walked closer to the girl, urging them into the alley. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a dark brown Dark Mage uniform and held a time under her arm. \"Listen, I just need to test my new tome out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New tome?\" Greg questioned. \"What does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing.

He never heard many good things about Dark Mages after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you met many Dark Mages?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've met a few here and there, although what we just witnessed was a first.\" said Sam.

It was surprisingly a comfortable sleep, as he didn't know what to expect from these Inns in the Outrealms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and stretched, although for some reason, his limbs felt a little different than normal. However, he was still kind of half-asleep so he didn't really bother. He did have to remove something from his face though, which felt like his hair. That very thought was odd. Greg's hair was always short, so why would it be in his face? He still didn't think much of it, blaming the bedhead or whatever. Still, the kicker came when he tripped and fell over something soft, which turned out to be the sleeping pants offered by the Inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Didn't these fit when I got them?\" he asked himself. Immediately, his hands went to his mouth. That voice didn't sound familiar at all. As he struggled to get up, he saw that he even had to hold up his pants a bit to keep them up. Not only that, two mounds on his chest were obscuring his view. Gasping, and now fully awake, Greg ran to the bathroom provided by the Inn. Closing the door behind him, he looked in the mirror, his smaller hands on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was obviously no longer a \"he\", but a \"she\" now. She was smaller than she was before, shorter by a good couple of inches. The white shirt she wore draped over one shoulder, as she now wasn't big enough for it. The mounds poking through were obviously a C-cup at minimum. Her body was lithe and petite, although not so much to be considered non-healthy, and she certainly had a decent amount of muscle. However, a bigger shock was her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hair...it's red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's formerly blue hair was now a vibrant red, cascading down her face and back. To be truthful, the red color went nicely with her fair skin tone, much to her discomfort. Her eyes were lighter too, kind of like an orange-yellow color. It was like all the dark colors of her male self were replaced with brighter colors. Still wondering if this was a dream, Greg splashed her face a bit with the water that was there, although the same soft face remained after she did. She touched some places on her face, from her bigger eyes to her smaller nose and mouth. It felt so surreal. What had caused this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Greg had to put those thoughts aside as she knew that she had to get a bath done before starting the day. She sighed as she dropped her bigger clothes; this was going to feel like a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Afterwards*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg finished her shower after a while, finding it a bit of a pain as the water felt bizarre on her skin, and her hair took forever. She officially swore off making fun of Karen whenever she took forever in the bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Greg's surprise, once she dried her hair out, she quickly found a band and whipped it into a ponytail, still leaving her bangs around her forehead and face. She didn't know how she knew how to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weirder and weirder.\" she sighed again as she exited the bathroom, drying herself off and finding her clothes. However, she also saw that her clothes had changed. Her blue and silver Hero clothes were gone, replaced with the garb of a female Mercenary. The tunic itself was green, with the armor white. The pants were a typical dark color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....it's like someone  used a Second Seal on me.\" Greg sighed as she got her clothes on, stumbling a bit with the bra before getting fully dressed. Sam was still totally beneath the covers, so Greg decided to leave him alone for now and get some breakfast.</span></div></div>",

He went to roll over in his chest when something blocked him on his side. He groaned, not wanting to deal with something early in the morning like this. He then realized the groan that escaped his lips had a higher pitch than usual and sounded older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel decided he should get out of bed now, knowing that Greg's probably awake. He sat up and stood from the bed rubbing his eyes. Something was definitely up. He felt more limber than usual as he stretched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then he looked down to try and discover what the odd, heavy weight on his chest was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel was never good with measurements like these, but about half of her B/A-Cup assets hung above her dress and stuck out. The red dress she was now wearing barely covered her rear as she wore thigh-length boots and a pink cloak. The sad thing though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...this was only the second time it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was smaller then before, so he could deal with it, but now he had a body of...larger proportions. \"She\" sighed as she looked in her nightstand and saw a headdress on it. She sighed and picked it up. \"...Guess I should change.\" Samuel said, a finger pressed against her lips in surprise, even though she knew it was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel had been married before. He knew how to do things to help women out, like braiding hair, like what he was doing to himself right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair had hung off loosely and messy. After running it under water and straightening it out, she put her hair in a long neat braid. She soon picked up the gold headdress and put it on, along with her pouch of Dragonstones. She looked down to still see her partially exposed assets there and blushed nervously. She needed to find Greg. She soon left their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel went down the stairs to see a fairly empty bottom floor, but in the corner was a Merc eating her breakfast. Although their faces changed to a more feminine look, she could tell it was Greg as she approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The obvious Manakete features stood out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you ended up like this too, huh?\" Greg deadpanned, as if pretty much used to it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" said Sam as she sat down, adjusting herself on the seat. She didn't have a cloak now to keep others from seeing that she was a Manakete, which worried her. Thankfully, not many people were there, and those that were weren't paying much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....you're back to being a Mercenary?\" smiled Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, apparently. I guess it's not all bad. I still have my skills and weapons. I wished that I had kept my blue hair though.\" Greg groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red actually looks surprisingly good on you.\" said Sam, as she tried to lighten the mood somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess. You're surprisingly calm.\" said Greg. \"Guess being around for who knows how many centuries kind of takes most surprises away, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can safely say that I've never experienced this. You think that Dark Mage had anything to do with this?\" pondered Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm willing to bet it does, hence why I plan on searching after breakfast. It's the only reasonable explanation.\" said Greg. \"So get something to eat. I'd like to leave, one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sam got some breakfast, the two of them left  their inn key at the desk. They told the person at the desk not to ask when she mentioned not recognizing them. Greg went out and found a bigger cloak for Sam, as the little pink one wasn't near big enough. To be honest, as weird as this was, Greg did find some of her sword movements to not be affected much. Her muscles weren't too different, but a little slimmer and easy to move in. Her clothes moved well with her body. She could at least be thankful for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, their little search for the Dark Mage ended in failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that ended up as a waste of time.\" groaned Greg. It was bad enough running around in circles, but having a guy or two find her new look \"appealing\" didn't help. Sam laughed a bit as Greg rubbed her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should just leave. If there's one thing I heard about Dark Mage curses, they usually aren't permanent. This will most likely pass over. Meanwhile, I think we should leave to the next realm. I'd rather get far from here to be honest.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. I don't want them to see me either.\" said Sam. Luckily, Greg had seen the familiar swirling energy of an Outrealm Gate in the distance, so they knew their destination now. With that in mind, they began to make their way, with Sam shedding the cloak once they were further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do all female Manaketes wear clothes that small? Because, if so, you must have quite the culture.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of them, but some are like that.\" said Sam as they finally approached the gate.</span></div></div>",

The two looked at each other. \"Wondering what will happen?\" Greg asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel nodded slightly, \"I just hope I can get a better change of clothes at least. Still a little nervous about this part...\" Samuel said shyly, pulling up her dress to try and cover her assets on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed a little before the two nodded at one another and entered. Upon entering, they felt their bodies begin changing and they passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel opened his eyes to see the blue sky above him. He groaned and realized he was still a \"she\". She sat up slowly rubbing her head. \"Great...\" Samuel said as she heard a more country-accented voice. She stood up and looked herself over. She wore a grayish-blue breastplate with a small skirt of sorts. She wore a matching helm that allowed her long green hair to flow from under it. She recognized her instantly and saw she was Nephenee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Nephenee, huh?\" Samuel said looking herself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, he was interrupted by a noise nearby as she saw her friend stand.</span></div></div>",

Greg gawked at Sam a bit at seeing her new appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Greg, instinctively reaching for her sword, which down seemed to be slimmer in appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, calm down there! It's me Sam. This realm seems to have changed us.\" replied Sam, talking in that new country accent. Greg seemed to calm down a bit, taking a look down at herself. She now had on an orange tunic that also served as a short skirt, black gloves on her arms, and some black stockings to go with black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kind of look like Mia, a Tellius warrior from long ago.\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how in the world did the realm do that?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I've changed too obviously, but I don't get why.\" said Sam. However, she saw Greg laughing a tiny bit. \"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound kind of funny with that accent, given that you were a Manakete just a while ago.\" Greg smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" Sam shrugged.</span></div></div>",

He had never felt so different in his life, not even when he was that female Mercenary when that Dark Mage cursed them. That was a wild ride for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's eyes suddenly widened at those thoughts and looked at his hand, clad in his familiar Hero armor, bringing a relieved smile to his face. Not that being a girl was a bad thing, but he was glad to be in his familiar body. Even his weapons were all on hand. All felt good, except for the nagging headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" he heard a soft female voice. Greg raised an eyebrow, not recognizing that voice specifically. He turned around and practically blushed at what he saw. There was a female Assassin in front of him, the armor black in color. Her long dark hair extended down in back freely and her eyes almost bore into Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Greg sputtered. Was this Sam in another form?

He would unfortunately get his answer soon when something white flashed in front of him, making him blush even heavily than before. Immediately, he saw Sam in front of him, wearing the sparkling outfit of a Bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" smiled Sam as she did a little twirl in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....the.....hell?\" Greg sputtered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" pouted Sam, putting her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what the hell?\" Greg repeated more fiercely. \"The dress looks nice, buy why in the middle of a town? We're getting odd looks already, and I get the feeling that they're not good looks. Not to mention...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg trailed off a bit there. He wanted to say she looked better in her previous class. In combat, Brides were known as a great support class, which contrasted heavily with who Sam was, both as a boy and as a girl. Even Greg would have to admit that she looked better before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well I guess you have a point. I couldn't help myself.\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.

It comprised of a small, blue tunic with long sleeves that covered her torso and exposed a bit of her cleavage, along with a white cloak-like robe that acted as a skirt as well, a string tying it at the waist. She also wore some stockings that would reach the thighs and boots shorter than knee length. It also had a hair band designed similarly to the Dancer's.

The stockings showed off her slim legs, and he hairband kept her hair from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg felt as if someone had just hit him with a Thoron spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Greg? Is it alright?\" asked Sam, snapping her fingers in front of his eyes. Greg immediately shook his head, his face reddening at his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, r-right....umm...it looks good on you. Very flattering.\" said Greg as honestly as he could, getting a smile from Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you! In that case, it's a done deal. Thanks miss!\" cheered Sam, shaking the Anna's hand, who thanked her in turn for the purchase. Right after that exchange, Sam grabbed Greg's hand and they were off. Eventually, the thought of what this clothing style was finally made it back to the front of Greg's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sam, what class is that? I saw a flash, so it was a class change.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it was. She called it a \"Secret Blade\" seal. You know, kind of like the Dread Scroll that the legends speak off. She said that this class is kind of like a counterpart to the Dread Fighter, since only males can be those. It's meant to enforce a lady's fierce strength and subtle grace and majesty. What do you think of that?\" smirked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I see the grace part.\"</i> thought Greg, shaking his head again. He felt as if his prior knowledge of Sam was gone. This was Sam now, and Greg could barely keep his blush down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyway, perhaps its best to reserve an Inn. Perhaps tomorrow we can explore more of the realm.\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...sure.\" spoke Greg, getting Sam's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?

Keep your wits about you!\" commanded Greg as he ran around, doding fire spells that rained down from the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the realm of Bryyo, a land that was enbroiled in a bloody war. Greg had no idea how the war began, as it likely started long before he came around. The scene was dark and gritty, as soldiers of all kinds clashed with heavily armored knights and other such cavalry. There were plenty of mages around, skilled ones too, as meteor spells were raining down like there was no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" grunted Greg as he took cover behind a hill. \"This is what I get for getting involved in other world's problems.\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was searching through the Outrealms because he believed that something big was coming, and he needed to search out and find it. The last thing he was looking for was to stumble into a war. He wasn't stupid, and a pretty capable tactitian, but he didn't like getting involved in such matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother near miss with a spell broke Greg out of his mental state, causing him to stay on the move. He had powerful weapons on him, a result of his travels, and his Armsthrift skill allowed him to keep using them infinitely. Good thing too, because his side was clearly outnumbered. He hadn't even asked to get involved. They pretty much picked him up and dragged him along. Long story short, it was a pain in the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die!\" roared a paladin who was coming over the hill towards Greg. However, the dread fighter was hardly worried, as he clutched a yellow tome in his hands, powerful lightning crackling through his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mjolnir!\" came Greg's reply as a thunderous bolt of lightning like no other struck the paladin dead, clearly no match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, this will go on forever at this rate. I honestly have no obligation to this world anyway.\" sighed Greg. That being said, despite his complaining, he never wanted to leave people suffering, despite his rule of not wanting to get involved in dramatic affairs. Greg helped a male soldier to his feet, one that was bleeding on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here for a healer. You can't fight like this.\" said Greg, getting the soldier to a safe spot. After dropping him there, Greg ran back out, bringing out his forged brave sword Zenith. Zenith looked like a normal brave sword, but it was a bit slimmer, and it was mostly colored red. With the blade, Greg was too swift for anyone. As he cut them down and got a brief respite, he looked out over the land. He hadn't seen much so far, other than this one battlefield. He hadn't even got to visit any of this realm's villages or cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. Would have been quite a sight before it was ruined.\" he commented. </span></div></div>",

Greg remembered hearing stories of a man named Walhart the Conqueror, but after seeing this man, he already seemed tougher. Greg held Zenith, angered. \"Why's you kill him?! He was unarmed!\" Greg yelled at the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure merely turned and faced him before saying, \"Exactly. Therefore, he was useless.

He knew he could counter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until the arrow pierced his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg felt the sharp pain shoot into his back as he lost his form. Just as he did, he received a sharp slash across the chest from the Gae Bolg. He flew across the field and landed a distance away. That's when he heard his back shatter. He couldn't move, his body crippled. He heard the hooves of the man's horse galloping closer. Greg readied for death when...it jumped over him. The man seemed preoccupied with the larger battle below. Greg wanted to help, but he was too busy fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg awoke, laying in the same place as before but with more bodies piled around him. He still couldn't move with his broken spine. He laid as smoke and death filled his nostrils. He thought that this would be it. He would die from this wound. Then he noticed the sun glistening something by his hand on the ground. With what strength he had, he grabbed it and saw it was a...</span></div></div>",

They fought but ended up overwhelming him. They then dragged Jacob through the Outrealms until they reached a temple ruin. Jacob was laid on an altar of sorts as the Einherjar suddenly sealed Jacob into an Einherjar Card. They then threw it back through the Outrealms, hoping it would be lost forever. Jacob had no memory of a past family, not knowing if they were alive or dead. From being left in the card, Jacob would have the same glow Einherjar usually have.

Greg, out of options, summoned him. After a moment with bright light, Jacob laid in front of Greg before slowly picking himself up. \"Wha-? Where am I? What's-?\" He stopped to see Greg's bloody body and his weak stare. Jacob quickly knelt next to him, and slowly picked him up. \"Stay with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was out a few moments later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he was bandaged and laid...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg had no idea how much time had passed between the end of the battle and now. All he knew was that he couldn't get up at all. Heck, even moving one limb was a challenge. He remembered something in his hand, something small. He couldn't tell what it was, but he knew that the sun glistened off of it before he passed out. Anyway, Greg's eyes slowly fluttered open as he heard the cracking of a fire nearby. Opening his eyes further, he could see that it was nighttime now, and he could vaguely see someone near the fire, emitting a blue glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" muttered Greg to himself at the strange man. The man obviously heard him though, as he almost immediately turned around and smiled. Greg could make out features of the man. He looked about the same age, with dark hair on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, you're awake. I was beginning to worry that you might never wake up.\" said the man as he came over with a bowl he had. Greg could tell that he was leaning against a rock or something, and he was able to raise his left hand high enough to take the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks.\" Greg stuttered out, having a little difficulty with talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. Got to admit that that I was surprised to see such a battlefield after finally getting out of that hellhole.\" muttered the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hellhole?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The card you had. Purely by luck, the card found its way towards you, and you put just enough power into it to activate it.\" said the man. Greg squinted his eyes at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Card....Wait, that card I had.....It was an Einherjar card.....I'm sure of it.\" Greg said between pauses. He then looked at the man again. \"Are you an Einherjar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, sort of.\" said the man, laughing as if it was no big deal. \"Got into a little too much trouble. But I'm obviously not a real Einherjar since I can actually remember being in the card. Thanks for that by the way.\" said the man, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....no problem.\" said Greg, feeling pain throughout his body. He was bandaged up a bit, but it did little to help the torn ligaments and his broken back. Greg then turned his attention to the man again. \"So....who the hell are you anyway?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Jacob.\" he replied curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure.\" replied Jacob. Gathering enough strength, Greg turned his head to the right, looking over the now desolate battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the battle go?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. It's been like this since you summoned me. I don't know what happened while I was in the card.\" said Jacob. Greg sighed, wondering if anyone was able to survive the bloodshed. He turned to Jacob again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....I see you're a tactician. You apparently.....don't have any weapons.\" said Greg after catching his breath a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of came without them.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should fix that.....and get your \"condition\" checked while you're at it.\" chuckled Greg, which only brought more pain to his wrecked torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, although I can't say I disagree.\" said Jacob. \"Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if any enemy units come back. However, you can't really move at all in your condition. Tell you what, I'm going to take a short walk over to the nearby village and get some supplies and maybe a doctor if I can. Elixirs and vulneraries ain't going to fix you up at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine.....just hurry.\" said Greg, breathing had a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jacob ran off, heading to the nearby town. It would probably take him about 10 minutes at least to make it while running, so Greg wasn't going anywhere for quite a while. Greg felt like hitting something. Sitting still wasn't a strongsuit for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" he sighed and leaned back. \"I could use a miracle right now. Things can't look any drearier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouldn't have said that. As he did, he felt a raindrop. Then another. And then another. And soon enough, he was getting poured on in about a few minutes. Greg sighed again, resting his hand on the ground. He really wished for a miracle right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made that wish, a bright card-shaped light appeared underneath his right hand.</span></div></div>",

A bright card-shaped light was appearing there, and Greg lightly tightened his hand around it. He couldn't see what was on the card at all. However, he knew that it felt warm, almost like a mini-sun. It felt good, compared to dreary conditions Greg had been fighting for the past few weeks or so. Given it's shape, he wondered if it was yet another Einherjar, except that he knew there wasn't one before. Was it answering his prayers? Greg wasn't often the type to believe in luck, but he certainly could use the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one way to find out.\" he said as he put a bit more power into the card, and the light began to burst, forming a wall of blue light. Greg watched in awe as the blue light shaped itself into a human form, looking like a young girl, according to Greg anyway. The light gave way to long shining red hair with fair skin. The being wore a red sage-like outfit, with some golden pieces of armor. The top of the outfit felt a little bit of her midriff exposed, but just a little. Greg gasped as the light died down more and the being took shape. The girl's eyes fluttered open, revealing red eyes that reminded Greg of a crystal ruby. It was gorgeous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the appearance was very different, Greg could still pin down who the girl was. She was Celica, known as the \"Blessed Maiden\" from the Valentian lore. The girl who helped form the kingdom in the first place. Of course, that wasn't the only thing on Greg's mind. The girl's beauty was....striking, even to someone like him who didn't know a thing about romance. That aside though, the girl soon noticed that it was raining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain.....where...am I?\" she asked slowly, mostly out of confusion for where she was. However, Greg groaned a bit, and that caught her attention. Celica turned her eyes toward Greg and gasped upon seeing his injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, are you alright?\" she asked after running over to him. Ignoring Greg's red face, Celica took notice of his wounds and broken back, being an expert in this field. She nodded as she formed the conclusion in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, don't move. I'll patch you right up.\" she said, giving Greg a sweet and reassuring smile. Greg's face turned about as red as her hair. Celica closed her eyes, putting her hands on Greg's torso. A small light emitted from her palms, and Greg could feel the energy entering him, seemingly putting his bones and ligaments back into place. Of course, such a procedure wasn't painless. Greg grunted in discomfort as everything was shifting back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Your injuries are extensive, so I'll have to keep this up for a while before they're healed.\" said Celica, as cool and calm as a cucumber.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Thank goodness she's looking at my wounds. My face must be burning red by now.\" </i>said Greg, somewhat embarrassed by having such a girl near him. Back home, he barely had any girls talking to him. His little sister, Karen, was perhaps the only one who cared to talk to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, as she kept healing, Celica gasped a bit, yet not losing her concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, I never introduced myself. My name is Celica, princess of Zofia. What is your name?\" she said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Greg.\" he replied softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my pleasure, although I wished we met under different circumstances.\" said Celica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's okay. This doesn't happen so often.\" mumbled Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that.\" Celica smiled at him. Celica's magic could quite some time, given the extent of Greg's injuries. In fact, it took so long, that Jacob was already walking back before she was done. While still out of sight, Jacob caught a view of the spectacle, seeing the maiden healing Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it's a good thing I couldn't find a good doctor. Would have been a waste.\" grinned Jacob.</span></div></div>",

While he was gone, he also restocked himself with weapons and found a tome on him, now leaving him equipped with a silver sword, killing edge, and the tome Valflame. Jacob walked over and bent on the other side of Greg across from Celica, who just noticed Jacob. \"I can't thank you enough for helping my friend here. I'm Jacob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celica.\" She replied with a smile, but still worried about Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This rain's not doing him any good. Come on,\" Jacob said. Jacob slid his hands under Greg's back as Greg clenched his teeth and winced a bit in pain. Although she healed him, the pain was still there for the most part. \"Sorry. I'm being as careful as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob finally got to an area of trees near a mountainside and laid Greg under them, keeping them out of the rain. \"Thanks...\" Greg said back. Celica still saw he was weak and couldn't help feel bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry this was all I could do,\" Celica told Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fixed me up. I'm better than before and I'm not gonna die at least, thanks Celica.\" Greg replied, smiling as best he could. Celica smiled back and laid by Greg. She curled next to him and laid a hand in his hair as she gently brushed it out of his face. Greg's face was red for a moment, surprised at her actions to make him feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sat at the side and chuckled, when he fell. Greg watched as Celica jumped up to catch him, but he was gone as blue flames developed his body and he disappeared. They were both shocked at how he disappeared. \"Where'd he go?!\" Greg said at his friend's disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica was about to speak when she saw something on the ground. She picked it up and handed to Greg with a worried expression on her face. Greg grabbed it and saw it was Jacob's card. Greg looked it over for a moment. \"Poor guy...\" Greg out enough strength into the card to cause a bright flash as Jacob laid on the ground. Celica knelt over him and turned to Greg. \"Let's get out of the rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica helped Jacob up and leaned him against a tree out of rain's reach as Greg, still weak an hurt, was able to move. He sat himself next to Jacob, who was coming to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh...what...?\" Jacob began before Celica silenced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, shhh. I'm not sure what just happened, but I know you need rest. 'Kay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded and rolled into a small patch of grass as Celica sat next to Greg. A few moments later they all fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Blinking a bit, he rubbed his eyes and looked around the campsite. He felt something warm to his left, so he looked to the left and saw Celica leaning against his shoulder, perfectly asleep. Greg smiled at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you wouldn't think she was a royal or something when you see her like this.\" said Greg, briefly ruffling her red hair. He nudged her a bit, trying to get her awake. He noticed that his arms and torso felt a lot better, if not a bit sore. However, it was more than enough for him to finally be able to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl really knows her healing powers huh?\" Greg heard from his right. He looked over to see Jacob already awake, getting himself some breakfast. He looked like he had been awake for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got up early.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bit of a light sleeper last night. Not too much of a problem though.\" said Jacob. After he said that, Greg turned to Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty rare to find someone who can heal without a staff. To date, I thought that only Micaiah, the fabled Priestess of Dawn, could heal with a staff, and those required her own life force or something.\" explained Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she truly is a wonder. I can see why what you're infatuated.\" smirked Jacob. Greg instantly went red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! What are you implying?!\" Greg practically yelled, which ultimately roused Celica from her sleep. Her red eyes fluttered open as she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Greg. Ah, your wounds seem to be all healed now.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah.\" Greg stumbled a bit, making Jacob laugh. After Celica helped him up, Jacob got some breakfast for all of them. As they began to eat, Celica looked at Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Jacob, what happened to you yesterday? What was that card?\" she asked. Jacob almost choked on his drink when she asked. Obviously, as he predicted, Celica didn't know anything about the Einherjar. She didn't even know that she was one herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say it's a curse someone placed on me some time ago. It happens.\" said Jacob. Celica's face became sad at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful. I'm sorry that I can't help though. My powers don't work on curses.\" she said solemnly. Jacob gave her a reassured look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's okay. I can deal with it.\" said Jacob. Celica cheered up a bit as she went back to her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now? The battle here is long over, but I'm sure the war is still going on.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to keep fighting the war?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I honestly prefer not to get involved in other world's affairs like this, but I don't like leaving people behind to die.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's reasonable. I haven't seen anymore fighting in this area. I wonder if they've moved to some other place.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing is for sure though, I have to find that man again. The rider who gave me these wounds.\" grunted Greg. \"He was no ordinary man. I have to figure out why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica gave him a worried look. \"That might not be wise. If he could give you those wounds so effortlessly, he might be beyond any of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but I'm not giving up. I left my home because I felt something big was going to happen. Perhaps that man is part of it. I don't know, but I need to find out for sure.\" said Greg, not budging on the subject. Jacob smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're certainly driven. I don't think I have anywhere else to be right now.\" said Jacob. Celica had a worried look on her face, but Greg wasn't surprised. Celica was known as a princess who honestly despised fighting. Going head straight into a war was not something she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to come if you don't want to Celica.\" said Greg. Celica then looked him in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I would rather be with you. I don't want either of you to die, so I'm going to keep it that way.\" she said, a little more resolute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" laughed Jacob as he rose from his sitting position. \"Well, shall we get going? One way or another, we need to be on the move.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" said Greg. All three of them packed up their gear, and they were all soon on the road, heading towards wherever the path took them.</span></div></div>",

They soon reached the gate of swirling power, and stood before it. \"Alright,\" Jacob said, \"Let's see where we go.\" The three looked at each other and then entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey traveled through swirling light and colors when Jacob held a hand to his head. \"Jacob,\" Greg asked, \"Are you al-?\" Just then Greg felt odd, and so did Celica as they all went unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg awoke a little later, and sat up. He was normal and he saw Celica waking up a foot or two away. Greg stood and headed to her and helped her stand, then they realized Jacob was gone. They spent a few seconds looking around when they heard something by a tree. The two looked and saw Jacob bound to a tree with shackles and gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob?! What the hell happened to you?!\" Greg said shocked, running to his side along with Celica. Jacob shrugged and tried to pull free. When he pulled his back away, Greg saw a symbol behind Jacob's back drawn against a tree. \"What's that?\" Greg said pointing at it. Jacob strained to look but couldn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...it looks like a dark magic seal.\" Celica pointed out. That didn't make Jacob feel any better, as he strained at them more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, give us a second,\" Greg said, when he heard the noise of crows. They turned and noticed a murder of crows flying above them in a close formation. They flew around until they suddenly disappeared and a boy with white hair and a plegian dark Mage outfit in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing with my test subject?\" The boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob had said something under the gag, but it couldn't be understood. \"What do you mean test subject? This guy's our friend!\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The boy replied, \"You mean he's alive? But when I found him he was dead as a....well, dead thing. Can I at least test on him?\" The boy asked pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Greg and Celica said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww! It was gonna be a pretty explosion! Especially with a live subject, and with him having more blood in his body.\" Jacob was struggling more than ever trying to get out. \"Alright. Give me a second.\" The white-haired boy took out a key and unshackled Jacob as he pulled the gag down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell's wrong with you, kid?!\" Were the first words out of Jacob's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

As Greg saw the figure come into the view, it was clear that it was a young female, probably in her late teens. She appeared to be a mercenary, wearing a yellow-ish outfit with long red hair. Greg could see that the girl was quite good looking. Although, one part he couldn't get past was the scowl on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeees, my dear daughter?\" said Henry, his smiling face not missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Daughter?!\"</i> yelled the group in their minds. What the hell was this guy talking about? This girl looked almost older than he was. The girl didn't seem to think much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing out here?! Mom's looking for you! Gawds!\" yelled the girl. Greg nearly had to plug his ears at her verbal assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't be like that Severa. You know I'm always on time.\" said Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear it. Let's just get back to mother. Gods, why am I always having to look out for you? It should be the other way around.\" said Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I always stay out of trouble. But when I saw this guy bleeding, I just couldn't resist.\" said Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be the one losing blood if you don't move it!\" Severa snapped, clearly losing her temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, blood.....\" sighed Henry, as if the thought made him content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....the....hell?\" was all Greg could say. These two seemed to be as mismatched a duo as you could ever come up with. <i>\"Well, she's cute, but she's got quite the motor mouth.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera's face was beat red as she grabbed Henry's collar, almost dragging the poor guy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, bye bye!\" yelled Henry, waving to them like a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that was weird.\" said Jacob as Henry was dragged away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were interesting characters.\" said Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in a good way.\" said Jacob. Then he turned to Greg. \"So what now Greg? We've found a new realm and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Perhaps we should explore a bit. I don't think we should return to Bryyo until we're fully ready. Might as well take in the sights as we do. I never got to see much in Bryyo.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good plan to me. Should we follow that girl?\" suggested Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's a good idea.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Greg?\" asked Celica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg thought for a minute about what to do.</span></div></div>",

It was pretty easy since the girl kept yelling at Henry, who's somehow her father. They soon followed them to the edge of the forest and saw that there was food laid out. Henry was sitting with the girl as a woman in silver Pegasus armor and red hair with a wing in it. They watched until they realized the woman saw them and began approaching. The thought of hiding crossed Jacob's mind when he decided not to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked out in front of her as Greg and Celica soon followed. \"I don't believe we met,\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we haven't,\" Jacob replied plainly, \"To be honest, we're not from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never been to Ylisstol?\" The woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob had heard of it, but never did. \"No. But I mean...we came through the Outrealm Gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of understanding crossed her face, \"Oh. Well, what made you come here?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he,\" Jacob said, pointing at Henry, \"thought that it would be nice to use me as a test subject while I was out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed and turned back toward them, \"Henry! What'd I say about random experiments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Henry yelled back, \"But it was gonna be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed and turned toward Jacob, \"Sorry about my husband. My name's Cordelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob. This is Greg, and that's Celica.\" Jacob said, Cordelia unphased by her being Einherjar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you join us?\" Cordelia offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob exchanged a glance with Greg and Celica, and they decided. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia smiled, \"It's nice to meet you.

Jacob has no idea where he's from.\" said Greg, to which Jacob gave him a little glare. \"Personally, I'm surprised that you weren't surprised at all by me saying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had our own runs through the Outrealms. Not the most enjoyable times. We kept fighting Risen who kept stealing stuff.\" said Cordelia. Celica gasped a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible. Wait, what's a Risen?\" asked Celica. Most of them gave her an odd stare. Greg realized that Celica would naturally know nothing about the Risen, having come from the Einherjar card and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, not many Risen have come around where she lived. They're reanimated soldiers that destroy anything in their path. Although I see our friends here have said that they often have other interests.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nya ha ha, that's for sure. Too bad they never noticed the curse I put on them. Oh, it would have been so good....\" Henry trailed off, making Severa sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously dad, couldn't you act normal for once?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am normal.\" replied Henry, his smile not fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what concerns me.\" thought Greg. This \"family\" didn't seem to be that functional. Henry and Cordelia seemed to really like each other, but Severa was 100% different from both of them. Suddenly, Cordelia turned to Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you never told me where you're from.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm from Zofia on Valentia.\" said Celica, smiling as she said it. Cordelia's eyes widened in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valentia? But that's....\" she started to say before Greg interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a different one. Not the one you know.\" Greg said quickly, his face going red. Most of them looked at him confused, but seemed to accept his answer. Jacob then spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I heard Severa say something about Henry being her dad? What's up with that? She almost looks older than both of you.\" said Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you wouldn't know since you're not from here. We recently had....well, some problems, and Severa and some other kids from the future came back because their world was destroyed.\" said Cordelia. Severa turned her head away, not in the mood to remember something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that explains it. Although last I checked, time travel really screws things up sometimes.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I never would have met my cute little daughter without it.\" laughed Henry as he one-armed Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, get your hands off me!\" she struggled against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter is quite the firebrand.\" said Greg. Cordelia smiled at his remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She certainly independent. She had a rough time as you might imagine.\" said Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" said Greg. By this time, Severa had gotten out of Henry's grip. Still mad, she got up and walked away, stomping her feet as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give her time to cool off.\" said Cordelia, as if she was used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" said Greg, face still a bit red from earlier. Unfortunately, Henry misinterpreted his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Greg, she is single. Nya ha ha!\" laughed the dark mage. Greg's face then went as red as Severa's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! T-That's not....!\" Greg protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed at that, except for Severa, who had just came back and heard her dad's remark, her face as red as Greg's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do the gods hate me?\" Greg mumbled.</span></div></div>",

Jacob wasn't in the mood though for eating with a man who wanted to see the blood blow from his body, so he just stood and listened. Doing that, he heard something back in the direction of the forest. Jacob turned back to the group to see then talking quite a bit. It seems Henry made another embarrassing comment, starting another conversation. Jacob didn't want to worry any of them, so he went on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked through the forest when he reached a small opening from where he heard the noise. He looked around and saw nothing. When he turned to leave, from out of nowhere he was surrounded by...rose petals?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob watched in confusion as rose petals flew around him from nowhere. He then heard a voice of a girl laughing, then he heard a Pegasus neigh, then he was hit by something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob flew backwards and hit the ground as something landed on him. His vision was somewhat blurry, but he saw that a girl with blue hair was now sitting above him holding her head. \"Ugh! What just-...?\" She stopped when she saw Jacob. \"Ohmigosh! Are you okay?\" She said, still sitting on top of him. Jacob replied simply with a thumbs up and weak stare. Just then he heard something to the right and saw two people. A man in royal-like armor and another Pegasus rider with grey hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia? Are you alright?\" The man said when they both saw Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pegasus rider crossed her arms smiling, \"I didn't know you had a boyfriend Cynthia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jacob wasn't being sat on, he would've pushed away. But luckily the girl, Cynthia, jumped up and faced them, \"Mom! He's not my boyfriend! I was practicing entrances and my Pegasus knocked me off and I hit him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood above Jacob as the other woman joined him, \"There are better places to sleep than on the ground you know? Come on,\" the man reached a hand out as Jacob took and stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. My name's Jacob, by the way.\" Jacob replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Chrom, Captain of the Ylissean Guard. This is my wife Sumia and that's out daughter, Cynthia.\" The man explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob recognized the name and knew it seemed important, \"Sorry, I'm...we're not from this realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but who's 'we'?\" Sumia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and my friends met another Pegasus Knight named Cordelia and her family, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cordelia?\" Chrom said, \"We're just going to see her. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob went along as Cynthia helped him along a little bit. \"I'm so sorry! I honestly didn't mean to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob chuckled dryly, \"It's alright, I'm okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia turned and looked at them, \"You sure you aren't boyfriend and girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jacob and Cynthia went red in their faces, \"Mom!\" Cynthia yelled back as she and Chrom laughed. After a few moments the arrived at Cordelia's picnic with others already joining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She didn't talk much to him after the incident, probably out of embarrassment. Greg noticed that Severa didn't talk much to him either, probably out of the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now what?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should decide whether or not to keep on moving or perhaps stick around a while.

He looked at himself as he appeared to be in some kind of blue cloak and seemed shorter than before. He looked over and saw Celica, in a red dress laying there, when he noticed her ears were pointy. He walked over and shook her. She awoke with a start as Greg explained what happened. \"I think we became Manaketes here,\" Greg explained that Manaketes were powerful dragons. Celica stood as Greg noticed a few more of his feature as his limbs were skinnier, and his ears pointier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did this, he heard Celica start giggling. He turned to see what she was looking at and stifled a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's eyes opened slowly. His body felt...wrong, in almost every aspect. Feel, shape, senses, all of it. Jacob stood up on all four feet before looking at Greg and Ce-. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour feet?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob turned his head toward his body and saw he was a dark brown wolf with the Tactician robes draped over his back like a coat. Jacob looked at his form and growled, obviously angry at the sudden change. Then he realized that Greg and Celica were awake a few feet away and watching him. His face went red, even as a wolf as he looked embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica walked over and petted Jacob on the head, \"Poor thing,\" Celica said, \"First you have that card curse, and then that Mage captures you, and now you're a Laguz.\" Celica ran her hand over his head and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackb growled back lowly but finally worked a grin up. Jacob then saw a pouch hanging from their waists. He poked one with his nose. \"Oh. What are these?\" Celica inquired as her and Greg opened then and pulled out small stones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Celica?\" Greg began before each was engulfed in light and in there places was Greg as a blue dragon, Celica a pink one. They looked down at Jacob awestruck. They soon turned back and looked at each other. Jacob seems to have trouble switching forms as he's stuck like that. Celica walked back over and knelt next to him. \"This realm seems...to weird to me,\" Greg said. \"If we have to stay here fine. But I don't think it'll bode well for me or Jacob.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded. \"What do you wanna do Celica?\" Greg asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica decides to...</span></div></div>",

Greg and Celica seemed to already be handling their forms well, Jacob on the other hand, not so much. He felt awkward walking on all fours, even though it wasn't uncomfortable. Jacob tried to keep the coat on him as he walked which was only slightly difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they reached the town and saw many of the people had animal features. Ears, claws, tails even, it was weird for the trio to see this. Houses were made and looked similar to modern ones, with the exception of a few shacks. Then they came across a cart selling stones, food, and etc. Greg walked over and grabbed two Dragonstones for him and Celica. He turned to see Celica with a piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing with that?\" Greg asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica bent down and held it in front of Jacob.

Greg and Celica pulled up their hoods on their cloaks, then Greg turned and saw Jacob just getting wet. Greg smiled and walked over and pulled the hood on his tactician coat on his back over his head. Jacob nodded thankfully and barked quietly as the three entered a nearby inn. The girl at the counter had cat ears and a tiger tail. Greg approached the counter and got a room with two beds. As they walked away, the bartender said, \"That's a cute wolf you got there. Interesting that you dressed him up though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob let out a barely audible growl and just kept walking as Celica held a giggle in. The room had two beds and not much else besides a nightstand in between them. Greg took one and Celica the other. As they were getting ready, Greg realized Jacob had nowhere to sleep and was still drenched. Greg smiled, \"Hey Jacob, come on.\" He walked over and hung Jacob's coat up as he walked Jacob up onto the bed as he laid on it. Greg finally got on too and petted him before Jacob moved to the foot of the bed. The three fell asleep quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had a recurring dream of the rider who took him down at Bryyo.

I'm fine, really.\" He petted him as Jacob just sat there and let him. Greg looked out the window to see it was early morning. \"What do you say about leaving now?\" Jacob nodded as Greg got up and packed a few of their belongings. Jacob jumped on Celica's bed and walked next to her face and licked her. Celica woke up and looked at Jacob, who's face was red with shock at what he just did. Celica laughed and hugged him as she got up and packed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three left and went down the next road until they found the next gate. \"Alright Greg, ready to leave?\" Celica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

They seemed to get a nod from Jacob on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go then.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio packed up anything they had and went downstairs. They waved a brief good bye to the lady at the desk and walked out on to the street after grabbing a little bit to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least the food is pretty good.\" said Greg, which also got a nod from Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, although being surrounded by all these beast-people gets a little unnerving after a while.\" said Celica. They got a little whine from Jacob, which seemed to say that he agreed. Anyway, after getting their little bit to eat, the trio walked their way out of the town, heading out on the road. They needed to find another Outrealm Gate to escape to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what kind of realm do you think we should go to next?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hasn't it been kind of random?\" asked Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just figured I'd ask where you'd like to go.\" smiled Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Well, I'd really like to visit Valentia sometime. I'd like to introduce you to everyone back home.\" smiled Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her say that brought a pang to Greg's heart. Celica, being an Einherjar, believed that she was the real Celica, when in reality she was a mere reflection of the ancient queen. Greg felt sorry for her. He didn't want her to learn that she was really just a phantom. She believed that she was real, and Greg didn't want to take that away from her. But at the same time, he figured that she might figure it out sometime. He barely managed to escape explaining back when they stumbled upon Ylisse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, before Greg could think further, they saw the familiar swirling energy of the Outrealm Gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, say good bye to beast world.\" smiled Greg, as he and the other subtly passed into the energy of the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Greg came to inside the gate, he felt his old body back, complete with his old gear. He turned to Celica, and she was back to normal too. They both heard groaning behind them, and saw Jacob standing up, fully returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to stand on two legs again.\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine so.\" said Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, it was time for the trio to continue on.</span></div></div>",

Greg walked over it and grabbed it, and then he heard a voice. \"Ugh...the hell happened...?\" It was Jacob's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob?\" Greg said kinda freaked out. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg? Why do you seem so much bigger? Where am I? What happened?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic, but you just became a sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Jacob said in shock. In a reflection he saw he was a long silver sword with a purple gem in the hilt and a gold encrusting around it. His sheath was purple and black. \"What do we do? Where's Celica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked around when he saw a wind tome on the ground. He opened it and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg! Greg! Help please! Please Greg!\" He heard Celica yell, fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celica! Shh shh, it's gonna be okay, alright? Please trust me.\" Greg then explained what happened and that Jacob and Celica were able to talk to each other already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now,\" Celica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can explore it. It looks like this realm has a bit of fighting to do with it.\" Greg said, making Celica uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob groaned, \"Fine. Just keep me around.

Just let me find a town and I'll try some maintenance on you two.\" Greg chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, the sword and tome moved down the road to a nearby town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was because you were an Einherjar or something.\" suggested Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about me?\" asked Celica. Greg didn't know what to say. He didn't want to reveal to her that she was in Einherjar too. He had to come up with some explanation for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it also has something to do with where you're from or something. I don't know. I don't make the rules of this realm.\" said Greg. As he said this, he got a good look at Celica's tome form. It was a wind tome, but it seemed to have a design of her tiara on the front cover, and on the back had some designs from her sage outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" said Celica. With that said, Greg neared the nearby town. When he got to it, he was quite surprised. Everyone is town seemed to have some sort of weapon on them. Even the women had at least a dagger or something. It kind of creeped Greg out to some degree. Looking to his left, he saw a man sitting there nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me. I'm not from around here, but could you tell me where I am?\" Greg tried to ask politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ForgeRealm. A place where everyone has at least something to protect them.\" said the man simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well thanks.\" said Greg as he walked further in. \"It's a good thing I'm a Dread Fighter, so you guys fit the look perfectly.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, but what now?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there seem to be a lot of forges, but not a lot of people next to them. I wonder if we have to use them ourselves.\" pondered Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how to?\" asked Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Never used one before.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we gotta do something.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Don't worry. I'll find something for you two.\" said Greg. After some more walking, he turned to a little nearby forge. It seemed to have everything one could want, including anything to forge a weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, talk about well stocked, but how to do maintenance?\" Greg pondered even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

When it cleared, Greg was now in a green apron with tan work clothes underneath. Greg looked around the forge and now knew what everything was and how to use them. He unsheathed Jacob and held him out. \"You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Jacob said. Greg placed Jacob in the fire and took a nearby hammer and waited until Jacob was glowing hot, and placed him on an anvil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he alright,\" Celica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. Right Jacob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Jacob replied. Greg continued and ended by engraving the name \"Jacob\" into the blade. He held Jacob up as he glistened in the light.

I'll get back to you when you cool down and finish with Celica.\" With Celica, all he did was read through the tome and translate some of the text inside, making it preform more efficiently. He then placed her on his hip as he picked Jacob up and sheathed him again. Greg wiped the sweat from his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Jacob said. \"I feel...better, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded and walked out from the forge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'd like to sign up.\" said Greg. The man nodded at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right. Go on in and wait your turn.\" said the man. Before Greg could leave, the man tossed a seal at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. I see you found one of our Blacksmith seals. Good for craft work, but not so much for combat.

Greg unsheathed Jacob and held him out in front ready to strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Trickster jumped and missed with his Iron Sword as Greg jumped out of the way. He took the opportunity to strike and did so again as the man went down. The crowd roared in approval.

I'm not going to string you up again.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason, I have trouble believing that.\" said Jacob. Celica smiled at Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Jacob. I think Henry's a good person, even if he has a weird sense of humor.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nya ha ha! You think I have a weird sense of humor? No one has a weirder sense of humor than Lucina. She can't see a joke coming even if it smacked her in the face!\" Henry laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Lucina?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom's other daughter. She's Cynthia's older sister.\" explained Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods, I bet she's worse than her sister.\" groaned Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised.\" laughed Henry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

The three sat around a little longer, more listening to them talk then saying anything, trying to get as much info on this realm as possible. Jacob sat a little ways outside the group when he saw a sword laying against a nearby boulder. He looked at it's odd shape and recognized it to be Falchion. He looked at it's craftsmanship before a voice stopped him. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and saw a woman with long blue hair and in a uniform strikingly similar to King Marth's. \"Oh, sorry. I was just seeing what it was. Is it what I think it is?\" Jacob inquired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean Falchion, then yes. I got this from my father before...\" She trailed off before Jacob saw her eyes get watery. Jacob think he pieced it together though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Before your future was destroyed?\" Jacob said. The woman pulled her head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How did you-?\" The woman began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told this by Cordelia and Captain Chrom, who I'm guessing is your father correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and wiped one of her eyes. \"Yes, he's my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then that rider who slammed into me must be your younger sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. That was you Cynthia told me about?\" She began before she started laughing, \"About being knocked off your feet by her. How was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob chuckled, \"Hurt like hell. Thanks for your sympathy.\" Jacob added smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled back, \"I'm Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina nodded, \"You should head back before they wonder where you went.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come along? I'm sure you'd enjoy it and it looks you could use a break.\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a second, but she nodded and sheathed Falchion as they returned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The scenery was quite nice, so he decided to take a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see a place not totally destroyed yet.\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had seen very few worlds intact since leaving Kirada. It was something that often weighed heavily on him. He was surprised to see that this world has very little remaining scars from its own wars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it says alot about Chrom's leadership.\" smiled Greg before he heard something to his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Cynthia! Now taste my lance, evildoers!\" He heard before a loud CRASH impacted him to his right. He turned and saw a pegasus getting itself off the ground a few yards away. Closer to him, he saw Cynthia, face down in a little crater, which Greg imagined she just made herself. Slowly, he saw the girl crawl her head out of the dirt, her face and hair almost completely covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pegasus poop, not again!\" said Cynthia as she dusted the remaining dirt off her face. Greg gave her a sympathetic smile. This girl somehow reminded him of both his sister and Celica, except much more clumsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" asked Greg as he knelled down and offered her a hand. Cynthia turned her head in his direction, giving him her classic smile and allowing him to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, thanks. I'm sorry if you heard that. I thought for sure I had it down that time.\" she pouted, getting some remaining dirt off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right. What were you trying to do?\" asked Greg as he got some dirt off her armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was awesome! I was doing this maneuver where I swoop down on Palla and just before we reach the ground, I land on my feet spectacularly. Except....I tripped on my harness and landed facefirst.\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" said Greg. \"Sounds like this happens often. Why do you keep doing it?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia just smiled at him. \"Practice makes perfect. I'll try a thousand times if that's what it takes. A real hero never gives up!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had to admit; the girl was highly amusing, yet her dedication was second to none. Greg found it kind of charming in a way. It must take a lot to get this girl down, if anything could get her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're done practicing, would you like to head back to the site with me? I'd say you could use a break.\" offered Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" said Cynthia.  </span></div></div>",

Cordelia, Henry, and Severa had already returned to camp as Chrom and the others were ready to go to. But before they left, Chrom turned back to the travelers, \"Hey, you people have anywhere to stay?\" Chrom yelled to Greg and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shook their heads, \"Not really. We just arrived at the realm.\" Jacob replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'd be willing to have you join us for now.\" Chrom offered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and the others saw no reason to say no (beside the crazy dark Mage Henry). \"Sure. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now we can't spare anymore tents. But perhaps there may be an area nearby the camp you could-\" Chrom began when he was interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, father?\" Lucina asked, \"I actually wouldn't mind to share my tent with one of them.\" Chrom and Sumia both exchanged confused, somewhat worried glances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about this Lucina? We just met them. We have no idea-\" Chrom began again before Lucina stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But he seems...different. I feel as if he knows how we felt before. No future to return to or have.\" Lucina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia and Chrom exchanged another look, before he sighed and finally relented, \"Alright go ahead.\" After that, Cynthia offered the same, and, after more exchanged glances, was allowed to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob walked through the camp with Lucina as they passed rows of tents and a few soldiers. \"Thanks for lending me your tent,\" Jacob said.

I figured you would want some privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wanted to thank you after digging me out of that hole. Besides, that's what heroes do, they help people.\" smiled Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really hooked on being a hero huh? Why is that?\" asked Greg. Suddenly, Cynthia's demeanor took a 180, and her face got a little gloomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd....rather not talk about it.\" said Cynthia as she finished taking off the rest of her armor, getting situated into her cot. Greg figured that it would be a good idea to talk more about it. If what they heard was true, then Cynthia no doubt carried some kind of scar from the ruined future she came from. As Greg got situated in himself, he wondered if he could help in some way. What he experienced in Bryyo probably couldn't compare to Cynthia's future, but he hoped he could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****The next morning*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg got himself a pretty good sleep, something he hadn't had often. However, as the morning began to come, he heard some weird things nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This soup is.....too cold....I can't swim in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to that, Greg could swear he felt something heavy on his chest, and there was something wet there too. Yawning a bit, Greg's eyes fluttered open, and he saw something obstructing his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked as he tried to get a better view. As his vision cleared up, he could see a mop of blue hair covering his view. A quick look to his right saw that Cynthia was no longer in her cot, but rather, she was on top of him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, how in the world did she get over here?\" wondered Greg. Was this a subconscious thing? Or did she sleepwalk? Greg had no idea. However, a quick look down showed him that the slightly wet feeling was her drooling on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, gross.\" said Greg, trying to slowly move her head from his chest. This reminded him of his sister, who unfortunately had a similar problem. To be honest, he had the same problem too. Meanwhile, he kept hearing her mutter in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are....evil pasta.....I'm going to force feed you cheese....and make you like it..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her head off him, Greg slowly backed away. Apparently, Severa wasn't joking when she said that Cynthia was the \"most nonsensical sleep-talker\" in the army. However, she had a smile on her face, which Greg had to admit he liked much more than her gloomy one from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gloomy face really doesn't suit her.\" said Greg as he got himself together and began to get out of the tent, letting Cynthia sleep a bit longer.  </span></div></div>",

He lifted his head and looked across the tent, he saw the flap closed, the bed, and a weapon rack, chest and nightstand. He was ready to go back to sleep when he realized what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked back up and stood from a sleeping bag-like bed in the corner of the tent and looked around. He walked around the other end and saw Lucina laying on the ground. \"Lucina?\" Jacob whispered as he knelt beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...Grima...I have to...stop him...\" Lucina said in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was familiar with the Grimleal and who they worshipped. He realized just how bad it must be for Lucina to live in such a future. Jacob then remembered what Henry said about her not getting a joke. No wonder, since she came from a era of death and destruction. Jacob smiled and lightly picked Lucina up and placed her on the bed again and covered her up. He turned when he felt a hand grab his. \"J-Jacob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back and saw Lucina eyes opened slightly, her face covered in pain. \"Lucina? Are you okay? You fell out of bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I...\" Her face turned gloomy and turned away. \"I'm okay. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sat on the bed next to her and placed a hand on her head gently, \"I understand. I'm sorry do what you've been through. You keep fighting for everything and work yourself endlessly, but are still haunted by the future. I...I'm here. For you. I know what it's like to have everything stripped away and be forced to start anew.\" Jacob was ready to get up when Lucina grabbed his arm and pulled herself into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jacob. Your words give me strength, but can you stay? Just until the morning?\" Lucina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded after some thought and laid against the bed with Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob woke up again in the morning and saw Lucina had grabbed his arm in her sleep. Jacob smiled and brushed some of the hair from her face and got up and covered her in a blanket before leaving the tent and changing. He stood outside the tent and saw Greg as well. But was also curious as to why his chest looked a little wet....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Greg saw Cynthia come out of her tent, yawning with a full head of bed hair. She undid her ponytails before going to bed, so her head was a mess, much to Severa's disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, do you ever comb that mop on your head?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I have you for. You know I'm no good at that girly stuff.\" smiled Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ARE a girl! Gods, you can be weird sometimes.\" sighed Severa. Despite her whining, Severa actually did what Cynthia asked and tried to help with Cynthia's hair, which didn't go over well because Cynthia's hair was full of knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I comb daily.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.

Did you sleep well?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough.\" said Greg as he kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, the morning was filled with the group eating their breakfast. Cynthia eventually made it once Severa got at least some of the knots out of her hair, and she still couldn't get all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is part of the reason I don't let my hair get too long.\" said Cynthia to Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duly noted.\" smiled Greg.</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, her face did a 180, like it was before. \"So I was thinking, when we get to the Outrealms, maybe we could have a grand entrance and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she goes again.\" sighed Lucina as Cynthia began to trail off about her newest idea for a grand entrance. Jacob sighed, Celica giggled, and Greg actually listened intently. For odd reasons even he couldn't figure out, he enjoyed hearing what Cynthia could think of next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there it is.\" said Jacob, pointing ahead of him to what was undoubtedly an Outrealm Gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny. I always figured the Outrealm Gates were in a single location, but I guess not.\" said Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they seem to be everywhere.\" said Greg. With that said, the group walked up towards the gate. Just before they were about to enter, Cynthia turned and faced Ylisse one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good bye Ylisse! See you again soon!\" she bellowed out. Greg laughed softly and grabbed her hand, escorting her through the gate along with the others. As always, the space in-between was as bright as usual as the group walked through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think is on the other side?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully something good. I could use a break from fighting.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amen.\" said Jacob. Everyone else universally agreed. Soon enough, a white light shone in front of them, nearly blinding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that light is bright...And it feels pretty hot too.\" said Greg as he shielded his eyes. Soon enough, Greg felt the light dim down, but he felt a near sweltering heat once he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Gods, is it hot.\" Greg spat out. He looked up to see a bright and sunny sky, unblocked by any clouds. However, looking ahead, he saw that Cynthia was looking very enthusiastic while Lucina has a surprised look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, it's the Hotrealm!\" cried Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotrealm?\" asked Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came here once some time ago. It's the best summer resort in all the Outrealms. We couldn't enjoy it last time though because it got overrun with Risen.\" explained Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

But at least I got a yukata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob chuckled, \"Really? I'd love to see with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Lucina began as she rounded the corner and was wearing a yukata patterned with the royal brand. She blushed just as red as Jacob did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You...look great.\" Jacob got out embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina laughed and grabbed his hand and walked with him to a spring. \"Maybe I can enjoy this one.\" Lucina chuckled as they got into a spring, Cynthia and Greg being dressed up the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this great, Greg?\" Cynthia said giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's better than having to worry about a flying arrow every minute coming at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Greg took a break a bit later and dried off a little. \"That was relaxing,\" Jacob said, Greg nodding in agreement. Then they looked over and saw Anna in a bikini suddenly appear infront of them and approached them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come with Lucina and Cynthia,\" she asked with her finger on her chin in a trademark pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Greg replied, \"Yeah. They're are friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna replied smiling, \"Well we really enjoy them, and friends of them are friends of us. And with that,\" she then pulled out two seals with swimsuits in them, \"We wanna give you a gift. Here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Jacob took the seals and nodded thankfully, \"Thank you.\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna waved and walked off, with a devious smile on her face. \"So what do these do?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out.\" Jacob said as they activated them and were covered in a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia and Lucina continued relaxing when they heard a yell in the fog. \"Risen?\" Lucina said as she and Cynthia got out and ran over to where they heard it. What they found was completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stood there with new large assets hanging off her body as her brown hair was now long and tied back into a braid. She had a red bikini on, not giving her \"uncanny valleys\" much privacy. She looked extremely embarrassed along with Greg with red hair tied up similarly to Severa's, with the same situation in a black bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and Cynthia began laughing, \"Freakin' Anna merchant,\" Greg said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia ran forward, grabbed Greg's hand and jumped up and down, \"Now we can have a lot of fun too! Come on sis!\" Cynthia yelled, dragging Greg away, leaving Jacob and Lucina there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now look who's looking good,\" giggled Lucina as Jacob tried to cover herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can you help me?\" Jacob said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, come on,\" she took her hand and walked her to another nearby spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Greg ran up close to her, hardly being able to walk straight with her new body dimensions. The new weight on her chest didn't help either. To be honest, Greg was a bit unsure about entering the water now. Soon enough, he heard Cynthia approaching him, wearing a blue bikini that was similar to her regular clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. There's nothing to be worried about. That's what I 'm here for.\" smiled Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about this.\" said Greg, bringing a hand up at hearing her new voice. \"Man, that is the last time I take anything from a random Anna merchant.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, most of them are actually good people. She probably didn't mean any harm by it. She just wanted to have a little fun. Besides, it was a seal right? I'm sure you can change back right afterwards.\" smiled Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who in the world creates seals just to make people into girls with bikinis?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, those Annas have created lots of weird things. Perhaps you just happened to end up as the test subject.\" said Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" sighed Greg. Then, Cynthia grabbed her arm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. While you're like this, you might as well enjoy it. This could be our only chance to really enjoy the beach you know?\" reasoned Cynthia. Greg had to admit that she had a point, and she didn't want to see Cynthia sad or anything. Besides, it would be a new experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, if you say so.\" smiled Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo! Let's go in!\" smiled Cynthia as she dragged herself and Greg to the ocean. Greg immediately felt a nice chill as she felt the ocean water over her body. It felt weird, but it was a nice weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\" asked Cynthia, who rose her head out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's fun.\" smiled Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" laughed Cynthia who immediately starting splashing Greg. To Greg's embarrassment, she let out a bit of a girly shriek at Cynthia's splashing, to which Cynthia started laughing. That began a nice splashing war between the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, that was fun.\" smiled Cynthia as she got a little tired, just floating on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was. What to go underwater and see what we can find?\" smiled Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's do it.\" smiled Cynthia, and both girls went underwater for a little deep sea watching.</span></div></div>",

It was chilly, but after the hot spring, it was exactly what she need.

They were looking underwater and saw fish, underwater plants, and color swirl infront of them. Jacob turned and looked at Lucina, who was smiling back as her hair floated around her.

She'll catch up with us soon.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, all of them started hitting the ball back and forth over the net. Greg and Cynthia were obviously one team, with Jacob and Lucina being the other. It was all really in good fun, especially since while Greg did a good job, Cynthia would occasionally fall on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! That's gonna bruise!\" she said after perhaps her 4th trip since the game started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you look fine. Come on.\" said Greg as she helped her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll and all,the four of them had a great time playing around.

Greg agreed with her, and the group then stepped back into the Outrealm Gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as they entered, Greg felt something flow over his body.

The entire group closed their eyes as they awaited whatever realm they were going to next. As Greg kept his eyes closed, he suddenly heard lots of really loud noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" started Greg as he opened his eyes and rubbed them a bit.

It looked as if all the buildings were part of a massive kingdom of somekind, each one being as tall as castles themselves, made out of metal. Jacob also noticed that clothes other people wore were dramatically different to theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" answered Jacob,\" But we should try and blend in.\" They agreed as they left the alley and quickly made their way down to a clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, they looked around and saw blue jeans, different colored shirts, small clothes. \"Well they certainly give you a lot of choices.\" Greg added. Jacob nodded as they all moved around the store and grabbed different clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob ditched the Tactician Robes for a grey t-shirt and blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg grabbed a pair of jeans and a purple shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica got a skirt with a red shirt connecting with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia had gotten a short black skirt and a white shirt along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Lucina bought blue jeans and a white tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is there string hanging from these shoes,\" Jacob asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These pants seem pretty baggy...and they don't look armored at all.\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These aren't really hero looking,\" Cynthia said looking at her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is obviously different from any other clothing from our realm.\" Lucina inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you see all those shoes Lucy,\" Cynthia asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if they were shoes,\" Lucina replied, \"There were so many I couldn't see a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all met again inside the store and looked at each other confusion and awe. \"I better pay for these,\" Jacob said as he walked toward the counter.

A pedestal that looked as if it was meant to hold some spherical object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. A spear hurtling toward Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina had brought up Falchion to block it, but Jacob cut it in half in midair as it missed Lucina. Jacob ran out ahead of them when he saw a figure rush at him. The man held a massive axe, almost as big as Jacob as it swung down and struck his chest fully. If that wasn't enough, the force sent Jacob hurtling towards a wall as he smashed through it. Greg rushed toward the man with Celica and Cynthia at his side. Lucina had charged off toward the wall Jacob just got tossed through. Greg then realized the man to be the rider back in Bryyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Greg yelled, his voice filling the air with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I kill you already?\" The man said coldly yet calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" Cynthia said, \"Greg's a hero you villain! And villains never kill the hero!\" Cynthia yelled, trying to intimidate the rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica pulled out her tome, \"I can't stand men like you! Hurting others for your personal gain! You'll pay for what you did,\" Celica yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As fun as that sounds,\" the man began, \"I already finished here.\" The man then held a gem that glew red ominously. He then summoned a rift gate and ran through as it dissipated before any of them could get through. As soon as that happened, they ran toward the shattered wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob opened his eyes as his vision was blurred from the blow and the blood over his right eye. He saw a woman above him shaking him. \"...-cob!...J-...Jacob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't bring himself to move anything but his arms and head.

I'll...help...you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina held a hand over her mouth as she saw a piece of shrapnel coming out of Jacob's chest. The tears began to fall as she began sobbing. Jacob reached up and grabbed Lucina's shoulder as his hand glided slowly across her cheek. \"I-I'll be fine...Pl-please help me up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina tore a strip of cloth from her uniform and bandaged his right eye. She then lifted him up and pulled an arm around her shoulders as she dragged Jacob along, Jacob trying to continue moving.

Celica, could you do that?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" said Celica resolutely. Lucina and Cynthia gently put Jacob down, allowing Celica to start doing some basic healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least get him patched to the point where all he would need is just some rest. We'll head back to that realm we were just in.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You want to go back so soon?\" asked Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have no choice. We'll need to go somewhere safe for a while. That realm is unusual, but at least it's safe enough. I'd say we can easily hide there for a time.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" agreed Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little while, the group waited as Celica gave Jacob a good patch job. After about 15 minutes, Celica deemed that he was well enough that they just needed to get him to rest. Picking him up, they helped each other get back to the gate they came through before. They walked through as fast as reasonably possible, going through the bright flash that awaited them every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Greg heard the familiar sounds of things moving back and forth and the sky-high pieces of metal from earlier. Greg and the others looked down and saw that they were back in the clothes they bought earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off, They walked a ways from the gate until Cynthia spotted something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that says \"Hotel\". It kind of looks like the inns we use.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group entered the place, surprised to see the doors open by themselves, but Greg decided to put that aside for another time. He went to what he imagined to be the desk and asked for a couple of rooms, since they would probably need them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" said Greg as he got the keys for the rooms, although he noticed that they looked like cards instead of keys. Greg decided that he would figure out what was what once they got to their rooms. Judging by the number, Greg imagined that they were a floor up. He gave one card to Lucina and kept one for himself. They found a staircase nearby, not noticing the elevator. </span></div></div>",

Greg, Cynthia, and Celica decided to share one room, leaving Jacob and Lucina the other. \"Alright, we'll see you guys in the morning. Take care,\" Greg said as he and the others waved as Lucina waved for both herself and Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and Jacob worked their way up the stairs until they reached their floor and moved down a brightly-lit hallway to a room with the same number as the one on the card. Lucina didn't see a keyhole, but instead a small black box under the handle with a slit in it. She assumed the key would go in there as she pushed it in. She reached and tried to turn the handle, but nothing happened. She pulled the card out to try again when the door made a quick \"click\", noise. Lucina hesitated, but reached and turned the handle as the door opened. She looked at Jacob, who, even though was weak, shrugged as they entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large bed, made of some incredibly soft material, a large window overlooking the realm, a table with two chairs, and a large glass box with a window in the front that showed nothing. Lucina would've paid more attention to these, but focused in Jacob for the time being. She laid Jacob on the bed and used the blankets to cover him up. Lucina walked to the other side of the bed and sat next to him, brushing his hair gently. \"Th-thanks, Lucina...\" Jacob said, mustering a smile. Lucina smiled back, but then turned her head away. Jacob could still hear her sob lightly. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you....you took the spear for me. And then you rushed over to attack who did it,\" Lucina said as she wiped a tear away, \"You got hurt saving me. If I had only been more careful...\" Lucina began, when Jacob cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" He replied simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis alone took Lucina by surprise, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't your fault,\" Jacob began, \"I saved you because I didn't want to see you hurt. I didn't and still don't care if I have to break myself over and over again to keep you safe. I...I'll always be there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was taken back by such a speech. She soon felt her tears coming, but out of joy this time. She hugged Jacob, who was surprised quite a bit by that. It took him a moment but he finally wrapped his arms around her. She looked at Jacob as he wiped a tear away. \"Thank you, Jacob. I don't know how to thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob held her hand and said, \"Stay with me for now, just until morning,\" Jacob said, mimicking Lucina's first request from before. She smiled and nodded as she removed her new clothes and slid under to covers next to him. Jacob turned his head to face Lucina as he ran a hand through her hair. \"Lucina,\" Jacob began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob leaned in and kissed her in the forehead. Lucina blushed, but then smiled back before saying, \"That it?\" Jacob was a little confused until Lucina planted a kiss on his lips. Jacob's face turned red, but he embraced the kiss, now kissing back and pulling her close until their bodies hugged each other. The two fell asleep a little while later, Jacob cradling Lucina's head on his chest with her arms wrapped around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Greg, herself, and Celica had taken the next room next to Jacob's. Greg had looked around in amazement at how everyone was. It was certainly a lot cleaner than any inn at any of the other realms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly though, Cynthia had actually taken to this realm's conveniences much more casually. She looked everywhere, from the bathroom, to the lamps, and the \"black box\" in front of the beds. She liked the beds the most though. They were amazingly comfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you're adjusting just fine.\" smiled Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I mean, this world is kind of weird, but I think I'm starting to like it.\" smiled Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what kind of world do you think this is?\" asked Celica. Greg gave it some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had to guess, I'd say it was the future or something.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you mean?\" asked Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, truthfully, I've noticed a lot of things here that are very similar to the ones in our world, except that they seem to run better and more efficiently. I mean, the bathroom looks like it brings all the water you need right to you.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I like the brushes they have for your teeth. I don't think my mouth has ever been cleaner.\" smiled Cynthia. Celica smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, every world has its strengths.\" she smiled. Then, Cynthia got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see what this black box does. Either there's nothing inside it or maybe there's a special method.\" said Cynthia. Celica looked closely at the space under the screen, where she saw something that said \"On\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this does something.\" said Celica as she pressed the On button. Immediately, the screen turned on, causing Cynthia to jump back a bit. What was on the TV turned out to be a movie, Thor. And it just so happened to be during one of the movie's opening action scenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! How did those people get in there?\" asked Greg. He looked over at Cynthia, who surprisingly wasn't questioning the \"little people\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at that guy with the hammer! He's crushing all the bad guys!\" cheered Cynthia, as if she had just found a new idol. Greg just chuckled at how Cynthia could not allow herself to be bothered by how things work and just enjoy it while she has it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they had all changed into night outfits (that they thankfully still had after all this time). Cynthia had a white nightgown on and had her blue hair down. Celica's was similar, and Greg used a spare shirt and shorts he had. However, they didn't all go to sleep for a while. Cynthia insisted on seeing the rest of the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that guy is a real hero. He didn't let his shortcomings get him down and he got his power back.\" smiled Cynthia as she movie came to a close. Mimicing what Celica did, she pressed the On button and the box turned off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do wonder how that thing works though.\" said Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll have to be careful about who we ask. I bet those things are rather common here. If we come out asking a whole bunch of questions, people will think we're weird.\" said Greg, with Celica nodding. Anyway, Celica got her own bed, but Cynthia insisted on sleeping with Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way I can make sure that no one jumps you in the dark.\" she smiled with her trademark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you do that.\" said an amused Greg. Reaching over, Greg pulled on the lamp like he did earlier and it caused the light to go out. Greg couldn't see that well, but he could tell that Cynthia was on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Greg.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, you think we can go back to the store?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, since we apparently have quite a bit of money here, but why?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually saw some things I'd like to check out. And personally, I'd also like a new sleeping outfit. I honestly don't like this gown.\" said Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, sure Cynthia.\" smiled Greg as the two fell asleep together.</span></div></div>",

She smiled, having not seen Jacob with any restful sleep. Lucina shook him for a moment as Jacob's eyes opened slowly. He turned and saw Lucina looking up, smiling at him. \"Well good morning,\" Jacob said as he ruffled Lucina's hair a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel any better,\" Lucina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smiled back warmly, \"Yeah, thanks. Celica can really do some healing.\" Lucina simply nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina stood up and walked towards a seperate room inside the room with a tub and washed up as Jacob stretched himself, trying to get his body back to original performance. Lucina walked out a little later in her original clothes. \"This realm's still pretty weird,\" Lucina said walking out, \"When I finished washing up, the water just disappeared.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob shrugged that off, \"I know. None if this is really making sense, but we should keep that to ourselves and the others. Other people might get suspicious if we don't what any of this stuff is.\" Lucina nodded. \"Also, I found some kind of box that asked me if I wanted breakfast, so I asked for two for us.\" Lucina was suspicious about getting food from this box, but they decided to play along and see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, there was a high toned ring that came from the door. Jacob opened it as a cart of food with two plates of food on it. Jacob wheeled it in and placed the plates on the table. There was a large, circular piece of what looked like wheat cooked, a yellow mass of something, and red strips that smelled like pork over fire. Jacob looked at Lucina from across the table as they looked at the \"food\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks...interesting,\" Jacob said. Lucina, curious, cut a piece from the wheat circle and placed it in her mouth. Jacob waited for a moment when Lucina smiled and ate some more, including the yellow thing. Jacob joined in later as they ate the food, which Jacob found later to be called \"eggs\", \"bacon\", and a \"pancake\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went towards the door, Lucina asked him something, \"You think I could get a change of clothes back at that shop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smiled, \"Sure, let's go get Greg and the others and head with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina nodded and smiled as they walked down the hall to Greg's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He didn't look like he was in the best mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went downstairs for breakfast sometime ago. Cynthia apparently wanted to make a \"bagel\", and she nearly broke what they use to make them. Gods, that was embarrassing.\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry!\" called Cynthia from the bathroom. Jacob could hear water running from inside, meaning that she was washing up. A few minutes later, Cynthia walked out the bathroom, her normal clothes on and a towel around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was the best wash I've ever had. These bathrooms are really convenient.\" she smiled. Soon enough, they were all dressed up and ready. Jacob told Greg that Lucina would like to go back to that shop and get something new. Greg agreed, saying that they had the same idea, now that they know a bit more a bout this realm. They all walked out of the room, and ended up following some other people to what they called an \"escalator.\" Needless to say, the brief loss of gravity freaked Lucina and Celica out a bit, although Cynthia cheered the whole way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****At the store*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group got to the store once again, they noticed that there were quite a few more people there this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we came during the busy hour.\" spoke Greg. They ended up splitting up a bit, deciding to look out for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for Lucina?\" asked Cynthia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to see if there's something lighter. This white top feels kind of tight.\" said Lucina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about that?\" said Cynthia, pointing to a dark blue blouse. Lucina seemed to like that one better. Cynthia on the other hand wanted to find something more fitting. They had figured out by now that these were likely all casual clothing, and the fact that there was no armor likely meant that there was no war they really feared. In the end, Cynthia found a turquoise tank top that wasn't too tight and got some black shorts. Lucina was a bit surprised by her choice, but Cynthia found the rather free-moving clothes to be a it nicer than the ones she got before. She even grabbed a grey sweatshirt on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the entire group got back together. Greg was wearing blue jeans with a dark blue shirt. Jacob had normal jeans and a small black coat on. Celica was wearing a red sweater with a red skirt with some moccasin boots. Lucina was wearing the dark blue blouse she found earlier with jeans, and Cynthia was wearing everything she found earlier. Except for Celica, all of them were wearing sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're a bit more comfortable than before.\" said Greg. The rest agreed. Greg payed for everything. Apparently all that gold they had translated to a good amount of money for them here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they were outside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many people. It feels like this city could host every single person from Ylisse in it.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels a little too crowded for my taste.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are a downer sometimes.\" smirked Greg. Jacob gave Greg a light thump on the shoulder for that. Suddenly, Greg couldn't see where Cynthia was. However, she was apparently a little ways in front of them, looking at a bunch of those \"boxes\" in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit him in the mouth!\" she cheered on. Greg wondered what she was watching. He caught up to her and saw that boxing was on the screen, although he didn't know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they fighting each other like that?\" asked Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see a crowd cheering them on. Perhaps it's like the arena.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my best guess. Interesting how they fight though. I haven't seen a single sword since we got here.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've seen no magic tomes either.\" added Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this world doesn't normally use magic or something.\" said Greg. With that, once they pried Cynthia away from the screen, they kept walking down, until something caught Lucina's eye. A large business building loomed in front of them, but the words on the front caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exalted Center Inc.? Huh?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a name. You think it's a coincidence?\" pondered Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should take a look\" suggested Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" said Lucina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right as she turned around, a figure rushed out of the door, knocking Lucina straight to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry! I was in a a bit of a hurry.\" said who was apparently a young woman, picking some of her things from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's my fault! Let me help with those.\" offered Lucina, who picked up a few things for her. However, right as Lucina picked them up, she and the woman looked straight at each other. Lucina stared right into the face of....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerself?</span></div></div>",

Are you al-...right?\" Jacob stopped as he saw their resemblance. \"Um...\" Jacob said, obviously speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia couldn't help but blurt out, \"Wow Lucy! I didn't know you had a twin!\" Lucina sent a quick, faint glare back at Cynthia, before turning back to the look-alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry there,\" Lucina apologized yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman waved her hand a smiled, \"No worries, it's alright.\" The woman began placing the stuff in her bag. \"I've been stuck in an office working FOREVER!...And I finally finished, so I'm ready to kick my feet up and relax.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled, \"That sounds nice. I guess we'll see you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded, smiled and waved as she began walking away.

I don't know why, but there's something else about her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could continue, the woman suddenly appeared and walked back up to them, \"You're not from around here are you,\" she asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no,\" Lucina said back to her look-alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled before saying, \"How about you come with me? Almost as a welcome to the city.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all exchanged a look with each other, but decided that this woman seemed harmless, and they could use some rest. \"Sure,\" Jacob replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, um...\" The woman said, not yet knowing their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina them introduced all of them to her, to where the woman replied, \"My name's Faith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Faith,\" Cynthia began, \"Where were you gonna go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a bar not far from here I hang out around, let's head there.\" Faith said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Jacob said, \"Lead the way Faith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith spun on her heel as they moved farther into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bar wasn't very big.

There were more of those boxes with people in them, most of them showing men in colored uniforms throwing something around as they ran across a field, being knocked down by others.

It had a living room, bathroom, kitchen, and a bedroom. They entered as Faith hung her coat up and dropped her back, \"It's great to finally be home.\" She began, \"Make yourselves at home, Lucina, follow me and I can show you the clothes.\" Lucina nodded and followed Faith into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith handed Lucina a red nightgown as Lucina began taking her clothes off to try them on. \"I'm gonna change as well if you don't mind,\" Faith said, laying her coat down on her bed as she began unbuttoning her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Take your ti-\" Lucina stopped when she noticed something on Faith's right back shoulder. Lucina stood in the nightgown and pulled Faith's shirt down, revealing the Brand of the Exalt. She turned Faith to face her, \"Faith? What do you know about that?\" Lucina asked, trying to keep her cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Faith began, \"Our family has a long generation of Kings and heroes born in the city here, all with this same mark. Are you okay Lucina?\" Faith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina straightened Faith and told her, \"Faith, look into my left eye.\" Faith did so and saw the same Brand on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Is this a prank?\" Faith said, obviously freaked out. It took awhile, but Lucina finally told her everything, about the Brand, the Outrealms, her realm, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Faith said, when there was a knock on the door. \"Come in,\" Faith said, already changed. Jacob stood in the door as he looked at Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything all right?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith suddenly stopped and said, \"Wait...Lord Lucina and Sir Jacob! That's you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Lucina both blushed, since that would mean they...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna need an explanation for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and Faith explained it all as Jacob listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It's the least I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all exchanged a look and nodded, \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith smiled as she set up beds in the living room.

He looked up to see the rest awake and eating food similar to the food at the hotel. Jacob sat down next to Lucina, already eating and made a plate ready for Jacob. They ate quickly, especially Faith, excited to show them her sister. They all dressed in their modern attire and left a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, they were walking back into Faith's workplace, dwarfed by the massive structure. \"So Faith,\" Jacob began, trying to start conversation, \"What do you do here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I co-manage with my cousin, Stella. Where is she anyway?\" Faith said, looking around the factory floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FAITH!\" A voice yelled. The group turned to see a girl with blue hair tied into ponytails hurry towards them. \"Faith! Fai-\" was thing the woman said before she almost fell and Faith caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stella! What's the rush? Are you okay?\" Faith said, holding her cousin and Cynthia and Greg's descendant up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna tell you that we get off early today and if you wanted to hang out. Would you-\" Stella stopped when she turned and saw Cynthia. The two looked very much alike, Stella having a few more blemishes than Cynthia. Cynthia knew Stella was her descendant, and could barely hold back. \"Who's this Faith,\" Stella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith allowed them to introduce themselves, then asked Stella to head with them back to her place. There, Faith explained their Brands they had since they were kids and Lucina and Cynthia's. She then explained how Jacob and Lucina would be an Aunt and Uncle, while Cythia and Greg would be her Great-something grandparents. \"Wait, so those stories as kids that we heard were true? And so...\" Stella turned to Cynthia, and was on her in a second. Cynthia hugged back, the two close to tears overjoyed. She then reached over, grabbed Greg by the collar and pulled him into the hug. Jacob, Lucina, Faith and Celica couldn't help but smile. They soon pulled away, to where Stella turned back to Faith. \"When did you realize this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just yesterday,\" Faith said still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Faith, would you mind if I hung out with you here?\" Stella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Faith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia soon put an arm around Stella and sat her down, \"So what do you like to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Stella said, pondering her thoughts, \"I like watching action movies with heroes in them. Have you seen any?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia recalled to that movie with the guy named 'Thor'. She nodded, \"Uh-huh. I only saw one, but it was really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella then got an idea, \"What if we had an action movie marathon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fun,\" Faith said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and the others agreed as they went out and bought food for this 'marathon'. They also got more movies, titled 'Captain America', 'Iron Man', and 'Batman'. They watched them into the night until only a few of them were awake. He leaned over next to Faith and Stella. \"Listen. Remember that Outrealm we came through? We're gonna have to leave through it again soon,\" Jacob told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorrow instantly covered their faces, but before they could speak Jacob stopped them, \"This doesn't mean we're gone forever. We may return, and we'll come straight to you if we do. Okay?\" He said it smiling, hoping to keep them from crying. Faith hugged Lucina and Jacob as Stella did Greg and Cynthia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please come back,\" the two said almost in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled and held their descendants, finishing the last of the movies. Soon it was just Jacob awake, he was falling asleep but could recall something appearing on the T.V. Some kind of scene for something called \"Fire Emblem: Awakening.\" As much as he wanted to stay awake to see it, he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each woke up the next day, Faith and Stella with somber faces. Jacob and the others comforted them as they left toward the alley where the Outrealm Gate had been. They stood in front of it and said their goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Although, we might want to do something about that rider though, and the war on Bryyo. Otherwise, that might continue to haunt us for who knows how long.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's mention of Bryyo suddenly brought Greg back to reality. In his excitement, he had almost totally forgotten about Bryyo. He had often wondered in the past if he should return sometime. He didn't want to leave that world at war for so long, especially with that rider on the loose. In fact, Greg still wondered how that rider even appeared at that temple. The only way that could happen was if he was possibly world-hopping like they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a good point Jacob.\" said Greg. \"We'll need to take care of Bryyo sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.

The \"ground\" beneath them began to shake and turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!

Anything could happen. And I mean anything.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duly noted.

Jacob and the others pushed through the gate, but were met with a flash and blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob woke up next to Greg and Celica, who were still laying down. Jacob shook Celica as she pushed herself up to her knees. Jacob then shook Greg, who groaned, but finally picked himself up with Jacob's help. As they did, Celica pointed out that Cynthia and Lucina were gone. They looked around until Jacob saw an odd, ancient, legendary-looking sword glistening in the sun with a blue glint as it laid next to a lance Jacob identified as the lance \"Luna\", being able to rip through defenses in a single blow, radiating a blue glow and shining with blue-gray color with the Brand of the Exalt on the flat part of the spearhead. Jacob walked toward the sword and examined it. It was long blade with and interstingly hooked hilt, colored silver like the other parts of the sword, but glistened with a blue tint and a Brand of the Exalt on the bottom. Jacob picked it up, and at that moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob? What..Nngh..what happened?\" Jacob heard the sword say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jacob, it sounded like Lucina. \"L-Lucina? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice replied back, \"Yeah. What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Lucina? Please don't freak out, but you're a sword now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Lucina exclaimed. Celica created a quick reflection showing Lucina to herself as a sword. \"H-how'd this happen? W-What happened to me? What if I'm stuck like this? Jacob, what if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey hey,\" Jacob said trying to calm her down, \"You're gonna be fine, alright? Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Lucina replied, \"Alright. Thanks Jacob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob turned back and saw Greg having a conversation with he lance. \"It's okay Cynthia. I'm gonna take care of you,\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two turned at each other and back at their weapons. \"It would be best if we found out where we were.\" Celica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded as he attached a sheath next to his waist and slid Lucina inside, a hand still in her hilt. \"Don't worry, Lucina. I'm gonna take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina replied, \"I trust you, Jacob. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg held Cynthia and slid her onto his back, \"You'll be alright. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia said, \"Thanks Greg. I hope at least I can do something heroic like this too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they left down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Greg wondered if being an Einherjar perhaps kept her from changing, but he didn't want her to know about that yet. Then, Jacob brought up another point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something else I've noticed. How are you even able to equip a spear here? You're a Dread Fighter.\" said Jacob. Greg looked a but taken back at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....a good question actually. I guess she just feels pretty comfortable in my hands.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because you two have a special connection.\" said Celica with an honest smile. Greg's face went beat red, and if you looked closely, you could see the Luna spear turning slightly purple at the spearhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't say stuff like that!\" said Cynthia. Celica giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, a town came into view. It looked nice and quaint, a bit small but having plenty of people. The group walked up the front, where Greg saw a man sitting down casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me sir, do you know what realm this is?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You kids from out of town?\" chuckled the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of.\" said Greg.

Besides, we deserve a bit of of fun after the Hotrealm incident.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that wasn't even our fault!\" cried Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, Celica, and Jacob laughed as they kept walking forward.</span></div></div>",

A few seconds later, he pulled the red hot blade out and laid it on an anvil, smoothing the blade and toughening it. Jacob was finishing his work when he realized Lucina hadn't said a thing. \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob held the blade on his knee, and in the reflection, he saw Lucina's face/head. \"I'm fine...just...

What if you break?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I imagine that as long as you put me back together, it'll be fine.\" Greg felt as if Cynthia was smiling at him. He turned and took the Luna lance off his back and looked it over. It was a nice shade of blue, kind of like Cynthia's hair. Although, he suddenly could faintly see Cynthia's face in the reflection of the spearhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" said Greg, taking a few steps back as he saw that. \"I didn't know you could do that. How does it feel anyway?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but it doesn't feel bad. I feel like I've something inside me just waiting to come out.\" said Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should test it.\" said Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a nearby forge they were passing by, Greg saw a sheet of metal on the side. \"You know, if you really have Luna, then maybe we should test it. Luna can pierce through any defense after all.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me!\" cheered Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg walked over to the side of the forge, grasping Cynthia in his hands. He honestly hadn't handled lances that often, but he felt as if he could use Cynthia. Taking a deep breath, he lunged towards the metal, striking it dead center. However, it only did little damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" cried Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" asked Greg, hoping she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. It just felt like something bonked me on the head.\" said Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Luna does activate based on Skill level. Perhaps you should try once more.\" said Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you up for one more?\" asked Greg, to which Cynthia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried again. As he got ready, the spear seemed to glow blue briefly as he lunged. The spear broke through the metal easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo-hoo! That was awesome! What a rush!\" cheered Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess someone's happy.\" smiled Greg. Their test done, they left the forge area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you okay being like this for a while?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind. At least I'm not an iron lance.\" smiled Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you aren't.\" smiled Greg.</span></div></div>",

Lucina is now one of the finest swords in the land.\" Jacob said. \"How about Cynthia and you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turns out she can use the Luna ability.\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well that's pretty effective!\" Jacob said impressed. They talk back and forth until Celica interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys? The sun's going down already,\" Celica pointed out. They turned and saw the sun half hidden as it descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Jacob said, \"I'll grab us a room at the inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered and got a room with three beds. Jacob sat on his and unsheathed Lucina a bit, enough to see her face reflecting on the blade. \"You sure you'll be alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina chuckled, \"I'll be fine. You made sure of that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smiled, \"Right.\" He slid her back into the sheath and leaned her against the nightstand on the bed.

They made sure to take in whatever sights they could before doing so though. Cynthia actually hoped that they would return someday, perhaps the next time she could see it as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite an arena they've got there.\" noticed Jacob as they reached the outskirts of the town. Greg made a mental note to go there sometime. He wanted to check it out when he didn't have war to think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they didn't get far out of town when they heard screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's in trouble!\" said Jacob. Nobody even had to say anything. They immediately started running towards the sound. Soon enough, they saw a red-haired woman being surrounded by bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna? Or at least one of them.\" said Greg, grabbing Cynthia from his back. There was no disputing this. They were going to help. Jacob then grabbed the hilt of Lucina's sword. Neither objected to being used. They wanted to help too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, pick on someone your own size.\" said Greg as he instantly began charging. The bandits noticed Greg and began charging. Jacob and Celica ended up coming right behind, ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps thanks to the special connection, handling the Luna lance was no problem for Greg, who even got off many Luna strikes at the bandits. Jacob's blade cut right through them, showing no mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what it feels to wield an exalted weapon in a sense.\" he muttered to himself. Meanwhile, the bandits couldn't get near Celica either, who short from afar with Celica's Gale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere weren't alot of bandits, so they were finished soon, allowing Anna to get back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, thanks for that. Don't think I would have made it without you guys.\" smiled Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no problem.\" said Greg as he wiped down the spear a bit. They were going to leave soon, but he figured he didn't want to leave too much blood on Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys heading out of town? I'm about to head home myself.\" said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we join you? We have no real destination in mind.\" said Jacob as he wiped his sword down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all.

He sat up and saw four other Anna's laying by her. Then he looked down and saw her body's new assets being openly displayed with merchant gear around her. She was about to yell in shock, but remained calm. 'Their probably the other Annas here.' Jacob thought as one Anna woke up, wearing a Trickster outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nngh...\" She said as she turned to Jacob. \"Anna? Where's the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Greg?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded as Jacob then revealed to Greg her body. Greg almost freaked if Jacob wasn't there to stop her. \"Alright. I think we should wake the others up and find out who's who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob woke up the Anna in a Yukata with black hair and a blue shine. She woke up oddly an uncomfortably. \"Anna? What happened?...Why am I in my Yukata?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob remembered that Lucina had a Yukata back in the Hotrealm, and she thought it was hers. Anna explained her identity as Jacob and helped Lucina. Jacob turned and saw Greg helping an Anna in a Pegasus uniform, almost instantly recognizing her for Cynthia. They looked around and tried to get used to their new bodies. Then a merchant Anna awoke, having to be Celica. They all looked and saw they were in a forest next to the Outrealm Gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. As weird as this is, we should look for a town. Maybe the Anna we were traveling with is there,\" Greg began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. The problem's gonna be how to find that Anna. If this realm makes people become Annas, how will we find the same one?\" Jacob inquired with the other Annas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see another option. Let's go.\" Lucina said as the five Annas walked down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He felt himself laying on grass, looking up at the early morning sky. Jacob held a hand to his head and noticed that his hand seemed...different. He also noticed the armor he wore changed and was now white. Jacob sat up and saw something \"she\" didn't expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob felt a new weight hang from her chest under her white coat. She felt a chilly, morning wind blow her light-blue hair into view. \"What's h-?\" Jacob began to say but stopped as she heard her new voice. She recognized herself as Lucia. She then heard a noise to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg awoke with both her hands to her purple hair, noticing the change instantly. \"W-what happened?\" Greg said, looking at her new body that belonged to Katarina and her new voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Outrealn collapsed. That's what happened,\" Jacob said as she stood and held her hand out to Greg to help her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that made us like this?\" Greg inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a possibility,\" Jacob said. They then heard another noise and turned to see a woman who looked like Lyn rise. \"Lucina?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wh-who are you?\" Lyn(Lucina) replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob walked over to help her up. \"Lucina, it's me, Jacob. And, um.....You aren't yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina looked at her body and gasped. \"I...I look like Lyn, noblewoman of Sacae. How'd this happen?\" Lucina asked as Jacob helped her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Outrealm collapsed. You alright?\" Jacob asked as Lucina nodded in reply. Then they heard a noise behind them as they saw the Pegasus knight they recognized as Palla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys. So this seems pretty weird Huh?\" Cynthia said to them in Palla's body. Greg noticed how she wasn't freaking out and seemed more mature. \"You guys alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Greg replied, \"Thanks Cynthia.\" They then saw Celica sit up, unchanged. Jacob and the others knew she was Einherjar and already of a legendary figure, so it made sense that she didn't change. Jacob looked around to see they were in the middle of a field, but saw a road a distance away that would lead to civilization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As weird as this is,\" Jacob said in Lucia's voice, \"we need to keep moving and find out where we are...And I'll need help to get use to this.\" Jacob said. Lucina smiled and put a hand on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help with that.\" Lucina smiled, \"Everyone ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia nodded and stood straight as she walked with them alongside Greg, who followed behind Jacob with Lucina and Celica by them as they got on the road and walked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Being the Lost Tactician didn't look so bad. Looking through her items, she saw that she had an Eliwood's Blade and a Katarina's Bolt, perfect for a Grandmaster. Her skills seemed to be Shadowgift, Tomefaire, Rally Spectrum, Focus, and Tomebreaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob fidgited a bit in her white garb. She saw that she had a Balmung sword attached to her waist. She often stumbled in her heeled boots, and her long light-blue hair whipped around in the breeze. Her skills were Swordfaire, Dual Support+, Astra, Vantage, and Avoid +10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina, in Lyn's DLC garb, looked at calm as ever. She noticed that she had a Sol Katti equipped, although she kind of mourned the loss of her Parallel Falchion. She wondered where that had gone in the disturbance. Nonetheless, being Lyn, the Noblewoman of Sacae, had an interesting appeal to her. The skills she saw she had were Aether, Vantage, Astra, Avoid +10, and Acrobat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was the Elder Sister, Palla, and to Greg's view, she seemed to look the part. Apparently, she even had her pegasus here. Unlike the Cynthia she knew, Cynthia seemed more calm, cool, and collected. Despite this, Greg seemed to sense some wonder in her, like she was living a dream. To her and Greg's surprise, she actually had Gradivus with her, one of the most powerful lances around. Her skills seemed to be Galeforce, Sol, Counter, Rally Skill, and Lancefaire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is almost too bizarre.\" muttered Greg, although she was getting used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wonder why we always end up as girls, yet everyone else stays the same.\" muttered Jacob, combing her long hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it just happens.\" said Celica. \"By the way, why didn't I change?\" she said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it doesn't work on you for some reason.\" explained Greg.

Lucia, I didn't expect to see you out here.

Jacob seemed to be enjoying herself, then down an alley to another street, she saw Elincia again. \"Head on without me. I'll catch up with you later,\" Jacob told the others as she walked down the alley toward Elincia. She found it odd that the Queen was wearing a hood outside, especially since it was hot out. \"Queen Elincia?\" Jacob inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia turned, almost startled, but quickly warmed up with a smile. \"Lucia, what a pleasant surprise.\" Elincia stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may milady, why do you wear a hood on a day such as this?\" Jacob said, curious to her wardrobe choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia smiled again, \"I like to move about my people as an equal. Therefore, I hide my face under a hood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob bowed slightly, \"Clever plan milady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia smiled yet again and turned. \"Walk with me, would you Lucia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smiled and nodded, \"Of course Queen Elincia.\" Jacob walked down the streets with Elincia as they stopped at vendor's stands and little shops. Finally they walked into one of the alleyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia pulled her hood down and looked back to Jacob. \"Thank you, Lucia,\" Elincia commented smiling. \"I enjoy being with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smiled and bowed her head yet again. \"The pleasure is mine milady,\" Jacob said respectfully. \"I've promised to serve you as a knight to a Queen. It's an honor to speak to you like this.\" Jacob then knelt down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia walked over by her and had her stand. She smiled to her loyal servant, \"I'm glad to have a knight like you Lucia. Come on.\" They then exited the alley and continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

As she left, Greg had approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling okay Cynthia?\" asked Greg. Cynthia gave him an odd look before giving him a smile that seemed like a fusion between a mature smile and Cynthia's typical wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing just fine. I'm quite enjoying this.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Kind of seems a bit out of character for you.\" said Greg. Cynthia shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember my pegasus back in Ylisse?\" asked Cynthia, to which Greg nodded. \"I named her Palla, after the legendary pegasus knight herself. To actually be her, even if it's just an Einherjar thing, it's quite exciting.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you do seem to be enjoying it.\" smiled Greg. Cynthia's smile became more reserved again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. I wish I could try the Triangle Attack for once. Hmm, I wonder if Catria and Est are in this realm. Perhaps I should go check. Good day Greg.\" said Cynthia who gave a small bow and left. Greg reached out to her, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is kind of weird, yet also ironic. Cynthia's not her usual energetic self, but she gets to be her idol for who knows how long.\" Greg sighed before a thought just came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unstable Outrealm Gate turned them into this. Would they ever get out of it? Greg hadn't seen any other Outrealm Gates around lately. He was beginning to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should enjoy myself first. Hmm, you know, this book was rather interesting. I should go look for some more.\" said Greg, having a change of thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucina had been touring the stores by herself, looking at all the wares.

All this still worried her. Cynthia seemed to be acting more her age, which...wasn't her age. It was as if everything Cynthia dreamed about being, a great, legendary hero, just vanished in seconds, only to be replaced by knightly actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also worried Lucina that everyone had split up, but she wasn't so worried.

She turned and saw Lucina, who motioned her to follow, which she did. As they did, they saw Greg sitting on a crate reading a book, with three more stacked beside her. \"Greg,\" Celica said trying to get her attention, but to no avail. Greg seemed glued to the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Greg,\" Lucina yelled a bit louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg jumped a bit and turned to them. \"Oh. Hey guys. Sorry, I was just reading a few of the books I bought. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna look for Jacob and Cynthia and see about getting an inn to sleep in.

Lucina is my sister too right?\" she asked herself while shaking her head. \"Sure, they are all my sisters.\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mannerisms continued to remain calm and collected, even while avoiding all the walking people. However, Cynthia began to wonder a bit if they were even here. What if they were in another town? Perhaps she should have asked to see if their pegasi were in that stable too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could they be?\" asked Cynthia as she put a hand to her head. However, through the crowd, she soon saw a flash of blue and pink. She instantly recognized them and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catria! Est!\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two figured turned around and gasped in happiness as they saw their elder sister. The blue-haired dark flier was Catria, while the pink-haired pegasus knight was Est. Each were still wearing their armor and such, although neither had their pegasus around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister, there you are! We've been looking for you!\" cried Est as she happily hugged her big sister. Catria sighed as Cynthia returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Est, stop acting like a kid! Palla has a reputation to uphold.\" she reprimanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun.\" pouted Est.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you two, enough.\" smiled Cynthia, not responding to Catria calling her Palla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try to motivate her more. She's the only one who isn't even promoted yet.\" said Catria, referring to how Est was still a tier 1 class. Est pouted at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'll get better soom. Just you wait!\" said Est.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia smiled at Est's behavior. It kind of reminded her of her own before she became like this. At the thought of that though, Cynthia shook her head and composed herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you two doing right now?\" asked Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've been given a day or two off from duty, so we've just been exploring. I feel weird though. I think I should be practicing.\" said Catria. Cynthia lightly giggled, with Catria's behavior reminding her of Cordelia to an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it makes you feel better, I have no problem with a little training, just to get you settled for the day.\" said Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great.\" smiled Catria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get it done then.

Est was already on the move and trying to dodge, allowing Catria to track her. But Est made a sharp turn and dodged. However, this startled her Pegasus and she lost her grip and fell off. She was falling until she felt something hit her. She opened her eyes and saw Palla looking at her, holding her in her arms. \"You alright?\" Cynthia asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEst smiled and nodded and gave Cynthia another hug. Cynthia put Est on her Pegasus and flew up to Catria. \"Alright, now me and Catria will train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey trained for awhile until landing again.

She took a walk outside, as if she was looking for something, until she got to the edge of town near a forest. For some reason, she smiled as she saw that and laid down near a tree, seeing the cloudless sky above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this feels better.\" said Lucina as she just watched the night sky, eventually dozing off.

You've had your nose in it all of yesterday too.\" said Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's pretty fascinating. I never had anything against books, but they have some truly fascinating ones here. There's a lot on battle strategy. Perhaps I can use this when I go back to King Marth and.....\" Greg said the last part a little lower to himself, King Marth and some other guy appearing in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that Greg?\" asked Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing.\" said Greg, her face turning a bit red but she went back to her book anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This world is really having quite the effect, although I guess I can see why. Unlike all the other realms, this one is really relaxing.\" said Celica as she sat on her bed. \"Honestly, I could probably see myself staying here long-term, although I imagine Alm might get really worried if I do that.\" said Celica, still unaware of her own status as an Einherjar. Anyway, she looked to the other side of the room and saw Cynthia wiping down her Gradivus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you up too?\" asked Celica with a smile. Cynthia smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gradivus was looking a little dirty, so I'm wiping it down.\" said Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs odd as Cynthia acting so mature was, Celica couldn't help but admire it a little bit. Sure, Cynthia hardly acted like herself, but she seemed a lot more capable and stronger now. It was a bit on conflict for Celica. You could make the argument that Cynthia was now achieving more than she would have before: leading a pegasus knight squadron, being well-known for her deeds rather than her clumsiness, and everyone in the land seemed to love her for it. Believe it or not, in a matter of speaking, Cynthia was achieving her dream in some way or form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was what made it hard for Celica to say anything wrong about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's enjoying it for now, so I see no reason to tell her not to.\" said Celica as she went down to get herself something to eat. She was hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Cynthia got up too. \"Greg, I'm going to go meet my sisters after I eat, okay?\" she informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sure.\" said Greg while waving her hand.</span></div></div>",

Jacob tried to sit up but fell back down in pain as it radiated from her gut. She looked and realized the first white coat was gone and she was just in the white suit underneath. She saw bandages wrapped around her middle as they had a red blotch on them. Just then he saw someone next to his side. Queen Elincia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Elincia...are y-you hurt?

I would cast my life out in order to save yours.\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia smiled even more as she felt Jacob's hair down mid-way to her neck, since it was cut by the assassin. \"Lucia.

One of the guards entered and explained what happened and informed them that they gave her a herb to help her sleep, so when she wakes, she could be a little drowsy. They sat by the bed for awhile. Greg wondered why Jacob's hair was shorter now. They sat there for a few minutes when Jacob began stirring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body pretty much felt like a puddle, not bringing her to be able to move much. She remembered the herb they gave her. Just...not what it did. She heard a soft voice say her name. \"Jacob,\" Celica said quietly. That seemed to snap Jacob back as she forced herself to open her eyes. She lolled her head to the right and saw Greg and Celica sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...H-hey, guys..\" Jacob said, she tried to reach toward them but barely moved her hand. Celica reached out and took her hand a squeezed it lightly. She was glad Jacob seemed okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled and patted Jacob on the shoulder lightly. \"Back with the living?\" Greg asked smiling. Jacob was able to give a smile back. \"But, I mean what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob tried to look at them, but the herb was still working a little bit. But as Jacob remembered what happened and Queen Elincia, Lucia came back. \"I..protected Queen Elinica from t-two men w-who wished to do harm.\" Jacob replied. Then \"Jacob\" still remembered Lucina and Cynthia. \"W-where are Lucina and Cynthia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia was looking for Lucina. They're still in town,\" Greg said back. Just then, Queen Elincia entered as well. This brought Lucia back in Jacob's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-milady...\" Jacob got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are your friends, I assume?\" Elincia said, smiling radiantly. She then bowed, \"A pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Celica both bowed back, \"Majesty.\" Celica addressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia turned back toward Jacob. \"Lucia, are you feeling a little better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob pulled then pushed her head to turn to the other side of the bed and see Elincia. \"I...think, yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia smiled and nodded. \"Good. Lucia, I'm sorry, but you should leave until you recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jacob looked back, still trying to look determined, \"What? Why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If those men attack, I can't have one of my finest knights unable to defend against them. Is there somewhere you could go?\" Elincia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica stepped forward and said, \"I can bring her back with us. We can take care of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Elincia said, turning back to Jacob. \"You'll stay with your friends until you're better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but....m-milady..?\" Jacob stuttered out. She was burning up and shivering now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia put a hand on her head, \"Shhh...Please rest, Lucia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA determined look grew on Celica's face, \"Don't worry Highness. I'll take care of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled away the sheets and, to everyone's surprise, including Celica's, she was able to pick Jacob up. Jacob laid in Celica's arms and leaned against her. They then left and departed for the inn. They entered a few minutes later and laid Jacob on one of the beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

They made a slight detour to head towards the royal barracks where they could let their mounts go for now. Cynthia gave Achaeus a nice brushing before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, he should still in the castle right now, so let's go.\" said Catria, already on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait up sis!\" followed Est.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're so eager.\" smiled Cynthia, calmly following them with Lucina in tow.</span></div></div>",

For now, you're free to act as you wish until needed. Rooms here have been offered for you to stay in.\" Marth smiled. \"You can go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia turned and saw an excited look on Est's face. She was glad Est was able to control herself. She raised her well as an older sis-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about that sentence felt off as she said. She nodded toward Marth as they turned and left.

But I'm not sure from where.\" Lyn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica was now seriously worried. She didn't remember where she was from? How could that-? Celica then asked Lyn, \"Where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn turned, \"I was part of the Lorca tribe, but then I was revealed to be a Noblewoman of Sacae.\" Lyn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Celica needed. She needed to get them through an Outrealm gate. And fast. \"Come on!\" She called and ran down a fork in the road leading towards Irena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Yelled Lyn, wondering what was happening as she followed her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain. Just hurry up please.\" Celica yelled as the two hurried from where they were to Irena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Well, sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob appeared to be a bit smaller than normal, and he wore a myrmidon outfit that was mostly white and gold. He still had Balmung equiped too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was wearing a grandmaster outfit somewhat similar to Katarina's. His body was also a bit smaller and hie hair was a bit shorter, stylized slightly like Katarinas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was actually a tiny bit taller, and her armor greatly resembled what she wore as Palla, including the heeled boots as well. She definitely looked like she was still a falcon knight. Her facial features seemed a bit sharper too, and Celica noticed that it still retained some of Palla's features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Lucina. Celica noticed that her hair seemed a bit darker than before, and her armor now slightly resembled Lyn's now. One drastic change though was that the bottom half of Lucina's clothes had become Lyn's, showing off her legs which made her blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm back?\" muttered Greg as Cynthia came over and helped him up. He glanced over at her and saw her smile at him. It still wasn't the usual Cynthia grin, but it was a sweet one that still made Greg blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, I even class changed.\" groaned Jacob at his new white outfit. \"I hope I don't have to go through another girl experience any time soon.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

This went on until the man knocked Greg's weapon down before bringing the spear's blade across Greg's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg fell clutching his chest, the man standing above him two hands on the spear ready for the killing blow when he was knocked off balance from behind as Jacob hit the man over the head with Balmung and kicked him away. The man spun and hit Jacob as he fell back. The man turned to Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had recovered and thrusted his blade through the helmet of the man. It was quiet. He heard the man let out a bloody gurgle then collapse. Then Greg did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke and saw a woman standing before him. If it was who he thought it was, he couldn't believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done it,\" her voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Naga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man corrupted the entire Eastern kingdom, sending them to war with the Northern kingdom. With his defeat, peace can return. The Eastern kingdom will accept the Northern's peace treaty and the fighting will end. I grant you my blessing. And your friend Jacob...will be freed of his card.\" Naga spoke with a smile the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg couldn't believe it, but he couldn't help but smile. \"Th-thank you, Naga.\" Naga smiled and a white light enveloped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg awoke with Jacob picking him up off the ground. He saw the blue aura around him gone. \"Jacob...your..\" Greg began before Jacob smiled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naga told me. Greg....thank you.\" Jacob said as he helped haul Greg through the smoke toward the others. When they saw them, Cynthia through herself at Greg and hugged him as they laid him down nearby and Celica healed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Greg began. \"It's all over....we did it...\" Lucina smiled and nodded as they all stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

That's my name.\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's.....unique.\" said Greg, not sure what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blame my mom.\" Nah sighed. \"Anyway, I'm ready to head back. You coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure.\" Greg said in a hurry, as Nah was already past him, heading back to the group.</span></div></div>",

A few people in the camp seemed to stop Jacob and Kjelle upon seeing one or the other or both. One had grey hair and sounded quite passionate. Another man approached them named Walhart, who made Jacob feel immediately puny in comparison to him. And a man named Priam who held a sword that Jacob swore he saw somewhere else before in one of his books...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Kjelle soon sat at a small fire with food laid out when Jacob spoke up. \"You have family here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. They're over there,\" she said. She pointed to a woman with short red hair and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...he...he actually couldn't see a father. Jacob would press further, but was too hungry to care at the very moment. Jacob sighed and began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" Kjelle asked, reflecting the question back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob swallowed what was in his mouth before answering. \"I did...Maybe I still do...I'm not sure at the moment...\" Jacob said, thinking about how long he could've been stuck in the card.

Nah immediately raised an eyebrow, and Greg soon felt like that was too sensitive a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" asked Nah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. I apologize.\" said Greg quickly. \"I didn't mean any offense. It's just that I was curious since I heard Manaketes live so long.\" Greg tried to defend himself. Thankfully, to his surprise, Nah smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, really. I'm not that old, only in my teens. My mother is over 1000 though, although you wouldn't know it from her appearance or behavior.\" Nah sighed as she uttered that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you mean?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She almost looks younger than me, I'll say that much. And she acts like it.\" Nah sighed again. \"Not only can't Mom act her age but she couldn't even give me a real name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds rough.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too big a deal though.\" said Nah before turning her attention to Greg. \"But enough about me, what about you? You don't look like you're from Ylisse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Greg explained the story of how they arrived here, even finding Celica and Jacob down the line. Nah was genuinely impressed by his stories, engrossed even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I don't think I saw such Outrealms when we went there.\" said Nah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to the Outrealms?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few times. Settling some squabbles here and there. However, your journey sounds fascinating. I'd very much like to see it.\" smiled Nah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our merry group could use another member. You sure your parents won't mind though?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom won't worry, and I'm sure Father won't either.\" said Nah. \"Now, let's find your friend and go. I want to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Nah grabbed Greg's arm, and rather fiercely at that. It began to hurt a bit as Greg almost found himself being dragged back to the campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She claims her Mom is immature, but she seems to have her bouts too.\" Greg smiled to himself. Nah was going to be one interesting companion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily, they happened to see Sully and Nowi eating together on a log.

Frankly, both were afraid that they would refuse. Instead, Sully grinned while Nowi jumped with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you think you can handle Kjelle enough to travel with her, be my guest.\" Sully grinned at the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, the Outrealms sound fun!

The sooner the better.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they found Celica and said good bye for now to Chrom and friends. He did wish for them to visit again, something Greg said that they would be happy to do. With that said, the merry group was off, heading back towards the Outrealm Gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think the location will be as random as before?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\" spoke Greg.

Kjelle responded by slapping him on the back....hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a good laugh out of Greg, Celica, and Nah. It was enough to get their minds off of the heat for a little while. After the laugh, they continued onwards. Kjelle and Nah even told Greg and the others about when they found their friend, Laurent. It was in a hot area too; so much that they often hallucinated. Greg could only hope that wouldn't happen too much out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Nah's ears perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Greg.

He probably needed the bath more than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of give continued onwards, a little more inspired now. Soon enough, at the same time hoping that they weren't hallucinating, they saw a tiny group of palm trees just up ahead. If they squinted, they could even see a sign: Osiris Realm Oasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot!\" shouted Jacob, as he began running, which made Kjelle facepalm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down! You don't want to fall on the sand and hurt yourself!\" She then went after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shall we?\" smiled Greg to his partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall.\" smiled Nah in return.</span></div></div>",

Nobody knew why, but they couldn't even remember why they were in this realm. They were just focused on the fun. Even Kjelle and Nah were under the influence. Many times, Greg had to comb her long ark hair out of her face, her body looking nice in the blue bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while though, after at least an hour passed, the group got a bit tired out. They grabbed the towels that Anna had given them and dried off. However, almost as soon as they did though, they saw a light pass over their bodies. In an instant, their old bodies had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck just happened?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spring's specialty.\" said Anna. \"Those who wade in just lose themselves to the fun so to speak. It's quite a stress reliever really. You'd be surprised at how many people actually come by in this realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" said Nah, glad to be back in her old clothes to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, then why make us girls?\" asked Greg, raising an eyebrow. Anna just shrugged and winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well......that was more for personal amusement. Girls in bikinis are far more interesting don't you think\" She giggled at the last comment, making the boys blush. Kjelle on the other hand, was pretty mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you held us up for amusement?! Get over here!!\" And with that, Anna started running from Kjelle, the armored girl pretty mad at the moment. It was an amusing sight for the group, watching her try to keep up with the running Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we had an hour with no worries.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. And if my memory is correct, that swimsuit didn't look too bad on you.\" Celica smiled, making Greg blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he looks fine the way he is.\" said Nah in a matter-of-fact tone. Celica gave her a knowing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and why is that?\" she smirked. Nah's face turned a bit red and she didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got all their stuff, Kjelle was walking back to them, still trying to catch her breath. She apparently couldn't keep up with the merchant, getting a laugh from the group. Still, the brief diversion was fun, and now it was time to hit the road again. They certainly didn't want to be in swimsuits when enemies appeared.</span></div></div>",

Still, there was sand in all directions as they wandered. Jacob led in the front when he saw something in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter studying it from afar, he realized it was an Outrealm Gate. He turned back to the other, \"I think I see a gate over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sighed in relief as Nah smiled lightly. \"Good, I'll be happy to leave this realm.\" Greg commented. As they began to travel, they heard a noise. A yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob ran up a nearby sand dune to see a few men, dressed in loose garbs were frantically scattering as Risen attacked them. As the others ran beside Jacob, Greg noticed a man in dark armor on a horse. He realized it was the black rider from Bryyo. The rider didn't notice them, and rode through a nearby gate. Kjelle unsheathed her spear, \"We need to help them!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others agreed in unison and pulled out their weapons and managed to run down  and get in between the two lines. A few men from the defending line had swords drawn but weren't prepared. The number of Risen was fairly small though, so Greg and the others took them out fairly quick. Once the final Risen went down, a man approached them from the group. \"Thank you so much! I have no idea what we'd do if you weren't here. Listen, we're returning to a town some distance away, why don't you come with us for a reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they decide?</span></div></div>",

With that, the group went on their way, leaving Greg and everyone else at the gate. Greg turned his attention towards the gate.

Excuse me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob then realized the voice seemed to talk to him as he turned around. The woman there wore a pink button-like coat and had curly blonde hair. He also noticed she had a parasol it seemed and was holding it in her hand. \"Yes? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for my friend Lissa. Have you seen her?\" The woman asked. Jacob classes her as part of a regal family, having a more royal sounding accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name seemed barely familiar to Jacob. He remembered hearing the name among the crowd, but never saw who it was. \"Sorry, can't say I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!

While Celica ended up discussing with Sumia and Cordelia, Greg wandered off to take a look around. The land seemed to be pretty nice, although visible scars from wars were everywhere. Greg wasn't sure he wanted to know what transpired during those times. He probably would hear about it before long though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after exchanging a pleasantry or two with Chrom and taking a walk around, Greg soon found a yellow flash zooming towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleric, coming through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBONG!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that very yellow flash ran him over, sending him down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" cried Greg as he rubbed his head, which had impacted the ground.

I was in a rush!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg could hear a distinctly female voice as he slowly raised his head. He immediately blushed though as he looked at her. It was a blonde-haired girl, wearing a yellow cleric-like dress. She had a headdress over her hair. Not to mention.....she was quite pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, I'm sorry too.\" muttered Greg.

She scrambled out of bed rushing to get dressed as her father flung the door open. He was wearing his old armor, now spattered with blood. \" You need to leave now!\" She followed him outside, which now resembled Hell on earth as flames slowly consumed the Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       A large group of men were closing in on theme. They wore simple leather armor and bandanas making them look even more intimidating. Emma thought they would be attacked as a gravely voice interrupted. \" Stand back boys, this ones mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         The men parted revealing the most terrifying man she had ever seen. He stood above 6,5 he had a large beard, but no hair on his scalp. He held two large swords, one in each hand that were identical. \"  What's wrong Knight, don't recognize an old friend?\" The man stabbed the blades into the ground leaning on the strong handles. \" No I remember you, TwinBlade. I just wish I wasn't looking at your sorry arse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           TwinBlade let out a hardy laugh. \" Ha, the two things that didn't change is your armor, and sense if humor. Don't pity me, I,m not the one who became a farmer! The only thing you did was raise a beautiful daughter.\" He gestured towards her disturbing her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \" Listen to me! You need to run, go find Joshua and escape. Don't argue, I love you Em.\" She hugged him before turning and fleeing. She began to tire and stopped to rest. As she did she noticed a man lying on the cobblestone road. Her fears were confirmed as she got closer she recognized it as her brother. He had a deep hole in his chest and sword still in hand, Emma couldn't take any more and collapsed on he knees weeping \" No, Josh please don't leave me, I can't do this alone!\" she heard hooping closing in on her and quickly scrambled under a nearby bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she able to evade the bandits? </span></div></div>",

Where were they when the village needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The one in front wore very elaborately decorated armor, he was likely the leader. He leaped down demo ding his helmet in respect, he looked more like a king than a knight. \"Are you from the village?\" Emma simply nodded \" I know this may be difficult, but you must tell me what happened.\" One of the men wearing a black helmet climes down chuckling before removing his helmet. He appeared to be in his mid thirties, bald, and had a long scare on the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \" What can we achieve from a sniveling farm girl? She waists our time.\" Some of the other knights laughed at this, the king knight was not amused. Emma looked away in shame of being chastised. \" You are out of line Robert.

Like he was trying to avoid his kid sister, her in this case. She eventually noticed a large mansion resting at the very edge of th town. Estates always were needing help, plus she was a great candidate for the job. She could take care of animals, clean, and cook ( not great, but she could get by.) She walked passed the shining gates and up to the elegant door, she pounded the knocker and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          She stood waiting for quite some time, and just before she almost walked away when the door opened. Inside stood an entirely armored man the was nearly a foot taller than her. \" Yes?\" Asked a voice conflicting with the intimidating appearingm sounding like a man her age, possibly slightly younger. \" Oh, umm... I was wondering if I could see someone about a job?\" she asked her voice shaking from her nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \" That will be all Alfons.\" The armored man moved aside revealing a tall, slim butler, although the small scar along his hairline showed he wasn't always in the occupation. \" Please, follow me miss.\" He then closed the door behind her and led her up the ornate staircase. She followed him down seemingly endless hallway before knocking on the door at the end before opening the door. She suddenly felt like she made a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The man sitting at the desk appeared to be in his late twentys and had mid length black hair, not short but wasn't long either. He had green eyes that inspected her, he wore a blue military dress uniform with ribbons and medals, as did most of the other men and women in the estate. He was talking to a woman a little taller than herself, her blonde hair tied in a bun. Her uniform looking identical to the mans, minus the ribbons. The womans blue eyes judgeing her more harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \" Excuse me Major Hews, the young lady behind mr was asking about a job.\" The major still sat with his hands in-front of his mouth. \" Thank you Elton....\" The grey haired man walked out. The Major motioned towards the empty chair. She swallowed hard before accepting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Should we keep following her, or switch back.</span></div></div>",

I'm pretty sure you're not doing this for fun?\" smiled Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, no....No, I'm not.\" groaned Jacob as he staggered to his feet. \"Just didn't expect to miss a step there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta watch yourself, especially in these dark places.\" said Greg. \"I'm Greg, just so you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob.\" said Jacob as the two shook hands. \"So, what are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exploring mostly. I've done nothing but that since I left my own realm.\" explained Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you've traveled the Outrealms too?\" asked Jacob. Greg was a bit surprised to hear him say that so casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. You know of them?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been here and there, although I'd prefer most of them not ending with me flat on my face.\" said Jacob, rubbing the sore spot on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, duly noted.\" said Greg. \"So, what are your plans?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a white scarf around her neck with two tails of it hanging behind her. Her boots reached up to her ankles as her gloves were a little short from elbow-length.

She also looked through her inventory and saw only a Sword and Heal, Physic, and Catharsis. \"W-What happened?\" The Mist lookalike exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon noticed someone else slumped nearby and realized it must be Greg.

More and more, she woke up, yawning a bit as she did.

However, right as she said that, her eyes widened, causing her to stumble down a bit. Nervously, as the other girl looked on, Greg looked down at \"herself\". She was wearing some kind of white robe, although the skirt part was long and split at the sides, allowing her long and slender legs to be seen. The robe was tied at her waist with a blue cloth, and the top of the robe was long-sleeved. In addition to the robe, there were simple brown boots on her feet. As the wind blew by, she could feel long dark hair blow across her face. Unknowningly to him, he had become a lookalike of Karla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where am I?!\" Greg asked herself, seeing the form of an adult woman instead of his usual form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in whatever realm we just passed into.\" said the other girl. \"It's me, Jacob. For some reason, we got changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked at Jacob, seeing that it must be true for her to know that name. Keeping some kind of calm, Greg looked at her body again, blushing a bit at the look of breasts through the robe. Looking at her inventory, she had a Wo Dao, Killing Edge, Silver Sword, and some Elixers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen a sword this small, yet it feels pretty strong.\" said Greg as she took a look at the Wo Dao. It wasn't exactly common after all. She sheathed it soon after. \"Well, this was unexpected to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you got a good one. I got a kid.\" pouted Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? You appear to be almost an adult.\" said Greg with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look so mature. I saw my face in the pond over there and I look like a kid.\" said Jacob. Greg actually giggled a bit, surprising herself with how she sounded. Being a little older than he was before and being a woman felt really weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it looks like we somewhat retained our classes. I'm still a Swordmaster.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like I'm a Cleric, and yet I feel much stronger than a normal one.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny how that works.\" said Greg as she got up and straightened herself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw around them was?</span></div></div>",

Anyway, after a while, Greg finished up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jacob. You see anything?\" asked Greg as she had a drink of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much. I checked out the mining area.

But judging by her voice, no. Jacob looked around on the ground and heard the crunch of snow on the ground from her movements. Jacob shivered and sat up to see herself in white Paladin and long black hair hanging from her head. Jacob sighed and brushed off some snow and noticed that she seemed to be older now. \"At least I'm not a kid,\" Jacob said as she spotted another unconscious body nearby. The Astrid lookalike walked over and knelt over the person.</span></div></div>",

Greg imagined that this was the new Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume that's you, Jacob?\" asked Greg, hearing a similar maturity in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Jacob nodded. \"Not that I'm happy that I'm still a girl, but at least I'm grown up this time. You seem to have outdone me again, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted on the last part, causing Greg to raise an eyebrow. As she sat up, she got a look at herself. She was wearing some really fancy clothes, almost like royalty. The colors were a mixture of gold and white, with small pieces of armor. The boots also went up to her thighs. They reminded Greg of some old pictures of Pegasus Knights from long ago. Perhaps that was who she was now. She put a hand on her head, feeling long green hair was was mostly tied up on her head, but some strands fell to her shoulders. Standing up, she saw that she was still a bit taller than Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this wasn't expected.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not. You look like a Queen.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you have to be exaggerating.\" said Greg, a bit embarrassed at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. I almost feel like bowing to you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them blushed a bit at that, decided to not bring it up again. Anyway, they looked around, seeing that they were standing on a snowy mountain path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how are we going to get out of this?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I see, you're a Paladin, and I guess I'm a Pegasus Knight of some sorts.

Greg had traveled from his home realm of Kirada, wanting to seek out other worlds and learn more about how they worked. Jacob was in a similar situation, and the two had met each other while traveling. Deciding that traveling together was ideal, the two set out, although they didn't figure that they would end up lost after about a week. Right now, they were in the realm where there was a huge forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, if Karen doesn't hear from me every week, I wouldn't be surprised if she hunted me down herself.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can look at the bright side.\" said Jacob, looking at his map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The town of Saria is just up ahead. According to this, we should find it just outside of the forest, and that should be less than a mark away.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right. I'm tired.\" said Greg. Jacob smirked at his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you that worried that your cousin will come after you?\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen has always worried about me. It's part of the reason she joined the clergy back in Kirada.\" said Greg. \"She's reckless enough at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know.\" smirked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

He saw a shop with a red-haired girl at the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be selling some new energy tonic that Jacob hadn't seen before. Greg came beside him noticing the calling merchant. \"How about that?\" Jacob asked his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he said as the two approached the smiling merchant, who's finger was on her chin like her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome! What can I interest you in?\" She said cheery as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two tonics, please. For me and my friend here.\" Jacob said placing gold on the counter.

I find something to like at every village.\" replied Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I agree with.\" said Greg, patting his stomach a bit, as they had just drank that tonic about 10 minutes ago. Greg certainly felt better after drinking it, although the taste seemed a little odd to him. It didn't taste like any elixir he had before. In fact, he had no idea what it tasted like. While part of him thought that he was really over thinking this, something just didn't seem right. He sometimes wondered about those Annas after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jacob, do you ever have trouble buying from those Annas?\" asked Greg. \"I've seen quite a few in the past myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob gave it a minute of thought before replying. \"I think they're okay. I mean, sure, they seem a bit money-obsessed, but they've been reliable. I don't think they're the types who would lie about stuff. It could probably hurt their business if they lied and it came back to bite them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good point. I remember one time back in Kirada. Karen didn't trust them a whole lot. She said the everlasting smile creeped her out.\" said Greg with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds interesting.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Greg looked up to the sun, determining that it was probably mid-afternoon at that point. They would probably have to make a quick decision about whether or not to stay. Greg personally felt like continuing on. He didn't want to just wait around too much, as he wasn't the kind of guy that could sit around for long. However, as they walked, Greg briefly looked towards Jacob, and ending up doing a double take. Assuming Greg wasn't hallucinating, there were streaks of red beginning to enter Jacob's normally brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Jacob?\" Greg started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what is....\" Jacob started as he turned around. Suddenly, he jumped a bit, his eyes wide open. \"Greg, I may be wrong, but I see darker strands of red in your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Greg asked in a bit of shock. He had natural red hair, but it was a light red, kind of like strawberry-blonde, but Jacob said darker red hair? \"Hold on a sec, I see red strands of hair on you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jacob replied, unable to tell obviously. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBoth of them needed some way to confirm this, and they immediately turned to the inn that Saria had. There were mirrors in the break rooms (or bathrooms or whatever), so both of them made their way there, while not bumping anyone over. Once they got there and saw at least a good mirror, they confirmed what each saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, did we land in something? Because it's not washing out.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine.\" said Greg.</span></div></div>",

Give me a second...\" Greg soon walked off. Jacob waited and was looking through his tomes for any cause with no answers.

He could feel his new hair tickling the middle of his back now, and the same seemed to appear for Jacob. \"I certainly don't know any magic that causes changes this radical. You sure you didn't cast something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing I know can do this.\" defended Jacob. \"I'm not made for spells that can change people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if someone casted this on us.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'm just guessing.\" said Greg as he looked outside. The sun was beginning to set, and it probably wasn't a good idea to begin traveling again with night falling. It was with that in mind that Greg decided to get them a room here at the inn. Hopefully, no one would find them strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Jacob to himself for now, Greg went out to the counter and got a single room key for a certain amount of gold. No one paid any mind to his hair, to which he was grateful for. For some reason though, he could swear that he had seen that shade of red before, but shook it off as nothing. He returned to Jacob, bearing the key with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should get some rest here. Panicking won't do us any good right now. Perhaps a good nights sleep will clear our heads.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it could work.\" sighed Jacob, not feeling too confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they got themselves a good dinner at the inn, and decided to turn in for now. Jacob just hoped that perhaps they could leave the realm in the morning. Perhaps that could take care of the changes. Greg wasn't too sure, but he agreed with hoping that they would be behind them. They got into some sleep clothes and went to bed, hoping nothing else would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****The Next Morning*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg awoke to Jacob nearly shouting at him. He hoped that the whole inn didn't hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at yourself...and me!\" said Jacob. Greg groggily looked at Jacob before gasping and looking at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them looked a bit smaller than before, probably around 5'4 or somewhere around there, and their overall body frames seemed to be smaller too. Their muscles didn't seem as big, although they weren't bad. Still, they looked really weird, alarming both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm really worried.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's think through this. We should try to leave as soon as we can.\" said Greg, much to Jacob's agreement. Right before they left though, and packed up their things, both of them did their best to wash their face and all that. However, something came over both of them, finding a couple of hair ties in front of them. Without really thinking about it, both of them weaved their hair through them, forming their hair into a couple of cute ponytails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....how did we do that?\" asked Jacob, a finger briefly touching his chin as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.....I guess it looks nice.\" said Greg, briefly touching his chin too.</span></div></div>",

What caught Jacob's eye was a Second Seal and a Silver Sword. \"Excuse me? How much for those?\" He asked pointing at the two items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1500 gold.\" The owner replied plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed fair, but for some reason, Jacob couldn't accept that. After some haggling (and perhaps a bribe or two) Jacob got his items for 500 gold. Jacob walked away smiling with a finger on his chin for a moment. He entered a small outhouse and thought about what class to be. Obviously one that can use swords, he thought as he activated the seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the door opened and Jacob donned a new Trickster outfit. Colored red down the sides and yellow down the front.  A small teddy bear also hung from the Silver Word's sheath.

Splitting up wasn't exactly the best case for them right now. It was with that in mind that he had actually ended up eavesdropping on the conversation earlier, and his jaw had dropped a bit from hearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****During the previous chapter*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1500 gold.\" The owner of the chop was talking to Jacob, who seemed to be eyeing a couple of items. Greg could see that it was a Second Seal and a Silver Sword. What in the world did he need those for? He wasn't a swordsman. Even if he used a seal, how would he suddenly get to use a Silver Sword. Still, Greg observed them, and he saw an odd look on Jacob's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1500....\" He heard Jacob mutter to himself. He then saw him shake his head slightly, as if something was amiss. As the streets were a bit busy, Greg couldn't hear much of what happened next. However, he saw Jacob talking to the owner, which almost seemed like an odd discussion. He could even see Jacob holding out a couple of things, although he couldn't get a good look. The talk went on for about another 5 minutes, until he suddenly heard the owner say that he only had to pay 500 gold instead. That seemed to make Jacob happy, and he had a finger on his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say to him?\" Greg asked himself as Jacob disappeared into the nearby outhouse. He could swear he saw a brief flash from inside, meaning that the seal was being used. Greg had no idea where this was going, but he didn't think it could be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Back to the present*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what's up with the get-up?\" asked Greg as he approached Jacob, now wearing a red and yellow Trickster outfit. He was also wearing the Silver Sword he bought, and it had a little charm on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Greg. Find out anything?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....well not much. What's up with the new class?\" asked Greg. Jacob looked at himself, actually looking not quite sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I'm not sure. I guess I kind of went on autopilot back there. This does feel nice though.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it does. Though, what about your Dark Mage items?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I stay like this, I won't need them. Maybe I'll sell them.\" said Jacob, not sure about that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" nodded Greg. He wasn't sure how to handle this, but they had enough confusing things on their minds right now. \"Anyway, we do kind of need to consider our next move.\"</span></div></div>",

They have also given orders that no one should leave town until the wolves are routed or flee. Greg sighed and out a finger to his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also felt odd for another reason. While he had a finger to his chin, his arm seemed to press against something on his chest. Looking down he saw two breasts. Greg felt as though \"she\" should be surprised, but it felt to natural to be bad. Greg soon felt a finger tap her shoulder. \"Everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg turned to see Jacob had undergone a few changes herself.

We could use a little more gold anyway. We've got quite a bit of stuff that we don't need anymore anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true.\" said Greg with a finger to her chin. Briefly, she brought her legs together, somewhat thinking that something was missing. It was, as what was originally between her legs was gone, same with Jacob. So they really couldn't be called guys at all anymore. Still, that thought didn't seem to cross Greg's mind, although he still worried about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I saw an open area down the street a bit. Conveniently, it's near where some of the guards are. I think this could work.\" said Jacob.

She twitched slightly as her eyes became a nice red color, along with her cheeks and nose softening. A certain glint seemed to remain in her eyes afterwards. Looking towards her friend, Greg saw Jacob's own eyes becoming red, her own features softening as her face became an exact replica of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a doubt, except for Greg still having her mostly unfitting Myrmidon clothes, the two girls were now virtually identical. As if noticing this, in a new tone of voice, Jacob looked at Greg's attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that outfit really doesn't work for what we need to do.\" said Jacob. Greg looked over her unfitting clothes, getting a sense that she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're right. I could use something new.\" she said</span></div></div>",

Anna smiled, \"800 gold.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Greg shared a glance before both shook their heads. \"That won't do.\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anna talked to them, she saw an empty bottle in Greg's pouch, recognizing it as her energy tonic bottle. \"Hey, maybe I could take that flimsy bottle off your hands,\" Anna said mentioning to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg pulled it out. \"Drop your price to 400.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed and agreed.

Suddenly, as he was walking by, he started hearing noises. Confused, he looked left and right to see what was going on. He couldn't see anything new, but he was hearing sounds of fighting coming from a building to the side. It didn't look as nice as the rest of the city. It was more old and definitely not maintained. Frankly, Greg wanted to avoid most trouble, but his curiosity was getting the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked closer to the building, hearing the punching noises get louder. Just as he was going to look in, he heard them stop, hearing stepping noises near the door. He popped down near a bush, out of sight when someone passed by him. The person slammed the door in anger so hard that it actually left it slightly ajar. He didn't notice it however and kept on walking by. Curious, when the man was out of sight, Greg walked over, taking a brief look inside. It seemed like a small prison, although it wasn't that bad. Perhaps it was more a place for detainees instead. He only saw one occupant; a thief laying on the ground, badly injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what happened to you?\" asked Greg to the still-conscious thief. He smirked at Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing too much. Apparently, this is what happens when you pickpocket just a couple times.\" the man laughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You appear to be a thief, so I guess it's not surprising. What's your name?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nice to meet you.\" replied Jacob, slowly getting up. Some more blood fell as he tried to stand, hands and legs still bound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that man do that to you? I wasn't aware that jailers were allowed to abuse inmates.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't, but he didn't get the memo. Still, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't in dire straits right now. You mind helping me? I got his keys right before he left. The ogre was so mad that he didn't even stop to think.\" Jacob added a smirk as he revealed a set of keys underneath him. Using some flexibility, he shoved them past the bars to Greg. Greg didn't seem to think that the man was evil, and besides he might die if nothing was tended to. Wounds like that went beyond vulneraries and elixirs. Without another thought, Greg popped the keys in, walking inside and using his Steel Sword to cut the ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....you responded quickly.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not fully confidant about you, but you clearly need help and don't deserve to bleed to death. We'll have to find someone though because I'm no healer, and it'll also have to be someone who won't call the knights or whoever on us.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" said Jacob, a little winded and woozy thanks to the blood loss. He could barely stand as Greg helped him up.</span></div></div>",

Greg walked over and approached her. \"Excuse me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked over and smiled at Greg. \"Yes? What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg knelt down as well. \"You're a cleric right? I need help. My friend is hurt and needs some medical attention. Can you help him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stood with Greg. \"Of course. I'm still training but I'll do what I can.\"  She was led to the room by Greg as she knelt beside Jacob and held the staff over him as she began to heal him. She finished a few minutes later and walked to Greg. \"Can I wait until he wakes up, just to make sure he's okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, thank you.\" Greg said as they waited for their friend to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbiut three hours passed before Jacob woke up again. He sat up with a hand to his bandaged forehead. He then looked to his side to see Greg sitting there. \"Feeling better?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stretched. \"Y-yeah. Thanks.\" He replied. Greg also had bought a loaf of bread and a flask of water for him and handed them over. Jacob ate and drank the meal. Jacob laid on his back when he was finished. Jacob thought something over in his head before asking the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Greg, I'm not sure what you're doing, but could I tag along perchance?\" Jacob asked.</span></div></div>",

As much as he believed that Jacob wasn't as bad as he made himself out to be, he wasn't sure if he wanted a thief tagging along. He was doing fine on his own. Then again, Karen would always tell him that \"the more the marrier\". He hardly listened to Karen's advise, but perhaps this could work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right....I guess you can. Perhaps you can block a stray arrow or two.\" Greg added with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" That got a bit of a laugh from the two men. The extra member of the group pulled her cowl over her head, almost feeling like she wasn't needed here. However, Greg soon rectified the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jacob, this is......\" Greg actually blushed out of embarrassment. He totally forgot to ask the cleric's name. \"Actually, what's your name?\" Jacob laughed at the situation. Greg was so eager to find a healer that he totally forgot his manners. The girl smiled at him though, not minding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Kuo, and it's very nice to meet you.\" She said with a bow. \"I don't think I've seen either of you two in town before. Are you new to town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he was just in jail, and I was traveling through.\" said Greg, getting a look from Jacob. Kuo gasped a bit at the \"jail\" bit, but a quick explanation fixed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, thanks a bunch for the save. You're pretty good.\" said Jacob. Kuo smiled gently, although she shook her head at the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no where near as good as Mother Hera. To be honest, I just started training a few months ago. I'm glad my staff helped you enough though.\" said Kuo. Then, she kept talking. \"By the way, you're both travelers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am for sure, and he's apparently decided to tag along.\" said Greg. Kuo smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great. Then, would it be all right if I accompanied you as well?\" She asked sincerely. Both Greg and Jacob dropped their mouths at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you ask that?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of my training involves traveling and developing my skills. I still have a lot to learn, and I promise you that I can be of help. Please.\" The girl looked pleadingly into Greg's face. To be honest, it started reminding him of when Karen would try to guilt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this girl is really naive to trust traveling with people she doesn't even know.\" Greg thought. The girl was around 14 years old, and quite frankly, barely looked it. She had a childish kind of face, thought it did bring out her yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a healer is always helpful on the road. So, I guess we'll be happy to have you.\" said Greg. Kuo instantly brightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?! Thank you so much. Can I meet you at the North exit? I need to get my things and tell Mother where I'm going. See you then.\" And with that, she was off like a bolt of Thoron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl has a really innocent way of getting what she wants.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" spoke Greg.</span></div></div>",

I never really had a destination in mind.\" said Greg, looking to his new travelmates. \"And how did you convince everyone so quickly, Kuo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other clerics didn't really pay much attention. They mostly just shook their heads without really thinking. I'm still really young in my training.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been doing it?\" asked Jacob. Kuo paused in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I guess about 2 years now, so I was around 12 years old. I got started later than others. Truth be told, my parents live in a nearby town, and my Dad's a blacksmith. I actually wanted to learn how to use a sword when I was a child.\" She spoke to everyone, surprising them a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, and yet you somehow ended up a cleric?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't take too long for me to realize that I didn't like inflicting pain on others. Besides, my Mom was a cleric herself, so I decided to follow in her footsteps instead.\" She pulled her cowl down again, feeling a little embarrassed at her little speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't feel bad. People have different talents.\" smiled Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as your talent for stealing things.\" quoted Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.....Hey!\" Greg and Kuo had a good laugh at Jacob's expense, which made him laugh a little later. They at least seemed to be bonding somewhat, although Greg didn't know what to fully think of his comrades. To be honest, looking at Kuo reminded him of Karen back home. Boy, she must be worried by now as well. She was also a cleric, well, a war cleric to be exact. She was pretty far along, since she started when she was 4 years old. By comparison, Greg didn't start his sword training until much later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is that an Anna?\" Jacob spoke up. Greg looked up to see a merchant caravan traveling its own path along the rail, with said person at the ready. The two parties noticed each other, and Anna stopped her horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, is Delian this way?\" she asked. Delian was the name of the town they just went by, so Greg nodded yes. \"Great, thanks! Stop by some time why don't you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she was cheerfully on her way, leaving the trio behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those Annas are always so cheerful.\" shrugged Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where they get it from. I even wonder where they all come from.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I once heard a rumor that there's an entire realm where they come from.\" Kuo spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's news to me.\" replied Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not think about it. An entire realm of them? Brrrr....\" Greg didn't want to think much more of it. Hopefully, whenever he goes into another realm, he'll be able to avoid this \"Anna realm\" or whatever it was. Besides, there were surely better places to see.</span></div></div>",

The three were about to walk by when Kuo spotted an interesting staff for sale. She told Jacob and Greg to go ahead as she looked at it. \"What is that?\" Kuo asked innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smiled with a finger on her chin as usual. \"That's a special staff there. It's called a 'Polymorph staff' it can make anyone anything. You can have it for 5000 gold.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo dug through her money and found a small amount no where close to that. Being a Cleric and staying in town didn't make much money since the monastery provided for her. Anna, taking note of this decided, \"How about you just take it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Kuo said wide-eyed. Anna smiled and nodded as Kuo thanked her and ran off with the staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Greg turned back to see Kuo running happily toward them with a new staff. \"Nice,\" Jacob said. He would inquire more but they found an Outrealm Gate and were ready to pass through. So they did without questioning the staff.<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\nThe trio walked out the other end before being met by heat. Their eyes adjusted and they saw a long beach in front of them. Kuo giggled excitedly as Jacob stretched and sighed. \"Guess we can rest here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded, \"Too bad I don't have my swimsuit with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo walked to a nearby shack with another Anna inside and asked about swimsuits. Anna replied, \"We have a lot of swimsuits,  but only for girls.\" Kuo then looked at the staff and then at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Granted, he had never been to somewhere like this before, but what kind of beach only sold girls' suits? Wouldn't that put a damper on tourism?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't make them. I just sell them. Besides, I think some got lost. Trans-dimensional travel and all that.\" responded Anna with a wink. Greg just groaned. What a load of BS. He was really getting tired of these Annas. Why did they all have to be so weird compared to the average merchant. From the look on Jacob's face, he seemed to share the same sentiment. He had no business being here if he wasn't wanted. Perhaps they should just walk away and find somewhere else to waste their time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, they considered it before....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take some.\" said Kuo, running up to Anna. \"I've never seen these before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We plan on selling them to more realms soon. You wouldn't believe how most places aren't even aware. Gives this place kind of a special feel, don't you think?\" Anna winked again at them. \"So, you want three or just for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo gave a bit of a thinking look, looking kind of cute with that childish face of hers. Greg wasn't sure why she was briefly looking at her new staff. Then, she immediately smiled. She held up three fingers, asking for three suits. Anna wasted no time in handing her three sets of bikinis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming, and enjoy your stay at BeachAnna.\" Kuo gave a respectful bow in thanks to Anna, grabbing all three sets and running away from the the stand. She motioned for the boys to follow her. Both of them could only wonder what was going on in the Cleric's head. Still, they followed her, heading to a small area where some blankets and umbrellas were set. It was kind of surreal for all three of them; you don't see this in their hometowns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Kuo stopped, smiling cutely at the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a solution to our problem.\" Kuo immediately whipped out her Polymorph Staff, which allowed Greg a better look at it. It had a unique unique, with a violet jewel in there, almost like a Restore Staff. \"I'm going to fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fix what?\" smirked Jacob. \"What can that thing so anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll fine out.\" Kuo smiled again as she aimed her staff at them, making them raise an eyebrow. \"All right, let's try this. Polymorph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash emitted itself from the staff, enveloping both boys in light-purple light. Greg wanted to ask what was going on, but felt his body go stiff for a couple seconds as he was enveloped entirely. After a few seconds, the light dimmed down, and both Greg and Jacob felt disoriented. However, they looked straight to Kuo, who was covering her surprised mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it does work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does---\" Greg immediately stopped, hearing a distinctly feminine voice. He looked down to see himself definitely a girl; petite with good proportions and a darker shade of pink hair. She immediately looked to Jacob, who was now Kuo's size very good proportions and short purple hair. She was just as shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that about?!\" Jacob almost yelled. Kuo just gave a childish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the merchant who gave me this said that it could change anything, so I wanted to try it out. I guess that's what you look like because that was the image in my head at the time. Now we can all have fun!\" Kuo smiled again. Greg and Jacob looked at each other oddly. Hopefully this was just a temporary thing. Kuo helped them change into bikinis. For now, they could live with it. They needed a vacation after all, especially Jacob after her stay in prison.</span></div></div>",

They reached the water's edge as Kuo walked up toward them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for? Come on!\" Without warning, Kuo yanked the two girls into the water. She soon got the two to begin swimming with their new bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls changed games. Either playing tag in the water or splashing one another, they played games for awhile. The two used-to-be boys having fun all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon took a break.

This isn't even close to my natural hair color.\" Greg pointed out to the long pink hair down her back. Kuo just smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just thought whatever came into my head and went with it. Besides, I thought pink and purple would make you look more exotic. That's what a lot of people say about my silver hair.\" She smiled at them while saying that. To be honest, Greg never got a good look at it before. Kuo always had her cowl up, so Greg never got a good look. However, her hair was now in full view, going down a little bit past her shoulders. He had to admit; it did make her look exotic. The last time he ever saw such a thing was when he was reading about the Priestess of Dawn, Micaiah, in the old tales of Tellius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jacob had finished as well, drying herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as fun as this was, I'd say it's time to change back. Think you could do that?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, already?\" asked Kuo with a little pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'd say so. Going beyond this area in these bodies might not be good for our psyche. Besides, our old clothes don't fit these bodies.\" said Greg. Kuo then brightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can try to see if the staff will change your clothes too.\" she offered. Greg found it a bit cute, but it was time to put it to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuo, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" Kuo relented finally. It was fun while it lasted. They walked back to their spot, where Greg and Jacob changed back into their now too-big boy clothes. Kuo changed back into her Cleric outfit and grabbed Polymorph. Reciting the same words as before, Greg and Jacob were enveloped again, and soon found themselves back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweet mercy.\" Jacob smiled as he flexed a bit, making Greg groan a bit. He couldn't help but notice Kuo looking a little sad though. While Jacob was enjoying the return of masculinity, Greg walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Are you okay?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo's face seemed like it couldn't make up its mind between happy or sad. \"I'm sorry. It's just that I was kind of sheltered by my parents. I never got a chance to play with other girls. Even when I joined the clergy, they're all business and little else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Greg felt a bit sorry about before. So Kuo had a reason for being so passionate about their forms before. He gave a smile and put a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that we could help you then.\" He gave her a soft smile as she looked at him. \"Tell you what, the next time he need a vacation, you can do whatever you want. We'll have some more fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you!\" Kuo then hugged him, almost reminded Greg of when Karen would do the same. He smiled as he patted her on the back. This girl reminded him quite a bit of his cousin back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay with that idea?\" asked Greg to Jacob, who heard the whole thing. He shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm okay with it, as long as it's not every other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" The group had a nice laugh after that. Anyway, after saying good bye to the Anna in charge, the group decided to head off. The sun was in its afternoon cycle by now, so they had to figure out how to proceed next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Um, what?\" Greg wasn't sure what to think. All of a sudden, Jacob looked like Anna, then a horse, and now....this? It was a pretty elegant dress. It almost reminded Greg of a Cleric dress, but much more elegant and strapless. It almost reminded Greg of that supposedly special class that existed only in the Outrealms, known as the Bride class. So that wasn't just a legend? Well, the more you learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it's so beautiful.\" Kuo's eyes practically sparked in delight, as if she was forgetting the issue here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kuo? I'm not sure Jacob is okay with this.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think he is right now. He seems content actually.\" As Kuo said that, she suddenly stopped, as if she just had some kind of realization. \"Amazing. Greg, I think this staff can affect someone mentally too. I don't sense any hostility or anything from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, how do you \"sense\" something from a dress?\" asked Greg. His mind was overflowing with questions right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because I changed him or something? I'm not sure. All I know is that this is pretty cool!\" Kuo got excited again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I know this is kind of fun for you, but I'm not sure if this is the place for that.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're not in a hurry, right? Besides, I want to find out everything this can do. I wonder if anything new will happen if I use it on you. Please?\" asked Kuo. Greg sighed, but didn't resist. She would probably just do it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it over with. Man, I feel like I'm dealing with Karen here.\" He mumbled the last part to himself so Kuo didn't hear. She put Jacob down for now, and focused Polymorph on Greg, enveloping him in light again. However, the sensation felt a bit different this time, and he felt totally different once it stopped. He saw Kuo's jaw open as it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg raised an eyebrow as she looked at himself. \"She\" gasped a bit as she looked around, seeing herself in a pink War Cleric-like outfit. Familiar pink hair tied in a ponytail flew behind her. It didn't take long for Greg to see who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck? How did you turn me into my cousin?\" Greg asked. This was Karen's body; Greg's own cousin who joined the clergy herself at a young age. She was so good that she even advanced to the next class by the time he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your cousin? I was actually thinking of you looking like some kind of prince. How did that look come around?\" asked Kuo, just as perplexed as Greg was. However, after a minute, Greg came to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking about her as you hit me. Perhaps the spell also reacts to whatever the transformee is thinking.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, really? Wow, that's some magic.\" said Kuo, as she smiled again. \"So, why does she have pink hair but you don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Mom and her sister have pink hair, and Karen inherited it.\" Greg explained simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" said Kuo. \"At least you don't think like her. I wasn't trying to change your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how thoughtful of you. Could you change me back now?\" asked Greg.</span></div></div>",

But instead of him turning to normal, he changed into something a little different. Her pink hair went to neck length behind her head as hair hung from the sides. She also seemed to become a bit younger with a softer face. She finally stopped changing as she looked at Kuo. Kuo looked a bit nervous until Greg smiled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for? Let's keep exploring,\" she said. Kuo giggled with glee and agreed. Then she turned to see where she left the dress that was Jacob. She found him and then looked at Greg and grinned. She walked over and handed Jacob to Greg. \"A dress?! Thank you Kuo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo was a little surprised. It seemed like Greg had forgotten Jacob was the dress. She smiled anyway as Greg found a few bushes to change behind.

You had one girl wearing a dress you'd hardly expect to travel in, and some Cleric that acted like a child. Still, the new Greg just chatted about the strangest things, almost like some high-strung noblewoman. Still, even that worked for Kuo. She just enjoyed the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading down the trail from BeachAnna, a sizable town soon came into view, called \"Telion\" judging by the sign. Kuo walked down the path with her friend, heading in without much trouble. Nobody really seemed to pay attention to the odd little duo, which Kuo was grateful for. She was not the standout type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, such a busy town.\" said Greg with a smile. \"How big do you think this town is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger than my hometown for sure.\" responded Kuo. Soon after that, both of their stomachs rumbled, which made them laugh a bit. They made a turn for the local inn, since they served food there for sure. It was nice and quiet, although Kuo could have sworn that Greg got some favoritism from the waiter. Was it the dress? The breasts? The smile? Kuo almost felt a little inadequate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" asked Greg. Kuo shook her head of those thoughts, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing.\" she replied. They finished up their meal with their gold and left. However, Kuo decided to change things up, and lead Greg behind the Inn. Waving Polymorph, she released the mental hold on Greg, and she suddenly came to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuo! What was all that about? Gods, the things that came out of my mouth.\" Greg spat. Obviously, she remembered what she said while under the mental influence of Polymorph. Kuo gave a sheepish smile and put her hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! Really, I am. I just wanted to have fun.\" she defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware of that, but is this really the time. I mean, the things I said back there. So embarrassing. If my family ever hears of this, there goes my credibility.\" Greg put a hand to her head, feeling really frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you're back to normal, right?\" Kuo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only in mind. Could you please change me back so I can change to my normal clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" sighed Kuo. Guess the party was over for now. She waved the staff again and Greg slowly reverted back to his male form. He soon got back into his normal Mercenary garb, feeling much more comfortable now. Now, all that was left was the Jacob dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as funny as it is for a thief to be a dress, could you please fix this?\" asked Greg.</span></div></div>",

Greg nodded and Kuo seemed a bit excited to continue. They then entered to the next realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered and saw a dark thundering sky. Before them was a tall tower with broken ruins before it. As soon as they entered, Kuo jumped behind Jacob shaking. \"Huh? Kuo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't like it here...I wanna leave!\" Kuo said urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We begin shortly milord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stopped and quickly hid against the ruins walls and looked to see a man in dark robes before a large open room. The man was met with a loud thunderous voice. \"Good. Before long, I will return to the realms. I can finally return to my rightful place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob then realized it was a dragon. They needed to get out. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw an Outrealm Gate straight to their right. He motioned to Greg to go to it. He did so and stood next to it ready to pass through. Kuo and Jacob then ran for it and entered with Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ran into a field on the other side and took a breather. \"That was creepy,\" Greg commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob thought, \"What was that lizard talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo was still a little shaken. \"Maybe we can just relax a little and maybe find out later.\" Jacob and Greg sighed in agreement as they began to travel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

This realm was different from where they were before, but anything was better than those ruins. What in the world was that thing? Greg had certainly never seen anything like it. Sure, he read books about various legends throughout history, but....seeing was truly believing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think it was?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've read legends, but who knows for sure. There have been quite a few dragons that have had quite an impact on history.\" said Greg, still breathing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, like who for example?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there was the Shadow Dragon Medeus. He was so strong that it took the Hero-King Marth to take him down, and even then it wasn't a sure thing. Outside of him, there was Loptyr in the Jugdralian legends, and I even heard another dragon recently ravaged against the land of Ylisse. Forgot his name though.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say. Boy, I don't want to meet any of those.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's to say who we saw was any of them. Who knows what evils are throughout the realms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the bastards. So dark and evil and.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Greg turned to see Kuo aiming Polymorph at Jacob, enveloping him in light once again. Greg barely blinked before Jacob disappeared, only leaving a dress where he once stood. This one was considerably more frilly than the last one; a pinkish-white color with some frills. It definitely looked more girly than before. Kuo ran up and hugged it, seemingly feeling more content. Greg narrowed his eyes at her. The way she acted just before using Polymorph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuo, are you alright?\" Greg asked. Kuo jumped a bit before talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course, why wouldn't I be?\" Greg wasn't buying it though. She freaked out just before using the staff, and judging by the way she just embraced the dress right after it happened told the whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....this is your way of relieving stress?\" Greg asked. Kuo looked down, seemingly a bit guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..well I....\" Greg could easily tell she wasn't well. From the moment they set foot in that temple, she's looked even paler than she normally did, and she was fair to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg...please....can I? Just for a little bit?\" How in the world could Greg resist that? Perhaps the girl needed a little security to get her mind off it. Besides, the dress seemingly had this \"ready to be worn\" feeling, which Greg imagined meant that Jacob's mind was changed again. He sighed, knowing that Jacob wouldn't like it, but perhaps giving Kuo this brief time would be good for her mental psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you can go on.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" said Kuo, flashing a brilliant smile.</span></div></div>",

He was worried about asking it for multiple reasons, but asked anyway. \"Hey Kuo?

Certainly.\" Greg responded, much to Kuo's delight. Man, his insides just became mush around this girl. Why did kids have to be his one weakness? Well, not much he could do about it now. The next village seemed to be in sight. This one looked circular in design, with some large structure in the middle; a really tall one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, is that a monastery? It's huge!\" spoke Greg as he looked from the nearby hill. Kuo clapped her hands together when she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, perhaps I could do some training here. I've never been to any outside of Bryyo.\" Kuo said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it would be good for you. Although, it's really late now. Perhaps we should turn in once we get in. You can do your thing tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the duo walked into the town of \"Aldean\" as it seemed to be called. Shops were closing down for the night, so they went straight to the inn. They only had to pay for two, which apparently was at least one benefit of the staff. Kuo suggested turning Greg into some clothing for her and they would only have to pay for one. He turned it down for now. Maybe next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some dinner, the two retired to their room, which would be more than big enough. Kuo hung Jacob up on a rack and changed into some provided sleepwear, as did Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you so desperate for companionship like this? You've taken to turning us into clothes at times and even girls entirely.\" said Greg. Kuo sat down on her bed, combing through her hair a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't born in the town you arrived in. My parents were really cautious with me. I didn't get to really play with anyone my age; no girls or boys. Eventually, I was just left at the monastery, where the Head Cleric decided to take care of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rough. What kind of parents are they to leave their daughter like that?\" Greg asked with a hint of anger. He couldn't stand parents who left their kids to the dogs like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I'm sure they're nice people.\" Greg looked to see Kuo giving a sad smile. \"I'll be a good Cleric, and then I'll go back and show them how much I've grown up, and....I'm sure they'll let me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gave her a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****The Next Day*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them woke up the next day, got ready, and Kuo changed Jacob back. His memory was a little hazy, but at least he apparently sleep well, for what it's worth. Greg and Kuo got a good laugh either way. They went down and got themselves some breakfast. However, right as they left, Greg spotted something to the side. There were some shady people heading in the direction of the monastery in the center of town. Perhaps he was a bit paranoid, but he was worried. The last thing a peaceful town needed was shady people infiltrating the clergy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Jacob and Kuo saw them too. They all nodded that something seemed off in this seemingly peaceful town.</span></div></div>",

Those kinds of people walking in mass to a monastery worried him. Greg seemed to share a similar feeling about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Kuo asked the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thought for a moment before Jacob sighed. \"Well, we could sneak in with them if Kuo used the Polymorph Staff.\" Jacob said. Greg seemed to nod in agreement when Kuo smiled and pointed the staff at the two. Light enveloped them as their clothes morphed and bodies tingled. Soon they finished. Jacob put his hood down for now. \"Thanks Ku-\" She stopped about halfway to realize she had a female voice. She looked down at her clothing to see the cloak and everything, but also a skin tight black covering across everything below her neck, similar to what most Sorcerers wear. She saw his hair was long and dark purple. She looked to see Greg given the same change with light pink hair tied into a braid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuo? Why did you make us girls?\" Greg asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo smiled brightly, \"That was my own choice.\" The two looked at each other then back at Kuo who just smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay out of sight for now and we'll find you here alright?\" Jacob said, Kuo nodding. The two began toward the monastery when Jacob said, \"I think that girl's growing on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled, \"If anything, you're going on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob went a light red at the dress involvement. \"H-hey...!\" She said as Greg gave another chuckle.

With that they went off searching. It wasn't long until they got an answer. Apparently a special item was kept in the monastery. A chipped shard from a dragon's claw. She said it was deep inside the monastery and on display, but practically impossible to obtain. Greg thanked the cleric as the two entered the Monastery. As they did, Jacob wondered, \"How did the other guys not notice this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shrugged her shoulders, \"Maybe they didn't even know what they were looking for. Maybe they only knew it was here.\" Jacob shrugged as the two soon saw the key in a locked box. The covering seemed to be enhanced magically so the glass wouldn't shatter easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jacob began searching herself frantically. \"Do I still have it.....Ah-ha!\" He soon removed a key looking object and stuck it in the lock and began fidgeting with it. Greg looked to her confused before Jacob explained. \"It's a skeleton key. I can try and usually pick any lock with this.\" A few minutes later and Jacob opened the case and grabbed the claw shard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two exited, a small group of these cultists saw what Jacob had and ordered her to stop. This sent Greg and Jacob in a run. They re-entered the alley with Kuo who was waiting and said, \"Hurry, can you hide us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo stammered a little before casting a quick spell. The cultists approached the alley and looked down it to see a brown dog along with a black one in the alley. The cultists moved on as Kuo came out of hiding from behind corner. She looked at the two and gave them their original clothes and bodies. Soon Jacob said...</span></div></div>",

They ran in the other direction, behind the monastery and towards the north side of town, which almost seemed like it's own city. Seriously, this town was big enough for two cities. The north side even seemed to have its own identity, so perhaps that would work in their favor. They ran down the road a bit, avoiding some passers on the way, with Kuo trying to say sorry to most of them before Jacob pulled her along. As the crowds got a bit bigger, they kind of blended in, and went down a small insertion between a couple of buildings. There was a quite a bit of commotion as many cultists ran by their hiding spot, looking everywhere with anger. One of them came near the hiding spot, and Greg had to hold down a yell from Kuo. Soon enough, they didn't hear much, and Greg took one look out just to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, looks like we might be good....for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt they think we've left the city, so they'll still be around.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for a peaceful town. I just hope none of the citizens get seriously hurt.\" said Greg as he took a brief look at the item in question. \"A claw of all things? Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet it's related to whatever we saw in that temple. Looks like whoever it is can go between realms too. That isn't good.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I certainly didn't expect to run into things like this when I left Kiradia. Still, I guess we're in the middle of it now. It's nice though that Kuo's staff actually proved useful for once.\" Greg added with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. For once, it served a good purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo pouted indignantly, getting a good laugh from the boys. Greg looked up to the sky, seeing that it was now about midday, given the sun's location. They had quite a bit of time before nightfall, so they had to decide what to do next. Kuo looked like she didn't want to leave. She wished she could have seen more of the monastery, but that might be a hornet's nest by now. </span></div></div>",

This caught Greg's attention. \"What are you doing?\" Greg asked, catching Kuo's attention now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks as though those cultists will be a problem, so I wanna be helpful in a fight.\" With that, a light enveloped Jacob and he stood their again in blue Myrmidon outfit with an iron sword at his waist and a headband. \"I might not be experienced,  but I can help.\" Greg nodded in approval as they continuing packing. Soon they left town and went Northeast.<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\nAfter about two hours of travel, they found a village much different from the one they left. Houses were made of straw and other foreign materials. There was a large creek running through the middle of the town, and alongside the coastline were cherry blossoms. It looked quite relaxing to the trio. As they wandered into town, they looked around. It didn't seem like there was a good place to stay. As soon as they considered turning around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio turned to see a girl with long black hair tied  into a ponytail behind her.

Her voice seemed somewhat firm, but timid. \"C-can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacib nodded. \"We're looking for a place to stay for a day or two, could you help us find an inn or perhaps a-\" He was cut off as the girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can stay at my home. It's fairly large so I'm sure it can accommodate all of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were somewhat shocked, but accepted gratefully. \"I'm Isabel.\" She said as she led them into her home, located near the river in a grove of cherry blossoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Let's just say that we ran into a bit of trouble with some cultists back in Aldean. Last I checked, they were scouring the city, looking for us. It got a little crazy, but we snuck out of town successfully. After that, we just ran on whatever trail we could for a few hours. And then, we just ran into you and the town.\" Greg explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel's eyes widened a bit as he explained. \"Cultists, you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, have you heard of them?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were they in black suits and cloaks?\" asked Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Kuo answered this time.

It sounds like you'll be busy.\" said Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it, especially since Jacob wasted 1000 gold on a Second Seal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that got another good laugh.</span></div></div>",

Would Kuo ever get tired of making people into clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Jacob said to her while they were eating some dinner. \"That spell might be useful if we kind some corrupt lord or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you would punish a corrupt lord by making him clothing?\" Greg chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that, or maybe some ditzy girl. Whichever sounds worse at the time.\" Jacob more whispered that last part, as not to tell Kuo and Isabel about it. The four of them were just enjoying a nice dinner, since Isabel did ask that they at least spend the night. Greg wasn't sure about putting the village in danger, but given everything that happened, they needed the rest, so he accepted the offer. The place was nice enough anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Next Morning*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and the others woke up at the crack of dawn the next morning, which gave them a nice look at Kuo's bed hair.

However, when he saw her door open, he saw her getting a bunch of supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to come with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Greg was surprised to say the least. \"No offense, but your people here need you. You can't run off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cousin can fill in for me. He was actually in charge for a while until I got older. The village will be just fine.

The villagers seemed to be just fine with her decision, and said cousin was quite confident of her. Without much else, the group of four went off, aiming to find just what was going on in the Outrealms.</span></div></div>",

Isabel watched in wonder as the light took only a second or two before dying down. In the place of Greg and Jacob were two well-dressed clerics, both of whom with their cowls up,hiding their heads. The basis for them seemed to be similar to their female forms from before, with longish hair covered by the cowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so cute!\" Kuo squealed at both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you learned to at least ask by now?\" asked Jacob out of exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently she hasn't. Let's just go.\" A female voice didn't even phase them now. They had gotten pretty used to them as well as Kuo's antics. Isabel wished them good luck, much to Jacob's slight embarrassment. Anyway, adjusting their white cloaks, the two of them began their walk to the Monastery. Perhaps it was because they were Clerics now, but the tension in the air seemed higher now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They certainly left their mark on the place.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cult certainly means business.\" Greg didn't feel confident about this at all. He could only imagine how Karen, a Cleric as well, would handle this situation. Probably not much better. Anyway, they got inside the building, hoping to find the right person to talk to. They found one cleric hanging around the nearby staircase, apparently doing some clean-up. Her cloak was the typical garb, with dark blue hair around her shoulders. Greg figured that was their target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss?\" Greg walked over, relic in hand from Jacob, to the woman, who gently smiled at them as they approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello. I don't believe I've seen you around before.\" She spoke gently, but it wasn't a demure tone. Greg cleared \"her\" throat before talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, we just came around here. I'm.....uh.....Kris.\" spoke Greg, coming up with something on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you. I'm Celdia....what is that you have?!\" She immediately noticed the relic in Greg's hands. Greg smiled and handed it right to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those cultists from earlier stole it, but we got it back.\" Greg started. \"Do you happen to know who they were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much, but they're part of some kind of dragon cult. At least, that's all they ever talk about. I've sen them as far as the country along the sea too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That far?\" Were these cultists everywhere? What a hassle. \"How would you know that much?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I sometimes head back home there. I live in another country, but the Monastery here is tops in the realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you travel that fast?\" Greg asked, genuinely curious right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I fly.\"</span></div></div>",

Greg and Jacob were both surprised by her carefree demeanor and shocked at how fast she made the decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks.\" Jacob said, but soon followed up with, \"But we need to show you something before we head out.\" Celdia nodded and followed them out toward Kuo and Isabel. Jacob quickly explained the plan to the two, who agreed. Then Kuo, without hesitation waved the Polymorph Staff and a light enveloped Jacob and Greg changing them back into their normal selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeldia looked surprised, but began laughing, making Jacob and Greg feel more embarrassed before. \"So, how do we get to Adamah?\" Isabel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeldia pointed toward a nearby dock, \"We can take the boat straight to the capital, Riviera. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo giggled,  \"A boat? I never actually rode one before.\" Jacob remembered the fact that she was mostly isolated for her entire life, making it understandable. The group soon made their way toward the dock, Celdia paying for the fare as we boarded a fairly large ship that soon set sail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Greg didn't get to take many boats in the past, so this was a rare chance for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, isn't it?\" asked Celdia, her cowl laying off of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is.\" Greg responded.

Not to mention, there was the fact that Jacob and I were in...certain disguises.\" Greg began to trail off a bit, almost feeling embarrassed by it. It was bad enough for Isabel to know, but Celdia too? Still, Celdia just laughed gently at Greg's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind at all. I'll admit that I was surprised to see a staff that can change appearances like that, but I'm fine with that. There are many fun things in the world, and I'd like to see them all someday.\" explained Celdia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gave a small smile as she said that. \"Fair enough I suppose. Though, it must be expensive for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not short on funds, trust me.\" Celdia smiled. \"I've got a bit more than the average cleric so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, you said that you \"fly\", but you never explained as much.\" said Greg, who had been wanting to ask that for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy. I'm a Pegasus Knight.\" Celdia instantly laughed upon seeing Greg's confused face. \"Yeah, I inherited it from my grandmother. Poor thing was sick though so I couldn't fly here.

I'll can tell you more later.\" said Celdia. \"You bunch seem to be the most bizarre yet fascinating people I've ever met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Greg said sarcastically. Celdia meant well, though that didn't mean much for his image. However, Celdia perked up upon hearing another lurch from Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your friend isn't holding up too well.\" Celdia said as they both turned around to see her on the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...hate...this....boat....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Isabel shared a brief laugh, even as Kuo tried her best to soothe the poor girl.</span></div></div>",

I'd say that we need to head back to the Outrealm Gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we know of any others?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know any, aside from the one we came through. We don't have the time or leisure to search for a new gate.\" said Greg, much to Kuo's displeasure. From the look on her face, you could swear that she was close to changing them both just do she could go inside the Monastery. Still, she seemed to calm down, albeit with still some pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" Greg said, grabbing Kuo's hand as they began to head down the street at a brisk pace. They didn't run too much to attract attention, but they knew that time was not on their side here. They could see some of the black members hunting around, even some shouting near the Monastery. They quickened their pace a bit as they heard more of it. Eventually, they reached the edge of the city, taking one quick look back before increasing their pace, retracing their steps back to the Outrealm Gate. They ran over the nearby hill, which mostly took the city out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully they won't know we're out here.\" Greg said, catching his breath. Kuo was out of breath at this point, not used to such a quick pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....was....too....fast...\" she huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids have no endurance these days.\" Jacob smirked, getting looks from both Kuo and Greg. He sweated a little bit under their gazes. \"A-Anyway, can I ask something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go, I'd like a class change.\" said Jacob out of the blue, with Greg raising his eyebrow at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's random. Besides, we don't have any Seals.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'd like the staff to be used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so began a little argument as Kuo didn't want to use the staff for something so \"boring\" as she put it. Not to mention, Jacob apparently wanted to be a Tactician, which both of them thought was weird. Greg could never understand people who use magic anyway. Well, in the interest of just moving along, Greg just told her to do it, since they didn't want to get caught. Sighing, she went ahead and did it, requiring no effort at all. Needless to say, Greg wasn't impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do Tactician's have such odd clothing choices..\" He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, regardless, they soon reached the gate again, wasting no time in going in. Greg and Jacob were both a bit uncertain though. These gates weren't just one way. The same gate could go to many places. They mostly remained silent as they walked through, taking whatever path between dimensions that they could. Eventually, they found an exit, and it definitely didn't lead to where they were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brrrrrrr!\" shivered Jacob instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place they ended up in was a lot colder than normal, with snow highlighting the trail around them. Mountains were everywhere, and the sky was cloudy. It was probably late in the day at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....a cold region....well at least no one might look for us here.\" said Greg, since they hardly had any other options to go with. A town was just ahead of them anyway, so they made the short walk there.</span></div></div>",

But I've been worrying about something,\" he spoke up. \"What if those cultists follow us? They might get suspicious of our actions if they find us here. We should find a place to lay low.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded. \"I agree. Those cultists finding us is the last thing we need right now. Now we just need a way to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jacob and Greg turned toward Kuo, who already began to smile. \"I have an idea, but you have to let me do it alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed, he had a good prediction as to what would happen to him. But he and Greg had no other good plan. Jacob sighed. \"F-fine. Just get it over with...\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo smiled as she readied the Polymorph Staff. \"Come on, once it happens you'll enjoy it.\" She said as she casted her spell. Jacob disappeared and fell into a folded pile of clothes. The dress was made of a thicker material and colored black with a large purple ribbon on the front. Alongside the pile were elbow-length gloves and purple leggings. The inside was made with a warmer material that covered the wearer's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuo quickly went on to Greg and casted another Polymorph spell on him. Soon a girl who seemed to have a resemblance to Greg stood in female mercenary garbs. Kuo also decided to change Greg's mind. Kuo smiled and picked Jacob up, holding the clothes to Greg. \"Here you go, I got you a warm dress. So how about we visit the nearby town?\" Kuo said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled back gleefully. \"Okay!\" She soon equipped the dress as Kuo gave herself some gloves and such. The \"trio\" then set out for the town. Kuo decided the most they'd be like this is a day, just to be sure. But for now, she thinks she'll enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite the conditions, it didn't look poor at all, and was even a bit lively. Kuo was amazed actually, since where she grew up didn't get much snow. The cold was a little hard to deal with, but the snow looked fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, she giggled a bit as she walked hand-in-hand with Greg. To the average person, they might an older sister escorting her younger sister. Well, Greg obviously didn't get that conclusion. They certainly blended in well, so hopefully they wouldn't have to deal with the cultists at all. That being said, perhaps she could finally have some fun before they would have to turn in. It was hard to tell with all the clouds but it was likely late afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis!\" Kuo jumped a bit. \"I want to see that market!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, settle down. We'll go.\" Greg smiled at her. Kuo didn't get any less excited though. They walked off to the market, which was quite large. Obviously, people were making sure they had enough in case of some terrible snow storm. Actually, Kuo just hoped that no one would ask for a backstory. She didn't come up with one for them, other than Greg being her big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, they took a look around, relaxing and enjoying themselves without a care for now. Kuo actually got tangled up in some scarfs, which was quite humorous to everyone else. Greg seemed to take a little pity on her though, helping her get untangled. She even got Kuo one of the scarfs, since she didn't have one and the price was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's get some dinner.

It was a nice evening, since the place had a working fire and everything, and Kuo enjoyed the light conversation. You'd hardly think anything was going wrong with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it was time to find a place to stay and hit the hey. Greg got them a room, which worked with what coin they had.

One way or another though, they'll want the claw fragment back.\" said Greg. \"I suppose there's the idea of trying to infiltrate them, but I think that's too risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. Besides, we're not that good at acting.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what then?\" asked Kuo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could perhaps try to at least see if anyone else knows of them. Perhaps ask around here a bit?\" suggested Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fine to me.\" said Jacob. \"Hopefully they haven't already entered the realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the best of plans, but it was enough for them to at least start. They got their winter gear and left the inn together, deciding to split up as they did. Jacob decided to go on his own, while Kuo went with Greg. At that, they split up and tried asking around discreetly if anyone could tell them anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if they have even heard of such a thing out here.\" wondered Kuo, given the town's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" said Greg as he approached a passing merchant. \"Excuse me sir, have you heard of this black group running around the realms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's face scrunched up in confusion for a second, before paling slightly. \"How do you know of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's just say they weren't too happy with us.\" said Greg. \"Start talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked left and right for a second, and then motioned Greg to come closer. \"Rumor states that they are always traveling the Outrealms, seeking to revive their master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who would that be?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one knows for sure, but it's rumored to be a dark dragon of great power.\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark dragon? You mean like Medeus or Grima?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one knows for sure who it is. It could be one of them, or maybe something else. One thing's for sure: don't get in their way.\" the man said. Greg nodded his head at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you for the information.\" said Greg respectfully as he lead Kuo out. \"Well, that gave us some things to think about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg, who's Medeus and Grima?\" asked Kuo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, you haven't traveled that much before. They are both dragons of great power that sought to conquer continents. It took the Hero-King Marth to defeat Medeus, and Grima was also defeated not too long ago. Though, both dragons had quite the following. Maybe one of them is behind the cult...or perhaps it's something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds scary.\" said Kuo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does. Let's get Jacob.\" said Greg. It wasn't too long before they found Jacob, trying to get his own information out of a random woman who apparently didn't know anything and almost hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that went well.\" groaned Jacob. After smiling for a bit, Greg relayed the information to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so that's how it is. Sounds like we've got our hands full if we keep going like this.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're already involved enough.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

Jacob soon caught sight of men in black robes, obviously the cultists that were after them. Jacob pulled Kuo and Greg off to the side. \"They found us!\" Jacob spoke sternly as he kept his voice down as well. \"We need to find an Outrealm Gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the only other one is that way,\" Kuo spoke up,  pointing off toward the direction of the searching cultists. Jacob turned and looked at Greg and the two nodded in acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob had Kuo find a place to hide nearby, but told her to be ready to run. Jacob and Greg soon began to snake through the alleys, trying to get a flank on the Cultists. \"You up for battle after your recent class change?\" Greg said, readying his own arsenal. Jacob looked through his inventory to see a Silver Sword, Thoron, Levin Sword, and Bolganonne. He nodded back to Greg as they waited for the Cultists to past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they did Greg attacked the closest one with his blade, and took the man off-guard, downing him immediately. Two more turned to face him when Jacob launched a Thoron bolt into the chest of a cultist, interrupting the other's attack. He was soon attacked by Greg as Jacob fought another with his Silver Sword. After the two men fell, Jacob called to Kuo as another group of Cultists from the other end of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio soon fled the small icy town as they ran through the mountains again. Kuo seemed a bit shaken from the fight. Jacob checked over each of them to see no serious injuries. \"We need to get moving before those cultists pick up on us...Please take us to a good realm...\" Jacob hoped as the three entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of realm is it?</span></div></div>",

They began to see something materializing before them, though they couldn't see much as they approached it. Immediately, they leaped out of the gate, and into a dark area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. It's too dark to tell.\" said Greg. \"Too bad we have no torches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right at that moment, torches lit up around them. It wasn't for good reasons though. They were being held by many Cultists instead. They had stumbled right into an even worse situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good.\" Jacob said, getting his sword out with his free hand. It was going to be hard to fight while keeping Kuo safe as well. Greg readied his sword too, backing up a bit as he hoped to get them back to the gate. However, he immediately heard other members coming through the gate, boxing them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this just went from bad to worse.\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg honestly didn't know.</span></div></div>",

Everyone seemed to try and shake it away and blow it away. Everything was the same once it cleared...except for the fact that a large dragon was now in Jacob's place. It seemed that Jacob was still in control too. Jacob felt different, as if knowing how to use his new form.

He turned to see cultist mages firing Fire spells in their direction, hitting pretty much everywhere. Also, the staircase was pretty small, but that didn't seem to stop Jacob. Greg and Kuo ducked as Jacob smashed into the staircase, making their way through it and heading outside into another room. Without even stopping, Greg looked around, trying to see where they could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That way!\" Greg pointed, seeing a small light at the end of one hallway. Apparently acknowledging Greg's words, Jacob turned and ran that way, delivering another roar as he ran past a few more cultists. With one final leap, Jacob burst through the entrance, reaching apparently warm sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're out!\" Kuo cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob kept running through, until they could at least get further away from them. He ran as fast as he could, as he wasn't really big enough to fly with the weight on him. Running on what eventually looked like a beachside, Jacob slowly came to a stop. Greg looked back to make sure, and there were no cultists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, we're clear.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Kuo cried again, waving Polymorph again to change Jacob back. After the flash of light, Jacob was a bit wobbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was cool...and also totally weird.\" Jacob said as he tried to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well,\" smiled Greg. \"Now we just need to figure out what's next.

Before he finished, the two boys were enveloped in light and smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt faded and revealed two girls, one wearing a tactician robe (which now seemed more Kuo's size) and another in mercenary garbs. \"Gah!

She was off to represent Ferox and go on buisness. Xanadu reclined, her red armor and buckler always on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be a few hours more.\" The man called back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXanadu sighed audibly and began to look through her weapons and played games outside the opening in the carriage. It was going fine as they were being transported through a path in a forest near a mountainside. She was getting close to Ylisstol,  her first stop. Everything was going fine until the carriage stopped. \"Huh? Oi! Why'd you stopped the carriage?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier fell off to the side, arrows in his neck. Xanadu immediately went for a Steel Sword and Throwing Axe and waited. Out of some bushes begin the cart came men in robes. Grimleal. Xanadu lunged toward them, dispatching two quickly and getting another with her Throwing Axe. Switching to her Steel Axe, she swung but missed one of the Assassins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt two arrows make their mark on her back and a dagger stab her leg. That was nothing to her, but then the assassin vanished....she felt him grab the back of her head. She yelled as almost a searing hot pain engulfed her entire being. She was dropped to the floor like a doll. Life was drained from her eyes, yet, she lived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man ran off as Xanadu gasped and coughed, hoping to be found.</span></div></div>",

He groaned and rubbed his head. But then he noticed something. He had some bracelet on, with....something pink connected to it? He decided to look down and gasped. Jacob wasn't a 'he' at the moment. 'She' wore a pink, white and black dancer outfit. She had her Killing Edge on her hip, her hair a bit longer, going a bit down the back of her neck and curling. That wasn't her primary concern though, it was just how little the outfit covered. She instinctively tried to cover herself with her arms and crossing her legs, blushing embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jacob noticed something weirder. Looking around, it seemed the Outrealm Gate was gone. Also, the land around them....smoke filled the sky and Jacob couldn't tell if it was nighttime or if the sun was being blotted out of the sky. The land seemed barren and dead, civilization seemingly gone. The ground burned in a few locations. The place looked horrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened here? Is there a war?\" She said.

She pulled Elincia back in an attempt to pull back, but the sword-wielding mercenary was turning around and coming right at her. Before it could though, a javelin impaled him from the side, rendering him dead instantly. Claire exhaled a breath that she didn't know she had been holding. A Falcon Knight came over and retrieved the javelin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to work more on delivering a killing blow.\" said the woman. \"They won't offer you the same mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain.\" Claire nodded in understanding. She was right. She should have finished that rogue on her own. She needed to be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you understand.\" the captain said with a firm nod, surveying the battle field and then turning to the remaining soldiers. \"Good work ladies. Not a single casualty.

Work on gathering any information we might need.\" She got a nod from all the girls, though she stopped two of them. \"Claire, Natalie, I'd like you two to scout around. Make sure we're clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir!\" the girls cried, taking off in separate directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Elincia.

It was a place not many went to; some thought it to be cursed or something. Claire didn't really believe that though. She was just focused on doing her job. After some time though, she was about to turn and rendezvous back with everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's head....Hmm?

However, upon closer look, Claire seemed to see a small outline of something behind a rock. It looked....like a person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Claire cried, directing Elincia down to the ground nearby. With her lance out for protection purposes, she slowly approached the person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hello?\" she asked, gently nudging the person, who was face-up.</span></div></div>",

However, immediately when she saw him cough blood and speak one word, she gasped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" she cried as she ran over to the man, looking over the cuts he had. She couldn't tell how bad they were, but they were enough that he had lost a lot of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her pack, bringing out the one vulnerary she had left from the battle. Knowing how to use one, she patched it on some of the wounds she saw, though not nearly enough to cover them completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*whistle* Elincia!\" she called her steed over, getting it's attention as it galloped over to her position. Claire tried to pull the man up with all the strength she had. The man was of average size for his age, though Claire was a bit on the small side. Her pegasus seemed a bit nervous too. She could tell. \"I-It'll be fine, girl. Just...put up with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, with a considerable amount of effort, Claire got the man situated on to her pegasus, letting her hop on behind him to keep him steady. \"Okay, be gentle now.\" she commanded her mount, the pegasus picking its wings up and beginning to pick up speed into the air. Thankfully, this wasn't the first time Claire had to escort someone unconscious before. She made sure to keep a good pace until she reached the point where her captain was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain!\" she called out. \"I found someone! He needs help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Mina turned to see Claire's passenger, surprised to see him. \"What happened?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found him unconscious near the woods.\" Claire said. \"He doesn't seem to wearing anything customary with the rogues here. I think he might be a civilian.\" she reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina gave it a bit of thought. \"Well, we can't be absolutely certain, but we'll see when he comes to. What's his condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I patched him up with my vulnerary, but he was coughing up blood when I found him.\" Claire said, her worry increasing a bit. She didn't want to be too late for the man. Mina came up to give him a look of her own, checking his pulse as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he might be okay until we can get him to the barracks. We're not too far anyway.\" Mina said. At that time, the other scout, Natalie, was returning. \"Ah, perfect timing. Natalie, please go back to the barracks with Claire. Get this man some treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Natalie, a brown-haired young girl said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, captain.\" Claire gave a slight bow, getting herself situated as she and Natalie's mounts took to the air. They could already see their destination anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had to pick up someone on this trip.\" Natalie have a slight tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it's not like that.\" Claire said back indignantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fly back to the barracks was filled with a bit more bickering between the girls.</span></div></div>",

With that much blood loss, who knows what would have happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob seemed to understand much of that, though his head still hurt too much to fully get it. At the very least, the girl didn't seem to want to hurt him. Hell, she could have easily just left him in the clearing if she had wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what's your name?\" Jacob squeaked out. Claire gave a small teasing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's proper manners to introduce yourself first.\" she smiled before straightening herself out. \"My name is Claire. I'm a member of Squad 7 in the Pegasus Knights, under Captain Mina. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Jacob.\" Jacob said simply, his head kind of pounding as he tried to stay up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well nice to meet you.\" Claire smiled, before walking over and helping him down on the mat. \"You're still badly injured though. Don't move so much unless you want to reopen some of those wounds. I don't want Sarah to put you through another healing session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a bit at that, knowing how exasperated her friend would be if this guy had more problems. Jacob didn't seem to object too much as Claire helped him rest a bit more.</span></div></div>",

There were so many of them after all. However, he wasn't done yet. The barracks were inside the capital city, and Jacob got a birds-eye view looking down at the city from the vantage point. The barracks as well as the castle were on a hill overlooking the surrounding capital city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy....\" he sighed to himself. He would have to navigate through the city somehow, no easy task. Well, if he wanted to get out, he would have to find a way eventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Back at the barracks*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how are.....you?\" Claire had come back after about half an hour to check on their little pick-up. However, she was surprised to see an empty tent. She noticed that the gear that they had in a nearby sack was empty, leading to one conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you have GOT to be kidding!\" Claire groaned in frustration. Just her luck that that one person she was supposed to look after ditched the place after just waking up. She'd need to give Jacob a stern talking to when she found it. That is, if she found him. If he was already in the city, then it would be harder to look for him. With a sigh, she realized that she had to find him. Her superiors would kill her if they found out that an unknown man was now among the civilians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing quickly, she ran back over to where the pegasi were kept, calling for Elincia again. Patting the horse again, she made sure she was saddled on correctly before taking off. As a knight, she had permission to fly above the city if needed, and this was definitely a need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, time to find that guy!\" she said to herself, Elincia taking a leap into the air as she began to fly above the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her training, Claire was pretty good at spotting things from above, giving her a good look as she flew above the city. Of course, the place was pretty huge, so it was going to be hard. She just hoped she could find him in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after about 15-20 minutes of looking around, she finally caught a break. As she was looking over some back roads, she saw a familiar mercenary outfit. The bandages even confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hah!\" she cried to herself urging Elincia down since there was enough room to land. She dove right in at a great speed, and as she got close to the ground, she made a leap off of Elincia, pinning Jacob down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you, you little deserter!\" Claire cried out.</span></div></div>",

He groans, pain lighting up in his body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you, you little deserter!\" The rider cried out and pinned him down. \"O-ow....my...my every thing....ooowwwww.....\" he groaned.

Still, it wasn't like she wasn't stubborn either. \"Well...I can't really let you out of my sight. You are kind of responsibility now.\" Okay, this was probably the most reckless thing she was going to do. Still, there was....something about this guy. She honestly wasn't sure, but there was something genuine about him, that almost made you really sympathize with what he was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Jacob interpreted her words as meaning she was bringing him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry....but I can't go back...\" he said again, scrambling to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't take you back...\" Claire sighed. \"If you won't go back, then I guess I'll have to tag along and make sure you don't get in more trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's eyes widened in shock. \"W-What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. I'm coming with you. I'm not going to let you get yourself killed when I just went through the trouble of helping you get patched up.\" she smirked. \"No questions asked either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she called Elincia over, patting her gently. \"It'll take forever to get you through the city on foot, so we'll fly out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On her?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

Cute huh?\" Claire smiled. \"Named her myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure.\" Jacob mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to convince Jacob to come along though, even with the offer. Still, Claire eventually got him on. The weight was nothing for Elincia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one thing though....you are going to help explaining to my captain if we both end up on most wanted posters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Elincia took off from the ground, soaring above the capital city.

She's been a friend of mine since forever. She can finish patching you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Sarah raised an eyebrow at the only man in the group. \"And what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story.\" Claire sighed. And so, she began to go into detail about what happened. Sarah couldn't help but gasp at some of the things that happened, in particular that Claire decided to help while basically abandoning the knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not going to stay put. I can tell.\" she sighed. \"And since I have to look after him, I just...came to a decision.

Didn't think he'd ever understand them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Sarah welcomed them inside, going to a room so she could at least heal him properly. She noticed that many of his wounds seemed patched up already, but Claire noted that they didn't really finish with him. Nodding, Sarah brought her staff out, focusing herself to heal Jacob. The feeling Jacob had was a lot more pleasant than he normally felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....thanks.\" Jacob smiled back, getting one in return from Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still tender though, so be careful.\" she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a bunch.\" Claire thanked her. \"I don't know what we would have done without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right when they got out of the room, heading back through the main part of the chapel, there was an unexpected visitor.

The current battle on the plains of Hoshido had only just begun, but already the stench of blood was in the air. Mikasa cringed a bit at the smell. This was her first real battle, having come out of training just a while ago. She wasn't too sure what to think of it as she was marching with the troops. Yet...to be here....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is war?\" She said to herself, witnessing the fighting before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the whirling of a blade just behind her head caused her to duck down, immediately jumping back up with her katana in hand. The blade hit flesh before she could think, hearing the agony of the mercenary falling to the ground afterwards. She was honestly shocked at how fast she moved, like it was natural to react such a way. The thought of how war could bring this out was both curious and nauseating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I think I'm going to be sick.\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikasa! Keep your eyes straight!\" Her commander, Soichi, a swordmaster, brought her head out of it's thinking process. \"You'll have plenty of time to digest this battle once it's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes sir!\" She nodded, her hands gripping her katana a bit harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe charged forward, keeping close to her squad mates as they clashed fiercely with the Nohrian soldiers. Given how much of the army was cavalry, it was quite the challenge for Mikasa, dealing with the mounted riders. It only proved the point when one Nohrian cavalier got a small slash on her left from a lance strike. Dealing with the pain from it, she kept on fighting. Eventually though, she felt a rumbling beneath her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is this?!\" she cried out, seeing some energy forming around the area where she was. Her fellow soldiers seemed to be alertly getting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a Dragon's Vein!\" one cried. \"It's a Nohrian royal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon's Vein? That power of the dragons that flowed through royals? Mikasa didn't get much time to think it through though, before the burst of energy shook the ground beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHH!\" she cried as she was tossed into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea how long it was or even where she fell, only that she felt like she was tumbling down a hill, the sounds of battle seemingly getting a bit further away. But then, with a loud smack against something, her world went black.</span></div></div>",

Gaza, a berserker, was assigned to Laurence as this was his first battle. \"You must be pretty tired.\" Gaza spoke, an older man with a gruff voice and a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence sighed. \"To be honest, yeah, that one took a bit out of me. It seemed so much different when I was training, it was easier there, but here?\" He said before looking back out over the battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get it, cause you see...\" Gaza began, as he grabbed Laurence by his throat and hoisted him into the air. \"...kill or be killed is how the battlefield works!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence grasped at the man's hand. \"Agggkk!!....Ga..Gaza....What're you-\" He was cut off by a strike to the head with the blunt end of an axe and tossed out into the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you like to know? Sorry, but I have bigger plans in mind, and they don't involve you kid!\" He said as he soon gave off a similar energy. He too, it seemed could control Dragon Veins and he caused massive earthquake to shake the field once more, tossing Laurence around who blacked out sometime during it. The battle violent and brutal ended in a practical stalemate due to all the damage done to both sides...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Was....this the forest off to the side of the Hoshido Plains? It was the only thing she could think of, not that thinking was doing her any good right now. Her body was wracked with soreness and discomfort. Her left arm and head were especially hurt due to the fighting and the Dragon's Vein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never seen one used in combat before. The only time she had seen it was then the royal family used it around Shirasagi Castle Town. She had always been amazed at what that power could do to help the people. Now, seeing it in combat for the first time, it was unreal how devastating it could be. In any case though, she didn't think she had time to just lay in the dirt. She...had to get back somehow. She didn't want to worry her friends and parents back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...my head....\" She groaned as she slowly got up, leaning against a tree as she struggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little touch to her head confirmed that she had bleed a bit from her head, though thankfully not much damage total other than nauseusness. Making sure she still had her katana strapped tightly, she tried taking some steps, which again was easier said than done. The pain aside, where in the woods was she? That earthquake could have tossed her anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anyone?\" she sputtered out, her throat a bit sore too. \"C-Commander? Iayasu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to be much good. Even in the place where the plains and forest seemed to met, there was just silence, though the scent of blood was still in the air. Finding  it a bit overwhelming, she fell to her knees, using her sheathed blade to hold herself up a bit. She was really lost out here, with only a Vulnerary to patch up small wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough...after a minute, she heard some slight groaning somewhere to her left. She gripped her blade a bit, turning a bit to try and get a better look. Slowly inching closer, she turned some grass away, seeing a male body, one almost as beat up as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who....are you?\" she squeaked out to the mostly unconscious man.</span></div></div>",

It was a mystery that many people had wondered about over the years. Guess there had to be some kind of truth to the rumors if this man was the one she had heard of. If it was true though, it was kind of funny for the unknown Nohrian prince to look not much older than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened just a bit and she gripped her katana a bit harder as the gears in her head worked. One way or another, the guy was clearly Nohrian, the kind of person she had been sent out to kill on the battlefield in the first place. She had already done it a few times earlier. Why...should this be any different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If...t-that's the...case...\" She struggled to say, barely lifting her blade. \"I...should....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she saw the boy closing his eyes, as it awaiting judgment, she could barely get enough strength to lift it up, her legs buckling under her as she fell back down to the ground, leaning against a nearby rock as her breath became more labored. She had an idea what was going on. She was in no better shape than he was. They were both too bloodied and beaten to make any significant move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can't do...it...\" She said, staring at the boy as much as she could. What more was there to say? The two just laid in their spots, neither able to do much to the other. Laurence couldn't seem to believe it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...why are...you here?\" he asked her, lifting his head up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same....as you....I...suppose...\" She said softly as she leaned her head back against the rock, not in the mood to say more. She could only hope that the boy didn't get the strength to kill her...or get reinforcements. The very idea of that struck a bit of fear in her. She didn't want to die here, not in the field all alone....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIKASA!\" Her eyes snapped open at the sudden sounds, turning her head slightly. It was a brigade of Hoshidan soldiers, one of them her friend, Iayasu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....good...\" She sighed a bit before closing her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth she and the prince had just about passed out once the brigade arrived.</span></div></div>",

Sitting up, she grabbed her side, feeling a quick jolt of pain as she heard a voice. \"Don't move too much, you're still healing up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, she saw Iayasu standing at the entryway to the tent. \"Iayasu! Thank goodness...where are we?\" Mikasa asked looking up at her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This a forward camp we had set up to do some reconnaissance from. Helped us learn a bit about Nohr's movements from the last battle.\" Iayasu said. \"You're lucky we found you when we did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Mikasa remembered something. \"There was a boy there too...what happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIayasu smiled. \"Another lucky break. That was one of Nohr's hidden nobles and the one responsible for the Dragon Vein that injured you. We got him bound in a holding cell for interrogations.\" She said. \"Once you start feeling better, you can get back to your duties.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how it went for a bit, Mikasa simply wandered the camp to help with small jobs, however she noticed something. Some more foot traffic coming in and out of the prison, including some groups of soldiers. She kept inspecting and noticed some with bruised knuckles and bloody stains. She had an idea of what was happening. She assumed they were acting of their own accord and not under orders. Mikasa couldn't help but feel sorry for the boy, so she decided to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day she put together a small bag full of some food. She had no idea what Nohrians usually ate and hoped that he might enjoy some more diverse foods. She also had a small bit of bandages just in case he needed those. She waited for the guard to go on break before sneaking in. Inside, she managed to get into his cell. He legs were bound by metal cuffs and chains at the ankles. His hands were done the same, cuffed at the wrist. He had both fresh and dried blood on him, a black eye and swollen lip, and looked emaciated, food deprived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence did not react at first until she finally spoke. \"H-Hello?\" And soon he raised his head up to look at her, as they met for the second time.</span></div></div>",

Looking at him now, she had to admit that he had a striking look to him, even behind all the injuries he had. Guess this was what Nohrians looked like. This was her first real encounter with one after all. After a second though, she shook her head. There were more important things to be thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\" she said softly, trying not to stutter or anything. \"I've brought some food and bandages. I'll see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?.....\" Laurence choked out, feeling a bit hard to talk. He hadn't said much since being brought here, as evidenced by the slight voice crack that Mikasa noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk.\" she said, walking closer to him and sitting down in front of him, placing her small bag of food in the front of him while she had the bandages and other medical things. \"You can use your hands still right? There's food in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa left it at that while she began tending to his injuries. She was no medic, but patching up small things like this was something she was good with. Laurence didn't say much, probably still shocked that someone was actually tending to him in this situation, just when he thought that everyone wanted a piece of him. Well, the girl seemed to be harmless (at first glance) so he didn't protest, using his hands to reach in, grabbing one of a few rice balls inside. He had never seen such a thing before, smelling it tentatively before taking a small bite. The taste....didn't impress..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...it's plain...\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Mikasa said curtly, squeezing one of the bandages a bit tighter to make a point, getting a yelp from him. \"I don't know what Nohrians eat, but it's the best a camp like this has, so suck it up or starve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence seemed to be quiet after that, though grumbling a bit. Mikasa surprised herself at how forceful she was being with this stranger. Guess it was because he somehow gave her a vibe similar to some of her more picky friends. Well, at least it helped somewhat with the awkward vibe of the tent right now. The only noises were Laurence's small eaiting and the sound of her bandages doing their job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Mikasa said after finishing some patching on his head. \"You're Prince Laurence of Nohr I hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished what he could, Laurence looked up. \"Yes, that's right, though not many treat me that way. I've been sheltered away most of my life. I don't think my existence is even common knowledge yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded so strange to Mikasa. A prince whose existence was kept secret? Why would they do such a thing? That didn't sound like something her country would do from her knowledge. All the same though, she nodded at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she said before continuing. \"I'm Mikasa by the way. Pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually did mean that, not wanting to be disrespectful even to a prisoner. The atmosphere around them seemed to be tolerable at least, with neither finding the other unbearable to be around. However, Mikasa knew that she shouldn't stick around long, lest others get the wrong idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to say something to keep the others from harming you. There's something not right about improper treatment like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my thanks.\" Laurence gave a small smile beneath his bandages. Honestly, Mikasa couldn't help but smile back just a bit. Kind of made her wonder why he was their enemy in the first place..but she guessed it wasn't up to her to decide that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could begin to make a move out, the ground started shaking, causing her to fall to the ground again. Winds were starting to gust around, and she could hear the cries of others outside the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, another Dragon's Vein!\" Laurence cried out, trying to stand, but unable to thanks to the shackles. \"D-Damn it!\" He couldn't even use a Dragon's Vein himself with how he was chained up. Just hearing the words horrified Mikasa, given her last experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHH!\" she screamed as everything just came falling down around them in a rush of magical energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them knew it, their world had gone black around them. Though...Mikasa couldn't help but notice a tiny speck of light before her vision went out completely....</span></div></div>",

She got up to her feet, still a bit woozy from the trip, wondering if he got up. Still, she saw no one, and there was no way he could get far with his injuries. Sighing, Mikasa put her hands on her hips, wondering where he was. Suddenly though, her foot brushed against something. Looking down, she saw what looked like something a female Samurai like herself would wear, though a but more pristine. It actually had a nice darker color mixed with some white, making an interesting contrast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Keep your friend with you,\"</i> Mikasa suddenly heard a voice, earily similar to that girl from earlier. <i>\"Keep him safe until he's healed.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Mikasa cried out, ending up picking up the pristine cloth. \"You mean.....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay so....that wasn't just a dream? And whatever that girl threw at them turning Laurence into this? It was actually a bit surprising she didn't change her as well. Mikasa knew magic could be strange, but this was ridiculous. Well, in any case, she was at a crossroads of what to do. Just carry him like this? Well, actually, upon looking at herself, Mikasa could see that her standard uniform was really beat up from the Dragon Vein that hit her, all ripped up in places. No way could she present herself to her commander like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Which then gave her the thought...oh boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe I'm doing this,\" Mikasa said as she took her chest armor off, ready to swap clothes. \"He better not be conscious enough to feel me up,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding her embarrassment, she put her new Samurai top on, putting her armor back on and placing her torn-up one in her bag, which still had potions in it. She could only wonder what those were about, but that was for another time. Making sure her katana was still equipped, she observed her surroundings. She seemed to be not too far from the Plains of Hoshido where the battle was. Camp shouldn't be too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...I hope they haven't left!\" Mikasa cried out, beginning to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she knew the way back to camp, which was smaller as it seemed like the army was heading back to Hoshido's capital. Right as Mikasa approached, nearly out of breath, who but Iayasu would see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mikasa!\" she cried out, grabbing her hand. \"I'm glad to see you safe. We couldn't find you when that Dragon Vein was used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...sorry,\" Mikasa said, bowing a bit to her friend. \"I wasn't sure what happened, but I woke up near the plains just a while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that's good to hear,\" Iayasu smiled, before looking at Mikasa's garb. \"Um, where did you get that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this?\" Mikasa motioned to her top. \"Um...I was near a village and...they were thankful to be spared from the fighting...and gave me a new top for my torn-up one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa could only hope that lie would actually pass, and it seemed to work as Iayasu nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fair enough.\" she said. \"In any case, let's go. It's time to head back to the capital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Mikasa said, her mind still full of confusion as to everything that happened, especially regarding the person now hiding as her own clothes.</span></div></div>",

What's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence thought all of these things to himself as he laid in grass trying to move and stuck staring up into the sky. He felt so weird after what had just happened. He had done studies on beings like the one they just saw but meeting one was new to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid there he soon heard someone call out for him. Mikasa. He tried to reply back but no words came out. Soon he saw her and thought, 'Why does she look so big and is looking at me like that?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough he was picked up by her as she held him up and seemed to be blushing now. As Laurence went to question it, a voice interrupted him. \"You should rest you know,\" a similar voice like the one from before stated as Laurence felt odd. He felt as though he was losing himself in his new form, Mikasa's new garb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But....she can't wear me...right?\" I ask the voice as I feel my consciousness fading. \"Oh she will,\" the voice replied, \"but we can't have you feeling her up or anything, so in this case....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even finish and let Laurence fade and become the outfit in mind for now in order to rest and \"relax\", as she would call it. Mikasa soon donned him and met back up with her friend as they arrived back in Hoshido's Capitol. \"What happens now Iayasu?\" Mikasa asked as they entered the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now you need to recuperate and rest. After that it might be best to report back to your group and see what they have assigned for you.\" Iayasu replied, Mikasa not going to argue as she did feel tired. The two would soon part ways as Mikasa walked and entered her own room in a nearby barrack.</span></div></div>",

Meeting the Nohrian prince, going into some other world...still felt surreal, yet the occasional voice in her head made sure she never thought it was a dream. In any case, the army was on standby for now, with the violence having calmed down since the battle on the plains. Mikasa hadn't talked much with her friends, mostly keeping to herself over the days. Until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay...I think he's ready to come back,\"</i> Mikasa heard the girl from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Mikasa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, he's rested enough. Use the small red bottle I put in your bag. That'll change him back, though he'll look different since he'll have to blend in a bit,\"</i> she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\" Mikasa sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she laid out the robe Laurence had become. Looking into her bag, she found the little bottle the girl had been referring to. Not really sure what to expect, Mikasa poured the contents on to the robe, it immediately sizzling to life as it covered the robe in light, immediately transforming into a new and humanoid shape. However, Mikasa noticed that the forming figure looked distinctly....feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the light was fading though, Mikasa gasped. In front of her was a girl, donned in the typical red and white clothes of a Shrine Maiden. She had long black hair that had a Hoshidan flower in it, though no other noteworthy features. Mikasa could only guess this was what the girl meant when she said Laurence would look different to blend it. Right as she thought this, Laurence's eyes began to flutter open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am....I...awake..? How many....?\" She was about to ask before realizing how she looked. Right as she looked like she would scream, Mikasa clamped her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't scream. You'll just grab attention,\" Mikasa warned before putting her hand down. \"You've been out for a couple days or so. The girl told me to bring you back just now. Guess she figured...you'd blend in more like this....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....I see...\" Laurence sighed, taking in her appearance. \"I wish it wasn't....a girl though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Shrine Maiden's are pretty low-profile. It's probably the best way for you to not be suspicious.\" Mikasa said, getting to her feet while helping her up. \"Well...I can't keep you in here all the time. If this is how you're going to be while you're here, it's probably best that I show you around. The more you don't know, the more suspicious you'll be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that,\" Laurence wobbled on her feet a bit. \"But how can I do it like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax....we'll get through it... somehow...\" Mikasa sighed again. Great, now she was stuck playing babysitter. Just how she wanted to spend her day. \"Well...let's go. We both need to get out and you've got a tough lesson coming.\"</span></div></div>",

Walking around behind her they head outside as he looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buildings look odd, built out of different materials than places in Nohr, built from bricks mostly. They seemed to have some odd materials in this land to build with. As he walked he soon caught eye of a large statue in the city center made from white stone of a dragon. He tugs on Mikasa's sleeve for her attention. \"What is that?\" He asks pointing to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa turned and looked. \"That's a statue of the Dawn Dragon, that brings light to Hoshido. You better learn as much as possible on it if you wanna pass as a shrine maiden.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he followed along. Mikasa had stopped by somewhere as Laurence waited and looked around as Mikasa returned with some odd dish. \"What is this?\" He asked taking the odd vegetable dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fried daikon with rice. Don't worry, it will have more taste than the stuff I gave you last time.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remains a bit cautious and starts eating, and soon finds himself eating away at the vegetables, never having eaten a vegetable like this. \"This is r-really good...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa couldn't help but smile just a little as soon someone passed in front of them and Mikasa stood a bit straighter. \"Meiko, your majesty!\" She said bowing, as Laurence caught off guard a bit just bowed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiko wore a yellow and white archer garb, her hair a sleek black color and in a ponytail. And on her back was the Fujin Yumi. Glasses adorned her soft face as she smiled back. \"Oh, Mikasa. No need to be so cordial here. I'm glad you're alright, after what happened it's a miracle.\" She smiled and soon saw Laurence. \"Is she a friend of yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa spoke up before Laurence could say anything. \"She is. This is Lily, she's from a shrine a bit out of the way and out from the Capitol. Lily, this is Meiko, one of Hoshido's princesses.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed and bowed more. \"Ah! Y-Your Majesty!\" He spoke as Meiko just chuckled a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear. Mikasa, do you mind coming by the palace at some time? I want to talk to you about an assignment.\" She said before waving a goodbye and heading off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa and Lily continued the tour for a bit before stopping back by the barracks. \"Thanks for showing me around Mikasa.\" He smiled. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It's no problem,\" Mikasa smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was honestly surprised that she seemed to be rather casual around Lili now, despite the whole \"prince of the enemy\" thing. Then again, he seemed to be a pretty nice person as a whole, which kind of made her wonder just what was behind this war to begin with. She never asked that question to her superiors. Perhaps it was a good time to ask that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looked at Mikasa after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...that was one of Hoshido's royals?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was Meiko, Hoshido's oldest princess and 2nd oldest of the royal siblings. She's a little bit older than me, but I've actually known her since childhood,\" Mikasa smiled. \"I'm not overly acquainted with the others though. I've seen High Prince Nobunaga at times, but not often. I've barely even laid eyes on their younger siblings. Supposedly their younger brother is kind of a shut-in, and their youngest sibling is a girl trying to become a Sky Knight from what I hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....\" Lily said. \"I haven't heard much about Hoshido's royals before now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps you can return it by telling me a thing or two about Nohr's later,\" Mikasa smirked before turning to leave. \"In any case, I should not keep Meiko waiting. Feel free to explore a bit if you want, or just stay here. I don't mind either way, as long as you feel you can learn your way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she gave Lily a small good bye as she left her room. Lily wasn't too sure what to do in all honesty. He didn't really want to wait around. Mikasa's little tour had made him curious to learn more about the place. She did give him permission after all. With that said, he left the barracks room as well, though Mikasa was long out of sight. Well, he was undettered, making his way out of the barracks from there. He wasn't too sure how to act when others came by, so he just bowed a bit at times, getting some chuckles from others though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....I really need to learn how to act around people,\" he sighed. He was sheltered back home as well, so learning how to act around people was even more troubling taking into account his new gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case though, he felt like he knew where the barracks were now, and Mikasa had already told others that \"Lily\" was a guest that was allowed to her room anytime. That helped as he left, heading back into town again. Right as he did though, he immediately found himself stumbling to the ground, landing on his butt with a dull thud. Lily groaned at the discomfort, ready to say something to whoever ran into him. His frustration waned though when he saw that it was a young girl, probably no more than 13 or 14 years old at most. She wore the shrine maiden's garb as well, and had a headdress on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so sorry!\" she cried out in apology, bowing low from her seated position. \"I was in a rush and I wasn't looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's okay,\" Lily recomposed himself and smiled at the girl. \"It was just an accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you!\" the girl smiled as she looked up, showing her brown eyes. \"Hmm...I haven't seen you around before. Are you new to the shrine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....\" Oh boy, someone was probably going to say that eventually. \"I..I came from out of town. I haven't...been to a shrine here before. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl just smiled, shaking her head a bit. \"No, that's no problem at all. If you'd like, would you like to join us for a session? That's where I was going before I tripped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well.....\" It was a chance to see some more of Hoshido's culture though, and the girl seemed like she wanted to apologize for earlier. \"...Okay, I'd be happy to join you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" she cried before she got up, a bit more giddy now before she composed herself. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I never introduced myself. I'm Himi. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's....Lily,\" Lily said, having to remember that name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing it, Himi grabbed Lily's hand, beginning to pull her along a new pathway through some buildings. Guess Lily would learn more once they got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****Meanwhile*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Mikasa had arrived at Castle Shirasagi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Meiko wanted to speak with me,\" she said respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, she said as much,\" the guard nodded before letting her through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa let herself in, seeing the Castle for just the second time in her lifetime. It always felt so surreal compared to the rest of Hoshido, being in the home of the royals. Luckily, she at least knew the way to where Meiko would want her to come. As she did though, she happened to pass by an older man, probably 20 or so years old. He had somewhat messy short black hair, with some green-themed swordmaster armor. The sight of the divine Raijinto blade made it clear who it was. High Prince Nobunaga. Mikasa bowed as he passed, him nodding a bit in her direction. Nobunaga was known to be pretty kind, a starring example of a prince, though he likely had many things on his mind to talk with her. Putting that behind her, she found Meiko in her quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you came,\" Meiko smiled. \"I'm glad you came quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" Mikasa smiled. \"So, what is it you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's....a hard thing to say,\" Meiko sighed. \"There are concerns about when Nohr might try to invade again. A lot of people are scared. So, a decision has been made to send some military on a secret mission to spy for Hoshido.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why tell me though?\" Mikasa asked. \"Don't you gave plenty of Ninjas for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...but they want someone who can interact more with the residents,\" Meiko said. \"Not to mention even sending Ninjas is risky. One was nearly captured some time ago. But that's enough of that. I'll cut to the chase....They want you to be a spy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Mikasa cried out, barely caring about yelling in a royal's presence. \"Why me?! I'm just a new recruit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it either,\" Meiko sighed. \"But...I can't go against what the others have decided. If anything, they actually think highly of you with your performance in the plains a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa groaned as she thought about it.</span></div></div>",

She had no prior shrine experience like a Hoshidan. \"S-Sorry for me asking, but can you let me know how this works? Just since it could be a little different from what I had to do at my shrine.\" Lily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHimi smiled back, \"Sure, I'll let you know when we're there. We're really close!\" A few more steps and they had arrived at a large ornate shrine building, which Lily marvelled at a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered there were some other maidens about along with some diviners and a monk. \"Himi!\" A diviner spoke as she apporached. \"We were worried you were going to be late. What happened?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry! I bumped into this girl here. She has a shrine outside of the city, a small one it sounds like too. Her name's Lily. Lily, this is Rakyo.\" Himi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily bowed her head as she greeted Rakyo. \"Th-thank you for having me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRakyo smiled and bowed back, \"Of course, we welcome it. Now come along, we're about to begin.\" She said as they all entered the large room in the center of the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looked around before asking Himi how it worked here. \"We pray to the 4 beings of Hoshido. The dragon, the tortoise, the bird, and the tiger. We meditate first and open up to them and pray for good fortunes for Hoshido.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily nodded. \"Uhm...okay, I'll try.\" She copued Himi's form and movement in everyway as she knelt down and closed her eyes. She took a deep breath before calming herself and after a few moments, she felt herself open up. She was experiencing something new, the sound of water flowing, of wind blowing, of leaves rustling and grass waving. She felt an indescribable feeling wash over her as the meditation ended. She opened her eyes with a smile and turned to Himi, \"Please, can you teach me more Himi?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHimi smiled and nodded as the session would continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa sighed as she soon spoke. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiko nodded, \"Very good. The assignment can start tomorrow. Due to the mission though, we can only provide you with funds for food and taking you to Nohr. We can't risk being too involved at the moment.\" She smiled at Meiko. \"I'm sure you'll do fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa bowed. \"Thank you, I promise to try my best.\" She spoke as she soon was dismissed and left. As soon as she was out of the castle, she sighed. Great. A high-stakes mission immediately. Not what she wanted to hear. Perhaps it would be a bit easier with Laurence though since he is from Nohr. Perhaps he could be helpful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa returned to the barracks and realized Lily wasn't there. \"Lily? Where did she go?\" She sighed.</span></div></div>",

In addition to the Dawn Dragon and the 4 beats as he initially learned about, there were many other minor spirits the Hoshidans honored. It was quite enlightening with the complete contrast to Nohr. Nohr didn't have a concentrated religious effort like this. Sure, there was the Dust Dragon, but hardly a concentrated group like the shrine maidens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....neat,\" Lily smiled. \"Sorry that it seems like I'm unaware of most of this. I'm...actually relatively new to my shrine so....I'm still picking up on things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Himi smiled widely. \"I was like that when I first started, and that was only a year ago. It always feels really peaceful though, like you and nature are one and the same. It helps to clear the mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly did. Lily actually allowed himself to briefly put aside his worry over the attempts on his life from earlier. It was nice to finally clear his head and get some things in order. Though, he did feel like he was lying big time to Himi though. She was a really sweet girl...and he wasn't even supposed to be a girl right now. Basically everything he said was a lie, and that didn't make him feel good, especially with his eventual return to Nohr coming some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in any case, the ending the session did come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Himi, it's been great...but I think I need to return back to where I'm staying,\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you for the great time!\" Himi smiled widely. \"Would you come again sometime? We can be best friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, she really knew how to lay it on. What was he to say to that? Still, he tried to smile, agreeing with her that they could be friends. She cheered a bit, leaving Lily both happy and conflicted. Life kind of sucked sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lily finally made her way back to the barracks. Mikasa was still there, sitting on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello,\" Mikasa said with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you said I could look around if I wanted,\" Lily said. \"And I didn't get lost if that's what you're thinking. I actually had a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Lily described his time with the shrine maidens, intriguing Mikasa greatly. She actually smiled at him getting a friend, though she also understood the burden of the fact that Himi had no idea that he was really a guy. Boy, that felt rough. Well, after Lily shared his story, Mikasa shared her own, which immediately surprised Lily. She told him about her new job to be a spy, which saddened Lily. Mikasa apologized for having to spy on his home, but Lily shook her head. There was something going on in Nohr. Perhaps this was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I start tomorrow. I'm guessing you'll be coming along.\" Mikasa said. \"Meiko already knows you at least, so she'll probably be okay with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Lily sighed, but he understood. He did need to get back to Nohr eventually. \"Well, guess there's no point in debating further on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa nodded in agreement. All they could do now was prepare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about this?\" Meiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lily is fine with it,\" Mikasa said. \"And...I could use the support honestly. We'll both be careful. Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mikasa and Lily were in more plain clothes now, next to some horses. They had a bag with a few things, but mostly just money. They were pretty much near the border now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope so. Take care of yourself,\" Meiko said with a brief hug. \"I really don't want to send you of all people though. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, even you can't control everything,\" Mikasa smiled a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mikasa and Lily got on the horses, beginning to make their way into Nohr. This was it. Mikasa's first time in Nohr. One could only wonder what would happen now.</span></div></div>",
