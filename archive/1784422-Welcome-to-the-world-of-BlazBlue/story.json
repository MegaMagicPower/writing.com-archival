Her parents raised Eve to be gentle to mostly everyone. However, she had a very traumatic life thanks to her babysitter defiling both her body and her mind. Her dad did give her some therapy though. Growing up was hard on her. People bullied her on a daily basis. As such, she was very lonely at ages 5-11. At age 12 however, Eve made a friend by the name Milly Erson. They became close friends. She has shown but rarely an ability to copy attacks and did not use it for a long time. Eve's body in her early years was considered \"childish\" by many. At age 18 however, puberty hit her with a sledgehammer. Example: she got MANY boys asking her if she had a boyfriend. Everyone was shocked to know that was the girl they bullied in the past. Eve has been seen using her new power willingly. She is still friends<br>\r\nwith Milly to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: She wears Tomboy clothes when she is not in battle, In battle though she is  the unique thing about her though is the fact she has a tail! She just woke up one day at age 19 and found it at end of her spine. Due to this, the townspeople kicked Eve and Milly (Who was trying to protect her that fateful day) out of said city. She accepted this and they became Level A Rank criminals. She is now retired and is now trying to protect Platinum(keyword is trying).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: A mixture of Taokaka, Ragna, and Iron Tager. Due to her past, she will openly attack mostly anyone that touches her or Platinum. As such, it takes a lot of time and patience for her to accept someone as a friend. She is very protective of Milly and surprisingly, children.<br>\r\nStrengths: She's unpredictable in battle and can surprise people with her mimicry.<br>\r\nWeaknesses: If you grab her tail, she will be startled for about 15 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: The Black Beast occasionally takes over her body and it has ALL of its powers. Eve,can't (unless her life is at stake) use this<br>\r\nthough.<br>\r\nHer Mimicry allows her to copy an character and gain some of their moves. Problem is, Eve also gains their weaknesses so using this is NOT advised.<br>\r\nShe is quite literally a living weapon.(Think of Peacock from Skullgirls) She also uses said weapons(Hammers, Swords, Drills, Axes, Bats, to name a few) in some of her attacks,(See below)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial Moves: Tornado Kick: (Think of Ryu from Street Fighter).<br>\r\nWave Sword: Eve swings a sword that lets out a wave of fire that is great for anti-air and zoning. <br>\r\nBook Spin: she throws out a book that spins around in a circle that if blocked, it allows her to get out trouble if it hits. <br>\r\nEve's Coming For You!: She puts on a pair of Krueger claws and launches them a la Rocket Punch and is excellent for extending combos since it holds people for a while. <br>\r\nSpin Dash:(Sonic's Trademark move and can combo into her launcher). <br>\r\nHammer Toss: Eve tosses a hammer in a arc similar to Hammer Bro Mario from SMB3.<br>\r\nPogo Tail: Eve uses her tail to get away or closer to her opponent/can be used in the air<br>\r\nRocket Blast: Eve's arm turn into a cannon that shoots rockets and can be used on the ground or the air.<br>\r\nFlying Divider: She gains wings and rams the opponent and is her main combo extender can be used in the air only.<br>\r\nDrill Kick: Her leg turns into a drill and attacks the enemy/air only.<br>\r\nCopy Cat: Eve thinks to herself before a lightbulb appears and a picture of said character is shown. A gauge appears right above the super bar she then adds shown characters moveset and can use it at anytime/Is random with choice and costs half a bar to use<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: She cosplays as different characters in some of these moves abit rarely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistortion Drives<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrand Impact: \"Let's see how you handle this!\" Eve grabs the opponent with the Krueger claws, stabs them headbutts them, throws them to the other side of the screen, grabs the enemy AGAIN then does a backbreaker before letting them down./Command grab can be comboed into./Ground only <br>\r\nF-Rush: \"Get a load of this!\" Eve attacks the opponent with a punch before she lets her wings come out and then she rushes at the opponent before she kicks them to the air and goes through them with her wings./Air only <br>\r\nDouble Trouble A.K.A Twin Phantasms; \"Two for one\" Eve splits herself into two/Perfect for starting up combos./Ground only<br>\r\nWeapon Ballet: \"Dance to the beat!\" Eve brings out a TON of weapons and tosses them at the opponent./ton of damage unsafe if blocked./Air only<br>\r\n                                                                      <br>\r\nDrive: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstral Heat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n128 1-ups?!: \"Juice and jam time!\" Eve runs in place until she suddenly disappears and reappears spinning around the enemy. While their dizzy, she jumps on their head a la Mario until you hear a 1-up sound. The opponent then comically falls off the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you use Copy Cat successfully three times,) (powers it up any more times)<br>\r\nThe Hell You Think I Am!!!!: \"Let's see you grit those teeth!\" Eve tries to headbutt the enemy. If it connects, Eve uses all three said copied characters special moves in a combo before she throws a familiar pair of shades at the opponent. The shades force the opponent in a spread eagle(Sort of) Eve THEN turns her arm into a very, VERY big drill. Rushing at them she shouts: GIGA! DRILL! BREAKER! Eve then retracts said drill before the opponent blows up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaokaka's name for her: Demon girl(Taokaka met her when The Black Beast was in control. To say it scared her is an understatement).<br>\r\nEve's names for everyone:<br>\r\nRagna: Emo<br>\r\nRachel: Rabbit<br>\r\nHazuma: Orochi<br>\r\nNoel: Guns 'n Roses<br>\r\nBang: Large Ham<br>\r\nCarl: Kid<br>\r\nJin: Jack Frost<br>\r\nTaokaka: KITTY!<br>\r\nArakune: Squiggly<br>\r\nLitchi: Doc<br>\r\nRelius: Monster<br>\r\nKokonoe: Brainy Cat<br>\r\nNu-13: Coocoolander<br>\r\nMu-12: Noel<br>\r\nIron Tager: Gigantor or Lightan<br>\r\nValkenhayn: Old Wolf<br>\r\nTsubaki: Goody Two Shoes<br>\r\nNu-13: Fangirl<br>\r\nLambda-11: Robot Girl<br>\r\nMakoto: SQUIRREL!!<br>\r\nHakumen: Talksalot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about this?</span></div></div>",

You both head to kokonoe's lab she then hands you several tracking nodes and two radios. \"Your missions are to place these tracking nodes they will scan the area for the amount of seather used and locate him and capture him also we have gained information Ragna the blood edge is rumored to be located in the area if you intercept him catch him he has a deadly weapon that we could use.\" She then gives you a GPS device. \" since Tager has GPS installed into him you have to carry this it will give you the location of the points and when all points are placed it will then show hawkumen's location got it.\" You both salute and leave you look at the GPS. \"13th Hierarchical City of Kagutsuchi eh well Tager we'll split these up and hunt down hawkumen deal.\" He just nods and leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where does our character go first. </span></div></div>",

He has shoulder length black hair with a red and white streak in it. He has mismatched eyes, one being snow white and the other being black. He wears a sleeveless shirt that has a large collar that ends at his chin and a skintight black jacket that covers his arms so no one can see a long scar on it. He wears black and white shorts with steel toe sandals. He also wears headphones that are almost always around his neck and fingerless black gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: He can control darkness and shadows. He is able to move around quickly by walking or jumping into a shadow. He also can control sound when he puts on his headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: He is emotionless to people, but also very kind. He can also be shy around girls and very brutal to people who deserve his anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapon: When he puts his headphones on his head, he can control sound.

He is also good friends with Rachel because they both amuse each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory: When Shadow turned 6, he was abused by his mom and dad because Shadow has accidently killed one of their friends with his shadow powers. Shadow tried to fight back to protect himself, but he knew it was futile since he got his powers from his parents. After two years of this, Shadow was saved by Ragna who was passing by on one of his walks. After Shadow watched Ragna beat down, but not kill his parents, Shadow was amazed at this and begged Ragna to take him. Ragna at first refused, but Shadow kept begging until Ragna agreed. After 4 years, Shadow decided to go separate ways with Ragna, but told him that they will meet again. On his one year journey, he met many people and became a villian with a high bounty on his head because of his killing of officers who attacked him when they found out his last name was Bloodedge. When this starts, Shadow is heading off to find Ragna after hearing about the events that happened in Calamity Trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistortion attack: Shadow Destruction - He uses his shadow powers to tie up his enemy and then runs at them after taking out his katana and hits them with several blows, he then shoots out other shadows from the ground and crushes them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstral Finish: Yami's Judgement - Shadow's body glows black with energy before a pillar of darkness shoots out around him. After it goes away, a large demon looking figure appears over Shadow and stares at the enemy. If the person is horrible in its eyes, it grabs them and crushes them to death before disappearing. If they are good then it leaves. Only people who are incredibly strong can survive this attack.</span></div></div>",

clean this clinic is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\"Jake quickly looked around...seeing that everything was as clean as it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,i'll be out in a minute.\"A very feminine

them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...........\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?........\"<br>\r\n\"He.......scythe.....own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like Tao,and the other lady are talking about Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\"Jake started,as his scythe turned to him.\"What do you think,they are talking about?\"The scythe didn't respond...strike that...he COULDN'T respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,so your the guest today.\"Jake looked forward,seeing a lady...and almost having a nosebleed.Jake could see a clear view of her.This lady was very...uh...cute,it was making Jake blush...lightly of course.The scythe was twitching,like it was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Jake?\"She asked,walking up to Jake,which was making him blush even more.The scythe was twitching even more.Jake angrily grabbed his scythe and tired to hide it behind his back,which failed,since the scythe was bigger than him.Luckily,if Jake his holding his scythe,he can control it to do whatever he want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Yes...Ma'am...\"Jake shyly said,not looking into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sick?Your face is red.\"Oh man,she can see him blushing,making things more awkward for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake is just hot.It is warm outside.Tao thinks that Deathcat's burning up.\"Tao said,appearing next to the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine...it's

Litchi...Litchi Faye-ling.And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake.Nice to meet you Boo--I mean Ms.Litchi.\"Jake was so focused on her,that he dropped his scythe,which stood up straight next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"Litchi quickly noticed his scythe was standing on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your scythe has a mind of his own.Interesting...\"She said,trying to get a closer look,but the scythe made a short hop backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think the scythe likes new people.\"Jake said,grabbing his scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny...your scythe has a mind of its own...yet,when you grab it,it's like it was never alive in the first place.\"Litchi said,touching the blade part of the scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because Deathcat doesn't know how to control the scythe when he's not holding it.'Good guy' taught him to control it.\"Tao explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,I don't know how to control it,when i'm not grabbing it.\"Jake said,as he dropped his scythe,which stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you just need to control the Armagus inside of a bit better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...oh!You see this.\"Litchi pulled a pendant out of her hair,which had a Yin-Yang symbol on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this,I can control my staff with ease.\"She placed the pendant back in her hair,and she waved her hand,which a staff came hopping and stopped right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!I see.Maybe we need something for you.\"Jake said,looking towards his scythe.The scythe seemed to be shaking for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can try this Deathcat!\"Tao came running towards Jake,with a red ribbon in her hands.Litchi looked at Tao,very curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tao,where did you get that ribbon.\"Litchi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it...Meow.\"Tao said,handing me the ribbon.Litchi rolled her eyes.Maybe Tao stole the ribbon...but who cares,maybe the ribbon will help him control his scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope this works.\"Jake said,as tied the ribbon onto his scythe.He took three steps back,and laid his eyes on his scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you feel any different?\"Jake

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the 13th Hierarchical City of Kagutsuchi. This is one of many Hierarchical cities built after the Dark War in order to escape from the seithr that now covers the surface of the earth. The city is governed under the watchful eye of the Novus Orbis Librarium (NOL or Library for short). Although the NOL protects the people, the people don\u2019t like how they operate and limit access to the Ars Magus (A combination of magic and science.) however no one has been capable of facing them. But one day a single man, Ragna the Bloodedge took on the library and single handedly over though several of there HQ.  Ragna is now in Kagutsuchi were the NOL, Sector Seven, and several vigilantes are waiting to take him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a Blazblue Fan fiction. You can create your own character or make your own story using characters from the game. Also you can do a main story, or if you like a gag reel.  I will provide links for more information for any one that doesn\u2019t know about the game and characters.<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/BlazBlue_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/BlazBlue_Wiki</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules.<br>\r\nI want everyone to have fun with this but I have a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) When you make a new character, please make a small bio for them. (Also please add the characters Drive move along this section.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) When you make a character please leave the option to make a new one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) You don\u2019t have to follow the story line of the Blazblue games but do try to keep the characters in context. (I will provide links for more detailed descriptions on there bio pages) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) I know that there is swearing in the game but if it is done to the extreme I will remove the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) I know Taokaka always makes the comments about Litchi being (clears thought) \u201cGifted\u201d But if anything along these lines are over used I will remove them (I want to keep this a 13+ story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun. </td>",
