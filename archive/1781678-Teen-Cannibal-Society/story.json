Alex remembered David never like spending time outside hence the pale skin, but he did love the one time he spent the weekend and saw David coming out of the bathroom wearing only his boxers. His body was very muscular and he had big feet. <br>\r\nAlex texted David and asked him if could come over and help him with something in the basement. David texted back that he would be over as soon as he finished taking a shower. Alex thought to himself that at least David would be clean. A few moments passed and David knocked at Alex's basement door. Alex answered wearing a lab coat and slippers on his feet. He asked David to take off his shoes before entering, but David declined saying his feet were cold. Alex adjusted the thermostat and asked David to make himself comfortable. As David sat down in a recliner, Alex helped recline the chair making David's legs and feet come up. David leans back and closes his eyes. <br>\r\nSuddenly, David is immobilized, unable to move any part of his body and is unable to speak. Alex stoops down and unties David's shoes and pulls them off. David's eyes widen as he wiggles his socked covered toes hoping that Alex won't go any further.

His muscular hairless chest and well formed abs tantalize Alex as he tugs off David's socks revealing his big bare feet. Alex says seductively that those big toes of David's look good as an appetizer. David winces as Alex engulfs both of his big toes into his mouth and begins to nibble on them. David passes out from the feeling and when he recovers, his now naked body is in a large pot of hot water. Still unable to move, David spots other body parts hanging by hooks on the wall. Alex takes a large pipe to push David's head down under the water. A faint scream is heard as it is covered with a large lid and secured. <br>\r\nA while later, Alex pulls David's lifeless body from the water and begin to cut it up. David's head is cut off first then his arms and legs. Alex cuts off David's toes and shoves them into his mouth. He looks...</span></div></div>",

It was exactly 1 on the wall clock, a knock on the door surprised him from his comfy sitting position in the living room couch, \"Mom, I'm going out for a while\" Alex shouted as he ran to the front door. \"Be back for your therapy session at six\" his mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once he got out, he grabbed Eric by the wrist and dragged him back to his car, there Alex sat with an upset and hungry stomach, \"Woah, I didn't know you were THAT hungry\" Eric teased. \"Just drive already!\" Alex shouted as his stomach grumbled louder. Eric turned to Alex and asked, \"Where to?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
