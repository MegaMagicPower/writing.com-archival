            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ravenscroft Academy is located in upstate Connecticut. To the cowan, it seems like a standard boarding school, with high hedge walls and a gate with voice and vision intercoms to keep out prying eyes. In fact, everyone there, male and female, is a witch, with the adults teaching children aged 11-17 the finer points of witchcraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school proper is composed of five buildings. The central building is the school itself, with classrooms, offices, a gymnasium, and an infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlanking the school building are the residence halls. Athame Hall and Wand Hall house the boys, while Cauldron Hall and Chalice Hall house the girls. The doors and windows are magickally shielded, so that persons of the opposite sex can only enter with a special spell that only the faculty members know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the school are an unpaved courtyard (where Esbats and Sabbats are held) and an Olympic-size swimming pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the school itself, but still on the grounds, are a number of gardens (yielding plants useful for magick) and groves and orchards of nine different trees: apple, birch, fir, hawthorn, hazel, oak, rowan, vine, and willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male and female students have separate headmasters, with the titles Magistra (in charge of the girls) and Magister (in charge of the boys). Currently, Heather Gardner is magistra, while Daniel Cochrane is magister. Professor Elaine Bishop teaches the history of the Craft. Professor Isaac Burroughs teaches spells and incantations. Raymond Carrier is professor of potions and ointments, while Professor Marion Corey teaches elemental studies. Professor Janet Good teaches charms, amulets, and talismans, while Professor Gavin Hobbs is in charge of divination. Professor Selena Wilds is the flight instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are more conventional subjects, as well. Students learn mathematics from Professor Eleanor Nurse (with so many shapes to draw, geometry is crucial in magick), and Professor Dennis Osborne teaches science (concentrating on botany and geology).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome students may have a difficult time adjusting to Ravenscroft, so Vanessa Procter is employed as the school guidance counselor. Just 26 years old, Mrs. Procter brings a smiling face and a calm demeanor to help her charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school infirmary, run by Dr. Robert Willard, is practically the school's own hospital, capable of administering to anything from candle burns to broken bones caused by falling off a flying broom, as well as ailments physical and magickal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief groundskeeper's name is Wardwell. I've never heard anyone call him by any other name. He directs the tending of all the plants, and also oversees the guard dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is something of a tradition for seventh-year students to play pranks on incoming first-years. Teachers are usually willing to let these slide, as long as nobody is harmed, and the pranks do not interfere with schoolwork. The pranks usually peter off after six weeks, and have usually stopped completely by Samhain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that's enough background about the school. Now, here's my story...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Alex Weaver. My parents are pretty much the only Wiccans in my neighborhood, so I've gotten used to my friends thinking my family's a little weird. But then one day, I found out exactly how different my family is from the norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my eleventh birthday. My party had been over for about a half hour, so I was in my room, checking out one of my new books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mom came into my room, holding a dowsing rod. \"Hey, Mom,\" I said. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer. She just walked around my room with the rod. I wanted to know what she was looking for, but, since she hadn't answered my first question, I didn't think she'd respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mom came up to me, and the rod twisted in her hand to point at me. Okay, I'll admit, that really got to me, and I finally spoke again. \"What's going on? Why are you using a dowsing rod? And why's it pointing at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"I wanted to be sure,\" she said, \"before I did anything.\" Releasing the rod at one end, she held it up. \"I was dowsing for something much more significant than water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She sat down on the edge of my bed. \"I'm a witch, Alex. And so are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we're Wiccans, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't just Wicca. I'm talking about actual magick. I can do it. And it seems I've passed the talent on to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you mean you and Dad are actual witches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Alex. Your father is a cowan, not a witch. That's why I had to test with the dowsing rod. Sometimes, the talent doesn't get passed on, or it skips a generation or two. So, you and I are witches, but your dad isn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to wrap my head around this. I was a real witch? \"So... what do I do, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Mom replied, \"I'm afraid you won't be going to school with your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat scared me, even more than her saying I was a witch. \"Wh... where will I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sending you to Ravenscroft Academy. It's a boarding school for witches. I went there, when I was your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. Is it anything like Hogwarts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Your classmates and teachers will all be witches, like yourself. But it's not all like the books and movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one thing, you'll be taking a bus. No, the bus isn't magick, unless you think it's magickal for a bus to hold more people than my Prius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething else occured to me. \"Mom, if we're witches, and Dad isn't, how come he's Wiccan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years ago, some witches imparted some of our religion to select cowan. That's how they discovered Wicca. We taught it to them, because we saw the dangers of pollution, even before cowan scientists caught on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If witches saw the dangers, why didn't we do anything about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There weren't enough of us. The Burning Times... the witch-hunts... wiped out whole lineages of witches. We had no choice but to try to bring the cowan to embrace our ways. It's our hope that, if enough are touched by our wisdom, we might perhaps turn things around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"It'd be a shame, if it didn't work. The whole human race, wiped out by their own foolishness, in more ways than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom kissed me on the forehead, and stood up. \"You'll have time to get used to the idea of Ravenscroft. It doesn't start any earlier than cowan school.\" With that, she left my room.</span></div></div>",

I was brought up in an evangelical household, taught to pity those who did not follow the ways of the Good Book, and help those who did understand it better. Due to my parents' strict ways, I was a top grade A student in fifth grade. Still, my family openly disliked me going to a 'public' school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a cut above the rest, my dear Winnie.\" said Mom with a certain air of pride. \"Therefore, for your eleventh birthday, we are sending you to a boarding school where they will bring out your true potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not putting down the public school system, perish the thought.\" said Dad, smiling. \"We merely feel that you can go further with a more... time-honored school, away from the distractions of home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, they began searching for a strict private school for me to attend. They found one they believed to be the perfect place and, before I knew it, I was given an acceptance letter from Ravenscroft Academy. As Mom read the letter, however, she seemed confused. \"Could have sworn I sent her application and references to Ravenscross Academy.\" she muttered. she then smiled. \"It must be a typo on their part, I'm too careful for such elementary mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe later gave me the acceptance letter. \"The bus, taking you to your new home for a while will arrive in two weeks' time, at this precise hour.\" she said, sternly. \"I expect you to be packed and ready to leave when the bus arrives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mom.\" I said. \"I will be packed and ready to leave when the bus arrives two weeks from now, this very hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"That's my girl.\" she said, smiling. \"I will pray for you each night and call you every Saturday before lights out is announced.\" She smiled, touching my cheek. \"You are venturing out on your own, at an early age, I expect to see great things from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mom.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"It's bedtime now, get yourself tucked in, I'm turning off the lights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly crawled into bed as mom then left the room, turning off the lights. \"Good night, Winnie.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, a single tear rolled down my face as I whispered, \"Please, mom, don't throw me away.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After one of the longest nights of my life, I awoke to the sound of a conversation downstairs.  I didn't recognize the man Dad was talking to, but Mom entered my room not long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winnie, there's a man here from your new school.  Come down and speak with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mom.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got ready and went down to the front room.  The man had long-ish black hair, about to his shoulders, a kind smile and pale blue eyes.  Blue seemed to be his color, as his suit was a pale blue as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to meet you Ms. Alexander.  I'm Andre LeFevre.\" he said extending his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mr. LeFevre.\" I said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winnie, he's here from Ravenscross.\" Dad said, although I already knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ravenscross.\" Andre said.  \"An excellent school that makes good use of methods that have been around for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a twinkle in his eye, like he was making a joke only he understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. LeFevre needs to have you fill out some documents for school.\" Dad said.  \"Your mother and I feel you should go alone with him to do this, it will be good practice for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dad.\" I said, trying to hide my sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's alright with you, I'd like to get going right away.  It may take some time.\" Andre said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Best to get started early.\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quietly followed Andre to his car, and waved to my parents as we pulled out of the driveway.  I was silent in the car as well, although Andre wouldn't have that for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Winnie, how do you feel about all this?  Boarding school at Ravenscroft I mean.\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ravenscroft? Don't you mean Ravenscross?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.  That's what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a great opportunity for me to expand my academic abilities.\" I said, giving the line I'd had to rehearse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask how your parents thought about it, I asked how you felt Winnie.\" Andre said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to protest, but I realized he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I feel like I'm being thrown away.  Like my parents don't want me around anymore.\" I said, barely holding back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this where you're supposed to say that that's not it at all, that my parents love me and would never try to get rid of me?\" I asked after Andre remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winnie, I don't know what your parent's motives are.  If I were to say what you want to hear I would be lying.  And I will never lie to you Winnie, I promise that.  Do you understand?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I understand.\" I said, still not quite satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  We're here as it is.\" he said as we pulled up to a fairly average looking brick building.  He lead me through the front door and into one of the only doors visible from there.  This room had another man sitting at a desk, frowning at some papers.  He looked up when we entered, and he gave us a tired smile in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Winnie Alexander.  I'm Mr. Pentral.\" he said.  \"Please, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you work at Ravenscross too?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ravenscross?\" he said, unsure what I meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the name on the sign up form, instead of Ravenscroft.\" Andre said, taking the seat to my right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  That's a new one.\" Mr. Pental commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand, what's going on?\" I asked, really starting to get scared.  Who were these men, and what was Ravenscroft?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winnie, I need you to remain calm as I explain this, alright?\" Mr. Pentral said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  First and foremost, there is no Ravenscross.  Or if there is, it isn't around here.  The boarding school you will be attending is called Ravenscroft.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did they use a different name?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Pentral was silent for a moment, before finally answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winnie, tell me everything you know about witches and witchcraft.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a more than a little surprised by the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much, other then they worship the devil.  I've heard of some evil things they can do, but my parents never gave me details.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre leaned back in his chair, like my answer disappointed him.  Mr. Pentral looked like he was expecting it, but still didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All lies, though it's hardly your fault for believing them.  Your parents have been feeding you those falsehoods your entire life.\" Mr. Pentral said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you meant?\" I asked, getting more confused as the conversation went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me inform you of the truth, Winnie.  Witchcraft has nothing to do with the devil.  Literally nothing, they don't even believe in a devil, much less worship one.  Secondly, most of the things you hear about what witches are capable of are very untrue.  Witchcraft is a very subtle form of magic, or magick with a 'k' to use the proper term.  You'll learn more about that in the coming months.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what to say at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are- are you a witch?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not.  The most magic I do is in a D&amp;D session, though knowing your parents you likely don't know about that either, which is a true shame.  Mr. LeFevre, however, is indeed a witch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Andre in shock, and he gave his kind smile in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather out of practice I'm afraid.\" he said sadly.  \"That's part of the reason we wanted to talk to you before you left for Ravenscroft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how does Ravenscroft fit into all this?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ravenscroft is an academy for witches, but there's a problem there.\" Mr. Pentral said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's an academy for witches, why am I going there?!  Even if everything I was ever told about witchcraft is wrong, I'm still not a witch myself!  Why am I going there?\" I shouted.  I was so confused I didn't know what I was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winnie, please.\" Mr. Pentral replied.  \"I know this is overwhelming now, but things will be made clear in time.  You must remain calm, lives are on the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't respond even if I had something to say, so he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understand, Winnie, that witches have been persecuted for centuries, and they still are even today.  And sometimes persecution is fatal.  An organization, known as The Inquisitors, has been killing witches in the area, and we have reason to believe that they have infiltrated Ravenscroft.  If that is true, then everyone there is in mortal danger.  But you can help us find the moles, and stop this threat.  I know you have very mixed feelings about this, but can you really condemn innocent people to be murdered for any reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I can't.  I may not agree with everything witches believe, but I can't live with myself if I know people will have died because of me.\"  I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I knew you'd do the right thing.\" Mr. Pentral said with a smile.  \"Now, a few things for you to do.  First and foremost, your parents must not know anything about this.  They must believe that you are attending a private, fundamentalist boarding school called Ravenscross.  It shouldn't be too hard, I know you're forced to hide your true emotions around them anyway.  Secondly,  you'll need these.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into his desk and handed me a small book and something with cloth wrapping on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't open that package until you get to Ravenscroft, and you won't need the book until then either.  Keep them well hidden.\" he said.  \"Finally, when you reach Ravenscroft, find Vanessa Proctor.  She will explain everything in more detail than I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I will.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Winnie it's very brave of you to do this, helping to save the lives of people you barely know.  Andre will take you home now.  Goodbye, and good luck.\" Mr. Pentral said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely remember anything past that.  The drive back with Andre, meeting Dad at home, apparently Mom was out for a while.  She was always organizing events in town, so she would be gone for stretches of time.  I went back up to my room and collapsed onto my bed.</span></div></div>",

Once they were our of sight, I sighed. \"I can't believe they just threw me away like that.\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it so hard.\" said a girl, sitting across from me. \"Ravenscroft is not a bad school, this is my second year there and I'm having a blast, learning magick.\" she paused, extending her hand as my eyes widened. \"I'm Jenny Wilkins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry, Jenny.\" I said, stunned. \"Did... did you say Ravenscroft? Also, I thought I heard you say magick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded. \"Of course, they teach all the normal classes as well.\" she said. \"Only, I like magick the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard, realized that a mistake had been made somewhere as mom and dad had specifically told me I would be attending Ravenscross boarding school. Still, I looked at Jenny with an air of pity, as I had been raised. \"I am Winnie.\" I said quickly. \"Jenny, I don't know what you had been told but nothing good will come of using magick.\" I paused, looking about to ensure I was not embarrassing her then quietly added, \"Walk away from it now and embrace the Good Lord while you still can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny grinned. \"Ah, you come from an evangelical family.\" she said, quietly as well. \"I wonder why you are being sent to Ravenscroft.\" she shrugged. \"Well, prepare yourself, Winnie, you are in for a shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned away from Jenny, saying. \"I intend to correct that mistake the moment I arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the bus ride was uncomfortable for me as I tried to keep the Lord's Prayer running through my head for 'protection' from the approaching devil's gates. A few hours later, we arrived at an ordinary looking boarding school. As I had read in the papers mom gave me, the school proper was composed of five buildings. The central building was the school itself, with classrooms, offices, a gymnasium, and an infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlanking the school building were the residence halls. Athame Hall and Wand Hall housed the boys, while Cauldron Hall and Chalice Hall housed the girls. As the bus came to a stop and we were all ushered off, Jenny turned to me and said, \"Good luck, whatever you decide, Winnie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" I replied. \"The same to you, may God be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be.\" said Jenny before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New students, form two lines, boys and girls!\" announced a tall and powerful looking man. \"I am Wardwell, grounds keeper, I will lead you to your orientations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, err, Wardwell.\" I said, speaking up. \"I believe there has been a mistake in my transfer papers. I am supposed to attend Ravenscross boarding school, not this... establishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell looked down at me with gentle blue eyes as he pushed aside his longish brown hair. \"You will have the chance to discuss this clerical error with Heather Gardner, the Magistra.\" he said. he then turned to the group. \"If there are there no other comments, please follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group, separated by boy and girl followed Wardwell into the main building where he took them to two offices, one on each side of a wide hall. \"Girls, you will form a line to the right, the boys to the left!\" he said, clearly. \"You will each be given a brief orientation where all of your questions and concerns will be quickly but efficiently addressed by the Magistra to the girls and Magister to the boys..\" he paused, smiling at the two groups who seemed nervous. \"Relax, I don't bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked away and the two doors opened with two voices stating, \"One at a time, please enter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was the first in line, as I had an issue with being at the school and walked into a luxuriously decorated office with a crystal chandelier hanging from the center of the ceiling. It glowed beautifully as I walked under it. \"Welcome, Miss  Alexander.\" said a tall, slender woman with long black hair and deep green eyes. \"I am Heather Gardner, the Magistra, or headmistress of the girls at this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you, madam Gardner.\" I said. \"There seems to be an error here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather rose a single eyebrow. \"Oh, what is this error you speak of?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told that I would be attending Ravencross girls boarding school, not Ravenscroft.\" I said. \"I would like this mistake to be cleared up as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" said Heather, giving the chandelier a quick glance. \"I am afraid that there is no error here.\" she turned to pull a file from her drawer and placed a folder in front of you. \"Your mother was quite insistent that you attend school here, you can read it for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the file and read mom's letter to the school, my face turning more pale with each line. \"Why has mom forsaken me by sending me to a school of magick?\" I asked aloud. \"She had always told me that it was the Devil's work, and yet she sends me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt as if I was going to be sick as the depth of my situation began to sink in. I wanted to scream, to run, but I found myself unable to move and began to wonder if it was too late for me. \"God, preserve me as I walk the valley of the dead!\" I whispered, sobbing. \"Please forgive my parents for their blasphemy for they know not the horror they had committed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather sighed. \"I believe I will have you speak with Vanessa Procter, our school counselor.\" she said. \"Welcome to Ravenscroft Academy,... blessed be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could respond, I found myself in another room, sitting in another luxuriously decorated office, facing as young and attractive woman, sitting behind a small desk. \"Welcome, Miss Alexander.\" she said, kindly in a melodious tone. she looked at a file in front of her. \"I see we have much to discuss....\"<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I was supposed to be sent to Ravenscross, not Ravenscroft. Actually, I'm still getting over being sent to a boarding school, in the first place. And, once I get here, I find that you're teaching deviltry?!\" I fell down, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Mrs. Procter get up from behind her desk and come around to my side. Then, she placed a hand on my shoulder. \"All will be well, Miss Alexander,\" she said. \"I don't know about this Ravenscross business, but I can assure you, devil worship is not on the curriculum. Most of us do not even believe in your Devil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the same,\" I said, \"it's clear that I don't belong here, and I must go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that would be most irresponsible of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked my head up out of my hands. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Procter made eye contact with me. Her face was serious. \"Do you remember the chandelier in the Magistra's office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"It seemed to light up when I entered the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were no ordinary lights,\" she said. \"Those crystals are enchanted, to respond to magickal potential. The magistra writes that the crystals were quite bright when you were beneath them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means, child, that you are, indeed, a witch. One of great potential. To send you out into the world, with no idea how to control or direct your magick, would be like placing a butcher knife in a baby's crib. It's not a question of if someone would be hurt, but who, and how badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart was in my throat. \"I... I'm a witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"You are, indeed. And, as you can tell, no demons were involved in your being so.\" She looked at my file again. \"Do you prefer Winifred?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Mom and Dad always called me Winnie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winnie, I don't understand your full history. But it's clear to me that, whatever your mother's intentions, it is good that you are here. We can teach you about your abilities, help you find your potential.

Yes, I'll let you help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid. And, if you have a particularly thorny problem, or if you just need a friendly ear, my door is always open.

Let's get into our school uniforms, and then I'll give you a primer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found my uniform on the bed. \"How many do we get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six,\" Tanith replied. \"Five for school days, plus a backup. You have to wear them on school grounds, or during field trips. They'll wash them, and repair them if needed, but it's five demerits if you go beyond normal wear and tear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uniform consisted of a royal blue blazer with the Ravenscroft crest over the left breast, a dark gray skirt, a white blouse, and a red tie with black and silver stripes. It didn't take us long to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's done,\" Tanith said, pulling out a trunk, \"I'll show you my tools, so you'll know what you need.\" She unwrapped a black-handled dagger from a silk cloth, and held it up. \"This is an athame. We use it to draw magick circles, and pentagrams in the air. We also use it for cutting plants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not human sacrifices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, silly. In fact, we have to be careful handling them. If it draws even a drop of blood, it'll just be a knife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she did the same with a goblet. \"This is a chalice. When we drink during Sabbats, we'll use this. Both it and the athame are used in the Great Rite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Rite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"The chalice is filled with juice, then we stick the athame into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents are okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just symbolic, silly old bear. It's not like there's any real sex involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said, I've heard all the jokes about my name. Tanith, though, seemed to have a way of saying that without sucking all the affection out of it, and I smiled. \"All right. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's your wand, of course. I've got a 'starter wand', but they'll teach you to carve your own. They say that, that way, you impart more of yourself into it, making it that much stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have the cauldron. I've got a small one, for travel. You can brew potions in it, or light a fire in it, to burn something else safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost.\" She pulled a necklace from under her blouse. \"A pentagram. It's for protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got all the protection I need,\" I said, showing her my gold cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, like I'd gotten it from a cereal box. \"There's something important you should know, Winnie. It's kind of a tradition, here, for the sevent-year students to play pranks on the first-years. There's nothing personal, and the teachers let it go, as long as it doesn't interfere with schoolwork. But it can feel rough. Two years ago, my older sister had to spend a day weighing 200 pounds. And she didn't call attention to herself the first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced, thinking about how I'd acted once I stepped off the bus. I started giving serious thought to getting a pentagram. Maybe a little more protection wouldn't hurt.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, Tanith and I were near the front, so we got a great view of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomebody had scaled the hedge, and was now being questioned by the magistra. \"Why have you come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a reporter,\" he replied. \"I aim to find out what this school is about.

It was large, as far as most school cafeterias but this one was more like a self serve bar with a variety of different foods to choose from. \"Just grab a plate and take what you like.\" said Tanith. \"It's all paid for through your tuition and yearly education fees, which your parents pay in advance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, hoping that the money was sent here instead of Ravenscross.

I am going to be very busy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately, no one was hurt when they ran out of the cafeteria, screaming.\" said Dr. Willard. \"However, the screams were heard throughout the first floor, disrupting the teachers and students during orientation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it was Professor Burroughs I heard snapping his fingers.\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded. \"I know you are still weak but you must go through your orientation before nightfall.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are free to go, Miss Alexander.\" said Dr. Willard. \"Blessed be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked, or rather stumbled out of the infirmary, I found Tanith waiting for me in the hall. \"Easy there.\" she said, helping to hold me steady. \"Let's get your orientation done quickly so I can take you back to the dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" I said. \"Apparently, I don't know my own 'strength'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanith giggled. \"Come on, you silly old bear.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With just us girls around, some of the older students chose to walk around the Hall stark naked. I hardly knew where to look. I certainly couldn't imagine myself parading about in my birthday suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught sight of a girl, about 13 or 14, sitting by the fireplace. The odd thing was, she was trying to conceal the huge grin on her face. If it weren't for her age, I'd think she'd been on the receiving end of a hex prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't the only one to notice her. I guess some of the teachers live in the Halls as well, and one of them approached the grinning girl. \"What is your name?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stopped grinning, and was now clearly nervous. \"Umm, Penelope... Cruise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher shook her head. \"There is no such student here, at your current grade level.\" She pulled out her wand and placed it on the girl's lips. \"Who... are... you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the girl seemed to struggle to keep her mouth shut, and I knew the teacher had cast a spell. Finally, she blurted, \"Chris Ostermeyer. I'm at Wand Hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher nodded. \"I think you've seen enough, Chris. Off you go. <i>Vanarbi.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris left the Hall, I walked up to the teacher. \"Ma'am, what did you say to her... him, just before he left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Oh,... just something to show him, for the next week, what a mistake he'd made, trying to sneak in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, a fifth-year girl ran up to her room. She returned, bearing a crystal ball. \"Let's see what that sneak's comeuppance was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the students gathered around the crystal ball, as an image formed of a young boy, apparently Chris, as he began to undress. I shielded my eyes, afraid of what would happen to me if I saw a boy naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the other girls squealed, though, I opened my eyes, and saw his front was completely flat. \"He looks like a Ken doll!\" Tanith laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the image faded, one girl asked, \"What do you suppose is gonna happen to him now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Professor Wilds didn't hurt him,\" another replied. \"Though he might come in for some teasing, especially if that truth spell hasn't worn off.\"</span></div></div>",

Would you ask that all the power plants be shut down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"And magick is the same way. We cannot control how you use it beyond these walls, but we can show you how to direct it, to prevent people from being hurt unnecessarily. All we ask is your cooperation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I'll try, Mrs. Procter, if for no other reason than to keep me from using magick accidentally.\"</span></div></div>",

A respect for magick means you will use it wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then other students began to pile in, taking their seats.

Oddly, not only did she examine the labels, but she also held this little crystal near the bottles. \"What does this do?\" she asked of a particular bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you drink it,\" I replied, \"it turns your urine blue for the rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not for me. I use it on people who give me a hard time, like this one jock last year. Scared the Nyuk out of him and his family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" she said. \"And what would you do, if you didn't know who was doing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can usually pick out a decent suspect,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, if you guess wrongly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought me up short. I hadn't thought of that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight smile crossed her face. \"Perhaps you should hope that, if you challenge the wrong person at Ravenscroft, she or he will be more forgiving.\" She closed the trunk and stood. \"I see nothing intrinsically wrong with this trunk, or its contents. Although it may compete for space with other things you'll need at Ravenscroft. Good day, Nico.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left my room, I secretly followed her, to hear what she said to my parents. \"How'd it go?\" Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an ordinary chemistry set,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm worried,\" Mom said, \"about what would happen, if he started playing his pranks at Ravenscroft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be worried, too.

I mean, I wasn't the only kid waiting for the bus, and the guys were watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus pulled away, leaving Mom to wait for her return flight. Luckily, none of the others were in a talkative mood, so I grabbed the chance to take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I slept, I dreamed it was back when Mom and Dad first told me about Ravenscroft. I laughed off the notion of them being witches, and Mom responded by turning my shirt and pants into a blouse and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dream, though, Dad smiled. \"I think you're onto something, dear,\" he said. He pulled out a wand of his own and pointed it at me. It flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my vision cleared, I first thought nothing had changed. It wasn't long, however, before I caught sight of the long hair that was now growing from my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down. The front of my blouse was just barely being pushed out by my budding breasts. I lifted my skirt, and saw that the front of my panties was now perfectly flat. Dad had turned me into a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Mom said. \"What do you think, Nico?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"I love it!

The very sight of him made me shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New students, form two lines, boys and girls!\" announced the man. \"I am Wardwell, grounds keeper, I will lead you all to your orientations! Do not wander or fall behind, you will not like the results!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made my heart skip a beat, remembering what I had heard my mom and dad say to woman who had visited our home to inspect my chemistry trunk. <i>'The seventh years will eat him alive!'</i> I considered myself safe, being third in line, and followed Wardwell with an air of confidence. That confidence left me as I felt a breeze in my nether regions, followed by a number of giggles from the girls. \"Dude, look down.\" said the boy behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did so and screamed, seeing that I was now wearing the girls' school uniform, to which everyone burst into laughter, causing Wardwell to stop and turn around. Seeing me, he shook his head and pulled out a narrow wand from the folds of his robe and pointed to someone out of my line of sight. \"Tyler Cohan, you know the rules!\" he barked. \"No pranks are tolerated before orientations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My humblest apologies, sir Wardwell.\" said Tyler with a low bow. \"My wand slipped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not like what happens when I allow <i>my</i> wand to slip, young man.\" Wardwell stated, unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rose his hands, chuckling. \"The spell wears off in a day, he'll live.\" he said, smiling. \"If 'she' asks nicely, I might reverse it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell turned a slight shade of red, his patience growing thin. \"I'm warning you, Cohan.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me, sir.\" I said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell shrugged. \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped out of line, feeling the skirt rubbing against my legs and looked Tyler in the eye. \"That's not a bad trick.\" I said, pulling a small cylinder out of my now feminine blazer. \"Try this, from me, its a gas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I sprayed a thick smoke from the canister into Tyler's face, covering my mouth with my free hand and stepped back as he coughed, breathing it in. \"You little twerp!\" he raged. he screamed as his voice was considerably higher, much like that of a girl. \"What did you do to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, along with Wardwell and my fellow first year students. \"If you want the antidote for that new feminine voice of yours,\" I said, folding my arms, \"change my clothes back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down at me, anger flashing in his eyes before he...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't know it then, but the boys were thinking of how easily it could have been <i>them</i> that suffered my fate. As for the girls, they had wry smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only person that was completely passive was Wardwell. He just ignored my sudden gender switch, at least at first. \"Miss Child. Can you go to the other line, thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him in annoyance. \"Can you do something about this\" I demanded, pointing to my now feminine body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It is not wise to counter a spell used in anger or to counter it so soon. You'll be staying in the girls' dorm until Mr Cohan decides to remove his spell\" Wardwell said, to my horror. The horror spread quickly to the other first years, as they realized they'll be fair game to others soon. \"However, you get to decide what is done to Mr Cohan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it\" I said, as I noticed another seventh year student guide me to the girls' line.

I had half-convinced myself that I must have imagined Mom changing my clothes back home, but this was completely different. Somehow, in a way science could not explain, I had been turned into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door, and another girl came in.

My doctor says that I may keep developing for a few years, but I've probably maxed out at 5-foot-4.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" I wasn't sure why she spoke to me that way.

Rachel was very patient though and she walked me through the steps. It was embarrassing, having to relearn a lot of things. Getting dressed was the next challenge but, again, Rachel was a big help. She showed me, with a game of mirror, how to put on a bra and explained how and why to wear pads. After all of that, it was time to get ready, which took us twenty minutes in all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never realized girls had to go through so much in the morning.\" I breathed, walking quickly through the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled. \"This was a rush job.\" she replied. \"Just wait until we have to get ready for a night out or a dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered at the thought but placed it aside as we walked into our first class, spells and incantations. Professor Isaac Burroughs was the teacher. He was a tall, well built man in his early thirties with black hair and blue eyes. He urged the last few students to enter.

Surprisingly, I seemed to enjoy it. \"Why two coats?\" curious, I asked, seeing her applying a second layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, if you want the polish to last longer than a few days, you need three coats,\" she explained. \"If you want, I can give you a few tips on makeup.\" Smiling again, she looked at me, adding, \"There's no harm in learning, since you're stuck like this for the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that, seeing the irony of my own words being used against me. \"Alight,\" blushing slightly, I said. \"Just don't make it so I draw attention from too many boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and I both laughed before the applied the third layer of polish to my toenails. Minutes later, Rachel had me in a chair in front of a shared vanity where she pulled my hair up, away from my face before holing it there with a hair clip. \"Now, the first thing you need to know about makeup is that the idea is to look like you have none on at all.\" Going though a number of makeup products she said. \"We start with a foundation that matches your skin color, so everything is one shade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like preparing a canvas for painting,\" I guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" giggling, Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to give me a makeover, explaining what each item was and how to apply it before turning me to face the mirror. \"What do you think, Nico?\" she asked. \"Are you beautiful or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small gasp escaped my lips as I saw the beautiful girl staring back at me. \"Wow... is that me?\" blushing, I asked. \"You did a great job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled at my compliment. \"Hey, I feel like taking a walk, want to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we walking to?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two walking paths that run around the girls and boys dorm buildings respectively.\" putting her shoes on, Rachel replied. \"So long as we are back in our dorms before sundown, no one really complains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and, minutes later, we were walking along the path that circled the girls' dorms. We were chatting and giggled amongst ourselves when I let out a short scream. Someone had grabbed me from behind and placed a hand over my mouth to prevent any further screams from escaping. Rachel turned and let out a scream of her own as she saw a man in bluejeans, shirt, and jacket, holding me firm. I was terrified as I struggled to free myself from his grip. Only the man painfully turned my wrist, forcing me to fall silent. Rachel, seeing this, confronted the strange man. \"Let her go!\" angrily, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't get the wrong idea.\" quickly, the man said. \"I'm a private detective, investigating this school. I just want to ask you two a few questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are trespassing on school grounds and assaulting a student!\" almost screaming, Rachel said. \"Let my roommate go, and get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go but, sorry, she comes with me.\" pulling me along, he said. \"I'll release her once I get my answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat really made me panic, as I had no idea what this man's plans were. Then the man suddenly let out a yell of his own as someone lifted him off of me. Running back to Rachel, I turned to see the man in the grip of the towering Wardwell. The man turned pale, seeing how big the man was. He paled even more when Wardwell turned red with anger. \"Not only have you trespassed and assaulted a student, you trampled all over my prize Ghost Orchids!\" giving the man a slight shake, he thundered. \"Do you have any idea how rare those flowers are!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that guy is in big trouble.\" whispering carefully, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell then turned to us, his face softening. \"Are you two injured?\" ignoring the man for the moment, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He- He twisted my wrist.\" showing him my now bruised wrist, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell drew in an angry breath. \"Both of you report to the infirmary,\" his breath heavy, he said. \"You do not need to see what is about to come next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and I gladly walked away, not daring to look back...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I struggled, feeling the sheets of my bed becoming tangled around my limbs through my thrashing only I saw the man handcuffing me to the floor of the van by hooks used to hold shelves in place for his equipment. \"I think we'll start with an oral interview then go... deeper,\" chuckling, the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed, feeling completely helpless as the man used a knife to cut away my clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nico!\" came a feminine voice from somewhere. \"Nico, wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes opened, filled with terror, as I screamed again. I was back in my dorm room with Rachel looking over me with a concerned look on her face. \"You were having a nightmare, Nico,\" softly, she said. \"I guess that private eye who grabbed you really shook you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed an unsteady sigh of relief. \"He- He was trying to... to...\" I began to sob into my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at peace, Nico,\" sitting down next to me, Rachel said. \"It was just a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a heavy knock came to the door and two women entered with their wands drawn. \"We heard screams,\" said the first woman, concerned. \"Is all well here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nico had a nightmare about the detective who had grabbed her last night,\" quickly, Rachel explained. \"All is well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women nodded. \"We, the seventh year hall monitors, will keep our eyes out, Nico.\" calmly, said the second woman. \"Be at peace, we will issue a warning that no pranks are to be pulled on you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had left, I turned to Rachel. \"They can keep pranks from being pulled on people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pranks are allowed to help students detect magical energy quickly,\" Rachel explained. \"So long as they do not disrupt school functions, they are tolerated.\" She touched my shoulder. \"You've been through a rough experience, any prank may cause you to automatically react with hostility, injuring other students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the pranks aren't personal,\" surprised, I said. \"They have a purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything done here has a purpose, Nico,\" smiling, Rachel said. \"The pranks also help students develop a sense of humor to match their magick.\" Giggling, she added, \"Like your science based pranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am Professor Janet Good, please enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were about to walk in when Rachel suddenly stopped me. \"What?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Note the faint glow around the door,\" Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focused my eyes and suddenly saw it. A dim glow around the open door. \"Nice try, Professor Good,\" with a smile, I said. \"You almost got me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have had a rough night, Professor,\" firmly, Rachel said. \"Please cancel the spell and allow us to come in; we have a no-prank pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing around the door vanished and we cautiously entered to see Professor Good standing behind her desk with a bemused smile on her face. Professor Good was very tall and slender, with long flowing sandy blond hair, and ocean blue eyes that seemed to dance in the light. Her long dress accented her figure well, as she walked out from behind her desk and smiled at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, Miss Child; Miss Downs,\" looking at us, she said. \"The glowing door was only to see if you have learned to detect magick, no prank was intended.\" She then giggled. \"However, I do not teach spells or enchantments in this class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened as I noticed Rachel was now wearing the boys' school uniform. I turned to myself, hopeful, but sighed; I was still a girl. A scream escaped Rachel's lips as she, or rather, he discovered that his clothing was not the only thing that had changed. \"Professor Good!\" stomping one foot, he protested. \"Have you not heard of last night's events!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor sighed, then placed a light hand onto our shoulder. \"Do not fear, Master Downs,\" gently, she said. \"You will return to your proper gender and attire upon leaving this classroom.\" She then pointed to a strange object above the door that looked like the male and female signs intertwined in a Celtic cross. \"When you are able to forge a talisman that will counteract my gender swap charm, you will have passed a third of my class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A charm and an amulet are the other thirds of your class?\" guessing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. You will be affected until you learn to make each of the three objects I teach. Hands-on is the fastest way to learn this, and I find that using them against my students gives a good incentive for them to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled. \"Careful, the students are permitted to prank the teachers back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Good shook her head, and pointed to a strange object that looked like a small shield with crossed wands over her desk. \"Those who try to prank me or anyone else in this class will only have it turn back onto themselves as I keep a shield amulet over my desk.\" amused, she explained. \"Yet another incentive to learn, if they even want a chance to prank me or anyone in my class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to like this class,\" smiling, Rachel said. \"Um... where do I sit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may sit wherever you like, but I suggest you sit near the front of the class,\" pointing to two empty seats near a familiar looking girl, the professor replied. \"I have a feeling your reputation of scientific pranks and Miss Procter here being the 'daughter' of the 'queen of pranks', will deter anyone from trying any pranks during class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at Professor Good, surprised, then gave me a curious look, causing the teacher to giggle. \"You are not the only one with a reputation, Miss Procter,\" smiling, she said. \"Miss Child is known to be quite skilled in science, and 'he' went toe to toe with a seventh year student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm a girl now,\" pouting slightly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but your opponent talks like a girl,\" the professor said. \"That is why other seventh years are impressed by you, Miss Child; you show promise of becoming a great witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made me feel a little better, as I unconsciously twirled a strand of hair with my finger. I did not know why, but it seemed to make me look cute, as Rachel chuckled. Professor Good giggled, then turned as another student approached the door. The three of us shared a quick grin before she said, \"Blessed be, child. I am Professor Janet Good, please enter...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If anyone looks at the pages before, their new gender will be locked until sundown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why threaten us, professor?\" annoyed, a boy asked. \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first four pages of the book are a quick reference guide, Mister Alexander,\" simply, the professor explained. \"I was not allowed to remove them from the book, as students are permitted to purchase them after graduation.\" She then frowned. \"There will be no shortcuts in my class! They will not help you when you need to make a magickal charm, talisman, or amulet in a pinch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to page five, careful not to look at the first four pages. On page five was the following...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twelve steps to creating a talisman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Decide the purpose of the talisman.<br>\r\nWithout first assigning a purpose, your talisman will be nothing more than a fancy piece of jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Identify appropriate planetary influences to determine best time for ritual.<br>\r\nWithout this important phase, your talisman will not have enough power for the task you had selected. If this is done improperly, your talisman may not have enough power, or worse, too much. Know your planets and their influences before going any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Undertake self-purification.<br>\r\nWithout this cleansing ritual, anything you make with the use of magick will not be pure in turn, causing unpredictable results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Don ritual garments, and gather appropriate magical tools.<br>\r\nThis should be self-explanatory but always use the right garments and tools for any job. If you do not know them, do not continue until you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Create a magick circle to work within.<br>\r\nThis is a very important step as it focuses all the magick being used into one focused area, making the other steps easier to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Invoke appropriate divine, angelic, and spirit help.<br>\r\nEveryone, even the most experienced witch, needs guidance. Allow the spirits to guide your hand and your words so your talisman will reach its full potential and mistakes you may have made in the previous steps may be spotted and corrected before it is too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Inscribe a circle on a piece of metal, parchment, or paper.<br>\r\nDoing this on paper or paper and parchment would be for a specific short-term objective, so the talisman may be destroyed when the goal is achieved. Doing this on metal (depending on the metal type) is for longer purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Inscribe symbols and sigils.<br>\r\nThese symbols must be associated with the appropriate planet, as well as any sacred names, words, or charms, on one or both sides of the talisman in order to grant it the power desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Focus intent, will, and emotional energy during inscription.<br>\r\nThis locks in the purpose of the talisman so it will do the task desired once activated or triggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Purify talisman<br>\r\nThis is done by passing metal through fire (such as a candle flame) or paper through smoke of incense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Charge talisman with magical power.<br>\r\nThis must be done by consecrating it in a ritual on the appropriate day of the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. Store or wear talisman in protective covering.<br>\r\nThis is for the protection of the talisman and the protection of those the talisman is not intended for. Unless the talisman is given the purpose for a specific person or group, it will effect anyone who wears it or walks under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lesson for the first day is to study those steps,\" kindly, the professor said. \"You have already been given the talisman's purpose, to counteract the gender swap talisman I have introduced you all to.\" She then giggled. \"I will gladly lock the talisman's effects onto those who wish to earn extra credit and walk in the shoes of the opposite gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho takes the challenge?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who else would like to join them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, other students volunteered for the extra credit assignment. When the teacher had five boys and five girls, she said, \"Very good. Would our volunteers please rise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the students had stood, she pointed her wand at each of them and cast her spell. \"I'll leave the rest of our class time open, so that our extra-credit students may choose who to exchange rooms with.\" smiling, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing I was denied the opportunity for the extra credit assignment, I decided to ask why. I rose my hand and Professor Good acknowledged me. \"Professor, my sex wasn't changed when I came in. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are already under an enchantment, Miss Child,\" the professor explained. \"However, you should still work on your talisman along with your fellow students. After all, you won't be under that enchantment forever. Come up to my desk, and I will give you an alternate extra credit assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to the professor's desk and she pointed to two envelopes. \"I offer this extra credit assignment choice to those who are either not keen on changing genders but still want extra credit or who are unaffected by the talisman due to an enchantment or spell cast upon them,\" quietly, she explained. \"The first is a prank assignment with a non-retaliation pass. You will enter the boys dormitory and hand a letter to Professor Vine; he teaches magickal creatures class and he is my older brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the letter for?\" curious, I asked. \"How is it a prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is between Professor Vine and myself,\" firmly but kindly, Professor Good replied. \"All you need to concern yourself with, if you accept, is to sneak into the boys dorm and personally hand it to him in his dorm chambers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the second option?\" not keen on the first choice, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second option is to write a report on the reason pranks are permitted in school,\" smiling, Professor Good replied. \"You may ask any seventh year student you like, they will answer. However, not many know the history behind the pranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other professors might,\" after a thought, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can get them to share that knowledge,\" smiling, Professor Good replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled back but suddenly froze as I felt a twinge of pain in my neither regions. Something was not right, I felt a dampness there and looked down to see... blood. My eyes widened; I wanted to scream. Professor Good saw this and immediately grabbed her wand and waved it at me. The bleeding seemed to stop but the professor still looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class is dismissed!\" quickly, she said. \"Everyone report to your dorms immediately! I have a medical situation I need to deal with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel ran over, looking concerned. \"What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Child is experiencing her first period early, Rachel,\" quietly, Professor Good replied. \"Please come with us to the infirmary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel quickly nodded and followed the professor out, holding my other hand. \"Everything is going to be okay, Nico,\" seeing me crying, she said. \"Don't be afraid.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your cycle may interfere with that spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up. \"What are you saying, doc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"It is possible that getting your period so soon may mean that you will not turn back into a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI passed out.</span></div></div>",

I am Melissa Strange, prefect captain for the seventh year class.\" Pausing, she asked, \"Please explain what happened here, Miss Child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I had my first per-period,\" trembling, I replied. \"The doctor told me that... that I may start growing breasts soon because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low gasp escaped Melissa's lips. \"Is this starting now?\" softly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering, I slowly nodded and lifted my blouse so she could see. Melissa pushed my hands back down, giving me a sympathetic look. \"This is a part of growing up for a girl,\" gently, she explained. \"However, just because you are going through these changes early, it does not mean you are stuck this way for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What do you mean?\" shaken, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is Cohan's curse that is keeping you a girl,\" firmly but kindly, Melissa said. \"Right now, you body is reacting just like any other girl's body would. A heavy shock or trauma can cause a little girl to start having periods early, meaning developing early as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can be a boy again?\" uncertain, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed. \"Unfortunately, trauma can also lock a curse into place,\" wincing, she said. \"There is no way to know for certain until the curse has run its course.\" Seeing me cry again, she quickly added, \"By the way, nice touch with the feminine voice on Cohan. He's getting his fair share of teasing over that, believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused me to smile slightly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled, making me jump. Seeing this, she sighed. \"You two have nothing to fear from pranks tonight,\" serious, she said. \"This sleepover is a school function, to allow all the students, young and old, to get to know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Nico Child, the transformed boy who was attacked by that reporter.\" appearing behind us, Melissa Strange said. \"She has been jumpy ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave me a sympathetic look. \"I'm sorry you went through that.\" softly, she said. \"Please, try to enjoy the festivities. I am Melissa Stonehenge; welcome to the all girls sleep over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stepped aside, allowing us to walk in. I saw several girls there, all talking amongst themselves around various tables where a wide variety of snacks were being offered. I walked over to the most isolated table I could find and picked up a small plate to sample some of the snacks that were offered there as Rachel and Melissa Strange followed. \"I wonder if there is more to her being jumpy than that incident.\" quietly, Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sighed. \"Nico told me that she felt confident she could handle any situation.\" whispering, she replied. \"She felt helpless against that reporter and now she feels helpless against her own body as it is developing earlier than normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa winced. \"That's rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard their conversation, I decided it best not to respond and try my best to relax. It was hard under the circumstances. Before, I felt as if I could conquer the world and now I feel like a tiny grain of sand on a massive beach. I felt the urge to cry again but a voice snapped me out of my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see I'm not the only transformed boy to attend this sleepover.\" causally, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spun around, startled, and sighed as I found myself facing Sam Procter from Professor Good's class. \"Sorry, you startled me,\" catching my breath, I said. \"Recent events have me a bit jumpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had my share.\" smiling, Sam said. \"How are you taking to the experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a girl I can get used to,\" frowning slightly, I said. \"It's some of the things girls do, and now I'm finding myself doing, that have me stumped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" curious, Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switching from one emotion extreme to another, for one,\" sighing, I replied. \"Sometimes, I don't know what I am feeling, and it makes it harder to talk about it to anyone who has not experienced it.\" I let out a low sigh. \"I never thought it could start as early as eleven...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of a million mysteries,\" giggling, Sam said. Only she stopped giggling when another girl whispered in her ear, causing Sam to blush brightly, as she turned back to me. \"I- I'm so sorry,\" stammering, she said. \"I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big, just a period,\" sniffing, I said. \"Dr. Willard told me that the scare I had earlier could have triggered it to start early, but it also means....\" I tearfully sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your chances of changing back have diminished?\" the other girl guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held back a sob as I nodded. \"Dr. Willard explained that there is a standing rule spell here, that places a child into a magickal 'lock down' if her menstrual cycle starts early, as their emotions will run dangerously high,\" tears falling, I said. \"The spell that changed me is locked and may not be reversible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will you know for certain?\" concerned, Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the end of the year, when the curse is due to cancel itself,\" frowning, I replied. \"Ironically, I find myself uncertain if I want to change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Sam smiled. \"You have a full year to worry about this,\" taking my arm, she said. \"Come on, there will be no pranks here tonight, so let's get to know everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, Nico,\" stepping up, Tonya said. \"It'll be good for you to mingle a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, then followed Sam into the crowd, where we talked to a group of...</span></div></div>",

Apparently, I wasn't the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a reminder,\" Melissa said, \"there will be no pranks tonight. You are all safe here, as in your own beds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why are some of the pranks so cruel?\" I asked. \"My roommate was stripped naked, in front of everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pranks aren't supposed to escalate into cruelty,\" replied an upperclasswoman. \"They're supposed to get you on your toes, in case you're attacked by a witch with bad intentions. Unfortunately, there's no way to weed out the malicious ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to remember,\" said another, \"that we were all first-year students, ourselves. We were pranked, just like you. And Mrs. Procter was still in college in our first year, so we didn't have her keeping an eye out for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those of you with older siblings,\" added a third, \"know that pranks don't stop at the gate. Some of us got pranked in our own homes, by older brothers and sisters looking to get a rise out of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl pointed at Sam. \"Excuse me, but I don't think I've seen you before. How did you get in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sam Procter,\" she replied. \"I took Professor Good's extra-credit assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older girl was put at ease, and laughed in recognition. \"I hope you've got a good partner, Sam. I spent the entire semester with a <i>thing</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese stories sounded plausible. It sounded like the seventh-years were like us, just older and more experienced. Most of the pranks weren't supposed to be mean-spirited, just embarrassing. With my history of science-based pranks, I could relate to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind was pulled away from these thoughts by abdominal cramps, and I clutched my stomach reflexively. \"You okay, Nico?\" asked one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First period,\" I explained. \"I was attacked by a cowan, and they think that started me off early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be okay, Nico,\" replied the second upperclasswoman from before. \"Everybody here knows what you're going through, or knows someone who does. I'm sure even Sam, here, has heard some stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Sam replied. \"Nobody thinks to talk to boys about menstrual cycles. That may be part of what's got Nico so scared. Nothing she's been told before has prepared her for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was touched. Sam had really given thought to my circumstances. I squeezed her hand. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed back, and kissed me on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I wiped my cheek, I did something I hadn't felt like doing very often since coming to Ravenscroft: I smiled.</span></div></div>",

Also, students should refrain from using magick in town, lest we be exposed to cowan eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were done talking to the older students, it was time for bed, so we unrolled our sleeping bags. Once I was almost ready, I ran to the restroom. Part of my preparation for bed, after all, involved a fresh pad and rubbing analgesic cream on my budding breasts, and I didn't want an audience for either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was finished, I returned to my sleeping bag. Sam asked me, \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early puberty is rough,\" I replied. \"Sometimes, I'd really like to get my hands on the man who put me through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I hear, if Wardwell got his way, he would do worse than you could think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse than growing breasts and having periods?

We get to have some fun in town, remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started crawling into my sleeping bag. \"A movie would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam started crawling into hers, then gasped. \"I just remembered. My friends live in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'd get to hang out with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avoid them, is more like it.

From what I had gathered, there were a large variety of shops to be had to buy everything we may need or want, within school rules. With us was the son, or rather, daughter of the guidance counselor, Sam Procter, and her adopted sister, Anna. We also had the adopted daughter of the groundskeeper, Wardwell, Tia, and Winnie Alexander with her roommate, Tanith. We were all escorted to the awaiting buses by Mrs Procter and Professor Nurse, who insisted we call her Eleanor while in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very few cowan would believe I was a professor of our school.\" Ruefully, she said. \"Make no mistake, though, you are to listen to my instructions and obey my commands without hesitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Nurse was a very short and slender young woman with doll-like features who could have easily passed as one of the first year students, if she so wished to try. She had mid-back-length midnight hair, and curious green eyes that seemed to hypnotize anyone who stared into them for too long. She wore the standard girl's school uniform, complete with the Mary Jane shoes and blazer, only she also wore a ruby tipped pin on her blazer that shone like a beacon. I guessed it was that which marked her as a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will all have four hours to shop, eat, or catch a movie.\" Firmly but kindly, Procter said. \"Return to the bus before time runs out, no exceptions or excuses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, we were all escorted onto the bus and driven into town, where we were dropped off in the center of the shopping hub. Upon stepping off the bus, I looked about and spotted a clothing store. There, in the display window, was a mannequin wearing the very powder blue dress I saw in my dream! My jaw dropped as I was easily able to see myself wearing it to the Mabon Ball. \"It's beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, who was standing at me side, smiled. \"Are you thinking about buying it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared.\" Whispering, I replied. \"It's the same dress I saw myself wearing in a dream last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the dress make you fearful?\" Showing concern, Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"It made me feel happy but it also made me feel sad for the boy I once was.\" softly, I said. I then touched the window of the display. \"Still, the dress seems to be calling me to it... I can't explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled. \"You are slowly accepting your life as a girl, but fear what it will bring in the long run.\" Kindly, she said. \"My older brother went through it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it pass?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sighed. \"It really all depends upon whether the curse reverses itself at the end of the year.\" Serious, she said. \"Even if you change back into a boy, you will always have a connection to your feminine side, having lived the life of a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back to the display window before making my decision. \"I'm buying it.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was with a babysitter at the time. My adopted family and I lived just a few blocks away from the Ravenscroft boarding school where my friends and I loved to play in an open field on the edge of their property. Now, I had always been seen as an odd person as I had keen senses, sharp reflexes, and above average attributes but these same quirks earned me some good friends who stood by my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on my eleventh birthday when my life changed forever. I was in the field with my friends, playing baseball when John Scooter, one of my friends, hit the ball high, over the main gate of the school. \"Oh crap!\" he said, seeing where the high flying ball had landed. \"That's an out and the game. we don't have another ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it.\" I said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not seriously going to climb the fence!?\" asked Tracey Wild, another friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" I replied. \"I'm going to buzz them at the main gate. I'm sure they won't mind giving us our ball back if I'm honest and polite about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I walked over to the main gate and hit the call button. A moment later, a voice answered. \"Please state your name and your business.\" said a voice, through a speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Samuel Stone.\" I replied. \"I'm afraid that we accidentally knocked our baseball onto your property, I am terribly sorry, could you send someone to retrieve it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, the woman on the other side of the camera, a secretary named Wilma Jennings, rose a single eyebrow. \"One moment, please.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I waited,  Wilma turned to Daniel Cochrane, the magister, and showed him a six year old missing persons report with my picture on it. \"It's him.\" she said, away from the microphone. \"I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel rubbed his chin in thought. \"Let him in.\" he said. \"Have Wardwell bring him to my office, I'll notify Mrs. Procter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the gates opened with a buzz and Wilma's voice rang through. \"Please follow Wardwell to the main building.\" she said, politely. \"The magister would like to speak with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, unaware of any trouble. \"Okay.\" I said. \"I should, at least say hi, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I followed the towering man onto the school grounds, with the gates closing behind me, while John and Tracey, unknown to me, had a strange urge to return home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, please.\" said Wardwell, calmly. \"I'm surprised you are not fearful of my presence, most people are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a lot to scare me, sir.\" I replied. \"I watch horror movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell chuckled then stopped at a door. \"This is the magister's office.\" he said. \"He is waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and thanked Wardwell then walked into the office where I met a tall, well dressed man behind a desk and tall, attractively dressed woman standing in front of it. Upon seeing the woman, I gasped. \"Mom....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Mrs. Procter, teared up. \"Samuel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

When mom knelt, opening her arms to me, I became overwhelmed with emotion. Tears fell like rivers as I ran into her embrace and exploded into infantile sobbing. Mom rocked me like a small child, crying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my baby!\" she sobbed, holding me. \"I never stopped searching for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... I mean Miss Stone told me that you and dad died in a car accident.\" I said, between sobs. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked me in the eye. \"We were in a car accident, six years ago, honey.\" she said. \"Only we got out of it with only a few scratches and bruises.\" she sniffed, rubbing her tears. \"When we returned home from the hospital, you and the sitter we hired were gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She kidnapped me!?\" I asked, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded, a certain anger entering her voice. \"Yes, she did.\" she replied. \"Don't worry, though, she will <i>never</i> get her hands on you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teared up again. \"Is dad still alive?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Yes, we will talk to him over the phone together later on.\" she promised. \"Right now... I'm just happy to see you alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I shared another tearful embrace before Daniel politely cleared his throat, causing us to break the hug. \"Forgive the interruption, Mrs Procter, but I believe your son is eligible for enrollment in this school.\" he said, glancing upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed the magister's gaze and spotted a beautiful chandelier, glowing brightly above me. Mom looked at it then giggled before turning to me. \"There is something you need to know about your real family, Samuel.\" she said. \"Your father and I are witches and so are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked. confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took a pen from her pocket and held it up for me to see then let it go. I looked down to see where it fell but did not see it until I looked back at mom. A short scream escaped my lips as I saw the pen floating in mid air. \"Oh, wow.\" I said. \"That's so cool, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"You have this power too, Samuel, here we can teach you how to control it.\" she said. \"However, we must first deal with your kidnapper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned slightly pale, guessing what magick could do to her. \"Please don't hurt her.\" I begged. \"I know what she did was very wrong, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The law will handle her.\" replied mom, serious. \"If she comes here after you, however,...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 'game on'.\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will get the paperwork moving on young Samuel's transfer and notify our friends in the police department.\" said Daniel. \"Why don't you give your son a tour then call your husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded then turned to me. \"Are you  ready to see your new school?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, teary eyed again. \"Lead the way... mom.\" I said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed my hand. \"The whole thing was harder than I imagined. When I was pregnant, it seemed like the least little thing could send me either crying or yelling my head off. Once you were born, that presented a new set of challenges. I couldn't find a sitter during school hours, so I had to carry you everywhere. On top of that, for some reason, you wouldn't take a bottle, so I had to drop whatever I was doing and 'serve' you at any moment. Once you started walking, I had to watch you constantly. Fortunately, Flight class wasn't until seventh year, so you were a little more manageable once it was time for us to climb onto our first broom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to look at her. \"I used to dream about us riding a broom. I could never figure out how come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tousled my hair. \"You were remembering one of our happiest times. I think the hardest part was persuading you to let go of the broomstick, once class was over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you did that without any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is done without help, Sam. My dormmate, Skye, didn't mind helping after school. She didn't even mind changing your diapers. Perhaps she was used to it. She was a Christian witch, and her parents had a large family. I should call her sometime, see how she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, of course, there was Miles, your father. He had promised to help me in any way he could, and he kept his promise. After graduation, we invited a good number of our classmates to our handfasting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Handfasting? What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a witch version of a wedding ceremony. Magistra Gardner officiated. All were dressed in white. Instead of exchanging rings, we had our hands bound together with a silken cord, to signify that we would be together as long as our love lasted. At the end, we jumped over a broomstick, to signify our journey into a new life. I'll show you the pictures, after we call your father.\"</span></div></div>",

I used a counterspell, so you could come in as my guest. Magister Cochrane will assign you to one of the boys' dorms later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went into Mom's quarters, and a cat walked up to me. \"Maddy,\" Mom said, \"this is Samuel, my long-lost son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the cat jumped up to my chest.

As I turned to face her, she flashed her claws, and I heard a female voice in my head say, *<i>You have been warned.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom cleared her throat. \"A familiar,\" she explained, \"is a partner in magick, not just a pet. For reasons lost to history, some animals are born with magick. However, they cannot direct it as we can. So witches form partnerships with such animals.We can access their magick to make our spells stronger, and their life expectancies are extended in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you use Maddy's magick to try to find me?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she replied. \"She just said to be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>I felt you near,</i>* Maddy explained. *<i>I knew you would come to us, sooner or later.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mom picked up the phone and started dialing. \"Hello, Miles,\" she said. \"There's someone here, who wants to speak to you.\" She handed me the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man's voice said, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard. \"Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam?\" Dad sounded like I felt. \"Thank the Goddess you're safe.

You will start your classes tomorrow, we'll get all the notes from today for you later.\" He then gave me a loving smile. \"Would you like to see some of your classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and dad escorted me out of my dorm, into the hall where he pointed one way. \"Your first class is incantations and enchantments.\" he said. \"Stay close unless you want someone to prank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head and quickly followed Dad down the hall into another where I stopped at a window to see Anna, the girl who was once my kidnapper. She had stopped at a window in another building where she caught my eye. Anna threw me a dirty look, sticking her tongue out at me before a grinning woman pushed her along, out of my view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could have done worse.\" I muttered, guessing correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I felt a breeze, followed by a number of giggles and laughs. I looked down and screamed, seeing that I was now wearing the girls' school uniform. Annoyed and blushing brightly, I turned to find the boy who had cast the spell. He was skinny but fit young man, most likely in his seventh year with short red hair and green eyes. He laughed in a high girlish tone before speaking with an oddly feminine voice. \"You should see the look on your face!\" he said. \"It's priceless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not funny!\" I protested in tears. \"I'm not a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just clothes, squirt,\" giggled the boy, in a girlish voice. \"They'll change back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to shake with a certain fury before a firm hand touched my shoulder, followed by a low chuckle. \"It's just a harmless prank, son,\" said Dad, smiling. \"Try not to take it too personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to dad and sighed. \"I'll be laughed at,\" I pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was laughed at, when my clothes were turned into infant attire,\" said the boy, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was laughed at when I spent my first day in a wedding dress,\" added dad, blushing slightly. \"It was your mom who did that, trying to prank back at a seventh year student.... that was when we first met.\" he gave another low chuckle. \"It's ironic, when I look back at it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... everyone gets pranked on their first year?\" I asked, turning from the boy to Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone who doesn't go on a rampage,\" said the boy. \"I got my new squeaky voice from a guy who tried to play on my level.\" he smiled. \"She is now on the girls' side of the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do these pranks go on?\" I asked, worried. \"I just got my mom back....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy paled slightly. \"You're Procter's kid!?\" he asked, alarm in his voice. \"S-Sorry, man.\" he waved his hand, returning my clothes to normal. \"No harm, no foul, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he hurried along, leaving me a little confused. \"What was that all about?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Let's just say your mom is well known in this school,\" he said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I wouldn't try, if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that as we stopped at a closed door and dad knocked. \"Enter, if you dare where screams are heard in the dark corners of our lair.\" said a booming voice on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"Drink from the cauldron and rest ye well.\" he recited. \"Soon to join the others, trapped within our spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short rhyme left you shivering but dad merely chuckled as the door opened. \"It was a poetic warning, once used to scare away the curious when the first magick academy was founded in Europe.\" he explained. \"Come on in, Professor Isaac Burroughs will not bite you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked in cautiously to see a number of students looking at me with an air of curiosity as dad walked in behind me.

We teachers are wise to you, and we have several mirrors ready at a moment's notice, to deflect or reflect any spells cast at us.

He returned with a bowl of saltwater, a small branch, a burner, and some incense.

Now, using the branch, sprinkle the wand with saltwater and say, 'I charge thee with water and earth.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I did that, he said, \"Now, hold it in the smoke from the incense, and say, 'I charge thee with fire and air.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I had done that with all my tools, I asked, \"How often should I do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three months is standard,\" he replied. \"You'll need to clean the chalice after every use, but the other tools won't need cleaning. Just wrap them in silk, and place them in your chest, on top of your Book of Shadows. The pentagram can go around your neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door, and Mom stepped in. \"How are you doing, Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Mom.

Those who have detected the spell will arrive shortly with late passes as they would have to visit the nurse to have the spell removed.\" Seeing my confusion, he added, \"It's a sick day spell, causing them to believe they are too ill to attend classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that disrupt their other school activities?\" accusingly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you paid attention to the prank rules.\" smiling, Isaac said. \"I designed the spell to cancel itself out long before they need to move on to their second class.\" He then pointed to the number of tardy slips on the desks. \"Those who do not detect it will arrive halfway through class and receive a warning to always be aware of magick use around them before they are sent to the nurse's office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will we be doing in the meantime?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I will be covering the class you missed yesterday.\" simply, Isaac replied. \"Please take out your wand, I wish to show you how to properly hold, maintain, and harness its power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter carefully taking my wand out of its case, Isaac instructed me to give it a wave, which I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I turned to Isaac, confused. \"Am I doing something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" the professor replied, with a smile. \"I had you wave your wand to demonstrate that the wand is not the source of a witch's power, as many cowans believe. The wand merely helps a witch focus that power, especially when using complex or powerful spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if a cowan were to take my wand, it would do him little good,\" I mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except to make the witch he stole the wand from annoyed,\" he replied. \"Now, to properly use a wand you must first cast the spell in your mind then, just before reciting the last word, point the wand at your target. However, with more complex spells, you should point the wand first to keep that magick focused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand,\" taking some notes, I said. \"Simple spells only require the wand so to point out a specific target, say in a crowd of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, master Procter,\" retrieving a wand of his own, he said. \"The wand is also a tool for defense against unwanted attacks from other witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the prank spells?\" hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" chuckling, Isaac replied. \"Prank spells are relatively harmless, and can be countered or reversed if the target student is alert and unafraid to ask for assistance.\" He sighed. \"Most first years are too embarrassed or frightened to ask a teacher for help when they are pranked but we <i>will</i> help, if only asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A student used a wand against me to change my clothing to the female uniform.\" blushing I said. \"Was that to point me out in a crowd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wands are used in pranks as a required warning,\" winking at me, Isaac said. \"We normally do not tell the first years this as such pranks make them more alert to magick so they can learn dodge or deflect spells faster.\" Returning to his desk, he added, \"Yes, some of the pranks are cruel. You will hear horror stories about that, I'm sure. However, there are limits to the pranks that can be pulled, and there are punishments to those who cross the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said the wand can be used to combat magickal attacks. Are you referring to a duel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good guess.\" smiling, Isaac said. \"Although not necessary, wands are often used in magick duels but they can also be useful in combating curses, identifying potions, and so forth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a group of annoyed looking students entered the room, carrying hall passes from the nurses office. \"Nice prank, professor,\" sarcastically, one student said. \"Turnabout is fair game, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, but this was not a prank.\" smiling, Isaac replied. \"This was a lesson, you need to learn to detect magick before you can properly combat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... how do you detect magick?\" raising my hand, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very good question, master Procter,\" turning to me, Isaac said. \"It is a pity your fellow classmates did not think to ask that in yesterday's class.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It gives John good or bad karma to prevent him from falling into greater harm or risk.\" Pausing, she added, \"I'm guessing he twisted his ankle gaining entry, and was caught before he could learn anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled with Skye. \"I'm glad. Sam was worried for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John is in no danger, so long as he can keep his curiosity under control,\" amused, Skye said. \"It was nice to hear from you again,  Vanessa.

However, Professor Eleanor Nurse informed me that, with so many shapes to draw, geometry was crucial to magick use. \"Also, you will find that potions and elixirs require <i>exact</i> amounts of the needed ingredients for them to work,\" facing her class, she said. \"Mathematics will hep you all become powerful witches, so do pay attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor was a very short and slender young woman with doll-like features who could have easily passed as one of the first year students, if she so wished to try. She had mid-back-length midnight hair, and curious green eyes that seemed to hypnotize anyone who stared into them for too long. She wore the standard girl's school uniform, complete with the Mary Jane shoes and blazer, only she also wore a ruby tipped pin on her blazer that shone like a beacon. I guessed it was that which marked her as a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense you have a question, Master Procter,\" looking at me Eleanor said. \"What do you wish to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just curious as to why you wear the school uniform,\" sounding small, I said. \"I mean no offense, but teachers are allowed to dress causally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor smiled. \"I wear the school uniform so to connect better with the students,\" simply, she replied. \"You may be surprised to know that I look this way due to a prank that I had thought had ruined my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" concerned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hit with a 'youth visit' spell,\" sighing, Eleanor replied. \"Normally, the spell only makes the target five years younger for twenty four hours, leaving him or her feeling vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only something went wrong,\" a girl student guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor nodded. \"The prankster botched the spell and cast a 'youth lock' spell, making me physically eleven years old for eleven years. The eleven years expired a few days ago, so I am now aging normally, and will be 'twelve' in a few months' time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What happened to the prankster?\" showing some anger, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fear, Master Procter,\" smiling, Eleanor said. \"The boy who cast the spell was given the same treatment. He, too, started aging normally from sixteen a few days ago. I hear he is doing well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there no way to counter the spell?\" asked another student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spell locks require first making a key spell to open them,\" with a hint of regret, Eleanor replied. \"The boy forgot to do so. That was why he was given the same treatment.\" She then smiled. \"Now then, who can tell me the basic structure of a parallelogram...?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You will be affected until you learn to make each of the three objects I teach.

They will not help you when you need to make a magickal charm, talisman or amulet in a pinch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to page five, careful not to look at the first four pages. On page five was the following...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twelve steps to creating a talisman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1. Decide the purpose of the talisman.</b><br>\r\nWithout first assigning a purpose, your talisman will be nothing more than a fancy piece of jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2. Identify appropriate planetary influences to determine best time for ritual.</b><br>\r\nWithout this important phase, your talisman will not have enough power for the task you had selected. If this is done improperly, your talisman may not have enough power, or worse, too much. <b>Know your planets and their influences before going any further.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3. Undertake self-purification.</b><br>\r\nWithout this cleansing ritual, anything you make with the use of magick will not be pure in turn, causing unpredictable results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>4. Don ritual garments, and gather appropriate magical tools.</b><br>\r\nThis should be self-explanatory but always use the right garments and tools for any job. If you do not know them, do not continue until you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5. Create a magick circle to work within.</b><br>\r\nThis is a very important step as it focuses all the magick being used into one focused area, making the other steps easier to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6. Invoke appropriate divine, angelic, and spirit help.</b><br>\r\nEveryone, even the most experienced witch, needs guidance. Allow the spirits to guide your hand and your words so your talisman will reach its full potential and mistakes you may have made in the previous steps may be spotted and corrected before it is too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>7. Inscribe a circle on a piece of metal, parchment, or paper.</b><br>\r\nDoing this on paper or paper and parchment would be for a specific short-term objective, so the talisman may be destroyed when the goal is achieved. Doing this on metal (depending on the metal type) is for longer purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>8. Inscribe symbols and sigils.</b><br>\r\nThese symbols must be associated with the appropriate planet, as well as any sacred names, words, or charms, on one or both sides of the talisman in order to grant it the power desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>9. Focus intent, will, and emotional energy during inscription.</i><br>\r\nThis locks in the purpose of the talisman so it will do the task desired once activated or triggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>10. Purify talisman </b><br>\r\nThis is done by passing metal through fire (such as a candle flame) or paper through smoke of incense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>11. Charge talisman with magical power.</b><br>\r\nThis must be done by consecrating it in a ritual on the appropriate day of the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>12. Store or wear talisman in protective covering.</b><br>\r\nThis is for the protection of the talisman and the protection of those the talisman is not intended for. Unless the talisman is given the purpose for a specific person or group, it will effect anyone who wears it or walks under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lesson for the first day is to study those steps,\" kindly, the professor said. \"You have already been given the talisman's purpose, to counteract the gender swap talisman I have introduced you all to.\" She then giggled. \"I will gladly lock the talisman's effects onto those who wish to earn extra credit and walk in the shoes of the opposite gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho takes the challenge?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How do you like being a girl so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too bad,\" shrugging, I replied. \"I can't get over the fact that I walk into the girls' bathroom without thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is part of the extra credit spell,\" kindly, Mom explained. \"Professor Good is trying to give her students a new experience, not torment them by turning their world upside down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's definitely a new experience,\" to Mom's giggles, I said. \"At least I can borrow Anna's clothes for a while instead of buying my own until I made the talisman that will break this spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more complicated than that, I'm afraid,\" smiling, Mom said. \"You see, Professor Good paired the boys and girls who accepted the extra credit into teams of two, each to switch dorms for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with making the talisman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grinned. \"I went through this too, with Professor Switch; she retired a few years ago.\" She paused. \"You will not be able to break the spell keeping you a girl, until your partner, Andy, makes his talisman as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced. \"So, until both talismans are made,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you are stuck as the wrong gender. I will explain this to Andy soon.\" She paused, seeing tears forming in my eyes. \"Oh, now don't fret,... Samantha. You will be changed back at the end of the semester if you finish your talisman, even if Andy does not finish his by then. But he will lose his extra credit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there is a time limit to this extra credit assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had studied Professor Good's class rules, you would have already known this,\" smiling, mom said. \"Each teacher has a set of rules for their classrooms, I'd take the time to study them so you do not get yourself roped into 'volunteering' for a demonstration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, unaware how cute it made me look. \"I'll make a note of that.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My roommate, Tabitha Wilkins, was a great help in my adapting to the life of a girl. She was about my height, with long black hair and gentle green eyes. Thankfully, Ms. Good's spell made being a girl a little easier than I had first feared. However, she did not make everything easy, as it was meant to be a new experience. I had to get used to wearing the girls' school uniform and girls' clothing. Although the spell kept me from blushing ten shades of red, it all still felt alien to me. Still, Tabitha helped me through the transition, and I was now putting on some makeup, to get ready for my first sleepover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are adjusting far better than I had originally hoped, Samantha,\" smiling, Tabitha said. \"When you first came here, under the extra credit challenge, you didn't know a thing about being a girl.\" She giggled. \"Now look at you, acting as if you'd been a girl all your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, not realizing how cute it made me look. \"You've been a great help, Tabitha,\" I said, smiling. \"Without you, I'd probably still be making a mess of my face with this makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha laughed. \"I remember the first time you tried to put it on yourself. You looked like a science experiment gone wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed with her, remembering. It was three days ago, I wanted to really learn the full experience, so I borrowed some of Tabitha's makeup and tried my best to put it on myself. As I had no idea what to use first, or what colors worked best for my face, I just randomly put the stuff on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, looking into the mirror, I saw a beautiful girl staring back at me and sighed. \"Mom and Dad met each other this way. I wonder where my experience will take me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out, girl,\" grabbing my arm, Tabitha said. \"Let's get to that sleepover, so you can make some new friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that, and followed Tabitha out of our dorm room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled, making us both wince. Seeing this, she sighed. \"You two have nothing to fear from pranks tonight,\" serious, she said. \"This sleepover is a <i>school function,</i> to allow all the students, young and old, to get to know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that caused Tabitha and me to relax a little. \"Some of those pranks the seventh years pull on the first years are borderline cruelty,\" tearing up, I said. \"I saw one girl get turned into a doll by one of them. She told me that she got carried around from class to class, being treated like a piece of property, missing a full day of her own classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded. \"The girl responsible was punished for that, I assure you,\" serious, she said. \"Ravenscroft Academy does not tolerate such cruel mischief.\" she frowned. \"She spent a day in the trophy case, as a mannequin, to teach her what it is like to be treated like property.\" She then smiled. \"Enough business. I am Melissa Stonehenge; welcome to the all-girls sleepover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" smiling back, I said. \"This is my first sleepover, so I'm kind of curious to see what is done at one.\" Melissa gave me a curious look, but giggled when I added, \"Professor Good's extra credit challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like womanhood so far?\" smiling, Melissa asked. \"Most boys who get their gender switched avoid this function, fearing they would get to like being girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its strange, and does take some getting used to,\" blushing a little, I said. \"All in all, though, it's not so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nodded, then stepped aside, allowing us to enter the common room ceremony hall, where dozens of other girls were talking amongst themselves. I recognized one as Nico Child, from Professor Good's class, and walked over to her. \"I'm glad to see I'm not the only transformed boy to attend this sleepover.\" startling her, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico sighed. \"Sorry, you startled me,\" catching her breath, she said. \"Recent events have me a bit jumpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had my share,\" thinking of John sneaking onto campus, I replied. \"How are you taking to the experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a girl I can get used to,\" frowning slightly, Nico said. \"It's some of the things girls do, and now I'm finding myself doing, that have me stumped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switching from one emotion extreme to another, for one,\" sighing, Nico replied. \"Sometimes, I don't know what I am feeling, and it makes it harder to talk about it to anyone who has not experienced it.\" She sighed. \"I never thought it could start as early as eleven...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of a million mysteries,\" giggling, I said. Only I stopped giggling when Tabitha whispered in my ear, and I blushed brightly, as I turned back to Nico. \"I- I'm so sorry,\"  I stammered. \"I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big, just a period,\" sniffing, Nico said. \"Dr. Willard told me that the scare I had earlier could have triggered it to start early, but it also means....\" she tearfully sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your chances of changing back have diminished?\" Tabitha guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico held back a sob as she nodded. \"Dr. Willard explained that there is a standing rule spell here, that places a child into a magickal 'lock down' if her menstrual cycle starts early, as their emotions will run dangerously high,\" tears falling, she said. \"The spell that changed me is locked and may not be reversible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will you know for certain?\" concerned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the end of the year, when the curse is due to cancel itself,\" frowning, Nico replied. \"Ironically, I find myself uncertain if I want to change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I smiled. \"You have a full year to worry about this,\" taking her arm, I said. \"Come on, there will be no pranks here tonight, so let's get to know everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, Nico,\" stepping up, Tonya said. \"It'll be good for you to mingle a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico sighed, then followed me into the crowd, where we talked to a group of...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And Mrs. Procter was still in college in our first year, so we didn't have her keeping an eye out for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those of you with older siblings,\" added another, \"know that pranks don't stop at the gate. Some of us got pranked in our own homes, by older brothers and sisters looking to get a rise out of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" the first girl said, \"but I don't think I've seen you before.\" She pointed to me. \"How did you get in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sam Procter,\" I replied. \"I took Professor Good's extra-credit assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed, and laughed in recognition. \"I hope you've got a good partner, Sam. I spent the entire semester with a <i>thing</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing all these stories, I began to relax. The seventh-years weren't that different from us, just older and more experienced. Most of their pranks weren't supposed to be mean-spirited, just a little embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Nico?\" asked one girl, seeing her clutch her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First period,\" she replied. \"I was attacked by a cowan, and they think that started me off early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be okay, Nico,\" said the second upperclasswoman. \"Everybody here knows what you're going through, or knows someone who does. I'm sure even Sam, here, has heard some stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" I replied. \"Nobody thinks to talk to boys about menstrual cycles. That may be part of what's got Nico so scared. Nothing she's been told before has prepared her for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico squeezed my hand. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squeezed back, and thought of how, if I were still a boy, I would have thought about kissing her. I gave her a peck on the cheek, anyway. She wiped at her cheek and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts from earlier returned to me.

It was a school based in the UK, much different than Ravenscroft. The girls were trained as witches and the boys as the witch hunters, and people born in the UK had a sort of immunity to TG and shrinking. Starmage also had boys and girls share the same dorm rooms, to allow equality in all aspects. Ryan was once a normal teen. That all changed, however, when he discovered his Mother's magick. Shortly after that, Ryan had to battle a rogue witch, and won out of sheer luck. Then, his destiny set, he traveled to Asia to learn martial arts. He also made a pact with a mystical katana that belonged to a warrior called Asura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man was Chon Kay, an 18-year-old from China. He had had a dark past: his older brother had been slain by witches when Chon was a young lad. Seeing his brother murdered made him tear his own eyes out in sheer horror. Since that day, Chon trained in martial arts and the use of chi energy to see, while donning a blindfold to cover his loss of eyes. All so he could wreak his revenge against those witches. He may not be from the UK, but he carries the same immunity to magick as Ryan does, due to his intense hatred of magick. In fact, using magick on him often just makes him angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was named Jenny Forth, a 16-year-old witch. Her magic was done differently from most witches, she required a book which belonged to her Grandmother. The reason for this was known to only Ryan's group: she was half cat, which was shown when her cat ears were out. She used magic to cover that feature up. She and Ryan had met before Starmage, and they dated at Ryan's old school for awhile. Then, one day, she left, leaving Ryan a hoodie that belonged to her. Then, when they met at Starmage, the two rekindled the flame. She was Ryan's chain and morality pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was a young man called Alexander, a 14-year-old who was an old friend of Ryan's. They knew each other ever since Ryan helped out in a fight when Alexander was younger. Alexander's fighting style was a mixture of fighting with a rapier and summoning a large robot to aid him in his fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the four had finished saving the world as only they could, they stepped into the magic portal to return to their school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they did, they realized that they were flying. That was normal, as they were flung around the world by use of this portal. But it was taking much longer than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?!\" Ryan yelled out, as they kept falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a problem with the spell! It must be on their side!\" Jenny yelled as she kept hold of her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good!\" Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay together!\" Alexander said to all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the world reappeared around them. However, they quickly found out that they were not anywhere near Starmage academy. Rather, they were at Ravenscroft. But where exactly were they?</span></div></div>",

The rest of his gang fell off of him and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" Chon muttered. \"I don't think we're in Starmage....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, intruders,\" said a female voice near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group quickly sprung into action.

Perhaps there was a mistake in the writing of the spell that was used to take you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded \"I thought that, too. We must have been placed here due to bad spell writing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon huffed \"Typical, I suppose,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now then?\" Alexander asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late, we shall have beds prepared for you quickly. We can sort out what will happen next in the morning.\" She then pressed a button on her desk, as if to call for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a woman arrived and opened the door to the office \"Did you call, Magistra?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Vanessa,\" Magistra Gardner said, \"we have a small group of students from the UK. They came due to a blunder in a transportation spell. See to it that they receive a bed each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, follow me. I will take you three gentleman to the boys dorm. Then I'll take you to the girls dorm.\" Vanessa said looking at Ryan, Chon and Alexander and Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... \" Jenny said as if to begin a protest, Starmage dorms had girls and boys living together, to ensure gender equality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it, Jen.

But he was smart enough to know that it was probably important, to her at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sat in front of Chon, still keeping her warm smile as befitting one of her job. She then took a deep breath and said \"Chon, I've heard about you. The blind vengeance of China, feared by witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon held the bridge of his nose with his right hand before saying \"I didn't choose that name by the way. If your scared that I'm going to be beating up witches then don't worry, I won't start anything so long as they keep to themselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon, why do you hate magic?\" Vanessa asked, taking his earlier statement in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to this Chon leaned forward, and simply said \"It took my family away from me, and left me a broken young boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I'm sorry to hear that Chon. It's strange that despite the fearsome reputation you've cultivated no one in the magic community knows of you outside of it, aside from your friends of course. But there's another matter that concerns me.\" Vanessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" Chon replied curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say you've killed people before, witches. From the age of 15, you have to understand Chon I need to know about this not just for your sake but for all of our magic students here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, silence filled the room as Chon turned his face away from Vanessa. He drummed his fingers on the desk before saying \"It was self defence, nothing more. They tried to harm me and paid the price for it. You don't need to worry about me, I've taken care of myself since I was a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Chon stood up and proceeded to exit the office, but Vanessa spoke up with \"Okay Chon. Just know if you ever want to talk about those issues I will be more than happy to hear them. Get to class now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"................\" Chon said nothing as he stood at the doorway, though he gave a nod before departing to class.

Even though I had probably never been as socially uncomfortable in my life before, there was a far more fundamental law of nature that had to be obeyed: nothing stands between an 11-year old girl and her presents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I opened the really big one first. It didn't take long before I recognised what was inside. \"Uhm ... it's a broom\" I noted quietly, feeling quite disappointed.<br>\r\n\"Wow, cool broom!\" said one of the guests.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'll definitely be needing one of those\" said mom.<br>\r\n\"If you say so\" I replied, wondering if they were actually sending me to become the Ravencroft janitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously I opened my next present. \"And this one is ... a pot?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"Cauldron, to be more precise\" corrected dad.<br>\r\n\"Uhm ... right, ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I continued unwrapping the gifts. Along with the broom and the cauldron, there was a small stick (which my parents assured me was a \"wand\"), a blank book (with a thick leather cover and thick pages) with a large quill, a small knife (again, my parents called it an \"athame\"), and a set of textbooks. Among the books were titles such as \"Beginner's Guide to Spellcraft\", \"Elementary Charms\", \"History of Magick Volume One\" and \"How To Avoid Being Eaten By Dragons (and other useful facts about magick beasts for young witches)\". I liked that last one - it had a cute pink cover with an image of a princess being roasted alive by a dragon inlaid in gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom. Thanks dad.\" I said.<br>\r\n\"How do you feel about going to Ravenscroft now, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean ... you're not giving me a choice are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"Not really\" admitted dad \"But we also want you to be happy. We love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled both mom and dad in for a hug and started to cry. In the background, the teenagers began packing my things into a large trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll come visit\" promised mom.<br>\r\n\"And your tutor was a witch too, by the way\" added dad \"I'm sure she'll want to know how you're getting on.\"<br>\r\n\"I love you\" I said.<br>\r\n\"We love you too\" replied mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearfully I let go of the hug and turned to the older group that was taking me. I still didn't feel right being around them, but still I mustered up the courage to quietly walk in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" said both my parents at the same time as I walked out the door.<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose would be my last words to them for a long while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The witches led me to a white van with tinted windows. After loading in my trunk, they silently motioned for me to come inside, and I did. Not only was it difficult to see into the van, but it was also tricky to see out of it. Later I'd realize the van was magicked with a powerful shield, but at the time, I think, I had other concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still didn't quite believe that magick was real. I thought this was either a prank, or perhaps my parents had finally abandoned me for good. I didn't even look at the others. For some reason I felt shame. As if they sensed my feelings, the others gave me lots of room in the van, remained quiet and left me to my own devices. I passed the time looking down, trying to sing songs in my head to cheer myself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't drive for nearly as long as I thought we would. For some reason I had expected a journey of at least many hours, but somehow, we reached the place in only a few minutes. The others ushered me outside, together with my trunk, and sped off down the road without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first impression was not of the academy itself, but the surrounding countryside. A far cry from the suburbia I grew up in, Ravenscroft was set on a beautiful country estate. Surrounding the property were green fields, lush forests and gentle, rolling hills. A large stone archway comprised the entrance to a long path with beautiful fountains to the sides, freshly mowed lawns, sweet flowers and water features. Of course, I didn't know what I'd expected, but the sweet breeze and wonderful scenery did much to calm my nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the path, and dragging my trunk behind me, I began to get a closer look at the main building of Ravenscroft. It was a large, imposing chateau, apparently with a 17th-century architecture. It reminded me of a painting I'd once seen of a royal French palace, but certain features, such as the narrow windows, seemed much more gothic in appearance. I thought about this as I walked, since I was a gifted young student. The building was made of yellow bricks, although the roof was red and tiled. Behind the main building I could see several other, smaller buildings built in a similar architectural style. Being something of a nerd in many respects, including architecture, I had to admit it actually looked kind of cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't take it in for long, though, as my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of an enormous BANG! It sounded like a cannon firing right in front of me. Instinctively I curled up into a little ball on the ground and looked on fearfully. On the far side of the building I could hear shattering glass and screaming. A plume of red-grey dust rose up behind the building, followed soon after by a large flock of crows. The plume slowly dissipated into the air, while the crows flew off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment on, it dawned on me that this wasn't just an out-of-the-ordinary school. Magick, I realized, could be dangerous. I hoped the school had good safety procedures in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing myself, I stood up, dusted myself off, and picked up the handle of my trunk of belongings. A little more cautiously now, I walked through the idyllic setting towards the large imposing school building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I approached the oversize, heavy wooden doorway at the front, I began to wonder how in the world a small girl like me was going to open it. Luckily, the handles moved themselves as I approached and the door swung open with a heavy creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" said the door in a deep voice as I passed through it.<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" I replied instinctively, before suddenly realizing how odd it was to be talking to a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust beyond the door was a large foyer. In the middle of the foyer was an open fire, the smoke from which was entirely covering the ceiling of the room. Nonetheless the room was at least two stories high. Numerous passageways led out from this chamber, and all over the plastered walls were ancient paintings, statues and other ornate artifacts. Besides the fire, the room was unlit, giving the whole place a smokey, mystical appearance. Next to the fire, I saw an old woman looking deeply into the dancing red flames, as well as a large, albeit cute, dog sleeping beside her. She wore long, dark robes and sat perfectly still, as though she were meditating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh - blessed be?\" I asked \"My name is Eva. Eva Dawn. I was sent here by my parents?\"<br>\r\n\"I see\" croaked the old woman, without taking her eyes from the fire \"You must be the daughter of Richard and Emma Dawn?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm - yes\" I replied uncertainly.<br>\r\nThe old woman smiled. \"I remember them. Both good witches. I sense great magick power in you, young Eva. But you must be careful. Your parents have many foes. In fact, I would think it wise not to tell anybody else about your parents. But also you must never be afraid to help others. Do not forget that power corrupts, Eva. Harm none.\"<br>\r\nI pondered on this for a moment. \"Who are you, exactly?\"<br>\r\n\"I am the keeper of the fire\" the old woman croaked in almost a whisper \"I have tended to these flames for many generations. I have seen many witches come and go. Any student is welcome to sit with me whensoever they wish.\"<br>\r\nI thought that was odd. Why did this school need to keep an open fire burning indoors for that long? Perhaps it was some archaic tradition, I thought to myself, which the school could not let go of.<br>\r\n\"Oh\" I replied after some hesitation \"So, do you know what I'm meant to do now?\"<br>\r\n\"I prophecy one of our senior students will come by to show you around in thirty four seconds\" said the woman in a low, dramatic whisper.<br>\r\nI wondered whether all witches were such drama queens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly thirty four seconds later, a teenage girl strutted into the room. She was wearing a fashionable crop top and high cut jeans, giving her an exceptionally beautiful appearance. \"Blessed be kiddo, I'm Caitlin\" she said sweetly \"Welcome to Ravenscroft academy for young witches.\"<br>\r\n\"Blessed be. I'm Eva,\" you replied quietly. For some reason you couldn't explain, you were much more confident talking to the old lady by the fire compared to this fellow student.<br>\r\n\"Well, welcome Eva, to your new home!\" said Caitlin \"Come on, let me show you around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin led you down one of the hallways, while you dragged your heavy trunk behind you. You wondered why Caitlin didn't cast a spell to make your trunk any lighter as you went. Most of the building's interior seemed dimly lit yet very clean, with fire torches for lighting. The smoke was much less intense than you might have expected, however. You walked past numerous heavy wooden doors through the labyrinthine corridors before ascending a staircase and seeing a window with a view to the gardens outside. Would you ever find your way around this whole place, you wondered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Caitlin stopped. \"This will be your first classroom here.\" she explained \"The door is locked right now but your first class is tomorrow. It's like a new-entrant class for witches, you just learn the real basics at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and Caitlin kept walking. \"If you ever get confused, just follow the others\" she explained \"I know it's a bit daunting to find your way around this whole place at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin showed you the way to the mess hall - a large dining room with ornate silverware and candles - the middle school lounge - a cosy affair which, to your surprise, featured a huge wide-screen TV - various bathrooms, and, eventually, your dorm room. Inside the dorm there were six bunk beds, all made up with fine sheets and bedding, as well as a fireplace, some cupboards for storage, a private ensuite bathroom, a narrow window, and a huge chandelier hanging from the roof. Besides five of the bunk beds stood others who looked about your age - three boys and two other girls - all staring at you. It was freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" said the door to your dorm as you walked inside.<br>\r\n\"Uh - am I supposed to say something back to the doors if they talk to me?\" I asked Caitlin. I hoped that wasn't a stupid question.<br>\r\n\"Well it would be polite\" explained the door.<br>\r\n\"Well, blessed be, I guess\" I said. Caitlin chuckled to herself. \"You'll get used to it\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be! Welcome to our dorm\" said one of the boys, wearing a loose Hawaiian shirt that showed off his beach body \"I'm Ben. I love sports, especially surfing.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Jack\" said another boy, wearing expensive looking clothes and a golden watch \"I like business and investment.\"<br>\r\n\"Amy\" said one of the girls, adjusting her glasses \"I like reading and science.\"<br>\r\n\"Liam\" said the last boy, who was quite small, \"I ... don't really know why I'm here. I miss my mummy.\"<br>\r\n\"And I'm Jessica\" cheered the remaining girl \"I like unicorns and rainbows and candy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked as they all looked at you, as though they expected you to say something back. All you could think was how normal all their hobbies seemed. For some reason you'd expected witches to have really odd hobbies, like milking frogs, taming dragons, or staring into a fire for decades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" you managed to splutter out eventually \"I'm, uh ... I'm Eva, I guess. Blessed be all of you.\"<br>\r\nYou smile faintly hoping the others in your new room will like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you to get settled\" said Caitlin, leaving the room \"Bright blessings, Eva!\"<br>\r\nAnd with that she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed nervously to yourself as you saw your roommates stare at you again. Could things get any less intimidating?</span></div></div>",

I'm so jealous of her boyfriend\" said Ben.<br>\r\n\"Get a grip, both of you\" snapped Amy \"You're both eleven. Right now we have a new girl in our dorm and that's what you talk about? Seriously.\"<br>\r\nFor some reason, Liam looked away out of the window, apparently sobbing gently to himself.<br>\r\nWhile Amy scolded Jack and Ben, Jessica came up to me. \"Here, I got you some chocolates!\" she said cheerily, handing you a pink box with a white bow \"They're not magick or anything, but they taste so good they might as well be!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" I said quietly, dragging my trunk towards the lockers.<br>\r\n\"You can have this bottom one\" explained Jessica, twirling around in her cute pink dress \"Want me to help you with that trunk?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine\" I say as I begin to unpack \"What's going on with Liam?\"<br>\r\n\"We don't know. He won't really talk to us\" said Jessica \"He seems to like the teddy bear I bought him, but I think he doesn't like being a witch. He keeps saying that he misses his parents and that this is all a mistake. But getting him to open up seems impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understood perfectly. The whole experience was totally overwhelming to me, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough I'd packed away my things. My bed was between Jessica and Ben, so Jessica and I decided to play chess together. Unfortunately, Jessica was a much better player than I was, and kept beating me in only a few moves. Her chess set was unusual too, with all the pieces and squares being pink and white instead of black and white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of us are still quite new here\" said Jessica \"Ben's been here the longest, and he only joined something like a month ago. Jack joined soon after ... Amy and I have been here for about two weeks each. Liam just joined a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n\"Are we all in the same class?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, we will be\" explained Jessica \"Our teacher's Professor Lewis ... he's a bit mad, but really nice.\"<br>\r\n\"That's good\" I said \"Let's play again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being thrashed in chess about a hundred times, Ben told me it was time for dinner. As I went with Ben towards the dining room, he tried to make conversation.<br>\r\n\"You seemed to get on well with Jessica\" he noted.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's nice\" I said quietly, looking down.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I couldn't help but gush about Caitlin before\" apologized Ben \"You could say she's one of the most popular girls around for a reason.\"<br>\r\n\"I get it\" I said simply.<br>\r\n\"So, uhm ... do you like sports? Ever tried surfing?\"<br>\r\n\"I've never really tried\" I explained \"I've always just lived at home with a private tutor. My parents were rarely ever around.\"<br>\r\nBen nodded. \"Mine either\" he explained \"They were both witches who went to magick prison. Some bastard called Richard Dawn locked them both up.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\" I said, making a mental note never to tell Ben about my heritage.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, surfing is lots of fun! I've got to show you one day!\" he said enthusiastically. I just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was nice. On my plate I found a delicious roast chicken with gravy, fresh steamed vegetables and potato. I noticed other kids had other foods on their plates, all presented as though it were created by the finest chefs. For dessert, I had sweet chocolate ice-cream and cake. Everyone talked around me, but I just smiled and concentrated on finishing my food. When I drank the orange juice in my cup, I noticed the cup automatically refilled itself. It was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, I saw the others from my dorm room head towards the middle school lounge. Except Liam. Liam went back to the room. I thought it would be better to give Liam some space, and followed the others to the lounge, remembering to say \"Blessed be\" whenever a door opened itself for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene looked like a party. There was music (which sounded a lot like the pop music you were used to), people drinking juice and pure water from ever-refilling cups, video games played on the giant TV, dancing, excited chatter and party games galore.<br>\r\n\"So I guess this is what witches do every night to unwind?\" I thought out loud to myself \"Huh, who knew...\"<br>\r\n\"Pretty much\" said Jessica, appearing behind you from out of nowhere \"Hey Eva, this is Julie. Julie, Eva.\"<br>\r\nI looked at the red-haired girl Jessica was introducing me too. She looked down towards the ground with her sweet blue eyes. I did too.<br>\r\n\"Julie is pretty new here too, but she's a great dancer\" explained Jessica \"I've been trying to convince her to let loose a bit more. Would it be ok if she taught you how to dance?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm ... if she wants to\" I said quietly.<br>\r\n\"I... uhm...\" whimpered Julie quietly \"Ok Jess.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" cheered Jessica enthusiastically \"Hey DJ! Switch to track nine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the record that was playing skipped, and a blond haired boy at the front with large headphones on switched the track to a soft Cuban beat. Immediately the pace of dancing around the room switched from fast to something slower and smoother - which was good, since I definitely would trip over myself if I tried to dance quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie held you hands softly and pulled herself tight against your body until you could feel her breath (which, thankfully, smelt like peppermint) on your face. \"Follow my lead\" she whispered softly \"Just do what I do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did a few simple steps, dancing across the room. It wasn't anything special, but it was clear from the little flourishes she did that she was an accomplished dancer. I just tried to follow along as best I could. The whole experience was alien to me. Not because there were small, minor touches of magic around the place (though far less than I would have expected) but because I'd never been in such a social environment before. Every so often, Jessica would come past, each time talking to different people, to check up on how we were doing. We'd both shyly tell her we were fine - I got the impression Julie was NOT comfortable with showing off in any way. I could imagine her having serious stage fright. Jessica, I began to realize, was the resident party animal. I saw the others, too - Ben was among the guys playing video games. Amy was being surprisingly non-social, reading a book in the corner by the fire with a few others - I thought maybe tomorrow night I should go directly there. And Jack was dancing too, though he occasionally would play games of tag or something like it, running around the room with some of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI actually didn't expect the slow dancing to be nearly as exhausting as it was. After a short period of time, Julie noticed me looking tired. \"Do you want to go to bed?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've had a long first day\" you explained.<br>\r\nJulie nodded. \"Just wait until you have class tomorrow\" she said, before signalling for Jessica to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica led you back to the dorm so you wouldn't get lost. You noticed in the dorm had the lights out, and Liam was apparently asleep in his bed.<br>\r\n\"Good night\" whispered Jessica with a smile \"I'll tell the others not to wake you up\"<br>\r\n\"Night\" I whispered back, as Jessica left to go back to the common area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, before heading for the ensuite bathroom. After a quick shower and a brush of my teeth - during which I wondered whether I'd ever learn to speed up that process through magick - I put on my pajamas and slid into my cosy, warm bed. It was still unfamiliar to me - I was used to a much less comfortable bed than this one - but I was too exhausted to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I began to drift into sleep, I remember vividly hearing Liam sob to himself on his bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up early the next morning. After a yawn and a stretch, I pulled myself out of my comfortable covers and towards the bathroom. As I did so, I noticed everyone else was seemingly fast asleep. I noticed Jessica was a bit of an oddity, sleeping on top of her covers rather than between them, and wearing only pink lingerie. After a warm shower and going through the rest of my morning bathroom routine, I went back to the dorm room. Here I saw Amy was also awake by now, reading a book on potions while waiting to use the bathroom. \"Blessed be\" she said casually as she set down the book and passed me.<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" I whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crept back towards my bed and got changed into my clothes underneath the covers. I noticed my bed made itself every time I came off it, which was extremely useful, because I was not good at making my bed neatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the others stood up, Jessica being last. Everyone said \"blessed be\" to each other as they woke up. I amused yourself for a while by sitting down on my bed repeatedly and watching it re-make itself every time, no matter how much I messed it up. Eventually, Amy finished. \"Want to come down with me for breakfast?\" she asked \"Oh, just leave your dirty laundry on your bed. It'll be clean by the time you come back from breakfast.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, uhm, ok\" I said to myself, a bit unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only been here a bit more than a week\" said Amy \"My mum was a cowan - apparently that's what they call non-magical people - and my dad was a witch. They both worked in the city library, so I got to read a lot as a child. Eventually I even found a few of my dad's secret books and learnt a few simple spells. The professor says I'm one of the gifted ones.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, the keeper of the fire said the same thing to me!\" I said, remembering \"Maybe we'll be in a group together.\"<br>\r\n\"That would be nice\" replied Amy as I entered the dining room, hoping I'd have cereal wherever we decided to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, I saw Julie talking with a boy at a nearby table. We both decided to sit down beside them without a word, and I was happy to notice that seemingly by dumb luck, I had a bowl of cereal with fresh milk right in front of me.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, apparently the cooks prophecy exactly what we will want to eat and where we will sit\" explained Amy, noticing my look of confusion.<br>\r\n\"You get used to it\" said Julie softly, with a faint smile \"Blessed be.\"<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" said everyone else.<br>\r\n\"Have you met Andrew yet?\" asked Amy, gesturing to the boy.<br>\r\nI looked down in case I had but didn't recall. Everything was happening so fast and there were so many new faces to remember.<br>\r\n\"I'm from Julie's dorm\" said Andrew by way of introduction \"I like drawing and playing the guitar.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you\" I managed quietly \"I'm sorry, I'm not used to meeting so many new people. Everyone is so different, too!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we all have only one thing in common\" noted Amy \"All of us are witches. Witches don't just come from one walk of life - there's books in the library about the sociology of witchcraft, very interesting stuff.\"<br>\r\nI smiled faintly. Being friends with Amy would definitely be helpful for any assignments I was set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I was packing a small bag for class in my dorm room. Jessica had apparently stayed up most of the night in the middle school lounge party, so she slept in for a long time and had to skip breakfast. Nonetheless she was as sociable as ever. I noticed she didn't talk with Amy much, however.<br>\r\n\"I like your shirt\" Jessica told me as all six of us headed for class. I smiled back at her in reply.<br>\r\nBehind the five of us, Liam sulked with his head in his hands, walking as reluctantly as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shared a blessing with the classroom door, allowing us entry. Inside was a classroom that was ... surprisingly normal. There were desks, wall displays, a whiteboard, and numerous kids racing about playing silly games. A window showed a nice view of a courtyard outside. A middle aged, dark-skinned, balding man wearing a formal suit and tie walked over from a teacher's desk, and introduced himself to me. \"I am Professor Lewis\" he said proudly \"Head of new enrollments here at Ravenscroft. It's my job to get you and your friends ready to move into a first-year class at the beginning of the next academic year.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Eva\" I replied softly.<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you\" said Professor Lewis \"Your desk is over there. If you work hard, you'll be a great and powerful witch in no time! This is where your life really gets started, Eva. Don't mess up this chance. I will expect a lot of work from you, but I know if you try your best always, you'll be able to make it. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, a freaky ghost thing came through one wall screaming with a high pitch, rushing through the classroom like a freight train, before going through the wall on the opposite side. Everyone covered their ears at the loud noise, and afterwards, rapidly made for their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the banshee has called, that's our signal to start the day!\" said the professor. I thought it was interesting that this school used a freaky ghost instead of a normal bell. I also noticed that I was sitting between Ben and Jessica. It seemed like the class had about fourty students, which was much more than the one-on-one tutoring I was accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" said the professor.<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" replied everyone.<br>\r\n\"We have a new student today\" beamed the professor \"Eva, why don't you introduce yourself.\"<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to me. Immediately I went into shock. I started shaking and didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n\"Uh - blessed be?\" I managed to say.<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" said everyone in response.<br>\r\n\"I'm Eva and I'm, uhm\" I really didn't know what to say \"I just turned eleven yesterday so, yeah, I'm new here. Uh - any questions?\"<br>\r\nThe class was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the professor took over again. \"Welcome to our class Eva. Why don't we all give her a big clap for her fine speech?\"<br>\r\nThe class broke out in applause that, I am certain, nobody actually meant.<br>\r\n\"It's always hard on your first day. I am sure many of you will remember coming to my class for the first time. For some it is especially difficult.\"<br>\r\nAt this everyone's heads seemed to turn to Liam, who was slumped over his desk with his head still firmly planted in his hands.<br>\r\n\"Hey, one two three, all eyes on me!\" commanded the professor \"We're here to help each other out, ok? We're all in this same boat together. So if somebody is new, I want you to help them out. Have you made any friends yet, Eva?\"<br>\r\nJessica gave me a soft nudge. I nodded quietly.<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said the professor \"Remember this lesson, young witches - help those who need it. That is true strength. Your power lies not in your aptitude for magick, but in your service to others. Now, for class today I have something very special to show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took out from his pocket a tiny glass ball, a little smaller than a tennis ball. The glass appeared quite frosted, but strangely pretty. The professor tossed it into the air, and everyone gasped as they saw the seemingly frail glass bounce off the floor, and back into the professor's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously this is a real magick\" explained the professor \"You will recall we've been learning about the differences between magick and stage magic in this class. But who would like to make a guess as to what this curious thing does?\"<br>\r\nAmy's hand shot up. \"It is a crystal ball, professor.\"<br>\r\n\"Very good. And what are the properties of a crystal ball?\"<br>\r\n\"It shows you things through space and time\" replied Amy instantly.<br>\r\n\"Well, that is a good general answer\" said the professor \"To be more precise, a crystal ball will show you whatever you need to see. It might be another place, or something from the past, or even the future. Sometimes you may gaze into it and see nothing, for there is nothing you need to see. But a crystal ball never lies ... it will always show you the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the professor passed around his tiny crystal ball, and everyone took turns at looking into it. He explained that only the person gazing most directly into it will see anything, and then only if they were holding the ball with an outstretched palm. In the meantime, the rest of the class would write an essay explaining possible uses for crystal balls. I couldn't really think of any unless the ball felt like showing something helpful, so I spent a lot of time just sitting there staring at my mostly-blank piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ben handed me the ball, with a big smile on his face. \"This is so cool\" he said to himself, obviously very satisfied with what he'd seen.<br>\r\nI looked into the ball. At first I saw nothing, and was disappointed. Then, very faintly, I noticed something like clouds inside the ball moving. I felt a force on my mind, projecting itself into the ball. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was my dad, wearing some kind of uniform, chained up in a dark underground prison. A menacing laugh rang out from the darkness.<br>\r\n\"You'll never see her again! Ha ha ha...\"<br>\r\n\"Nooooo...\" cried out my dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dropped the crystal ball in shock and almost fell backwards on my chair. Everyone in the class was staring at me as the frosted glass ball bounced in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" asked Ben.<br>\r\n\"Uh - I think so\" I said.<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" asked Jessica \"I mean, your eyes literally glazed over, and then you started screaming the word no as loudly as you could.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that must have been one heck of a vision\" added Ben.<br>\r\nI looked down, ashamed. Remembering everything I'd been told, I realised it probably wasn't a good idea to talk about it.<br>\r\n\"Let's keep going, class\" said the professor \"Eva is new, remember class? Things are still very weird for her, I bet. And Eva ... if you need to talk about whatever you saw, I suggest you keep it private. A crystal ball will always show you the truth, but it is always something you need to see ... not necessarily what the rest of the class needs to hear about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded softly to myself.</span></div></div>",

My final paper was actually mostly blank, while I could see Amy had written a mini-thesis on the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I calculated the equations in front of me, I wondered to myself, how far in the future would my father be imprisoned? What if he was imprisoned right now? Who had captured him? What if the crystal ball was showing me an alternate reality somehow? My parents had said I'd be safe so long as I was in the academy, but were they safe? What if they put me here because they knew they were about to be captured?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced over to Liam, who was clearly not doing the task and just looked dejected. In a way I understood what he was feeling. Being here did feel like a mistake - magick wasn't even supposed to be real. There was no way that crystal ball could have known that. And I missed my parents like nothing else. Even though I rarely saw my parents as a child, I missed them now, and feared I'd never see them again. Just like that harrowing, menacing voice in her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I became aware that Jessica was busy copying all my maths answers. \"Hey\" I whispered to her.<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were so brainy\" Jessica smiled back \"Seriously, I can do maths, but not half as quickly as you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone had to cover their ears again as the school banshee raced past, and the class made for the mess hall. You found a banana and munched on it quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw myself surfing this huge wave!\" said Ben excitedly.<br>\r\n\"I saw myself when I first learnt how to play the guitar\" said Andrew \"It made me remember why I love it so much.\"<br>\r\n\"Lucky for you guys, I saw myself dropping a dollar down a drain and not knowing how to get it out\" said Jack.<br>\r\n\"Well I saw my marriage ceremony!\" cheered Jessica \"It was so good. My dress is going to be amazing!\"<br>\r\n\"Did you see who you'll marry?\" asked Julie softly.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" blushed Jessica \"But I'm not telling who!\"<br>\r\n\"Is it someone we'd know?\" asked Jack curiously.<br>\r\n\"Yes ... uhm, no more questions!\" said Jessica quickly, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed quiet, not really wanting to share anything about what I saw in the ball. The professor had been right ... many things one needs to see are better kept private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this snack and a short chat it was time for our next class. We resumed our seats and the professor lectured again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I hope you already know this\" he began \"But magick is dangerous. We always say we should harm none. That is for a good reason. When we try to use magick to harm others, we actually harm ourselves. Many who have tried to use magick to destroy the world, corrupted by its power, have seen instead their own destruction. When we use magick to help others is when we find ourselves blessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor handed out sheets of paper with \"blessed be\" apparently translated into tons of languages, and we split off into pairs to practice saying those words in different languages. Apparently this was to help us say incantations written in archaic languages as we got older. As everyone was pairing up, I went directly over to Liam's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be\" I said gently.<br>\r\n\"Go away\" he sighed, seemingly on the verge of tears again.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" I explained \"Can I share a secret with you? I don't want to be here either.\"<br>\r\nLiam looked confused. \"Then why do you hang out with all of these freaks?\" he asked \"This isn't normal! If my parents knew what this place was really like ... they told me I'd be going here for a holiday camp. This has to be a mix-up ... it's not right! Now they're lying to me. Everyone's lying, saying my parents were witches and everything! I don't want to be a witch or do magick. I want to go back home with my friends and my family. I miss my dog Bones and my cat Nightstalker. I miss warm hugs from my mum...\"<br>\r\nHe broke down in tears at this point. I was almost crying too. In my mind I imagined he couldn't accept his parents lied to him ... but what if he really wasn't a witch and it <i>was</i> genuinely a mistake? Was that possible? And I could definitely understand the part about being homesick. Now that I knew the fate of my father, at least, I certainly was too.<br>\r\nCarefully and softly, I moved my hand to his back and patted it. He let me. \"I hear you\" I said \"After what I saw in the ball this morning ... I totally understand where you're coming from.\"<br>\r\n\"The ball lies\" said Liam firmly \"It said my parents were happy I was here so they didn't have to hide their magick from me any longer. But I know in my heart that's not true. My parents would never lie to me!\"<br>\r\nI nodded quietly. \"I'm sorry\" I said \"I'm so sorry that happened. I wish I could do something to help you.\"<br>\r\nLiam looked up and smiled a little at me. It was the first time I'd see him smile even a little. \"You're the first person...\" he muttered \"Everyone else thinks I'm crazy here. It's been going on like this for days...\"<br>\r\n\"You're not crazy\" I assured him \"And whatever happens, you and me both, let's make a pact that we will see our parents and our friends again. Ideally, alive and well.\"<br>\r\nI offered him my hand. He looked at it for a moment, and then clasped it.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Eva\" he said \"This means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of my eye, I noticed the professor had been watching this whole exchange with a smile. I had expected him to tell us off for not doing what he'd asked, but instead he seemed fine with it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next class, the professor took us outside to the gardens. He showed us a small shrub with holly growing.<br>\r\n\"Who knows what we call this?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"That's holly!\" answered Amy before anyone else could reply.<br>\r\n\"Great! Holly is useful in lots of concoctions and rituals. Today we'll be harvesting some of this holly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor handed out sickles and small baskets for collecting holly. Everyone seemed to struggle somewhat with using them, as there was something of an art to it. Even Amy didn't seem to take very naturally to this task. It was slow and painstaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually\" lectured the professor while we worked \"You would only harvest holly at specific times, depending on the ritual or whatever spell you wished to cast. Holly harvested at particular times on particular dates can have a very high street value.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about how my kitchen at home was always well-stocked with herbs and other green leaves ... perhaps it was not simply, as I had always assumed, that my mother had been a great chef, but also that she performed magick with them. I wondered what kinds of spells my mum would cast around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be careful\" continued the professor \"Holly can be poisonous if you don't prepare it right. We're just harvesting right now ... we'll make something out of it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the harvesting did give me something of an appetite. Luckily it was followed by lunchtime, where the cooks had apparently prepared a delicious smoked chicken salad for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey - look\" said Jessica, thrusting a newspaper into my hands \"This is the Ravenscroft Chronicle - it's a thrice-a-week newspaper for everything Ravenscroft\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\" I said \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n\"Take a look at the third page\" she continued \"That's the clubs directory, in case you want to join something. I do cheerleading, netball, rowing... Ben's teaching me how to surf, too.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to take a look\" I said.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come with me and take a look at the library?\" asked Amy \"It's nice there.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds like an interesting way to spend my first lunch break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough you found yourself in a giant hall with seemingly endless stacks of books around you. There was plenty of tables, bean bags, cushions and even some platters with refreshments. \"Just get a book, find a cosy spot, and read!\" explained Amy.<br>\r\n\"How do you find anything in this library though?\" I asked, uncertain.<br>\r\n\"That's the best part!\" replied Amy \"It took me a while to remember this too, but this IS a magical library so ... just call out loudly what sort of book you're looking for, and the library will make the closest book fall straight into your lap! It's so nice! See ... watch ... Book about how to use magic libraries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said it, a book came flying past her. With a swift snatch she caught it and then handed it to you. \"When you're done, just leave it lying around here somewhere, the book will return itself\" she said \"Isn't it awesome?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was pretty cool\" I had to admit.<br>\r\n\"All the librarians really do is enchant new books that come in and fix books when the enchantment starts to fade\" explained Amy \"I've already begun my training, of course. Anyway, right now I could use a good book on ... Werewolf Politics!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe chuckled and laid down together on the same beanbag. Time flew while I learnt how to call out various specific commands for books and got the hang of catching them as they flew past. It was surprisingly easy with practice, even for me - and you should know, I'm a very lazy catcher. Unfortunately, the break was too short, as the wail of the banshee informed us it was time to head back to class. Lying down next to Amy and just reading quietly to ourselves was definitely my level of social - still doing things together but without all the brashness that Jessica seemed to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun\" I said on my way back to class.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the library's a nice place to unwind\" said Amy \"I'm down there quite a lot - it's great for homework and stuff too! Just blurt out the question, and a book with the answer will usually come right your way. Plus the place is big enough that you can hardly hear anyone else saying their questions.\"<br>\r\nYou smiled. Sometimes, just sometimes, being in a magick school sure was fun.</span></div></div>",

What's worse is the fact I am an orphan; left abandoned on the steps of Child Hope Orphanage as an infant. With sun blond hair, blue eyes, and doll like features one would think a couple would want to adopt me right away. Only no couple ever seemed to want me; it was as if they did not even see me like I had a dark cloud over my head. The other orphans seemed to ignore me as well when they were not pushing me around. The staff never seemed to see the bullying or just did not care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy troubles became unbearable upon my eleventh birthday the other day. Strange things began to happen that I could not explain. The kids who got rough with me were suddenly thrown off their feet by an invisible force and food would appear in my hands when I grew hungry were strong examples. It did not take long for me to realize that I had magick. The staff and other orphans began to like me even less after that. I had cried myself to sleep, praying to be rescued from my misery when I was visited by a black cat. For some strange reason, I could hear a female voice in my head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*My name is Maddalena; you can call me Maddy.*</i> Softly, the cat introduced. <i>*I heard your cry for help; please follow me.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like a sequence in a dream. My curiosity was too great not to follow the strange talking cat and she lead me out of the orphanage through a service entrance that was left open and down the dim lit sidewalk. Though I was only wearing a nightgown and undergarments, no one seemed to notice me. I continued following Maddy until we reached a tall iron gate in a high stone wall. I did not know what purpose the complex of low building beyond served but I had always sensed something powerful inside when the orphanage bus had passed it to and from field trips the orphanage offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious and more curious.\" Whispering, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy easily slipped between the bars and meowed loudly until a massive man came forward.  He was towering with a bushy mustache and beard, wearing black robes with dark pants and shirt beneath. I sensed powerful magick within him, making me shiver only his gentle blue eyes oddly placed me at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddalena, who have you lead to our gates?\" Softly, he demanded. \"This poor child looks as if she had been severely neglected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm Tia Grant.\" Finding my voice, I stammered. \"I am an orphan with magick, living at Child Hope Orphanage a few blocks from here.\" I bowed deeply, adding. \"Please, mighty wizard... teach me how to control my magick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering man raised a single eyebrow as I heard or thought I heard Maddy giggle. A bemused look came across the man's face. \"Quiet.\" Grinning, he scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then produced a long thin wooden rod from the folds of his ropes and pointed it at me. \"Interesting.\" Softly, he said. \"My name is Wardwell; groundskeeper of Ravenscroft school. Please follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he opened the gate and offered his hand. Uncertain, I accepted his hand and he gently led me inside as the gate closed behind us on its own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Will you accept me as one of your apprentices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, a deep, rich sound. \"As I said, I am the groundskeeper here at Ravenscroft Academy. I am taking you to the magistra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked until we reached a door, and he knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the door opened, and an older woman stood before us. \"What is it, Wardwell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddalena has brought us a guest, Magistra.\" Gesturing to me, he said, \"This is Tia Grant. I know she doesn't look it, but she is of age, and she has magick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curtsied to me. \"Good evening, Tia, and blessed be. You've come rather early, as the school year doesn't begin for another week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I can learn about magick here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my dear. However, our dormitory halls are not yet ready to accommodate students. We will need to make some sort of arrangement for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I stay with Mr. Wardwell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked. \"I'm not sure if he has the room for you, Tia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't take up much room, Magistra.

Have plants always reacted to your presence and touch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love gardening.\" Still smiling, I said. \"Plants seem to understand me, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell was thoughtful for a moment. \"Every witch specializes in one or more types of magick.\" Smiling slightly, he said. \"Your specialty may be Agro-bonding; the rare ability to communicate with and command plant life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a good thing?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell let out a deep chuckle. \"Well, it helps me know where to start in defining your magickal strengths.\" Bemused, he replied. \"Also, I would hope it is a good thing as that is one of my specialties as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that as Wardwell then led me to his cottage. I was very surprised to find that it was made of a large circle of trees with its high branches interweaving to form the roof. Tightly wound vines surrounding the trees made up the outer walls. The windows were made up of hardened clear tree sap and the door was a curtain of loose hanging branches of a weeping willow that made up part of the cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing it all made me feel... at home. \"You grew your own house.\" In awe, I whispered. \"You are a mighty wizard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell laughed, confusing me. \"I wish I could take credit for such a feat but no.\" Amused, he said. \"The trees and vines did this on their own for me in a gesture of friendship and trust.\" He then turned serious. \"Magick exists in all things as such all things can use magick in their own mysterious ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even normal people?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal people, whom we call cowan, have magick but it is too weak for them to use.\" Smiling, Wardwell replied. \"It finds an outlet through their talents and skills which is why they say they can work 'magick' in what they do best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded at that then yawned. \"Sorry.\" Wincing, I said. \"I don't get much sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell smiled kindly. \"Let us find room for you to sleep then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he led me into the cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For now, they're curious. By the time you move into one of the residence halls, they'll regard you as a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main room of the cottage was a combination living room/dining room/kitchen. Next to the table was a bookcase. Most of the books were about philosophy. On the table was a book by Immanuel Kant. Its condition suggested that this was far from the first time he'd read it. Hanging on the wall were pictures. Except for one of him holding a baby in one hand, they were all of various dogs he had owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell took out his wand and cast a spell, creating another bedroom. \"Have a look inside,\" he said. \" Let me know if it's big enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I'll be fine,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not looking to cram you into something just to see if you fit,\" he replied. \"Let me know if I need to make it bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went into the new room, and Wardwell didn't have to worry.

As I sat in the palm of this huge hand, I heard a laugh. I didn't need to hear the laugh, however, to know that I had been rescued by Wardwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried me to dry land and set me down, but it almost didn't matter.

Once done, I came out wearing a moderate length blue skirt and ivory blouse with a pair of flats. Wardwell smiled kindly then helped me into a chair. The four dogs were already happily enjoying their own morning meal as we began to eat. As we did, I could not help wonder about the dream I had. \"Um... Wardwell, I had a dream last night about how my parent's died.\" Softly, I said. \"I dreamed that you saved me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell sighed before wiping his mouth with a napkin. \"That was not a dream, my dear.\" Firmly but kindly, he replied. \"That was a memory.\" He paused, as if to search for the right words. \"Your mother and father were adventurers, always looking for the next big thrill. They had decided to take you with them for your first adventure out on a boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They ran into an unexpected storm.\" Softly, Wardwell explained. \"I was in the area when I caught their distress call on my radio. I sailed out to see what I could do but the storm had already taken the boat and your parents.\" He gulped down a hard lump before adding. \"I was crying when I took you into my hand because I came too late to save your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So that wasn't a laugh I heard in my dream.\"</i> Gulping, I thought. <i>\"It was Wardwell crying.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose from my chair and offered my hand to Wardwell. \"Thank you for saving me.\" Smiling slightly, I said. \"Also, thank you for trying to save my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell shed a few tears as he took me into his arms and racked me a little. \"Had I known then you had magick, I would have adopted you on the spot.\" Tearfully, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could adopt me now.\" Hopefully, I said. I sniffed. \"No one who came to the orphanage even bothered to look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to cry as Wardwell continued to rock me like a small child, crying himself. The four dogs began to whimper then howled in tune with our cries. Out in the garden, every flower opened in a beautiful display of approval; a powerful bond had been made.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was not much good to say, unfortunately as I was for the most part treated poorly by the staff and other orphans. Wardwell listened intently then knotted his jaws in decision. \"I can not, in good conscious allow you to go back there.\" Firmly, he said. \"I left you at the orphanage in hopes you would find a good home, not to be treated in such a way you described.\" He then smiled at me kindly. \"I will adopt you, if you will have me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI replied by jumping into his arms, crying. Wardwell again rocked me gently then, after I had calmed down, he took me to the magistra's office where he again knocked. Minutes later, the magistra answered. \"Blessed be, Wardwell.\" Patiently, she said. \"What brings you back to me with Tia so soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to adopt her.\" Serious, Wardwell replied. \"It was I who rescued her from the ocean waters ten years ago and left her at the orphanage, not knowing she had magick. It is only right and only fair.\" He paused, tearing up. \"I cannot stand seeing her get sent back there; the horrors she spoke of when telling me of her life there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Smiling, the magistra replied. She turned to me. \"You need not worry, dear child. I will take care of this matter immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she produced a long thin wooden rod of her own and pointed it at me and then at Wardwell. I had expected to feel different but all I felt was a sense of relief. The magistra then smiled as us both. \"Congratulations, Wardwell and to you, Tia Wardwell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teared up. \"Tia... Wardwell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now officially Wardwell's adopted daughter.\" Smiling, magistra said. \"You need not ever go back to that orphanage as all the paperwork is already done. As far as anyone is concerned, you are a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were falling at this point. \"I love magick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magistra giggled slightly. \"I am pleased to hear that.\" Patiently, she said. \"Now off with you both; we all have much work to do. Blessed be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWardwell and I returned to the cottage for a small celebration. \"How would you like to help me work in the gardens, Tia?\" Smiling, Wardwell asked. \"I can show you flowers you had never seen before, at least not in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI beamed at that. \"I would love to... dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The days to the official start of school went fast as dad taught me the wonders of potion making through the various gardens they grow to make them. \"To a cowan, these mixtures do nothing for them except to perhaps upset their stomach.\" Serious, dad had explained. \"Magick is needed to properly mix the ingredients into a usable potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cowan can still make some real good medicines.\" Politely, I countered. \"They are made from herbs and spices as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"That is true and that is where their extremely limited magick comes into play but potions are far more effective due to the stronger magick used to make them.\" He looked at the clock on the wall. \"It is time for me to greet the students for their orientation. Would you like to join me; you already had yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eagerly nodded and dad led me to the front courtyard where the buses were already beginning to gather with the next class of fresh students. They were people from all walks of life who, as dad explained, just discovered they had magick abilities. Two students caught my eye though I'm not sure why. The first was a tall young girl with mid back blond hair and blue eyes looking about in an almost panicked state. She kept rubbing her fingers on a Christian cross hanging from a necklace. The second was a short young boy with brown hair and brown eyes looking rather confident, I dare say cocky even. He was carrying an odd case with him and I wondered what he could possibly be bringing with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached, dad motioned me to stand out of sight. \"It is customary for the seventh year students to play magickal pranks on the first year students to keep them on their toes.\" Serious, he whispered. \"It's not personal but you would be seen as an 'easy' target.\" He grinned. \"I'd rather wait and see the look on their faces when they learn that is not the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that as dad had taught me a number of defensive spells to block and even throw spells back at the aggressor if I felt cornered. I stepped back into the shadow of a weeping willow and allowed its hanging branches to hide me from sight. I could see out into the crowd but no one could see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New students, form two lines, boys and girls!\" Firmly, dad commanded. \"I am Wardwell, grounds keeper, I will lead you all to your orientations! Do not wander or fall behind, you will not like the results!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys marched forward, I sensed magick being used. I turned and nearly gave myself away with a gasp as the confident boy's uniform changed into a girl's uniform. I heard the boy behind him whisper, \"Dude, look down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy screamed in fright then looked about angrily as nearly everyone burst into a nervous laughter at his comical predicament. <i>\"That poor boy.\"</i> Wincing, I thought. <i>\"Someone got him even before orientations.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad looked about then slowly shook his head before pulling out his wand from the folds of his robe; pointing it to someone out of my line of sight. \"Tyler Cohan, you know the rules!\" he barked. \"No pranks are tolerated before orientations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, Tyler walked into sight with a smile on his face. He was a skinny but fit young man, most likely in his seventh year with short red hair and green eyes. \"My humblest apologies, sir Wardwell.\" said Tyler with a low bow. \"My wand slipped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not like what happens when I allow my wand to slip, young man.\" Unimpressed, dad countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rose his hands, chuckling. \"The spell wears off in a day, he'll live.\" he said, smiling. \"If 'she' asks nicely, I might reverse it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned a slight shade of red, I could tell his patience was growing thin with this boy. \"I'm warning you, Cohan.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me, sir.\" Grinning, the confident boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shrugged. \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, curious, as the boy stepped out of line and looked Tyler in the eye. \"That's not a bad trick.\" Grinning, he said. I noticed him discretely pulling a small cylinder out of his now feminine blazer. \"Try this, from me, its a gas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he sprayed a thick smoke from the canister into Tyler's face, covering his mouth with his free hand. Tyler stumbled back, coughing as he breathed the gas in. \"You little twerp!\" he raged. He screamed as his voice was considerably higher, much like that of a girl. \"What did you do to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI covered my mouth to suppress a giggle as the boy laughed along with dad and the other first year students. \"If you want the antidote for that new feminine voice of yours,\" Folding his arms, the confident boy said, \"change my clothes back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was less than impressed. \"I don't need anything from you or your pathetic chemisty set. Hope you like the girls' dorms, jerk, casue thats where you'll be spending the year\" Tyler sneered, as the boy's body then transformed into the female state to match the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at the other students in a mixture of horror and embrassment, but surprisingly, there was very little laughter. I began to wonder what made seventh year students so mean, so vicious to the first years. The other boys seemed more nervous while the girls had wry smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only person that was completely passive was dad. He just ignored my sudden gender switch, at least at first. \"Miss Child. Can you go to the other line, thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, now girl, Miss Child, looked at dad in annoyance. \"Can you do something about this\" pointing at her now feminine body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It is not wise to counter a spell used in anger or to counter it so soon. You'll be staying in the girls' dorm until Mr Cohan decides to remove his spell\" Surprisingly calm, dad said. I looked on, a sense of horror running down my spine as I thought what would have happened to me without dad's teachings before school. Only a sense of relief fell through me as dad added, \"However, you get to decide what is done to Mr Cohan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it\" Miss Child replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teenage girl, I suspected was a seventh year, guided Miss Child to the girls' line. She gave her a small smile, before leaving. As she walked passed where I was hiding, I heard her whisper to another seventh year girl, \"That Tyler jerk will never live that down; a first year got the best of him on his, or rather, her first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl giggled as they walked out of my view. I turned to the girl who had caught my eye and noticed that she seemed even more terrified than before. Once the students had passed through the gates, dad came to fetch me. \"I know you saw what had happened.\" Calmly, he said. \"Believe me when I say Miss Child's actions have earned her some points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"The seventh year students are impressed by those few newbies who can actually fight back near or on their level.\" Bemused, he said. \"I would not be surprised if a few ask her out to the up coming ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that. \"Awkward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"Indeed.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My first class was spells and incantations with Professor Isaac Burroughs. I made certain to get there early, using what Wardwell had taught me to keep a look out for mischief. Professor Burroughs, who preferred to be called Issac, knelled down to my level with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be, Miss Wardwell.\" Kindly, he said. \"It is an honor to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The honor is mine.\" Bowing slightly, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac chuckled. \"Like you, Wardwell was an orphan.\" Softly, he said. \"He was raised here in these very halls; this is home to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I didn't know that.\" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac smiled. \"He is family to us and now so are you.\" Kindly, he said. He then pointed at you with a smirk. \"Just don't think we'll go any easier on you just because you are family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help giggle at that. \"I wouldn't have it any other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac nodded, satisfied. \"Since you are the first one here, might I suggest to take a seat near the front so you have a clear view of the chalkboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and took my seat as other students began shuffling in and claimed seats of their own. The younger students gave me curious looks while some of the seventh years gave me a kind smile before sitting down. Less than a minute before class began, two girls ran in with a young boy not too far behind. I recognized the first girl as Nico Child from the standoff at orientation. The other must have been her roommate. The bell rang and the door slammed in the boy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced before giving Issac a pleading look. He merely winked at me before turning to the door. \"What is the most misused magick word, known to cowan? asked Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause before the boy guessed, \"Abracadabra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Isaac allowed him inside. \"Each time you are late for class, the question gets harder.\" he explained to the entire class. \"If you answer incorrectly, you get a pass back to your dorm and you will have to ask to read the notes of one of your classmates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" replied the boy, softly. \"It won't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not say 'it won't happen again'.\" warned Isaac. \"You are only asking for a jinx, if you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then smiled. \"Now that we have all settled, let us begin.\" he said, pulling out a wand. \"Who would like to volunteer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have Miss Child volunteer. She is already transformed\" a voice says somewhere behind me. Hearing a few snickers, I was tempted to turn and give the boy a dirty look but I noticed that Issac was not impressed by the outburst. I wisely decided to remain still and silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for volunteering, Mister Parsens\" Isaac says seriously. \"I was going to show several amongst the class but I guess Nate wants it all for himself.\" He then turned to Nico Child who was seated next to me; he was blushing terribly. \"You're already seen gender..\" Issac said,  \"..but guess you can all see it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Don't.. I don't want.... what have you done to me!?!\" the newly formed girl shrieked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and winced seeing the new girl. In a way, I felt sorry for him, or rather her but I had a feeling Isaac would keep her like that for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another spell we use is age progression/ regression\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it enough to.. Urrgh\" Nate said, as she began to develop a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nate was clearly a teenager with lovely curves and a modest bust. It made me wonder if i would look as good when I reached that age. Nate, however as clearly freaked out by it. Some of the other girls suggested she be regressed while others asked to see more progression. I decided to turn back to face the front seeing the awkward look on the boy's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the embarrassed girl begged, 'you've had your fun. Please turn me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you see, class,\" Smiling, Issac said, \"the first and most important thing to remember in spellcasting is to be very careful what you say.\" With that, he returned Nate to his original form, and sent him back to his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there are no further out bursts, let us begin with simple spell casting...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dad had warned me about this, that it meant I was about to be on the receiving end of a prank. Luckily, he taught me a couple of counter-spells. I quickly cast one, so it turned out that the seventh-year who cast the spell found himself wearing a diaper instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, I noticed there was something of interest spreading among the teachers. They were very excited when they heard it, and I remembered Dad telling me how fast news spread among witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, I went to visit Dad. \"I noticed the teachers talking about something. What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dad lit up. \"Very good news, indeed, Tia. Sam has been found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Counselor Procter's son. Turns out he was next door for I don't know how long. The Magistra has taken care of the person responsible.\" He changed the subject. \"Where would you like to go in town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Students who keep good behavior get to go into town every weekend. I thought you might have some ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"I thought that I'd spend the weekend with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't be such a good idea. On weekends, I tend to the students on <i>bad</i> behavior. Most of them are alright, they just need a little help straightening themselves out. Every now and then, though, you get one who's trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to think about that.\" I checked the time. \"Guess I'd better get back to the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blessed be, Tia.

I could not help wonder what she had done to be sent there but, as the older girl was no doubt a seventh year, I was wise enough not to ask. The young girl paused looking at me then turned to a window before sticking her tongue out at someone in another hall. Curios, I turned to find a small boy looking at her with an almost sad expression on his face. <i>\"Was he the one who reported her?\"</i> Wincing, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman escorting the girl smiled before urging her on but paused upon seeing me. \"Blessed be, Miss Wardwell.\" Kindly, she said. \"You had better move on quickly, the professors tend to pick on those who are tardy for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Bowing, I replied. \"Um... what did she do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman patiently smiled. \"We are not allowed to discuss such things as it can and will promote unnecessary rumors.\" Lightly scolding, she said. \"Run along now.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNot wanting to annoy the seventh year student, I hurried along but I caught the girl blurting out, \"Thanks for not telling her I was once a full grown woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seventh year giggled. \"I didn't have to, you just did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept walking, not daring to turn around but hearing what the girl said sent an icy chill down my spine. \"She had to be the one who had taken Mrs Procter's son.\" Unnerved, I whispered. \"This school does not fool around.\" I gulped, wondering what punishments were handed down to the students who misbehaved or were tardy to class.

Unknown to me, it made me quite a celebrity among the seventh years as they were privately impressed with my ability to detect magickal pranks and deflect them. Upon approaching my next class, talismans, charms, and amulets, I placed my pass onto the door and it opened only i noticed a slight glow around the opening. \"I have a pass back to class from guidance counselor Procter.\" Politely, I said. \"Please cancel your prank before I enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a feminine giggle before the glowing stopped and I entered the room only to freeze half way through. \"I sense a talisman.\" Pouting, I said. \"Did you not hear that I had a pass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Miss Wardwell.\" Smiling, the professor said. \"You are actually the first to detect the trap before entering, I am impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Janet Good was very tall and slender with long flowing sand blond hair and ocean blue eyes; her long black dress accented her figure well. She motioned me to enter and I felt a change immediately after. I screamed upon realizing I had become a boy in the boy's uniform. I turned to Professor Good who merely smiled. \"Do not fear, Mr. Wardwell.\" gently, she said. \"You will return to your proper gender and attire upon leaving this classroom.\" She then pointed to a strange object above the door that looked like the male and female signs intertwined in a Celtic cross. \"When you are able to forge a talisman that will counteract my gender swap charm, you will have passed a third of my class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is an interesting way to motivate students to learn.\" Pouting, I said. \"It may also inspire some to strike back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet smiled kindly. \"None of those transformed will face male or female issues; I am not that mean.\" Softly, she explained. \"As for fighting back, I have a shield talisman over my desk protecting myself and all the students in this room from pranks. The offender will only be throwing a prank on him or herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that to which Janet nodded and offered a seat near the front of the class next to a familiar looking girl. She smiled upon catching my eye. \"Sam Procter.\" Introducing herself, she said. \"You must be Tia Wardwell; mom told me about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty Wardwell for now.\" Chuckling, I replied. \"Your mom spoke of you too.\" I paused. \"Did I miss too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled. \"I'll lend you my notes after class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, class continued...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI headed back home after class with a smile on my face. I had declined Professor Good's extra credit challenge but optioned for a report on what I felt boys went through in a day. I thought it would be an interesting study. It was after dinner when I sensed something was wrong. I rose from the table and looked out the window to see a strange man wearing bluejeans shirt and jacket silently jumping down from the high wall into one of the gardens. \"Dad, we have a prowler!\" Whispering, I alerted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad looked out the window and growled slightly as we both saw him grabbing a female student from behind, forcing a hand over her mouth. I recognized her as Nico Child. There was another girl with her, I recognized as Rachel demanding he release her friend. \"Stay here.\" Firmly, dad commanded. \"I shall deal with this immediately.\" He turned to his dogs. \"Protect her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs immediately surrounded me, their eyes steel focused outward for any trouble. I wanted to go with dad to confront this intruder but the dogs held me back and all I could do was helplessly watch through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't get the wrong idea.\" I heard the man quickly say. \"I'm a private detective, investigating this school. I just want to ask you two a few questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are trespassing on school grounds and assaulting a student!\" almost screaming, Rachel said. \"Let my roommate go, and get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go but, sorry, she comes with me.\" pulling Nico along, the man said. \"I'll release her once I get my answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made my blood boil. \"How dare he...\" Furious, I whispered. \"That man has no respect for people or plants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then smiled seeing dad easily lift the man off the ground with one arm by the collar of his shirt; surprising him enough to let Nico go. \"Not only have you trespassed and assaulted a student, you trampled all over my prize Ghost Orchids!\" giving the man a slight shake, dad thundered. \"Do you have any idea how rare those flowers are!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad then turned to Nico and Rachel, his face softening. \"Are you two injured?\" ignoring the man for the moment, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He- He twisted my wrist.\" showing him her now bruised wrist, Nico said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad drew in an angry breath. \"Both of you report to the infirmary,\" his breath heavy, he said. \"You do not need to see what is about to come next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Rachel and Nico hurried down the path, not daring to look back as dad then literally carried the struggling man to the house and ushered him inside. \"Sit down!\" Angrily, he ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was pale with fear and obeyed immediately, eying the large dogs as they growled a warning, still guarding me. \"I did not mean any real harm.\" Nervous, the man protested. \"Just let me go and we can forget all about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be leaving with the police.\" Firmly, dad countered. \"I would not try to run; my dogs can reach the fence in three and a half seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man caught my eye, I turned pale. \"I know him; he's a con artist named Michael Cort.\" Fearful, I said. \"He claimed to be looking for someone to adopt only he was really looking for dirt to blackmail the orphanage into paying him a ton of cash.\" I shivered at the memory. \"He locked  me in a steam trunk to keep me from telling on him; it took them two days to find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, Michael, turned red with annoyance. \"You bratty tattle tale!\" Hissing, he spat. He rose from his seat in an aggressive gesture only to freeze as the dogs barked and snapped in a clear display of protection. He got the message and quickly sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave the man a warning glare, causing him to again turn pale. \"A blackmailer scam artist.\" Annoyed, he said. \"Not to worry, my dear daughter, we have dealt with his kind before.\" He then picked up a telephone. \"Security, we have an intruder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, the man was escorted away by a number of men in police uniforms as the dogs continued to guard me. \"That man will answer for his crimes including his crime against you last year; you need not give him any more thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those poor orchids...\" Tearing up, I muttered. \"They're hurt; they need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned to me, surprised. \"You feel their pain, don't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly nodded. \"I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to dad's further surprise, the orchids suddenly rose back up, looking as beautiful as ever before a number of bruises appeared on my face and sides. Dad cried out my name just as I had fainted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up what seemed like hours later completely healed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many of boys I questioned seemed to feel awkward to even be near me. \"I think I bit more than I can chew on this extra credit assignment.\" Wincing, I said. \"Boys seem embarrassed to talk about their issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not their issues they are uncomfortable with.\" Smiling, Professor Good said. \"It's explaining them to a girl.\" She chuckled. \"It's similar to a girl trying to explain their issues to a boy. You have to be the gender to understand it fully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too keen on that.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Good chuckled. \"Try the library.\" Kindly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, not having thought of it at first. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the library, as I was studying, I was startled by a small voice beside me. \"E-Excuse me, Miss Miss Wardwell.\" Stammering, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned, surprised to find a boy, no taller than myself nervously holding a folded piece of paper. \"I- I'm...\" He blushed terribly. \"My name is Rio Mage.\" Shyly, he said. \"I- I was wondering if... if you would go to the Mabon Ball with me next weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to blush terribly. Rio was rather cute with his short forest brown hair and gentle green eyes. He was the first person to summon the courage to ask me and he was almost exactly my height. I sensed no malaise from him, just nervousness and I shyly smiled. \"I'd love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy grinned ear to ear. \"Okay, I- I'll pick you up at your house then...?\" Nervous, he asked. \"He gulped. \"Maybe I should introduce myself to your father as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't bite you.\" Smiling, I said. \"Still, it is gentleman like to meet the father of your escort before going to the dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************************************************** ********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, I told dad about the small boy who has asked me to the dance and he chuckled, surprising me. \"The shiest boy in all the first years and he had the courage to ask you first.\" Bemused, he said. \"I am pleased you were asked by someone so kind hearted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that then gasped as dad and I heard a loud painful yelp! Dad sighed and looked out the window. \"It seems we have a young male suitor whose found some bad luck.\" half grinning, he said. \"Stay here. I do not want him to see your healing abilities in case he is a cowan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, staying behind the protection of dad's three dogs. \"You there!\" dad thundered, \"This is a private school! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gave a mumbled response i did not hear. \"\"Regardless of the reason, we can not have you or anyone else trespassing.\" seriously, dad said. \"I must ask you to come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stood but cried out again as he tried to walk. Dad sighed wearily before taking the boy into his arms. \"Consider yourself thankful all you did was twist your ankle, young man.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad then took the boy into the school. Nearly an hour later, he returned, muttering to himself. \"Sloppy, real sloppy.\" Huffing, he said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay, dad?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a cowan friend of Samuel Proctor.\" Softly, dad explained. \"Because security forgot to give plausible explanations for both person's vanishings, he sneaked in to check up on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good friend.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Calmly, dad said. \"However, there are some secrets than simply must be kept for the safety of all those involved.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was to be an official school function, so pranks would be forbidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went home to read up on boys, when I heard Dad's voice coming from inside the cottage. This was different, as I usually found Dad reading when I came home. I could hear him talking about the pictures on the wall. \"I've loved all my pups,\" he said, \"but I really felt it when my little girl came into my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got to the door, I realized what had got him talking, as I heard a quieter voice inside with him. When I opened the door, I saw that it was Rio, keeping his promise to ask Dad's permission to take me to the Mabon Ball. \"Ah, there's my girl,\" Dad said as I came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRio stood up immediately. <i>Ever the gentleman,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again, Tia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Rio will be a fine young man, Tia.

She easily stood two feet taller than me with shoulder length brown hair and blue eyes and wore a prefect badge on her sleeve. She smiled politely at me, making me wince only I was not wincing at her. I had caught a glimpse of the girl, Nico Child who still seemed rattled by her encounter with her attacker. Seeing me wince, the girl sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to fear from pranks tonight, Miss Wardwell.\" Serious, she said. \"This sleepover is a school function, to allow all the students, young and old, to get to know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was wincing at poor Nico Child.\" Softly, I said. \"I saw the man attack her in the garden that night.\" I sighed. \"He attacked me too, last year at the orphanage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl raised a single eyebrow. \"Did he now?\" Concerned, she asked. \"Are you permitted to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"He was a blackmailing con artist named Michael Cort.\" Serious, I replied. \"Dad scared him good and handed him over to the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled. \"Then it is unlikely you or Miss Child will ever see that man again.\" Kindly, she said. \"I am Melissa Strange, captain of the seventh year prefects. We do what we can to ensure the safety of all students.\" She motioned me to enter. \"Please, Enjoy the sleepover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the hall where I was greeted by another upperclassman girl wearing a prefect badge. \"Bright blessings, Miss Wardwell.\" Smiling, she said. \"I am Melissa Stonehenge, second captain of the prefects.\" She giggled. \"I must tell you that you and a few others have become quite the celebrities among the seventh year boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that. \"I- I'm no one special.\" Timidly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled. \"You have held your own against more pranks than any other first year student in Ravenscroft history.\" Bemused, she said. \"Make no mistake, you are special in more ways than one.\" She sighed before changing the subject. \"Has any boy dared to ask you out to the Mabon Ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, nodding. \"A shy first year named Rio Mage.\" Softly, I said. \"He is quite the gentleman. He even asked dad for permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head. \"Shy but brave.\" Bemused, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that and Melissa left me to enjoy the festivities. I saw several girls there, all talking among themselves around various tables where a wide variety of snacks were being offered. At the most isolated table I saw Nico standing with Rachel and Melissa Strange talking. Nearby was Nico Child talking with Sam Procter. They stopped upon seeing me approach. \"Bright blessings.\" Nervously, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bright blessings.\" Sam replied. \"We were just talking about girl issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and nightmares.\" Shuddering, Nico muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was there when you were attacked.\" Surprising Nico, I said. \"That man attacked me too last year when I was at the orphanage.\" Shuddering, I added, \"I had nightmares for days after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went on to explain who the man was, my own encounter with him and what had happened after dad had pulled him away from Nico and Rachel. This brought a small grin to Nico's face. \"I'm guessing we won't ever be seeing him again.\" Softly, she said. \"That makes me feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been told by the other seventh years here that I've become quite a celebrity among the seventh year boys.\" With a nervous grin, Sam said. \"So far, no boy has dared to ask me to the Mabon Ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" Smiling slightly, Nico said. \"only it's because I managed to hold my own against a notorious seventh year prankster named Tyler Cohan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"It would be ironic if he ends up being the one to ask you to the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico laughed at that. \"It would be ironic, wouldn't it?\" Bemused, she asked. Then her grin turned into a smile. \"It would be more ironic if I'm the one to ask him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed at that. \"I was asked to the ball by a shy first year named Rio Mage.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico smiled and raised a glass. \"To the celebrities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned at that and took up a glass as did Sam. \"To the celebrities.\" We all said, toasting each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we talked, I spotted the nervous first year girl, Winnie Alexander slowly enter the hall for the sleepover.

As such, it was announced that the ball would be held outside, in the spacious courtyard behind Wand and Cauldron Hall. Dad and I were very busy the morning before, preparing everything for the event. Tables and chairs were set up around the courtyard with various small huts prepared past the groves and orchards. I wrinkled my nose at the huts, turning to Dad. \"Are those set up for what I think?\" Softly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled before giving me a nod. \"For the upperclassmen, the Mabon Ball is more of a romantic event.\" Calmly, he replied. \"No underclassmen are permitted to enter the huts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only wince at that. \"Ew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"You will think differently in a few years.\" Bemused, he said. He motioned to various objects we had set up in the past few hours. \"The torches surrounding the courtyard are magickal, used to keep insects and other pests out for the event, so we can enjoy ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it the large tables are for the food, so everyone can help themselves?' curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"The food materializes onto each student's plate upon sitting down to eat.\" Serious, he replied. \"The head chef is a clairvoyant, she knows what everyone is hungry for the moment they sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think i have ever met the head chef.\" Curious, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad blushed slightly. \"Her name is Summer West, a very shy woman in her mid-thirties.\" Softly, he explained. \"She and I, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried not to smile, knowing that Dad had a crush on someone, and decided to change the subject. \"How will the ball start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed, happy that I had changed the subject. \"The boys will enter the courtyard from Wand Hall, while the girls will enter from Cauldron Hall.\" Calmly, he replied. \"They will bow to their chosen partner, and escort each other to their designated spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the marked tables, I noticed a pattern. \"It's like the points on a map.\" Surprised, I said. \"Seventh years to the north, the staff to the south...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" Chuckling, dad said. He motioned to the marked tables. \"The faculty and staff will face the seventh years on either side of the courtyard. The sixth, fifth, and fourth years will be to their right, while the third, second, and first years will be to their left. Each will take turns dancing to various styles of music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard my stomach grumble. \"Which is first, the eating or the dancing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad laughed. \"First is a long and boring speech from the Magister, Daniel Cochrane, and the Magistra, Heather Gardner.\" Bemused, he replied. \"Then comes the meal, and then the dancing, with meals in between each dance, as well as small events, games and contests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crowing the top first year for one.\" smiling, Dad replied. \"You are definitely in the running, having foiled the most prank attempts by the seventh years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, but Dad quickly changed the subject. \"Come on, I'm sure you've built up an appetite helping me all morning.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">I'm an 11-year-old, ready to start school at Ravenscroft Academy. It's a rather exclusive school, more so than most. Not because of racial or financial restrictions, but because it's exclusively for the teaching of witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you've gotta have rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) First person, past tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Don't kill the main character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Sex, if age-appropriate, is fine, but don't go into detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Keep the language PG-13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Pop-culture witches are fictional characters in this story. Don't introduce anybody to Harry Potter, the Halliwell sisters, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a short glossary for the less-familiar words we'll be using:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>athame</b>: A ceremonial dagger, used for drawing <i>magick</i> circles or cutting or carving for sacred purposes. Must be handled with great care; if the athame ever draws blood - even accidentally - it will be useless for magick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Blessed be</b>: A common salutation among witches. May be used as greeting or farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Book of Shadows</b>: The spellbook of a witch or coven, so called because it should be kept hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bright blessings</b>: A variation on <i>Blessed be</i>. Some witches only use one term, and some use one for greeting and the other for farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>cowan</b>: A person who is not a witch. Singular or plural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>magick</b>: This spelling is used to distinguish between witchcraft and stage magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are a couple of characters to get started:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex Weaver was brought up Wiccan, so he's used to his parents not being like others in the neighborhood. On his eleventh birthday, however, he learns that his mother is an actual witch. Moreover, he's a witch, too, and must go to Ravenscroft to learn magick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie Alexander was brought up in an evangelical household, taught that anything to do with witchcraft was the Devil's work. So it's a bit of a shock when it seems that a clerical error has sent her to Ravenscroft. It's a bigger shock, though, when they tell her that she is also a witch.</td>",
