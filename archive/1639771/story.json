            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hello there. My name is Ashley Wilkins and I'm a student at Ruby City all-girl high school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you're reading this interactive story, I take it that you're interested in learning about the strange events that have taken place in Ruby High. But first, I wanna tell you a little bit about myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've lived in Ruby City for my entire life. My father, Robert, works in an office, while my mother, Hayley, stays home all day. I have an 8-year old sister named Emma who attends Ruby City elementary school. I'm currently in the 10th grade in Ruby High. I excel in most of my classes, including literature and gym. I have blonde hair and, well, I'm pretty much you're average teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut my life isn't all average. The best examples that I can give you are the events that have taken place in Ruby High. Strange things have happened to me just in this past year in 10th grade! But I'm not the only one to encounter these problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake, for instance, Chloe Miller, the head of the school's cheerleading squad. During football games at Ruby City all-boy high school, she would lead her team to cheer on the home side. She's one of the most popular seniors in Ruby High, but she is also one of the meanest people that you could ever meet. It is true that she is a very pretty girl, and everyone else in the school would agree, but she does tend to be a Pre-Madonna most of the time. But no one expected what happened to her in the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you'd prefer to hear the story of Kelly Griffin. She's a good friend to me, but she is judged by the rest of our class for being a scene kid, or even a goth, although she does tend to dress over the top most of the time. She can be a little bit shy at times, but once you get to know her, she's one cool chick. But this past year, the strangest things had happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also the story of Anna Whitworth, one of the freshmen in Ruby High. Although I don't like to mention it, the first thing that you'd notice about her is that she is incredibly overweight, considering her young age. And because of her weight, she is constantly picked on in the school, mostly by Chloe Miller. But no one expected what happened to her in the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough stranger things has happened in Ruby High, these four examples are the ones that I could name on the top of my head. But which story do you wish to follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember, this is an interactive story, so feel free to make an addition or two, just as long as you follow the rules in the story description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who's it going to be?</span></div></div>",

Though, you probably don't want to listen to me ramble about the little details, so I'll skip through some of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym class was over that day. I stretched my arms out after I put my school uniform back on, letting off some of the energy gained from the exercises and the dodgeball game. The door out of the locker room was crowded with other girls, so I knew there was no way I could get myself to be one of the first ones out. As such, I chose to stay out of such a cluster. I felt that something was off, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never clicked to me: how did some of the girls get so tall? I could have sworn they were around my height just last week. No, they weren't wearing heels. (I don't think they're allowed, anyways.) It was as if their entire bodies had stretched out a bit. Or was that just me? Perspective is an odd mistress, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stretched my arms again. For some reason, I just needed to let off some energy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt something odd, though. Physically felt it, this time. Did my sleeves get smaller, I wondered. They covered my arms just a minute ago, so why are they down to my wrists now? Also, did my shirt just get a little tighter? And did my shoes suddenly get smaller? Maybe it's just me. Or maybe I just had a sudden growth spurt overnight and I didn't notice until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the bell rang, and my next class was Chemistry.  Oh, what happened next is probably the true start of it all... Like a start to a wild adventure or a terrible tragedy--except I'm here telling you the story, so you already know how it ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you think happened?</span></div></div>",

She just showed off one of her potions she invented (a hair growth formula, although one tiny drop could make you look like cousin Itt from the Addams family) and I was just packing my things up. It was Friday afternoon and that meant resting and getting enough energy to survive another week of school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Wilkins could I talk with you for a second?\" Mrs. Saunders asked me. I hesitated a little of course. \"It's not about your grades though they could be influenced by it.\" Mrs. Saunders added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it about?\" I asked Mrs. Saunders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you might suspect I have been developing another potion lately, one with great potential for mankind. But I need to test it first and since you're one of my brightest students I thought you might would like to try it out.\" Mrs. Saunders explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Mrs. Saunders.\" I told her looking hesitant to become one of her test subjects, not all of her experiments were considered safe and I wouldn't want to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not dangerous if that's what you're thinking about, but I do promise you if you test it your average will be raised.\" Mrs. Saunders said with a coy smile. It wasn't like I had bad grades for chemistry, but a higher average could always be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mrs. Saunders I'll do it.\" I told her with a plastered smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid, now wait here as I'll get the other volunteer.\" Mrs. Saunders said as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came back, she was accompanied by ....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was surprised to see Kelly being accompanied by Ms. Saunders. I knew Kelly had a low mark from her Chemistry test last semester but I didn't think she would be this desperate to get a passing grade. Although the same could be said about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" Kelly said shyly as she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Saunders didn't seem to notice it. \"I already know you two know each other so that will make things easier for both of you. Now I would like the both of you to strip down off your clothes. Ms. Wilkins is taller than you Ms. Griffin and your clothes wouldn't survive the transformation.\" Me and Kelly both looked at each other confused. What did this all mean? We were both wondering what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for a place to change. Well, um.\" Ms. Saunders looked around as there was not a seclusive area to change. \"I suppose I can leave you girls for a few minutes.\" She said as she left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence as Ms. Saunders left and we were both on our own. \"I guess that means we need to change.\" I said nodding to Kelly. Kelly nodded as well and then we were off to undressing ourselves. I first pulled off the white t-shirt I was wearing. \"This is really weird.\" Kelly suddenly said to me. I turned around and saw her pulling her black t-shirt off as well. \"I know right.\" I confirmed as I walked closer to her so we were standing opposite each other. \"What do you think? She's going to turn us into a pair of Incredible Hulks?\" I asked her giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so, I can't wait to be taller and smash some things.\" Kelly said giggling as well. I then pulled off my flats and undid the zipper of my blue skirt and shimmered it down my bum. Kelly moved her feet out of her sneakers and undid the zipper of her jeans and pulled them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of us were standing in our underwear now. I still wore the white bra with flower motif from this morning together with the matching pair of panties. Kelly was wearing a simple black bra with purple panties. Luckily we both had gym classes together so it wasn't really awkward standing like this.Before any of us could say something  Ms. Saunders entered the room again, looking surprised at the both of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you needed to strip off all of your clothes. That means your underwear as well.\" She said in a business tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" I asked her confused. This was taking things really far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's vital.\" Ms. Saunders said. \"Come on now, or should I let your grades stay as they are?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Kelly said nervous. Clearly she really, really wanted to improve her grades. We both pulled off our bra's and panties and lay them away. I couldn't help but admire Kelly's figure though. While I was taller, Kelly had a much thinner physique. Her breasts weren't as big as mine, but she did have a nice skinny waste. Same with her butt, mine was a little bigger while hers was smaller. Kelly caught me staring at her and me staring at her and we both grinned at what we were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I both need you to drink the contents of these vials. Except I need to do one thing first.\" Ms. Saunders said and with a pull she pulled down my hair band and grabbed a few of my hairs. She then pulled off some of Kelly's hairs as well. She then turned around and did something to those vials. Ms. Saunders than handed us each a vial. \"Now you both drink from it in one gulp. Understand?\" She said as we both nodded. Kelly and me both looked at each other and at three we both drank down the entire content of the vial given to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me tell you, I still remember clearly what happened next. It's something you never forget for the rest of your life. At first I thought I had drunk a vial of water, there was no taste to it and it didn't taste dangerous. But then something happened to me. I fell down to the ground as I had the worst of menstrual cramps. My insides were hurt as something was turning and twisting them. I couldn't see clearly anymore as my vision was half fading away. The changes though were going to get started . As I looked at my hands I slowly saw them shrinking, yeah shrinking. Becoming smaller than before as I felt the bones in my hands shrinking and changing. Next my arms slowly shrunk as well, as I lye lower to the ground than before. Then the same thing happened with both my feet and my legs, they shrunk and the bones inside them changed. But then the worst pain had to come yet; suddenly I felt the hugest of cramps coming from my tummy. I tried to look up to Ms. Saunders, to ask her what was going on, but the pain made me lower my head as I awaited the next change to happen. And that were my breasts; hoping that they would be spared, instead I felt them hurting as something happened to them. I only remembered feeling them less than before. Then my vagina changed as well as I could feel something different about it. At last my head was about to change. I felt as my skull suddenly shrunk down, together with my nose, mouth and ears. My eyes suddenly were trembling and before I knew it I could see well enough again. As I was still recovering a glow went through my hair, like someone burned every hair on my skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the pain stopped all of a sudden. Just like that. One moment I was lingering in pain and the next moment I was just lying on the ground feeling nothing. Except for the slight draft coming from underneath the door. When I looked up to Ms. Saunders she looked happy as she was frantically writing notes. \"What happened?\" I asked her confused. My voice sounded different as well. Ms. Saunders simply pointed at the other side. And as I looked I was shocked as opposite me was a person lying looking the same as me. She looked at me with fear in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley?\" The girl asked and then I realized what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly?\" I asked her in shock. Looking down on my body I saw I was clearly not myself anymore. I had switched bodies with one of my best friends. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"OMG.\" I said looking at my former body walking closer towards it. Kelly came closer as well as confused as I was. We just stared at each other until I began to laugh, it was all out of nothing. There was nothing to laugh about of course; I was being inside the body of one of my best friends, but the weirdness of the situation made me laugh. Then all of a sudden Kelly had to laugh as well; I was surprised to hear my own body laugh but it was great. This was really an amazing and weird experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ms. Saunders came between us having to smile as well. \"I'm glad you girls think this is something to be laughing about. Now I just want to do some small tests on you to see how good this transformation worked on you.\" Kelly and I agreed to them; we first had to walk on a treadmill; which is usually boring but weird when being inside another person's body. As Ms. Saunders pointed out we still held onto our own mannerisms. While Kelly slouched a bit; I was standing up straight as an arrow. Even walking was still the same for us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ms. Saunders asked us questions about the other person's life. While I knew Kelly, a lot of questions I couldn't answer all of them. I mean, who would remembered with which leg they leave their bed? Luckily for me Kelly didn't know the answer to that question either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all tests were done, Ms. Saunders sat behind her desk looking through the results. \"I'm glad with the results though a little disappointed I have to admit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" I asked her curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you both seem to have taken on each other's body. Your fingerprints, DNA, even your hair is identical to the person you turned into. But things like memory and manners are still the same. I can't figure out why that remains.\" Ms. Saunders scratched her hair as to figure out an answer to that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that bad?\" Kelly hoped it didn't affect her mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it isn't. Though I would like to find out. So that's why I want you girls to ask to stay as you are.\" Ms. Saunders asked us both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean for me to stay as Kelly and her as me?\" I asked Ms. Saunders to which she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I want to figure out what is causing this. And besides even if I wanted to, I can't change you back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" I asked her as I was afraid I would remain stuck as my best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The potion. I have to made another batch of it. I wasn't sure that it would work so I didn't expect the need to make it. So that means you will have to stay this way for a while. Oh, and I have to ask you not to tell what exactly happened here. We can't let this leak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying we have to pretend to be each other?\" I asked her to be certain. She nodded her head. I looked at Kelly and rolled my eyes. Somehow things turn out like this always with Ms. Saunders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelly and me needed to dress up Ms. Saunders left the room again to get some coffee and to get some ideas. While it was weird undressing with one of your friends in the same room, it's even weirder to get dressed up as her. I took Kelly's underwear and put it on as my own. It felt strange to wear it; not to mention the size. Kelly's bra didn't  need to hold as much weight as my own did. It felt actually pretty good to have less in the front. I then put on the black shirt and her jeans. Kelly however had to wear my shirt with skirt. The last thing not something she wore often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I hate this already.\" Kelly complained as she turned around to face me. \"I feel so naked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not, you look beautiful.\" I said as I complimented her. \"Besides you have the legs to show it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, don't I?\" Kelly said positively surprised as she looked at her legs. I had to admit the skirt suited my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that I put on Kelly sneakers and she put on her sneakers and pulled her hair in a loose ponytail. I usually would pull it all in, but since it was Kelly's body for now, I decided not to say anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" Ms. Saunders said as she stepped inside the room. \"Just like you entered the room. Now off you go. I'll call you when I know more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that announcement we were standing outside the room. It was very awkward for a moment as we didn't know what to say to each other. \"So.\" I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Kelly said awkwardly as she began to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're going to have  to pretend to be each other. Piece of cake right?\" I asked her cheerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. I mean who would believe us anyway if we were to tell the truth?\" She said looking in the windows at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody and that sucks.\" I said as I stretched my arms. We were leaving the school and now we stood outside of the school. The sun was going down. Kelly and me each had to go another way to reach our homes. Luckily we both knew the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were standing there uncomfortable when Kelly spoke up: \"I guess we need to go. You take care of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same with you. Keep it safe alright?\" I told her as I embraced her in a hug. It was weird hugging Kelly like this, she usually was the taller one and she didn't smell like roses like I usually did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was weird to think I would be going home, but not my real home. Kelly's home where I had to pretend to be her. It was not something I was happy about. I'd rather go to my own home where I could be myself. Instead I would have to pretend to be Kelly in front of her parents. Luckily I knew here so it wouldn't be that hard to pull off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to Kelly's home looking around once in a while to be sure I was going the right way. It was a while ago when I was there the last time. Not to mention things looked different. I mean I did shrunk a little and things that look so obvious did look different when you're looking at it from a different angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when I arrived home it was dinner time already. I tried opening the front door but it was locked. Luckily I knew where Kelly's parents kept the key. I grabbed it from it's secret compartment and opened the door and stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" I asked to be sure I was the only one at home. Nobody answered. That was right. Kelly only lived with her mother, a very nice woman who worked very hard and was almost never home. I walked into the kitchen and saw some food on the counter with a note on it. The note was from Kelly's mother who was late and told Kelly to have dinner without her. It was lasagna to be warmed in the microwave. The instructions were clear. I put the food inside the microwave and got it out though I almost burned my fingers. I grabbed a knife and fork and began eating slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around the quiet place. It was eerily quiet. I was used to coming home and my parents would be around talking and joking with me and my sister. It was so depressing to be here. Perhaps that was a reason Kelly became a girl like that. I thought to ask her when the time came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was finished eating I did the dishes and hurried upstairs. There I found Kelly's room. It was just like I remembered from last time. The walls were painted dark pink (she told me once her mother wouldn't let them paint black so this came as close as she wanted), there were paper bats hanging from the ceiling and there was a poster of a heavy metal band Kelly liked. I didn't like the band at all, the lead singer looked very intimidating. I decided not to look at the poster too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock I saw it was still too early to call Kelly, dinner was usually still going. I decided to get to do her homework. It only took me longer than usually and the reason for it was my handwriting. I still had my usual handwriting which was way different than Kelly's. Since we needed to pretend to be each other I looked at some of Kelly's old homework and tried to copy her handwriting. The result was something of a mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was finally finished I lied down on Kelly's bed and decided to call Kelly. The phone rang for a couple of seconds before she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" She said sounding happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how is it going?\" I asked her. I was dying to know if she was able to pretend to be me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...so so. Your parents thought I was a bit quiet, so I told them I wasn't feeling so well.\" Kelly answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did they believe it?\" I asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. I mean, they did think I slouched way more.\" Kelly answered. \"So how is it at my home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I mean your mom is working late so I haven't seen her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" She sounded disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then talked a little more about our lives and then it was time to go to bed. I wished Kelly a good night and she me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stripped out of my clothes and put on the long shirt Kelly usually wore to bed. I didn't hear Kelly's mother coming in, so I guessed that she would make it late. I shut my eyes and tried to go to sleep even going as far as lying on my stomach which I usually avoided. I don't know how long I twisted and turned but finally I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo do you think my brain would get affected by the potion and make me more like Kelly?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was surprised to see Jasmine being accompanied by Ms. Saunders. I knew Jasmine only from my biology class. We talked a few times and she seemed nice. We didn't hang around that often as she was practicing most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Jasmine said a bit awkward as she was let inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Saunders didn't seem to notice it. \"The two of you are somewhat familiar with each other so that will make things easier for both of you. Now I would like the both of you to strip down off your clothes. Ms. Smith is shorter, so that will affect clothes.\" Me and Jasmine both looked at each other confused. What did this all mean? We were both wondering what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for a place to change. Well, um...\" Ms. Saunders looked around as there was not a seclusive area to change. \"I suppose I can leave you girls for a few minutes. I need to have some coffee. \" She said as she left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence as Ms. Saunders left and we were both on our own. \"I guess that means we need to change.\" I said nodding to Jasmine. Jasmine nodded as well and then we were off to undressing ourselves. I first pulled off the white tank top I was wearing. \"I didn't expect this.\" Jasmine suddenly talked to me. I turned around and saw her pulling her black vest off. \"I know right.\" I confirmed as I walked closer to her so we were standing opposite each other. \"What do you think? She's going to turn us pink?\" I asked her giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? I wouldn't mind. Perhaps the competition would all trip looking like that.\" Jasmine said giggling as well. I then pulled off my sandals and undid the zipper of my black skirt and shimmered it down my bum. Jasmine moved her feet out of her running shoes and moved out of her sweats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of us were standing in our underwear now. I still wore the green bra from this morning together with the matching pair of panties. Jasmine was wearing a simple black sports bra with black panties. We never saw each other like this before, so it was kind of awkward where to look.Before any of us could say something Ms. Saunders entered the room again, looking surprised at the both of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you needed to strip off all of your clothes. That means your underwear as well.\" She said in a business tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" I asked her confused. This was taking things really far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's vital.\" Ms. Saunders said. \"Come on now, or should I let your grades stay as they are?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's get this over with.\" Jasmine agreed. Clearly she really wanted to improve her grades. We both pulled off our bra's and panties and lay them away. I couldn't help but admire Jasmine's figure though. We were the same height, but Jasmine was clearly the fittest of us two. Her stomach didn't have any fat, like mine. Her breasts were bigger than my own, about two cups I wagered. I caught Jasmine looking at my breasts. She kept staring at them and felt a bit shy as she looked at them. Luckily Jasmine caught my stare and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I both need you to drink the contents of these vials. Except I need to do one thing first.\" Ms. Saunders said and with a pull she removed my hair band and grabbed a hair from each of us.  Ms. Saunders turned around and did something to those vials. She handed us each a vial. \"Now you both drink from it in one gulp. Understand?\" She said as we both nodded. Jasmine and me both looked at each other and at three we both drank down the entire content of the vial given to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were standing there still as we waited for something to happen. I was still looking in front of me when suddenly Jasmine pointed at my feet. \"Y-Your feet girl.\" I looked down and saw to my surprise they were changing. The skin on my feet suddenly darkened without me knowing how. \"What's happening to them?\" I asked as I tried to rub away the darkness. But nothing happened. I looked at Jasmine and then something caught my eye. \"Jasmine. Look.\" I pointed out at her own feet which were changing as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is this?\" Get this off?\" Jasmine sat down as well as she tried to rub the patches of lighter skin away. Something about the skin seemed familiar. I then noticed something as well. Jasmine had pink nail polish on her feet. The same product I always used. I then looked at my toes and saw to my surprise it was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to switch bodies?\" I asked Ms. Saunders who was observing. She simply nodded and went back to making notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this immediately, I...ugh.\" Jasmine said as she wanted to stand up but couldn't. The reason for it was that the bones in her feet were changing size. They became smaller. I looked at mine and felt how my feet became bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the next area were the legs. Mine were long and skinny while Jasmine's were short but more muscled. I moved over to Jasmine so we could help each other if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, if I knew this, I wouldn't have done this.\" Jasmine said a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" I agreed with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin on my legs turned black as well. Then I felt how the bones in my legs shrunk as to match Jasmine's and muscles began appearing. My legs felt stronger somehow. Looking at Jasmine she looked rather weird. Her lower halve was now white while her upper body was still black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh.\" I said looking at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is funny.\" She said looking at herself. \"Look at you.\" She said pointing to me. The reverse was for me. My legs were black but my upper body was still white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is funny right. Oh no. The next part.\" Jasmine said as she felt her hips shrinking. Mine were expanded. I then felt something happening to my ass. Looking over at Jasmine's hers shrank down to fit her or rather my body. Mine became larger and more jiggly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted an ass boys would look at.\" I said pointing at my larger ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you will get more things boys like. What the?\" Jasmine said as she looked at her vagina. Her hand was blocking my view, but I knew what happened as I felt the same with mine. I felt mine started to shrink and positions itself. A glowing feeling went through it and I felt a bit flustered. Not something you want to feel when you're in a position like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach changed color as well and felt it tightening, like someone was pushing it back. Touching it, I felt the muscles Jasmine had. Jasmine looked depressed as she felt my stomach, not as trained as hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling then continued to our breasts. I felt how my breasts began to grow all of a sudden, my nipples changing color and felt them expanding. Jasmine looked rather happy with my breasts, perhaps she didn't like the size of her own breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen our arms and hands changed. Jasmine's became long and elegant, while mine became short and chubby. And as last our heads. I felt how my lips became thicker, my eyes flickering for a second to change color and much more. I only wanted it to stop. Then when I felt my hair receding into my skull while turning black I knew it was the last part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then looked up and stared at my own body watching from the other side. It was not a mirror sadly, but the owner of my former body was now Jasmine Smith. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surprised I was to see Connie being accompanied by Ms. Saunders. Connie was the school librarian.  Most people think of librarians as stuck up people, you know, the ones that think their books are the most important things in life and if you don't you can leave the librarian and never come back. Not Connie though, she's actually cool. I hanged out with her several times when I needed help on a paper I was writing. We got along pretty well. She's a cheerful woman and although she's still looking for Mr.Right she still keeps an eye out for her favorite students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ashely.\" Connie said with a fake smile and rolling eyes as Ms. Saunders had her arm on Connie's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Saunders didn't seem to notice the gesture. \"I heard from Connie that you two know each other so that will make things easier for both of you. Now I would like the both of you to strip down off your clothes. Ms. Wilkins is taller than you Connie and your clothes wouldn't survive the transformation.\" Me and Connie both looked at each other confused. What did she mean by that our clothes wouldn't survive the transformation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for a place to change out of your clothes. Well, um...\" Ms. Saunders looked around as the classroom was not a reclusive area to change. \"I suppose I can leave you girls for a few minutes while I get myself a cup of coffee.\" She said as she left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence as Ms. Saunders left and we were both on our own. \"I guess that means we need to change.\" I said nodding to Connie. \"I think so too, I really don't want to get on her mad side.\" Connie said as she walked over to the door and stood on her toes as she looked out of the window. \"She once gave me a love potion to try out and the next thing I know I was surrounded by dogs.\" I giggled to the story, that was so like Ms. Saunders. With the uncomfortable silence gone we were off to undressing ourselves. I first pulled off the black tank top I was wearing. \"This is really weird.\" Connie suddenly said to me. I turned around and saw her undoing the buttons of her red blouse. \"I know right.\" I confirmed as I walked closer to her so we were standing opposite each other. \"What do you think she's up to with us? Is she going to make you drink a growth potion and me a shrink potion.\" I asked her as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so, I can't wait to be taller and finally reach the back of my cupboard for once.\" Kelly said giggling as well. I then pulled off my sneakers and undid the zipper of my short shorts and shimmered it down my bum. Connie moved her feet out of her high heels and undid the zipper of her skirt before pulling it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of us were standing in our underwear now. I still wore the pink and black polka dot from this morning together with the matching pair of panties. Connie was wearing a black frilly bra with the matching panties. Seeing each other like this was a bit awkward. Connie was to say something when Ms. Saunders entered the room again, looking surprised at the both of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you needed to strip off all of your clothes. That means your underwear as well.\" She said in a business tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" I asked her confused. This was taking things really far. She expected me to strip in front of my teacher and the librarian?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's vital.\" Ms. Saunders said in a no-nonsense manner. \"Come on now, or should I let your grades stay as they are?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" I said nervous. It wasn't that I wasn't proud of my figure, but the thought that outsiders would see me like this put me a bit off. Connie and me both pulled off our bra's and panties and lay them away. When we were finished I couldn't help but stare at Connie's figure. While I was taller and slimmer, Connie had a much curvier figure. Her breasts were the size of half a melon, though they were a bit saggy as expected from her age. Connie wasn't fat, but she did have a little pooch. Connie caught me staring at her and suddenly turned around and gave her jiggle ass a playful slap. \"Now you've seen everything.\" She said laughing at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I both need you to drink the contents of these vials. Except I need to do one thing first.\" Ms. Saunders said and with a pull she pulled down my hair band and grabbed a few of my hairs while with Connie she pulled of the glasses Connie wore and pulled off a few hairs as well. She then turned around and did something to those vials. Ms. Saunders than handed us each a vial. \"Now you both drink from it in one gulp. Understand?\" She said as we both nodded. Connie and me both looked at each other and at three we both drank down the entire content of the vial given to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me tell you, I still remember clearly what happened next. It's a feeling that I would remember for the rest of my life. At first I thought I drunk a vial of water, there was no taste to it. But then something happened to me. I fell down to the ground as I had the worst of menstrual cramps. My insides were hurt as if someone or something was turning and twisting them inside. I couldn't see clear anymore as my vision was fading away. The outside changes though were only beginning. As I looked at my hands I slowly felt them changing. Yes, you think me mad but I clearly felt the bones in my hands shrinking and changing as my fingers began to swell up. Next my arms slowly shrunk as well, my upper arms though felt like they were getting bigger. Then I felt the bones in my legs and feet changing as well, they shrunk and I felt my upper thighs somewhat getting fatter. But then the worst pain had to come; suddenly I felt the hugest of cramps coming from my tummy. I tried to look up to Ms. Saunders, to ask her for help, to stop this painful experiment, but the pain made me lower my head as I awaited the next change to happen. And that were my breasts; hoping that they would be spared, instead I felt them hurting as something happened to them. I only remembered feeling that someone pulled them as to make them larger. Then my vagina changed as well as I could feel something different about it. At last my head was about to change. I felt as my skull suddenly was pulled on from both sides to make it bigger. My mouth, my nose and my ears suddenly were changing as well. My eyes suddenly were trembling and before I knew it my vision was off, like I couldn't see things in the distance anymore. As I thought it was finally over, I felt the last change coming over me. My long blond hair was reducing in size, it felt like someone had drilled holes in my head and tried to push my hair inside but with a lot of resistance. I just prayed it was all over soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the pain stopped all of a sudden. Just like that. One moment I was lingering in pain and the next moment I was just lying on the ground feeling nothing. Except for the slight draft coming from underneath the door. When I looked up to Ms. Saunders who was a bit blurry, she looked happy as she was frantically writing notes. \"What happened?\" I asked her confused. My voice sounded different as well. Ms. Saunders simply pointed at the other side. And as I looked I was shocked as opposite me was a person lying looking the same as me. She looked at me with confusion in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley?\" The girl asked and then I realized what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connie?\" I asked her in shock. Looking down on my body I saw I was clearly not myself anymore. I had switched bodies with the librarian. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"OMG.\" I said looking at my former body walking closer towards it. Connie came forward as well as confused as I was. We just stared at each other until I began to laugh, it was all out of nothing. There was nothing to laugh about of course; I was inside the body of a librarian, but the weirdness of the situation made me laugh. Then all of a sudden Connie had to laugh as well; I was surprised to hear my own body laugh but it was great. This was really an amazing and weird experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ms. Saunders came between us having to smile as well. \"I'm glad you girls think this is something to be laughing about. Now I just want to do some small tests on you to see how good this transformation worked on you.\" Connie and I agreed to them; we first had to walk on a treadmill; which is usually boring but weird when being inside another person's body. As Ms. Saunders pointed out we still held onto our own mannerisms. While Connie was walking she had the notion to wiggle with her hips, a thing she usually did ; when I walked I just held on to my normal walk routine as well. That aspect of our bodies didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ms. Saunders asked us questions about the other person's life. While I knew Connie a little bit, most questions I couldn't answer. We never talked about her favorite color.  Luckily for me Connie didn't know the answer to that question either so I didn't feel left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all tests were done, Ms. Saunders sat behind her desk looking through the results. \"I'm glad with the results though a little disappointed I have to admit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" I asked her curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you both seem to have taken on each other's body. Your fingerprints, DNA, even your hair is identical to the person you turned into. But things like memory and mannerism are still the same. I can't figure out why that remains intact.\" Ms. Saunders scratched her hair as if that would give her the answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it's just something that takes time?\" Connie suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you're right Connie. Though I would like to find out. So that's why I want you girls to ask to stay as you are.\" Ms. Saunders asked us both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean for me to stay as Connie and her as me?\" I asked Ms. Saunders to which she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I want to figure out what is causing this. And besides even if I wanted to, I can't change you back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" I asked her as I was afraid I would remain stuck as a librarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The potion. I have to made another batch of it. I wasn't sure that it would work so I didn't expect the need to make it. So that means you will have to stay this way for a while. Oh, and I have to ask you not to tell what exactly happened here. We can't let this leak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying we have to pretend to be each other?\" I asked her to be certain. She nodded her head. I looked at Connie and rolled my eyes. Somehow things turn out like this always with Ms. Saunders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Connie and me needed to dress up Ms. Saunders left the room again to get some coffee and to get some ideas. While it was weird undressing with someone that you hardly knew, it's even weirder to get dressed up as her. I took Connie's underwear and put it on as my own. It felt wrong to wear it; when I held it in my hands I could not help but think that I was playing dress up like I was a kid. The sizes of Connie's panties and bra were not comparable to my own. Putting on Connie's panties I felt my jiggly ass and putting on her bra was even more of a challenge.  Luckily Connie was around to show me how to do it easier and faster. Something only large endowed women know, but smaller build girls like don't. When I had the bra put on I felt the relieve of my breast not pulling me down.  I then put on the red blouse and skirt, something I wore only on formal occasions which weren't a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,somebody wake me up.\" I complained as I turned around to face me. Connie was already dressed in my tank top and short shorts which looked way more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't complain, you look beautiful.\" Connie said as she complimented me. \"Besides you have the ass and tits to show it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, don't I? I said as I looked back and gave my ass a little slap like Connie did before. We both laughed at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that I put on Connie's high heels and glasses. The glasses were for things far away mostly. Connie put on my sneakers and let my hair loose. I usually would pull it in a ponytail, but since it was Connie's body for now, I decided not to say anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" Ms. Saunders said as she stepped inside the room. \"Just like you entered the room. Now off you go. I'll call you when I know more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that announcement we were standing outside the room. It was very awkward for a moment as we didn't know what to say to each other. \"So.\" I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now it begins.\" Connie said as she walked next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're going to have to pretend to be each other. It's going to be weird. \" I concluded as I tried not to make too many steps with my high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. But look at the bright sight, it's something nobody has done before.\" She said looking in the windows at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody and that sucks.\" I said as I stretched my arms. We were leaving the school and now we stood outside of the school. The sun was going down. Connie and me each had to go another way to reach our homes. Connie usually took the bus to her work so I had to wait for that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were standing there uncomfortable when Connie spoke up: \"Listen, we both don't know each other as well as we're supposed to, to let this whole body swap thing work. We need to go through some things before we can say goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" I said relieved that I didn't have to end up alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did we agree to talk over some more?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I didn't expected to see Ms. Tory Miller coming through the door with Mrs. Saunders. She was new to the school and probably didn't know the reputation of Mrs. Saunders as a mad scientist. But she was very sweet as well, trying her best to teach us about history with another approach. Usually when we began learning about a new time period Ms. Miller would tell us about it in great detail, showing us images of what people were wearing, greatest monuments of that period. We usually had to write an essay at the end, but she wasn't that strict. She even wanted us to call her Tory, but most of us didn't dare in case the principal heard about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ashley.\" Ms. Miller said with a nervous tone in her voice as Mrs. Saunders pushed her inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard from Tory that you two know each other so that will make things easier for both of you. Now I would like the both of you to strip down off your clothes. Ms. Wilkins is skinnier than you Tory, so her clothes wouldn't make it through the transformation.\" Me and Ms. Miller both looked at each other in confusion. What did she mean by that my clothes wouldn't survive the transformation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for a place to change out of your clothes. Well, um...\" The classroom didn't leave a lot of room for privacy. There were only desks and in the back there was the usual emergency shower (with no curtains) and closets full of dangerous chemicals. \"I suppose I can leave you girls for a few minutes while I get myself a cup of coffee.\" Mrs. Saunders shrugged her shoulders as she left the room in search for her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mrs. Saunders closed the door behind her there was an uncomfortable silence surrounding us as we both didn't know what to do or say. \"Well, we better get to it. Or else she will get mad at us.\" Ms. Miller said looking out the window. Nobody visited the science department because of Ms. Saunders and her bizarre experiments so most teachers and students avoided this section. I nodded to the suggestion and prepared myself mentally not to look at Ms. Miller. When I pulled off my green tank top, Ms. Miller suddenly asked: \"Are these experiments normal?\" I looked up to her and saw she had just undone the first few buttons of her blue blouse, revealing her pale skin. \"It's pretty normal around here, but for us to help her with them, not so.\" I said trying not to look as I concentrated on pulling off the tight jeans. \"It would be cool if something worked, right? We would be part of history. Our names remembered forever. Ashley Wilkins and Tory Miller helping Diana Saunders pull off amazing experiment.\" Hearing her talk like that I couldn't help but grin. It was just like class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be amazing and we would get asked on all these television shows and magazines.\" I fantasized with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine it already, though I hope I will have lost some weight by then.\" She ended her sentence with a sigh that sounded like she was helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I would too.\" I agreed with her. Last week I had gym class with Chloe Miller, the head cheerleader. When we were changing in the locker room I saw what was the perfect size stomach. It was so tight, you could play a round of shuffle board on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, you're not serious about that. Just look at me.\" Ms. Miller replied and as I turned around I was a bit surprised. She wasn't exactly thin, but looking at her like that I seriously disagreed with her. Her belly was slightly hanging over, but nothing serious. My mom would describe her having a pear figure. Her hips were larger than her shoulders, which made her ass and thighs seem larger in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Miller, you're not serious.You are not fat.\" I said earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, I told you, you can call me Tory.\" And she added: \"The principal can't hear us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Mrs. Saunders entered the room again looking confused at us.\"I said you needed to strip off all of your clothes. That means your underwear as well.\" She said in a business tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" I shrieked. This was taking things too far. She expected me to strip in front of both my teachers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's vital.\" Mrs. Saunders said in a no-nonsense manner. \"Come on now, or should I let your grades stay as they are?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine.\" I answered nervous. Me and Ms. Miller or should I say Tory from now on, had already seen the other in underwear. Why not go naked all the way? Me and Tory pulled off our underwear and guarded our private zones with our hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, now I both need you to drink the contents of these vials. Except I need to do one thing first.\" Mrs. Saunders said and pulled a few of my hairs then walked to Tory, pulled off her scrunchie and pulled off a few hairs as well. She then turned around and did something to those vials. Ms. Saunders than handed us each a vial. \"Now you both drink from it in one gulp. Understand?\" She said as we both nodded. Tory and me both looked nervously at each other and at three we both drank down the entire content of the vial given to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first nothing happened. Tory and I were just staring at each other when I suddenly felt a cramp coming from my stomach. At that same moment Tory experienced the same. We both fell to the ground. I remembered looking up to Mrs. Saunders trying to ask for help, but she was just holding up her notebook making notes of our situation. This was all part of it. My whole body changed starting from my feet. The pain was so terrible I didn't noticed my skin there started to get paler, what I did feel was how the bones in my feet became smaller which resulted in a lot of pain I barely held in. My feet became tinier. The pain then grew to my legs and as I lied on the ground with my arms I could feel my feet coming towards me. Then when it reached my thighs I suddenly felt my skin stretching itself. It then hit me, I wasn't going to transform into something, but into someone, Tory. I looked up and as I did I saw Tory doing the same thing. We both knew what was going to happen now. The next thing was really bizarre as I felt my vagina changing. Tory and me both were embarrassed by the feeling and sensations because of it, we quickly looked down again. I then felt my hips became larger than they were; my tummy which I wasn't proud of before, stretched itself and my ass inflated itself. I looked down under and saw the changes happening to me. The only thing going through my mind was that guys were gonna love this ass. It was the only positive thing to this transformation, I had to think positive. Then my breasts expanded themselves more and slightly sagging. The changes happening to my nipples made me feel as flustered as before. My arms then changed as well, my skinny arms were now bulkier and my hands slightly thicker. The nail polish I applied this weekend disappeared. And then the biggest transformation. I felt how my head was being twisted and changed. A small double chin, brown colored eyes instead of blue, my nose becoming larger. At last the strands of hair changed from blond to brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the pain stopped all of a sudden. It was done. Finally over. I promised myself never do something stupid like this again. I looked up to Mrs. Saunders who was still writing notes. \"Is it done?\" I asked her noticing the lower tone in my voice. Mrs. Saunders nodded as she continued writing. I then looked forward and saw Tory who had become me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley?\" The girl asked noticing her higher voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I nodded. We had done it. I had swapped with my history teacher.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This story all began in gym class or rather the end of the class. We had our usually standard run done by Oakdale which meant an extremely long run which made the whole class sweating as otters. I always noticed Ms. Oakdale's piercing gaze with that smile on her mouth, like she enjoyed having us run the extra mile just to wear us out. I hoped when I had kids of mine own they wouldn't have such a rotten gym teacher as we did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as we were all sweaty the whole class decided to take showers. A few hours earlier we heard that Mrs. Saunders class was canceled (something about an explosion in the chemistry lab) so we didn't have any classes after gym. Since we were with too many girl to use the shower I volunteered to wait. I was looking at my phone, my legs crossed when I noticed Lena looking at me. Lena was a typical goth girl, dyed long black hair, heavy eye shadow, pale skin and lips covered with black lipstick. Lena was...nice. Okay, I wasn't sure what Lena was. She wasn't the type of girl that you would talk to, having an aura that told you not to speak with her if you didn't need to. But the few moments I talked with her she was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was busy on my phone however I felt rather disturbed by Lena's gaze. I felt like Lena was looking at me like some sort of prey. She looked at me from top to toe and I didn't feel comfortable being stared at like that. So I decided to do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you Lena?\" I asked her politely even though I felt shiver going through me as I saw Lena smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you can.\" Lena replied standing up and walking over to the bench where I was sitting and sitting down next to me. It felt rather weird having this girl sitting next to me, not to mention gross. Lena smelled of junk food and it really reeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I.\" Lena stammered as she usually did with people she was not familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not feeling well? Do you need me to call someone?\" I asked her concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.\" She grabbed my wrist as I wanted to stand up. \"I need your help with some thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I asked her as I looked into her eyes which made her startle more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Could you be me?\" Lena asked after which she saw the reaction in my eyes. \"It-it's not what you think, but I need someone who is more feminine than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other girls were finished showering and getting dressed and changed Lena told me about her childhood. Her mother was a Russian waitress and her father was in jail. The kids in her neighborhood didn't want to play with her and so she was left to herself while being bullied at the same time. That's when she discovered the goth subculture; she met friends there who liked her for who she is. But still she wanted that people on Ruby High would accept her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so me and my friends we found this spell, it allows the user to leave her body and take over the bodies of others. Since the guys know what I want, they allowed me to use the spell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you want me to take over your body? I still don't see how I can help you.\" I told her concerned while looking around. The showers were deserted as everyone was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can take over my body and just be you in me, I know that people will accept me. You're really popular and nice so that's why I thought of you.\" Lena says standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena, I don't know what to say.\" I said still having doubts of this plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I will do anything for you.\" Lena said bowing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything.\" Lena answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it. It felt good to be able to help Lena to become more popular. It was a challenge but one I really liked to try out on. But there was just one thing I was not sure about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I take over your body, what will happen to it then?\" I asked Lena to which she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will run on an automatic pilot, it will just talk and act like you, except when....\" Lena didn't finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except when what?\" I asked Lena at which she looked embarrassingly to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, it's possible for the one that is going to possess, that's you, to put the one she is going to possess, that's me, into her own body.\" Lena mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it's only if you want to. I mean, I understand if you don't trust me with your body. If you just take over my body, I will be in a sleep-like state. I won't remember anything of what you do while me.\" Lena explained. \"So you want to do this?\" She asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I will do it, but you know I might make some changes that you won't like. You can't complain to me afterwards then.\" I told Lena to which she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, I won't, thank you.\" Lena said relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I take over your body?\" I asked Lena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena walked back to her locker and opened it. When she returned she got hold of an old parchment. \"This is the spell. You just need to say the words on it out loud. If all goes well, you should be a ghost then.\" I nodded to Lena who sat on the opposite bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened up the parchment. It was old and musty smelling. The spell though it was different than I imagined. The letters were all written in red blood. I spoke out the first few letters and somehow the rest of the words slipped out of my mouth as I read it. Then when I said the last word, I felt a tingling going through my body. It felt like I was being on fire. Without thinking I stood up. As I did I slowly felt the warmness ebbing away. Looking down at myself I saw myself naked though I could see through my body. Looking back I saw my body still sitting there, dressed in the black tank top and yoga pants. On the other side Lena was sitting there shivering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also needed to make a choice now; should I let Lena take over my body? Or should I just take over her body?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wasn't sure what I was thinking at the moment. I think I felt pity for Lena. After all she always had been the outsider girl. She wasn't used to being accepted by the other girls; she was always considered the weirdo in the class and didn't talk to anyone. I wanted Lena to feel how it was being accepted by others. And besides if I took over her body and succeeded in making her popular then what? She would take over her own body again and I would return to mine. But she would never know how to improve herself on her own. That would undo all the work I would do for her. So it wasn't an option for me not to let her take over for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to Lena who was shivering even harder than before. Not sure how to pull her spirit out, I grabbed her hand and felt something slimy. I pulled it out and with it came Lena's spirit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did came for me.\" Lena stammered as she looked at her spirit version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did. How else will you know how to be popular?\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you.\" All of a sudden Lena grabbed me by my back and gave me a hug. I wasn't sure how to react, but I slowly reached for her back and patted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Lena, this will work fine.\" I told Lena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I know it will.\" Lena replied sounding relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get to your body then, don't want it to run for you on it's own.\" Lena replied. She let go off me and stood in front of my body.Then she lowered herself in my body. Immediately her spirit fused with my body. I then took a step forward to Lena's body. Repeating what Lena just did, I turned myself around and lowered myself in Lena's body. I felt how my spirit was attaching itself to her body. Then everything turned black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ashley, are you alright?\" I suddenly heard a voice calling out to me. I opened my eyes and got the shock of my life as I saw my own body looking over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena, is that you?\" I asked concerned. I saw my body nodding it's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked, we really switched bodies.\" Lena screamed as she jumped up and down. She grabbed my hands and forced me to jump up and down as well. I felt so many things: confusion, excitement and Lena's larger breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right, this is really awesome.\" I told Lena who looked excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is, I really should let the guys know.\" Lena said as she walked over to her locker and grabbing her phone. \"Oh, I guess this is your phone now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can send the message silly, after all they are your friends.\" I told Lena. Lena nodded and I saw how my former fingers put down a message for Lena's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I know they will be really glad for me.\" Lena told me as she put the phone back in her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now?\" Lena asked with pleading eyes. \"Should we go to my house or yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think first we need a shower.\" I told Lena. \"I don't know about you, but I worked up a pretty good sweat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,\" Lena said hesitating, \"I don't shower here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's a good thing for socializing with other girls. We all share something in common here, after all who doesn't hate Ms. Oakdale's workout?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so, but I don't know what to say.\" Lena said looking depressed. I never noticed my face could show that off. This was really weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we can practice.\" I told Lena as I began pulling the shirt that I was wearing over my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you doing?\" She asked pulling her shirt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showering. We both need it. Come on Lena, work with me. You told me you would do anything for me. So this is one of the things you will do for me. Hurry up and get out of those clothes.\" I told Lena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena nodded shyly and began stripping off her clothes. I then turned my attention to mine. Lena was only wearing a white t-shirt and some sweat pants as her work out clothes. Another note I made was if I could spruce it up a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got the clothes off I was a bit surprised. From the jumping I assumed Lena's breasts were huge, but I assumed they were just a cup bigger, but they were at least two cups bigger than my own. Lena wasn't even wearing a sports bra, but just a regular one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got that from my mother.\" Lena said as I turned around. \"She was big up there as well and I got the same size.\" Lena explained as she was staring down my smaller sized breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I just wasn't used to it.\" I told Lena. After a few tries I finally felt the straps of Lena's bra and could unhook the bra. I then pulled off the purple panties Lena was wearing before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then turned around and saw my own naked body standing there shyly. I had to admit, Lena's body did have much more curves than my former. But my former body had something cute, something adorable that I didn't feel coming from this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now we grab some shampoo? Let me guess, you didn't bring any of it. Lena shook her head. \"Alright, we both use mine.\" I told Lena as I opened my locker and grabbed hold of the shampoo bottle. Let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Lena and me stepped inside the shower area. We both stood next to each other as we pushed the button for the showers to work. It was pretty awkward in the beginning. After all we just swapped bodies with each other. But then Lena began talking about Ms. Oakdale's workout just as I told her. I reacted to it and we both began talking. First about gym class, then our favorite teachers. Slowly it felt like we were old friends or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was amazing.\" Lena told me as we both left the shower area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right, I told you. It went great.\" I told Lena as I grabbed her former underwear. I usually went for something new, but since Lena didn't bring anything new with her. I was stuck with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but maybe that's because you are such an easy talker.\" Lena told me. \"Thanks,\" I told her smiling as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.\" She suddenly said becoming all quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is, Lena?\" I asked her concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That smile, I have seen you do it so many times but this is the first time I've seen it on my face. It looks really great.\" Lena told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to her and grabbed her in a hug, feeling my large breasts against her smaller ones. \"Lena, you are great. We just need to practice and soon you can do it as well.\" I told her confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She said looking up looking all flustered. I then quickly let go off her and hurried off to change into Lena's clothes. A large black shirt with a long black jacket and baggy trousers with sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" I asked Lena. She was already dressed up in my tank top with the jean mini-skirt and white sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, better than this.\" Lena said as she tried to pull down her skirt. \"I just feel so exposed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't, it looks perfect, and besides that's the point and it's great with the warm weather.\" I told Lena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but I hope you don't plan on wearing mini-skirts while in my body.\" Lena told me (I was secretly planning on wearing them). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, not yet. Let's go.\" I told Lena and we left the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do we go now?\" Lena asked me. There were so many places I wanted to go. The mall for a make-over, the pool for socializing with some other girls, the arcade to chat up with some guys. But I thought the first thing we needed to do was to learn about each other. So I thought about where we could go to learn about each other.</span></div></div>",

She used to be 5 foot and 10 inches tall, but quickly she already lost 4 inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this, Miss Oakdale began to panic. Then her breasts began to shrink, as well as her muscles. The flab under her arms faded away. Her gym socks crumbled to her ankles. Her top was become baggier and her gym shorts was about to slide down her legs. It was as if she was shrinking into her clothes and sinking into her trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling humiliated, Oakdale rushed out of her over-sized trainers and ran back into the changing room as everyone in the class, including me, laughed at her.

Her name is Emma and she attends Ruby city elementary school. She is currently in 3rd grade. Basically, she looks a lot like I used to look at that age, with long, blonde hair and blue eyes. She is generally your average little sister, although she can be a bit of a pain at times. Ever since she was born, I've always had a gut feeling that she was out to get me! Crazy? Yeah I know, but you should it when she gives someone one of her sinister glares!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now on with the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning I missed the school bus. Not wanting to be late, I asked my parents to give me a lift in their car to Ruby High. The only flaw was that I had to get in the car with Emma because they were on their way to drop her off in the elementary school. As usual, we pestered each other in the car until we finally pulled up outside Ruby High, and with 15 minutes to spare before first period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the car in quite a rush to meet with my friends. However I did not realize that I had forgotten my schoolbag. While I went off in search of my friends, my parents realized this, and asked if Emma could run into the school and give me my bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I most probably know what you're thinking right now. What kind of parents would send their 8-year old daughter into a high school alone with just a few minutes before first period? Well you obviously don't know Emma as well as my family do. She is very smart and brave when it comes to situations like these. I even remember one time when she was only 5-years old and she managed to walk through Ruby city central and back unharmed! So this would be just a walk in the backyard for her. Or so she thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying my schoolbag over her shoulder, she rushes into the school grounds, amidst the crowd of students awaiting their lectures. However as she stepped into an empty hall, she felt a slight tingling sensation running through her body. This momentarily distracts her, but before she could move any further, she accidentally bumps into someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter bumping into each other, they both fall onto the tiled floor and black out momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who did Emma bump into?</span></div></div>",

She met my dad, Robert, ironically, in Ruby High back when she was a sophomore, and they've been with each other ever since. Hayley's parents, Tom and Bertha Sheringham, live together in the retirement home, although Hayley is close friends with Bertha. If it helps, this is what she looks like: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.hottestmominamerica.com/cpg149/displayimage.php?pid=511&amp;fullsize=1\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hottestmominamerica.com/cpg14...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's basically everything that you need to know. So on with the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was parents night in Ruby High, and everyone's parents were visiting to check on how their daughters were doing there. But because we couldn't find anyone to babysit my little sister, my dad decided to stay home as my mom came with me to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at 6 o'clock, later than usual, and we make our way into the school-grounds. She was completely unaware of everything that transpired in the school, but no matter how much you wanted to talk to her about these strange events, you knew that she would only think that you were crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long night, even though we had only been in the school for about an hour. We both sat outside my chemistry class, waiting for my final review of the evening. So far, it did not look good for me this year. My B-grade average had been reduced to a C-grade average, and somehow I even flunked music. It was not looking good for me, and my mom knew this too. It seemed like the bonus allowance that I anticipated for doing well tonight is down the drain. That is, until we were left alone outside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we awaited the final review impatiently, I turned to face my mother, only to discover that something was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was happening to her?</span></div></div>",

Dad always said they were just laugh lines, but Mom didn't think they were any laughing matter. She tried everything that promised to erase wrinkles, but nothing worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I looked at her that night, however, I could see that those little lines were fading. \"Hey, Mom,\" I said, \"have you been doing something different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to butter me up, young lady,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shut up, but I kept studying her. Then, I picked up on her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, she had started getting a few white hairs here and there. Nothing major, but enough to bother her. Tonight, though, there were no white hairs at all. That's when I knew that, whatever caused strange things to happen at Ruby high, it was starting to affect my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went home after the final review. It was as bad as I'd anticipated, but I couldn't think about it. I was completely focused on my mom. By the time we got home, she looked a good ten years younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got in the door, Mom just took her coat off and headed for her bedroom. \"There'll be no bonus for Ashley tonight,\" she said. \"I'm going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad took a good look at her, and turned to me when she left the room. \"Does your mother look... different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"She's getting younger.\" I wasn't quite ready to tell him about the weirdness at Ruby High. I just headed upstairs to my own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I was brushing my teeth, when I heard a scream. The voice was young, but I somehow knew it was Mom. I ran down the stairs to see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was Mom, but she was too young to be my mother anymore. In fact, she was...</span></div></div>",

Most of the time, it would be an inaudible mumble or a short whispered conversation to a mirror while she was in her locker. Other than that, she seemed very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to her one time, to try and spark a conversation. It was kind of the big game around the school, trying to get Erin to come out of her shell. She had been there one full semester but no one had yet been able to really reach her. As I approached her, I paused, catching one of her solo conversations to her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't let you peek.\" she whispered to her reflection. She then paused as if to listen. \"What do you mean why!? It's the Girls' locker room stupid!... Look, I know we are twins, and that we can not help being able to look through each other's eyes, but come on, you're a boy!...\" she shook her head. \"The answer is no, Eric! Deal with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she closed her locker, as if she were hanging up on someone, and walked away, oblivious to my presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her twin brother can see through her eyes!?\" I thought, feeling slightly disturbed by what I had just witnessed, \"No wonder she keeps her head down all the time. It's so she doesn't accidentally give him a 'cheap thrill'.\" I shivered at the thought of having to go through life like that. \"I wonder if there's anything I could do to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do I do next?</span></div></div>",

Erin was very small for her age, only a few inches taller than my little sister, with long and flowing auburn hair and gentle green eyes. Most everyone liked her as she always looked them in the eye. Only now I understood the true reason behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Erin.\" I said. \"Can we talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded but did not speak. By that time, we were in the locker room and Erin was reluctant to look at me or even turn in my direction. Other girls would have just assumed that she was feeling shy. Only, I knew better, as I heard her conversation with her brother, Eric, through the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm decent.\" I told her. \"I kind of overheard your conversation with Eric at your locker... Is there any way I could help you deal with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin slowly looked up at me, her eyes watering slightly. \"You're not the first girl here to catch on to my problem.\" she said, quietly. She sobbed a little. \"But your the first to offer me any help.\" She sobbed a little more. \"I don't have an answer for you... I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I got through to her.\" I thought, \"I might as well run with it and see where it goes.\" Then I said \"Um... would you like to come over to my place after school and talk about it? Mom would love to have you over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin gave me a tiny smile. It was the first smile I had seen from her since she first arrived at the school. \"No one has ever invited me over before,\" she said, still quietly. \"Do I have to wear anything special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that and shook my head. \"No, mom can take you to my place right from school and take you home afterwards.\" I paused. \"Would your folks be okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin blushed. \"They want me to get out more often,\" she replied. \"They won't mind... I'll call them during lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" I said. \"I'll do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's smile grew a little wider. \"Thank you, Ashley,\" she said timidly, \"You... made me... happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she opened her locker to get her gym uniform and frowned at her mirror. \"Don't worry so much, Eric.\" she whispered. She then took the magnetic mirror off the inner wall of the locker door and placed it upside down onto a shelf. \"I'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, Erin was nervously sitting at my kitchen table with my family and myself. I wanted to talk to her but I was not expecting my whole family to get into the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

You look cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded. \"I'm fine.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I caught what she said as she mumbled, \"Why do you have to take such cold showers, Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin can feel what Eric feels too!?!\" I thought, horrified. \"This must have driving her crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come to my room, Erin.\" I offered. \"We can talk in private there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked at me then nodded and I escorted her down the hall, still shivering, to my room with Emma following.

Erin was sitting on my bed, rubbing her arms as if she were trying to get warm. I took up a heavy blanket and carefully wrapped her in it. She blushed, a small smile of relief forming on her face as she sank into the warmth it provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th... Thank you.\" she said. \"That feels better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you and Eric can do more than see through each other's eyes.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded. \"It's a little complicated.\" she said, quietly. \"An example, Eric likes to take cold showers. When he does, I can feel the water hitting me, making me feel cold. In turn, when I shower and I clean my breasts, he can feel the weight of them as if he had breasts himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost as if you two are sharing bodies.\" I said. \"It sound a little creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded. \"If you only knew how maddening it really is for us.\" she said. \"I can feel everything he does and he can feel everything I feel. Eric hates it when I brush my skirt because it makes him feel as if he were wearing one as well. I hate it when he adjusts his tie because I can feel it tightening around my neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is deep.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin began to tear up a little. \"We don't mean to drive each other crazy, we try to be careful. We both learned to take a shower with our eyes closed. While drying off and changing as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't imagine going through life like that.\" I told her. \"It must have been rough... for both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been very rough.\" replied Erin, sobbing a little. \"We've just trying to get along right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked beyond any words. To have to endure such a life would have driven me stock raving mad by the end of the first year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you two get along well?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As well as expected.\" she said. \"I... (Gasp!)\" she then blushed and whispered, \"Must you!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin blushed more brightly. \"Eric just... cleaned his privates.\" said Erin, softly. \"He tries to be gentle, so I don't really feel it, but... he's also trying to rush. He knows I can't stand the cold water... not for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered at the thought. \"We got to find some way to block that.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked at me, hopeful. \"I...

I'll handle the cost of the visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked at me, surprised. \"You... would do that... for me?\" she asked, tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" I replied, honestly. \"You're my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stared at me, wide eyed as she began to cry. \"You think of me.... as a friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, smiling. \"Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin responded by suddenly jumping off the bed, giving me a tight hug, as she quietly sobbed onto my shoulder. It was then I realized that Erin did not have many friends, due to her maddening condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ashley!\" she said, quietly. \"This means so much me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, I carefully explained the situation to my mom and dad. I was delighted when they promised to help all they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy family was far from being poor and my parents loved to help others. Above all, they loved a good mystery and Erin and Eric's curious condition was indeed a mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor dear!\" said my mom. \"I can't imagine going through life like that!\" she smiled. \"Don't worry, our doctor is among the best in the business, he will get to bottom of yours and Eric's condition and don't worry about the cost, we have it covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin hugged your mom as well. \"Thank you!\" she cried. \"Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, at the office of my family's physician, Dr. Khan, I meet Eric and Ms Strange for the first time. Eric was a near mirror image of Erin, same height, similar build, gentle green eyes, and long brown hair. I must admit, I was surprised to see a boy with such long hair. Only, knowing their story, I guessed that he kept his hair long because he would go crazy feeling Erin's hair, if his was short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who know about Erin and I understand.\" said Eric, confirming my suspicion. he swallowed. \"Those who don't... (sob!)... Tease me terribly.... (sob.) ... It hurts a lot, being called a sissy boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that he was struggling to keep his composure as he added, \"Thank you for being so kind to Erin... and me, we appreciate you doing this for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then began to quietly sob and started to turn away. I knelled down and pulled him in for a hug. He instantly fell into tears, hugging me back, as I slowly rocked Eric back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" I told him. \"Dr. Khan is a great man. He will find a way to help you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin walked up to me, sobbing as well, and I hugged her as well. My mom smiled at me, proud, then turned to their mother, Emily Strange. She was a tall, slender woman of about 35 with long, brown hair, like her children, with deep green eyes and doll like features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have bee difficult, raising two kids with that condition.\" she said, carefully. \"How did you manage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not easy, Hayley.\" admitted Emily, dabbing at her tears. \"I can not paddle one child, for misbehaving, without torturing the other. I had to be inventive to keep peace in the household.\" she paused. \"I can't thank you and your family enough for doing this for Erin and Eric... it means so much to us all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to sob as well and my mom opened her arms to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw! Come here, you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and my mom embraced each other with her sobbing as well. It was obvious to me that this had been a heavy burden to them for a very long time. I smiled, tearing up myself, knowing that they were finally going to get some medical help.  Then the door to the waiting room opened and a nurse peeked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin and Eric Strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI released the two and stood up. \"They're right here.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse smiled kindly at them. \"Dr. Khan is ready to see you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please come with us.\" begged Erin, turning to me. \"I... I'm a little scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agreed and Dr. Khan asked her and Eric a number of questions before running a number of tests on them. They were both nervous but they felt a little better as D. Khan had the same tests done to them both at the same time to ease any discomfort. Once all the tests were run, he instructed me, Eric and Erin to wait for the results in the waiting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little nervous about what they will find.\" whispered Emily to my mom. \"What if it can't be treated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you will know.\" replied my mom, equally as softly. \"It's better than not knowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled at that. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared, Ashley.\" said Erin, softly. \"What if its something that spreads to others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that. \"I doubt that.\" I said. \"Let's wait for the results and go from there, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did not have long to wait as, thirty minutes later, the nurse called Erin and Eric back. I went with them for support as Dr. Khan told them what he had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you familiar with the term, Siamese Twins.\" he asked, with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are twins who are connected to each other by a part of the body.\" replied Erin, slowly, confused. \"What does that that have to do with Eric and I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Eric are a very rare form of Siamese twins.\" replied Dr. Khan. \"You and your bother are connected to each other by your very souls. That is how you are able to see through each other's eyes and feel what the other experiences.\" he paused, looking hesitant. \"I'm afraid that this will only get worse as you age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Eric both broke down into tears but paused as Dr. Khan then added, \"But there are medications that can lesson the intensity of what you see and feel through the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... There is?\" asked Erin hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" begged Eric, politely. \"What are these medications?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are used to treat seizures.\" replied Dr. Khan. \"It will not block out what you see and feel completely but it will definitely be an improvement.\" he paused, thinking. \"I will start you two on a low dosage, for now, in case there are any unforeseen side effects and then go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Dr. Khan.\" I told him. \"Just send the bill to my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Khan shook his head. \"There will be no charge.\" he said. he then turned to Erin and Eric, as long as your mother allows me to be your primary physician and continue to work on your curious case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have to ask mom that.\" said Erin, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Khan smiled. \"I will do so.\" he wrote up two prescriptions then escorted you, Erin, and Eric to the waiting room to talk to Emily Strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the few days that followed, Erin could not have been happier as the effects of their condition did seem to get better for her and Eric. I was happy for them and she was grateful to me for making it happen. This made me rather popular as I managed to get her to finally open up a little.

Erin's face was there as well, just more in the background as if they were standing in single file. I began to shake, seeing their faces, overlapping my own in the mirror, I had somehow become part of their nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... Why am I seeing your face!?\" whispered Eric, in my head, sobbing. \"I can feel your skirts on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that's bad?\" I whispered back. \"I'm feeling a weight between my legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... So am I!\" whispered Erin, her face becoming more clear for the moment. \"I'm scared Ashley!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call Dr. Kahn the second I get to lunch.\" I promised. \"There has to be a logical explanation to all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then, Ashley,\" said Eric, sadly, \"welcome to our nightmare....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered at that as Eric then vanished. \"Where'd he go!?\" I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must have closed his locker.\" whispered Erin. \"That's how it started for us, through the mirror, it just got worse and worse from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin said that, I noticed that I could no longer feel that extra weight between my legs as Eric cut off the connection. \"Maybe I'm going to need some of that medicine as well.\" I whispered to Erin. \"At least until we see Dr. Khan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might not be a bad idea.\" replied Erin. \"Of course, you're bigger than Eric and me, you may need a larger dose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be right.\" I mussed quietly. \"It might be better if I just wait.\" you paused. \"Then again, if this gets worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's up to you, Ashley.\" said Erin, through my mind. \"I'll see you in P.E.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Erin's face vanished and I knew that she had closed her locker. \"This is going to be a long day.\" I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to me next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was stepping out of the hot shower, toweling myself dry when I suddenly blushed brightly, feeling an invisible weight between my legs. What unnerved me more was that it seemed to be swaying back and forth, telling me that he was not dressed. <i>\"Oh crap!\"</i> I thought, blushing more. <i>\"Eric is about to shower!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Eric loved to take cold showers, I was tempted to run back under the hot water to counter it but I had to get to my next class, study hall. As I reluctantly got dressed into some fresh clothes, I began to feel cold water hitting my skin, even though I was completely dry. I shivered at the chill it gave me as I felt my breasts harden slightly in reaction but did my best to ignore it. \"Erin told me that Eric always tries to rush when in the shower.\" I whispered to myself. \"I'll just have to deal with it for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, I walked passed one of my classmates as she turned, revealing her naked breasts as she was pulling a sports bra into place. I paid no attention to it, as I see the same thing on myself in the mirror every day but I blushed brightly as I heard Eric's voice in my head. <i>*Ga!! What are you trying to do, blind me!? Lower your eyes!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately lowered my eyes, away from the girl. \"Sorry.\" I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shrugged. \"No big.\" she said. \"It's not like you've never seen them before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly walked out of the girls' locker room, shivering from the sensation of the cold water from Eric's shower hitting my body and running down my sides and feet. \"Will you hurry it up, I'm freezing.\" I whispered. \"How can you stand taking such cold showers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*They numb my body so I won't feel as much for a while.*</i> came Eric's mental reply. <i>*I'm almost done.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped out loud, feeling a hand touching my nether regions, sending a powerful wave of pleasure through me and I guessed that Eric was cleaning his privates. <i>\"I'm going to go insane before this day ends!\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rounded the corner, I saw Erin, looking at me with tears in her eyes as she shivered in tune with me. \"I'm sooo sorry I pulled you into this.\" she said, quietly. \"At least now you know what Eric and I have been living with all these years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, relieved that the sensation of cold water hitting my body had stopped. \"We'll figure something out, Erin, okay?\" I replied. \"At least Eric is done taking his shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin began to cry. \"Are we still friends?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, holding back a shiver as I felt the sensation of Eric putting on his tie. \"Of course we are.\" I said, pulling Erin into a warm hug. \"Nothing will change that, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the bell rang and I urged Erin to hurry into study hall, the last class for the day as I worried what could happen next with this strange and disturbing link I had with Erin and Eric...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was as if I had suddenly been hit in the head, in fact, that was exactly what it felt like. I immediately knew that someone was beating up on either Eric or Erin and looked around to find Erin sitting a few chairs down from me. Fortunately, it was study hall so I was able to walk down and sit next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Eric get beat up a lot?\" I asked her, whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded, her lips trembling. \"You saw him.\" she whispered back. \"He's smaller than other boys, feminine looking, he and I always end up sharing the bruises.\" shivering, she added, \"I'll pity him when I get my first period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, I would have laughed at the thought of a boy getting a period but, knowing their condition, I felt pity for him and began to wonder. <i>\"Maybe...\"</i> I thought then I thought to Eric, <i>\"Use my strength, add it to your own.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I-I'll try.\"</i> came Eric's mental response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, I felt very weak but I did not feel another hit, just pressure on my knuckles and a slight breeze on my face as if something had sped just in front of it. A few moments later, I heard Eric's voice again. <i>\"It worked.\"</i> came his happy voice. <i>\"I don't think those guys are going to bug me again for a long while, thank you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My pleasure, Eric.\"</i> I thought back, feeling my strength return. <i>\"Have a good rest of the day.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of my day went well, happy I was able to help Eric out of a jam. Unknown to me, in doing so I had pulled myself deeper into their situation as I noticed my clothing seemed a bit too loose on me. \"What's going on?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it was the end of the day and I managed to get home to find I had shrunk some more. I was now as tall as my little sister, Emma. \"This can't be good.\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the telephone rang but I was too preoccupied with my own predicament to notice until mom called from the hall. \"Ashley, Erin on the phone for you!\" as I came down, she gasped, seeing my new look. \"What happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping Erin has that answer, mom.\" I replied, tearing up. I answered the phone. \"Erin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, something has happened to Eric!\" wailed Erin, panicking. \"He's turned into a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say I was shocked was an understatement as I turned to a mirror to see the ghostly outline of three identical girls. \"Oh my, goodness!\" I breathed. \"We're triplets!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twenty minutes later I gave a sad smile to Eric in the girls school uniform as he walked up to me, crying. \"I feel so strange.\" he sobbed. \"Why did this happen to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to find out.\" I said, giving Eric's shoulder a gently squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Khan saw us immediately and gave us all another full examination before sighing. \"I have good news and bad news.\" he said, looking at the three of us. \"The bad news is that, because you shared your strength with Eric, after being able to see through their eyes, I can only guess that you became linked to their souls and your body quickly changed to match that link.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the bad news, what's the good news.\" asked Eric, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good news is that Ashley's addition to the balance, caused you to become a girl.\" said Dr Khan. \"Before you yell at me for saying that is good news, think of this... Now that you are all girls, feeling what the other feels will no longer be an issue, eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What caused me to be linked with them?\" I asked. \"Do you have a theory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Khan nodded. \"Their condition is contagious.\" he replied to my shock. \"When one soul reaches out to the other and they accept the embrace, they become linked. Only in Erin and Eric's case, it is to an extreme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, everyone we get close to will become 'part of the family'?\" asked Erin, freaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, I will just increase the dosage of the medication and it should nullify that.\" said Dr Khan. \"Sorry, bit I fear the medication will not return you to your previous state. You will have to grow up again from where you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid of that.\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" asked Erin, looking at you. \"Should you go home with your family or come home with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question.\" I replied, uncertain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
