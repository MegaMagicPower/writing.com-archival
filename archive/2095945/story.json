This is where the spin-off storylines of Small Bargain will go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1 (School Party): The students of Opal High School throw a formal party to escape the stress of weekday work. Blake makes an attempt to make himself more appealing to Aria with his magic, but ends up shrunken to half an inch tall instead. Thus he needs to get the attention of one of the girls and think of a way to restore his size, while avoiding a dip in the snack bowl, or a swim in someone's punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2 (Magical Mayhem): In an alternate universe, Blake goes to a school of magic and is currently the only student there who hasn't mastered spells yet. He is therefore a frequent victim of other students' hexes -- most recently, a shrinking spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3 (Transformative Curse): Blake is cursed by his wicked pursuer, Raven Flame, and transforms into various inanimate objects (technological devices not included) for the next week. Blake must try to psychically get a girl's attention in his transformed state or endure his fate as gum, food, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 4 (Spectral Sickness): Aria is stricken with a supernatural illness, and Blake must venture into the underworld to find a cure for his love interest's ailment, while dealing with the wrath of Raven and the trials set by Lord Samedi, ruler of the underworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...take your pick, dear reader!</span></div></div>",

Everybody at Opal Academy is naturally gifted in the mystical arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...everybody but one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake Heart nervously ruffled his black hair as he walked through the hallways of the school building. The teenage boy had recently been enrolled at Opal Academy to learn the magic required for self-defense. Unfortunately, he had yet to get the hang of his powers. Blake would often face bullying in the form of elemental assaults, speech-altering curses, unbearable itchiness, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, he approached a classroom door and opened it...only for a bucket of mysterious fluid to be dumped all over him! Struggling to get the strange stuff off of his skin, Blake saw his surroundings gradually grow bigger...and bigger...no...he was SHRINKING! The bucket must have been filled with a size-changing concoction! Thankfully, he stopped shrinking at half an inch in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny, bespectacled newbie heard footsteps approaching and retreated behind one of the nearest desk's legs.

And she had natural magical talent to boot! No wonder so many students at Opal Academy envied her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria stepped into the classroom, confused at the presence of a fallen bucket and the orange fluid that had spilled from it. Not knowing the effects of this concoction, the brunette ignored it and strolled over to her desk towards the front of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his fears and insecurities, Blake decided that now was his chance to get Aria\u2019s attention, and possibly find a way to restore his size.

She couldn't hear the mental cry of anguish as it plopped into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a little cough, Ruby answered the phone, jokingly annoyed as she explained the situation with a laugh. The social butterfly easily managed to turn a minor event into a small funny story as her 'gum' bubbled away in her acid.

Blake\u2019s would have to \u2013 if he still had blood and was not currently a blob of chewed-up gum within his friend\u2019s hand. It was not a voice that accompanied or brought with it anything good. No, this voice belonged to a certain person who had only ever brought the pair nothing but strife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurling her fingers protectively around her gummified-friend, turning them into bars so as to not trap him in the dark, Ruby glanced over her shoulder with a look of pure annoyance. At the sight, she could barely repress the bile forming in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words slipped free in the form of a hiss. \u201cOh\u2026 <i>Hello, Marcia.</i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia Diaz had everything a girl could possibly want. Mesmerizing brown eyes, overflowing locks of the most delicious chocolate-brown hair, supple lips oh-so inviting, smooth and creamy skin utterly free of any spots or blemishes, and a drop-dead gorgeous body that every boy at school fantasized about at the very least once. Even Blake himself had, and begrudgingly admitted to himself that it was a damn good dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really said something about the genetic jackpot Marcia had won that the only girl who could possibly rival her in looks was essentially a living reflection: her identical twin sister, Maria. But that girl had no intention of ever usurping her sister\u2019s position from her. Maria simply kept to herself. All Blake or Ruby knew about her was her leadership of the school karate club. Everything else about her was a mystery to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, one might think that anyone with enough beauty to easily bend the wills of most students and even some teachers would be content to spend her school years ruling as New Opal\u2019s grand queen bee. But this was Marcia Diaz, and nothing was ever enough for Marcia Diaz. She wanted something more, something in particular: she wanted to be captain of the cheer squad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she applied. The sheer ability she displayed set her high above almost everyone else, and those judges not swayed by her athleticism fell in line with a few sweet whispers and naughty looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, it came down to her and Ruby, equals in skill, with the coach having the final say. Clearly Marcia felt the choice was obvious. But the coach had a will of unmovable iron. Unswayed by the young enchantress' charms, the coach made Ruby, who cared for her teammates, captain over Marcia. Her first ever true loss dealt to her, Marcia\u2019s initial dismissal of Ruby turned into a burning hatred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Blake, Marcia thankfully rarely paid any attention to him. He was far beneath her in the school hierarchy; another commoner to her royalty, and as such of little interest to her. Though, occasionally he would notice her sizing him up from the corner of his eye. Maybe figuring out a way to use him to hurt Ruby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia\u2019s trademark condescending smirk widened as she picked up on Ruby\u2019s obvious distaste. \u201cHello, <i>Ruby</i>.\u201d She spat back. Her eyes quickly trailed down from her nemesis\u2019s face until they reached the gum in her hand. \u201cI, for one, think that the New Opal High School cheer captain shouldn\u2019t be talking to a snack. I mean, what would everyone at school think if they found out Ruby Sparks talked to gum?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s glare intensified. \u201cLike they\u2019d care, Marcia.\u201d She turned to face Marcia head on, coming almost chest-to-chest with the slightly taller girl before her. The hand guarding her gum came to rest against her midriff, giving Blake a good view through the bars of his cage at the two girls squiring off. If looks could kill, he was sure both of them would have died a hundred times over by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he hadn\u2019t been so absorbed in watching their dispute, maybe he would have noticed the two foreign fingers snaking in\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an agonizing few seconds, the pair stood in the relative silence of empty classroom, their eyes drilling holes into each other\u2019s. Then Marcia gave an exaggerated sigh of defeat. \u201cAlright, alright...\u201d She said with a halfhearted shrug, and began her retreat, hips swaying as she waltzed towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll let you off this time, Rubes.\u201d Stopping inside the doorframe, she glanced back at the only person now left in the room. \u201cBut if you keep trying your hardest to drag the cheer squad\u2019s reputation into the mud, I <i>will</i> see to it your gone. Understood, captain?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s response was to simply glare back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia\u2019s expression turned sinister. \u201cAnd please, do try to get this into that thick skull of yours...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA victorious smile crawled across Marcia\u2019s face as she lifted up two fingers to Ruby. Between them sat an all-too familiar little blob. Ruby\u2019s eyes flung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGum is meant to be chewed, not spoken to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Blake saw was Ruby\u2019s shocked face before he was tossed past Marcia\u2019s lips and into the dark, humid oppression of her mouth. Immediately, the tongue flung him across to her waiting teeth, which eagerly began to bash him and mash him between them. Chew, chew, chew. He could hear Marcia hum happily around him, seemingly enjoying his taste, and he could feel between the barrage of her teeth the slight bumps of her moving at a quick pace. What would happened to him next? He could only hope, as a flicker of light through her briefly parted lips showed him the abyss at the back of her mouth, it wouldn\u2019t be <i>that</i>.</span></div></div>",

The fleshy walls pulsated steadily, and a greenish sea bubbled with acid nearby.

Right now, with Marcia\u2019s stomach slowly stirring to live in preparation to begin processing him, the most pressing questions were A) \u201cWould he be able to escape this?\u201d and B) \u201cWhat would happen to him if he didn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to A) came all-too fast. The pulsating walls flexed, sharply and suddenly, and threw the transformed boy into the now slowly-growing pool he had only-momentarily rested beside. To the bottom, Blake\u2019s helpless form sank, before he finally come to a stop at the base of the bubbling lagoon. Almost immediately, he felt the digestive juices start digging into him. For the first few seconds, it felt little more than an awkward tingle running across his gummy skin; then they ramped up their efforts, clearly eager to break him down, and that awkward tingle evolved into an overwhelming burning sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake silently screamed as the acids smelted him down into nutrients for their master\u2019s absorption. The last thing he heard before the pain overtook him was what sounded like a massive, yet muted by flesh, belch coming from the outside world. Then darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Marcia a good moment to realize just how powerful that burp had been. It was perhaps the loudest she had ever heard, and by a long shot, the loudest she had ever herself produced. Had she\u2019d let that behemoth loose in public, she would have been awash with utter embarrassment. But here, between herself and the goddess in the mirror, it\u2019s strength instead blossomed a strange feeling of pride in her. A smug smirk was quick to replace the brief look of shock on her face, and once again she turned her gaze down towards the reflection of her abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! \u2018Scuse me!\u201d Marcia said with a giggle as she gave her tummy a few soft pats. Through flesh and skin, she could hear the organ diligently gurgling and churning away at the likely perpetrator of her thunderous outburst. Beneath her fingers, she even felt the faint vibrations as it sloshed and squished it\u2019s contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really know how to surprise a girl, don\u2019t ya?\u201d She half-mused, half-questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Glorp</i>, went the stomach. That made Marcia laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks for that! Always good to experience a new thing every now and then, ya know?\u201d Again, she patted her belly in pretend-appreciation. Or was it actual appreciation? <i>No</i>, she thought. <i>How can you appreciate a silly wad of gum?</i> She shook her head slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo anyways, I think a good reward for you would be\u2026 adding to this perfect body of mine, right?\u201d She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Slosh</i>, said her tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia\u2019s smirk widened into a joyful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d She beamed, and, for the last time that day, pat her belly. \u201cThen get to it, and I\u2019ll see you on my tits. Or ass. Or\u2026 wherever you end up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an agreement \u201creached\u201d between her and her currently-digesting snack, Marcia went about the rest of her day with a spring in her step. Her stomach quietened down as it finished transforming her snack into something much easier for the intestines to handle and sent it on it\u2019s way, to be drained for all it\u2019s worth\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he slowly stirred into consciousness, somehow still alive, Blake Heart finally learned the answer to question B): he was now \u2013 </span></div></div>",

She looked down her nose at her mouth, contemplating the absurdity of it, <i>I-is he...really my gum?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock of the situation didn't stop her from continuing to mash Blake between her teeth. She suppressed a moan, the reverberations in her mouth giving him a bizarre, buzzing massage. <i>God, he tastes so good,</i> she blushes, savoring his sweet cherry flavoring, <i>I gotta use him some more...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's mind was already frazzled from his tossing and turning inside the moist cavern of her mouth, but the fact that Ruby flat out ignored him wore his sanity thin. Why did she keep chewing him?! She actually stopped for a second when he relayed his message to her, so she <i>must</i> have heard it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm, if he's not just playing a prank on me, I kinda feel bad for him,</i> Ruby mused, tossing the tiny wad of mage from cheek to cheek, <i>Maybe I can do something to make him feel better...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Blake's body was lodged in the cheerleader's right cheek, stationed just past her premolars. Was she going to get him out? After a few seconds of nerve-wracking silence, his hopes were dashed as he felt a strange sucking sensation that left him feeling all tingly. Slowly, but surely, his body was being pulled through the slight gap between Ruby's premolars, the monster of a tongue licking slightly at what came through. Soon, the tingling gave way into ecstasy as more of Blake's body was squeezed between the teeth. He couldn't speak, but in his mind, the magical apprentice was shivering and groaning. It almost felt like he was getting sucked in a...<i>lewder</i> sense of the word...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver and over again, his body was pulled through Ruby's teeth and onto her tongue, only to start the process all over again. Both parties were in blissful heaven, the cheerleader from the mind-blowing taste of her gum, and the mage from this new, exotic, erotic sensation that poured over him. Just as Blake lost his composure...</span></div></div>",

Digging through her backpack, Indigo plucked out a piece of gum, unwrapped it, and tossed the little treat in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slowly awoke in total darkness, starting to wonder how he'd survived being digested inside Jade. Realizing he hadn't been absorbed into his sister's body, the mage was still unable to move by his own power...so he assumed that the curse must've transferred his soul to another object. A light from above peeked in as a giant yet delicate hand reached in for him. Allowing himself to be grabbed and raised into the light of the classroom, Blake was relieved to see the face of Indigo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat relief turned into horror as Blake was dropped into Indigo's open maw, right onto her slimy tongue. He found himself being moved toward the giantess's molars, which came down to crush his tiny body again and again...and again. He'd been turned into chewing gum!! Trying and failing to struggle, Blake was at the mercy of Indigo's pearly whites, until she decided to blow her gum past her lips into the form of a bubble. Recalling that he had psychic powers, Blake figured he could try and use telepathy to communicate with his unaware captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indigo! I'm your gum, please stop blowing! INDY!!\" Blake screamed mentally just before he popped, praying that his tormentor would hear him and help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo looked around for a moment, swearing she'd heard a voice. It sounded like Blake, but...he wasn't in class today...though, what he said didn't seem to add up...</span></div></div>",

Looking down at her now edible brother, she waited for a response. \"I was cursed Jade, now I'm stuck transforming into objects for a week. You have to help me...And not eat me anymore, I think you but my leg off.\" He says up to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade watches the whole time and her face slowly slips into one that was annoyed. \"Well....Maybe this will be a lesson for your Blake. You've been so caught up in your magic stuff that you don't even care what will happen to you! I think if you live out being my sandwich, you'll see how much it hurts me that you keep up this magic stuff.\" She says licking her lips, bringing Blake back up for another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WAIT JADE!\" Blake cries out as his sister's teeth sink back into his body. He watched and felt another piece of him get chewed up before disappearing into her gut. \"Mmm, you do taste good Blake, you know how to make a good sandwich.\" She said winking at her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite Blake was eaten before his entire form was inside Jade's stomach. Her acids warmed Blake and slowly worked to dissolve him. \"Jade, please! I'll stop using my magic just get me out of here!\" He cried out one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Blake, it's too late.

You don't have to be nervous around me.\" A deviant grin crossed Tanner's voice as he leaned in closer, delivering a predatory whisper into her ear, \"Especially after last Friday night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rising heat permeated her cheeks. She cupped her hands over her eyes in a futile attempt to conceal her embarrassment. \"Tanner, stop!\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you said when we were...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!\" She moaned. \"I get it.

What is he talking about? You're only thirteen!\" You screamed from within her gut. Your internal protests were met with silence. The thought that your younger sister could possibly have a boyfriend or be doing those types of things eluded you, until the painful reality was laid bare before you. Out of the countless places you could be right now, this had to rank at the very bottom. You could be in class. You could be in your bed, sleeping comfortably nestled under the covers. You could be confessing your love to Aria. If you were capable of tears in your current form, they would be streaming down your visage. Yet even that simple comfort was lost to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out of here, Jade!\" You frantically squirmed within your captress' stomach. She halted her steps for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Tanner asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking of how lucky I am to have such an amazing guy.\" Jade beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah, you are.\" He chuckled, planting a firm slap on her rear, which elicited a surprising gasp from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, please! Do you really want to do this with me around?! Can't this wait until another time?!\" You continued your fervent struggle, but this time Jade paid you no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tempest of emotions were swirling through Jade's core. She didn't want to take Blake along on her personal time, but she couldn't break off her date with this guy. The feelings that Tanner evoked in her whenever she was in his presence were undeniable. She wasn't going to risk losing her chance at happiness over her whiny brother. Blake's dilemma would just have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was uncomfortable at first, but she gradually became accustomed to his verbal protesting. She began to grow used to the feeling of his squirms within her. Her main focus now was on the marvelous hunk of man in front of her. Her heart quivered as they paid for their tickets, and took their seats in the theater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic screen flickered to life, playing previews for other movies which honestly did not garner her care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this movie is as good as the previews.\" Tanner said. \"Sometimes they try to hype these things up for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you picked it I'm sure it will be amazing.\" Jade responded gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like I picked you.\" He wittily riposted. Leaning in for a kiss. Jade responded in kind, and their lips met in a fleeting but passionate moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wriggling in her stomach intensified. It was certainly an annoyance, but not enough to dampen the mood or ruin her night. Nonetheless, it would be best if he ceased his useless struggling. Deciding to have a conversation with him, she excused herself to the restroom, promising to return posthaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the restroom door behind her, she checked the entirety of the space and luckily found the room empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Blake! I'm having a great time with this guy so can you please be quiet and stop squirming around?\" Jade asked, though her question was delivered more in the tone and context of a statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?!\" Blake shrieked internally. \"Why would I do that? I told you, you can do this another time! I'm your older brother, this is the last thing I want to see my sister doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should have thought about that before you decided to play around with your magic again. If you ask me, you deserve this. If you were just able to confess your feelings to Aria like a man, you wouldn't be in this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's scathing remarks eviscerated Blake's self-esteem. A dreary mood overtook him, rendering him speechless for a moment. Jade took that moment to capitalize on her dialogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanner confessed his feelings to me and asked me out months ago without hesitation, but you'd rather practice your magic, without thinking of how it hurts others. Maybe if you had more courage and consideration, you'd be on a date with Aria, instead of trapped in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry okay?\" Blake responded, his voice a shaky sobbing mess, though the tears could not fall. \"I'll confess to her the next chance I get, and I'll stop practicing magic, I swear. Just give me a second chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want a second chance, then don't say a word for the rest of my date.\" She commanded, her voice far more firm than when she was in Tanner's presence. \"I don't want to feel any annoying squirms. I don't want to hear a peep out of you until the date is over, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Blake replied, his voice weakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because if you ruin this for me...\" Jade slammed her open hand into her stomach with moderate force, \"You'll be trapped in my stomach forever and you'll never speak to Aria again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay...\" Blake whimpered the word repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm going to get back to my date. Remember what I said. No talking and no squirming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were met with silence, to which she smiled. Finally, she would have the peace she desired and she could focus on her love for Tanner, rather than the protests of her annoying brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way back into the theater, weaving through the seats until she took her rightful chair - the one next to Tanner's - once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took awhile,\" He remarked, grabbing a handful of popcorn. \"I thought you were gonna make it quick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that babe.\" She whispered, \"But I'm feeling much better now.\" She nabbed a few pieces of popcorn herself, enjoying the flavor and gulping it down to where Blake resided. She felt no squirms coming from him. She beamed even wider, releasing a contented sigh from her seat and leaning her head against Tanner's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jade's desire to be close to Tanner was too much to bear. Her heart felt on the verge of exploding. She plopped herself on his lap, snuggling against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe, I'm trying to watch the movie.\" He whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the movie more important than me?\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once the slick Tanner was not able to provide a sufficient comeback. He stewed in silence a moment, attempting to compile a witty riposte, but it would not come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just move your head at least so I can watch.\" He requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Anything for you.\" She adjusted herself to a comfortable position atop him without impeding his view. Tanner wrapped his arms around her torso, his hands resting on her stomach. Blake let out a brief yelp, and Jade knew this must be torture for him, but right now, she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Blake, this experience was a living nightmare. Throughout the experience, he kept thinking of Aria. She was the only thing that got him through. The worst part was when Tanner placed his hand on him unknowingly and rested it there for an hour. He had no way of communicating to him, only Jade could hear him, and she had made it clear what would happen if he caused a fuss. He tried to stifle his sobs out of fear that Jade might punish him for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe this, he was her older brother! Yet she had commanded him, and here he was acting obediently out of fear of her. This was all wrong. He shouldn't be forced to sit here for hours watching in dread as his sister was intimate with someone. The hours of his torment seemed to drag into eternity. Sometimes, Jade would turn around to kiss him. Sometimes, they would exchange dirty talk. Throughout the experience, he had to endure Tanner's hand trailing up and down her form, at times tracing themselves across her stomach, his current resting place. Just when he was about to break, the movie finally ended and Jade arose from his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was actually a pretty awesome movie. Not that you would know.\" Tanner addressed Jade with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you better than some stupid movie.\" She scowled. \"So, what do you wanna do now?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was either stick around and see something he shouldn't or try to fight and still see something he shouldn't, with the add bonus of pain and suffering on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was so lost in his thoughts he hadn't even registered that Tanner and his sister were now on the move. By the time he did however, he knew for certain that this was going to be a long date.<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you they were out.\" Tanner smiled as he noticed his parent's car missing from the driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long do you think they'll be gone for?\" Jade asked. The last thing she wanted was for them to show up and interrupt their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing them... a couple of hours.\" Tanner shrugged before opening the front door. He flipped on the lights before tossing his keys aside. He wrapped his arms around Jade a slowly moved in for a kiss. A kiss Jade didn't hesitate to reciprocate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake did his best not to yelp when he felt another body pressed up against him. From the sound of things the two love birds were kissing. Internally he shuddered. He didn't need to see or hear this. All he wanted was to go home and have Jade fix him... And potentially find a way to get payback on Raven for kickstarting this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair finally broke off panting as they needed air. \"Why don't you head up to my room and I'll join you shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got something planned?\" Jade teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it?\" Tanner responded without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade smirked before giving him a quick peck on the lips. \"I'll be waiting then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she began her trek upstairs. As she did her thoughts soon drifted to her elder brother who'd been surprisingly silent thus far. She half expected Blake to break their agreement or squirm like mad at the thought of coming back to Tanner's place for some unsupervised fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently placed a hand over her stomach and just as gently brushed against the spot which held his consciousness. All he had to do was make it through this and she'd try to help him get back to normal, but if he couldn't then she would keep her word. Blake would be staying in her abs for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now wasn't the time to think about all this stuff, it would only ruin the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade entered Tanner's room and through herself across the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis date was still on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His body refusing to move as he gazed up at the straps above him.<br>\r\n\"What-\" Blake attempted to speak, but nothing came out- a strange, faint smell wafted around his odd prison, something that he couldn't quite put his finger on. That's when he heard a noise from the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark black hair fell over the back of a barefooted giantess who stood with her back to the tiny Blake. Her phone quietly played music into her ears using headphones as she gazed into a mirror, adding black eyeshadow in the mirror. It was awkward to see from the leather flopped over him but he quickly managed to peg her as his friend Violet. He tried once more to yell up to her as she stood up from her chair, her skirt swaying casually as she edged away from her desk. Her uncovered eye locked onto the paralyzed Blake followed with a kind smile. Blake could only sigh in relief as she wandered towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, she raised her barefoot over his body when she got close, the rough sole wiggled high above as the small amount of dirt and lint refused to let go.<br>\r\n\"Violet?\" Blake choked, unable to be heard as her hands angled the straps that were draped over him to form a long tunnel upwards. He whimpered as he worked out what he was, right as the foot slid down ontop of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny insole could only groan as the soft skin of the ball of her foot slid down face towards his lower body, his 'eye's' widening as her heel hovered in place momentarily as her hand adjusted the gladiator sandal prison. For a moment, a spark of pleasure hit the tiny boy from the wriggling toes, his embarrassment lasted for all of two seconds before the giant girl stood up- pounding his body thinner then ever with her powerful weight. He cried out silently as his friend ironed him out underfoot while she put her other shoe on, all of her weight wobbled ontop of his crushed body for a moment before slightly easing up. The slightly dustly sole twisted cruelly as Violet took her first step, rolling across his entire body before kicking off- pain shot through the abused insoles body as he tried to get his mind together during the feeling of low gravity, the feeling sadly didn't last long as he was soon flattened back onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet didn't even think about her old sandals as she walked out of her room, nabbing her key on her way out.<br>\r\n\"See you later- I'm off to work\" Violet called out, wandering into the kitchen. Not noticing the cries from her sandal weakening with each step as she wandered towards the mail. Briefly glancing through the stack, she shrugged as she found nothing there for her before leaving to do her part-time job. Her shoes squeaked across the tiles as she wandered towards the back door, briefly glancing at the note to say her parents were out- followed by a short list of chores. With a small groan at the long day ahead, the shy goth grabbed her bag and headed out, locking the door behind her.<br>\r\n\"Vi-Violet-\" Blake tried to call mentally as her foot fell on him for the hundredth time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>WHAM</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet's foot pummeled the transfigured mage with her next step and the next after that. Blake was rapidly learning that Violet's sole-- which he had once considered somewhat cute (though of no comparison to Aria's), was significantly less appealing when it was bigger than he was and slamming down on his face repeatedly. And making things worse, was that Blake realized that she wasn't even doing this consciously. Every footfall, every moment of building pressure as her sole flexed and pressed down upon him, before a brief moment of respite, was nothing more than Violet's ordinary, every day footsteps. She was not stomping, running, leaping or even jogging. Something that Blake realized somewhere, deep down, and tried his absolute best to ignore that fact as long as he could, in an effort to do something. Anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHAM</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA difficult proposition when Violet's foot flattened down on his face in a repeating, endless, painful cycle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Violet's part she didn't even acknowledge Blake's continued torment at her feet. And why would she? Nobody took the time to think about the \"suffering\" their insoles endured at their feet. Insoles didn't have feelings, after all. Violet just kept on walking along on her paper route, quietly humming to herself, and trying to ignore the rising heat of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be a hot one. I can feel it.\" She murmured, as she continued striding along. Violet was not a huge fan of the heat, and she considered that if she wanted to avoid the worst of it, she would need to pick up the pace soon. As she thought this, her stride quickened. Not quite yet a jog, but faster than the leisurely walk she had been doing, unknowingly, and uncaringly putting more force and pressure into each and every step she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not something Blake was able to ignore, however. Just as he'd begun to adjust his mind to focus, her footsteps hammered down on him more forcefully, and Blake let out a silent gasp of pain. Unwillingly, he drew in the scent of her dusty foot, as Violet sped up, each new footfall causing Blake to release more exclamations of frustration or pain. He just couldn't focus! Couldn't keep his attention on building up any form of magic long enough to even attempt to make Violet. Her every step shattered it, and forced him to resume from square one! He felt the goth's toes scrunch lightly, pulling and digging into his face slightly, as Violet stopped at a crosswalk, twisting her foot mildly in boredom, and grinding her foot into Blake. And it was beginning to get worse. As Blake struggled vainly beneath his friend's foot, he began to feel something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intense heat of the day was starting to cause Violet to sweat. And unfortunately for Blake, that started at her feet. She hadn't even fully noticed it yet, but already a thin sheen of perspiration was seeping through her soles and dripping onto Blake. The mage, at this point, was firmly disillusioned of his thoughts of Violet's feet being cute, and doubted he'd be able to look at them the same way for weeks after this was over, and Violet was only halfway done her route. She pressed on, her pace quickening and pressing down on Blake. Each footstep caused her soft sole to press Blake down harder, burying the transformed mage under her foot, and flattening him more and more into his new insole form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Raven did tell me this would be over in seven days right?</i> For an instant Blake was a little nervous. Magic was a fickle mistress and so many things could go wrong with even the best cast spells. Conditions and rules were in place, and Blake earnestly hoped that Violet wouldn't accidentally break one. He was already hitting his limit just from a walk that was less than an hour! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after awhile, Violet completed her paper route and returned home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! I'm glad that's over with!\" She said with a chuckle, as she opened the front door, and stepped inside. She hung up her keys, and slid each of her sandals off, making a face as she felt her footwear practically slide off. \"Oh man, it was worse than I thought.\" She said, looking directly at her insole-- directly at Blake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Violet! Can you hear me?!\" Blake called out to her, straining with all his might to make any sort of motion that Violet might pick up on. But the goth's eyes only reflected mild embarrassment at him, as she began to move Blake back toward the ground. A sweaty imprint of Violet's foot was plastered over Blake, practically imprinting the mage with her footprint. Violet pushed her sandals back away in her room, and began to walk away, Blake staring, helplessly at the soles that had pummeled him walking away, and hoping that Raven hadn't been lying and that he'd be finding himself in a new form soon. Any new form would do, he couldn't handle that again. He knew now he was in the form of Violet's gladiator sandals and that she would absolutely use him again at the first opportunity. Blake wasn't prepared to deal with her soles a second time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would Blake be so fortunate?</span></div></div>",

First, the mage woke up in darkness, then the drawer opened to reveal the large and cute face of his friend Vixen, the new girl at school.

He could faintly feel her legs moving once the girl had fully dressed herself in her favorite light blue tube shirt, matching skirt, and ballet flats. The fact that Vixen's skirt blocked most of the helpless boy's vision drove Blake to a horrifying conclusion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been turned into a pair of panties for the new girl at Opal High!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen smiled to herself as she made her way into the school building, then her homeroom, backpack in tow. She glanced around at her peers and noticed that something seemed...different. One of the normally-occupied seats was empty. Shrugging, the new girl took her own seat and prepared for the day's lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, meanwhile, felt himself being pressed against a smooth wooden surface.

The two were close, but not to the point of having romantic feelings for each other. Craving some caffeine after a rough night, Ms. Solar parted her lips to reveal the moist darkness of her mouth. Blake became even more terrified when the rim of his prison met Ms. Solar's rosy-red lips, pouring some of his fluid form down her gullet.

Wherever he was, it was too dark to see anything, and all he could hear were the faint sounds of a heart beating and someone breathing. Something was pushing into him from below, holding him up and pressing him together, and he felt himself rise a little and then fall repeatedly, in unison with that breathing. Inside of him, something sloshed about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly perplexed, Blake tried to remember what had happened to him, but his recollection of the day was foggy and muddled. He needed to find out where he was, hoping that would jog his memory, and luckily he knew the perfect spell for that. It was an old scouting spell, one that let a mage make an image of the area and people around him within his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young mage focused intently and soon felt his the picture begin to form, and he was greeted by the image of a female chest concealed in an orange collar shirt. That wasn\u2019t much to go on, so he focused harder. The mental image expanded to reveal the whole body of the person that chest belonged to: Ms. Solar. The teacher was sitting at her desk, busy marking some papers and sipping away at a cup of coffee. Why was he Ms. Solar\u2019s\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered what happened to him. His concentration broke as it all flooded back, the mental picture of the woman shattering and splintering like glass in his head before dispersing at his realization. He had become Ms. Solar\u2019s breasts after she had digested his coffee form! The skin, the nipple, the fat, the milk. He had become all of it, held firmly within her bra and forced to softy bounce with her movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware of the boy\u2019s situation, Ms. Solar finished her paperwork, and took the final chug of her coffee. As she felt it slip down her throat, she reflected on how inferior it was to her last cup. \u201cNot nearly as good as you, Blake.\u201d Ms. Solar said, patting her gut affectionately. She briefly wondered if he was okay in there, but she pushed it aside quickly. He could use magic, so she was sure he had a spell or two that would get him out in one piece. Maybe he was even enjoying the ride and would want to do it again! She licked her lips at the idea. \u201cI might be getting to addicted to Blake-brand coffee!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelepathy wasn\u2019t an option anymore, not to the furious Blake. There were other spells he knew, nefarious ones that the normally moral boy wouldn\u2019t dare use, but right now he was angrier than he\u2019d ever been at being betrayed, consumed and trapped by his teacher. Returning to normal was priority number one, and if Ms. Solar was going to stand in the way, she had to be dealt with\u2026 </span></div></div>",

It was an insidious hex; invented by mages of old for use in warfare and sabotage. He had been taught to only ever use it in most dire of situations, and he briefly pondered if perhaps he was going too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt his teacher stretch, making her supple breasts \u2013 <i>him</i> \u2013 jiggle slightly within her tight bra and reminding him of what she\u2019d done. \u201cNo. This is only fair.\u201d He growled to himself, and began focusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her stretch, Ms. Solar spared a glance at the clock above the classroom door. She sighed disappointingly at the sight. Still so much time left until she was free and still so much paper work to do, with only this second-rate brew to nourish her. Yesterday it would easily have kept her content, but now, after tasting Blake, it only left her with a taste of utter disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Blake\u2026\u201d She moaned longingly as she caressed her belly. She fantasized about what else his magic could turn him into, and licked her lips at the idea of a Blake-made cake. She unexpectedly belched, then giggled to hide her embarrassment. \u201cNaughty boy! You\u2019re not allowed to come back up now\u2026 even if I do quite fancy drinking you again.\u201d As she teased her delicious student, Ms. Solar reached over to her desk drawer to get the rest of the unmarked papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand stopped itself just before the handle. The teacher glanced down at the unresponsive limb, perplexed, before a ghostly chill pulsed down her spine. She tried to scream, but her mouth slammed shut and refused to open. She tried to stand, but her legs refused to budge. She tried to grasp her head, to stop an invasive pain that crept up from her chest, but her hands refused, instead digging her fingers into the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Solar panicked. <i>W-what\u2019s happening to me?!</i> She was being overtaken by some unnatural force, as if she was being cursed\u2026 Her pupils shrunk. <i>Blake?!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her possessed hands gave her a thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Blake! Wait, please!</i> Ms. Solar begged in her mind. She felt her consciousness growing weaker, being suppressed by the magical invader. <i>I\u2019m sorry about drinking you! I\u2019ll never do it again, just please stop whatever it is you\u2019r-</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind faltered and gave way. Everything went black to Ms. Solar.</span></div></div>",

Well, not \u201chis\u201d eyes; the eyes of the body he had just succeeded in taking over. Sharply he inhaled, taking in that refreshing, if stale, air that had been robbed from him along with his physical form, before glancing down at his newly acquired bosom. The spell he had just used allowed the user to swap around consciousnesses with the target\u2019s. So if he was now here then Ms. Solar must be in his former prison. With a vengeful smirk, he grabbed the breasts tightly and began playfully squeezing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the darkness, Ms. Solar was in a fit of panic. She felt like she had been split in two, and each half was being held in place by some sort of net. Inside of her she felt liquid gently slosh with the rhyme of her faint movements, and behind her something loudly beat, with every thump it made sending a ghostly pulse through her. The situation, which she couldn\u2019t remember how she got into, was wrecking her brain in confusion. \u201cW-w-where am I?\u201d She voicelessly cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer she got was a pair of beasts descending on her from both sides and forcing her two pieces together. \u201cAH!\u201d The force and path of the assault fluctuated erratically; sometimes one side was stronger that the other, sometimes they were equal, and sometimes they\u2019d change direction entirely, like pushing her up and letting her fall. Her mind scrambled frantically under the torture before finally she remembered how she got here. \u201cBlake, please turn me back! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d She desperately pleaded. It fell on deaf ears, the attack continuing without pause. The teacher whimpered in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Blake released the mounds from his grasp, letting them bounce back into their resting state. The mage was in no way satisfied punishing his teacher, but he shoved his revenge aside for now. He needed to get his real body back before the spell wore off, least he once again be trapped in the bust of his teacher, and to do that he\u2019d need to get his spellbook! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a readying breath, \u201cMs. Solar\u201d stood up and took a step towards the classroom door. When the sound of heel clicked firmly against the floor he smiled proudly. <i>Maybe this won\u2019t be so hard after all\u2026</i> Then he took another step and harshly slammed against the chalkboard, violently slapping around his breasts. <i>Damn high heels!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he stumbled out into the empty corridor. Thankfully it seemed the school was pretty much deserted, and there was no one around to watch the teacher suspiciously shamble about. Hurrying as best he could with such annoying foot wear, \u201cMs. Solar\u201d marched along, the determination of a mage blaring in her eyes. </span></div></div>",

They lifted him up, bringing him out the darkness that had surrounded him and into the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was given him a good, if a little blurry, view of the world he had been transported to as he was taken higher. It was a kitchen. He was in a kitchen; one that looked so familiar. His mind lurched as it searched for the answer he knew was there, but the panic of his sudden transformation was still clogging his thoughts and keeping it just out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, his twin escorts finally brought him to a gently halt. He turned his vision around, and was met by a face so familiar no mental haze could possibly stop him from recognizing them. \u201cMOM?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother Claire was sitting at the kitchen table, staring down through her reading glasses at the papers before her. It was a sight Blake had seen many times going to or coming back from school, but never like this, transformed and at the mercy of her fingers. The mage realized his mind was still to distorted to let him use any magic, preventing him from contacting her in his mouthless state, so instead the watched her like a hawk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire clicked her tongue as she swapped to another paper with her other hand, obviously quite tired of her work. <i>She works herself too hard\u2026</i> Blake mused. Often he\u2019d catch her overworking herself, and she didn\u2019t seem to stop no matter how many times he or Jade would scold her for it. Normally, if he saw her in such a rundown state, he would prepare for her a nice and warm cup of coffee, something she was very appreciate of, even if drinking it meant spiting out or swallowing her favorite min-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hit him like a truck.

He looked down, to see his mother\u2019s handbag below him on the table, it\u2019s dark interior where the she had plucked him from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom always chewed on mints when she worked. More often than not, she\u2019d swallow them too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no.</i> Blake mentally muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on queue, he was brought closer to his mother\u2019s mouth, from where her tongue slipped out and dragged itself slowly across his surface. His panic soared into absolute terror as the soaking muscle left it\u2019s wet mark upon the entirety of his front side, and somehow that terror broke the absolute limit as he watched her mouth slowly open before him. The glistening, pink cave was more than willing to accept him, to thoroughly chomp and chew him for the pleasure of it\u2019s master, and was more than likely planning on sending him down the dark and haunting abyss that rested at it\u2019s end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ever once of his being, Blake fought against the fog in his mind as he desperately tried to stir up enough magic for a telepathy spell. He could feel the hot breath tingly along his minty skin as he was drawn closer and closer towards Claire\u2019s awaiting cavern. <i>Focus! Focus!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his destination, her expecting tongue, only a second away, Blake finally screamed out. \u201cMOM! STOP!\u201d </span></div></div>",

She\u2019d remember that face for the rest of her long life, and would most certainly use it to cheer herself up when she happened to be down in the dumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, after some recollection, she quickly came to find it disappointing. Sure, her enemy was gone for the moment, forced against his will to become an item for someone else\u2019s (hopefully painful) use, but for how long would he stay gone? The spell, as powerful as it was, was also completely random in what it turned it\u2019s target into and where they went. What was to say he didn\u2019t end up discovered by someone more than willing and able to help return him to normal. That, she mused with a scowl, would be absolutely no fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could still sense her spell clinging to him as it dragged his unwilling soul farther and farther away. A nefarious idea fluttered into her head. While she couldn\u2019t change the course of the spell, she could trick it through a portal to another realm. And that would put her dear little nemesis in an even deeper level of trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind set, Raven closed her eyes and whispered the enchantment for the portal spell.

While sleepy looking through his spellbook last night, he finally found a recipe for a potion that would make Aria fall in love with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was to excited to sleep and had made the batch of potion under the light of the moon. Letting out a big yawn, he slipped into his clothes and walked out of his house to get the love of his life. Blake had an easy plan, he was going to cover a piece of cake he had saved for her with the potion and let Aria eat it, then she would soon fall madly in love with him and they could be happy forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake reached the front door of his crush, he began to feel nervous and scared. \"Y-you can do this Blake.\" The mage told himself, knocking on the door to alert Aria. The door swung open to reveal the beautiful face of Blake's crush, Aria. With a smile she greeted him, \"Oh hi Blake, what's up?\" He calm voice floating through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh hey Aria....I I'm, did some baking last night and I...Thought you might want a slice of my cake?\" Blake said, embarrassment on his face and in his voice. Aria giggled in response and took the cake gently from him, \"Of course Blake, I love baked goods.\" She happily said, ripping off a tiny piece and eating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had a breif conversation while Aria ate the rest of her treat. \"Well Blake it was nice.....To,.....Ohhh....I don't feel well...\" She said, leaning around before falling into the mages arms. \"A-aria?! Are you alright?!?\" Blake asked with fear, not knowing what went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly casted a transportation spell to bring them both to Blake's secret hideout, placing Aria safely on a bed. \"Aria, speak to me!\" The mage yelled out, pleading that he hadn't killed his crush. As he looked down at her, he saw Aria slowly open her eyes....As well as something else....Aria's hand was see through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....What did I do?!\" Blake yelled as he started to flip through his spellbook to the page he found. His heart stopped as he reread the page from last night. \"This love potion was used by spirits to attract the ones they loved in the afterlife. This potion is not to be used on living creatures, as it will slowly turn them into a phantom before disappearing all together! This fatal transformation is know as Phantasmic Syndrome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt like he had just killed the one person he loved. Aria looked up weakly at her friend, \"B-blake...W-what did you do to me?\" She said, lifitng her hand up into view. \"B-blake?! W-whats going on?!\" Aria began to panic. The mage quickly tried to calm her down, \"A-aria please...I'm going to fix this....I need a cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back in the book, Blake let out a gasp at the next bit of information. \"The only cure for Phantasmic Syndrome can be found at the heart of the underworld, the land of the dead, the demon kings castle.\" This wasn't looking good for Blake. Very few have ever survived a trip to see Lord Samedi and lived to tell the tale. \"Blake...Please...What happened.\" Aria asked so very afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake let out a small tear before going to the bedside of his love, \"Aria...I need to go and find a cure for you. Please stay here, you'll be safe and sound......I have been....Meaning to tell you this for awhile.....I'm actually....A mage....\" He said shyly as it felt like he had let doelwn his crush. \"I can answer any questions you have when I get back. But I need to go find your cute before you *gulps* ... . Disappear forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aria could protest, Blake had already summoned a portal. Looking back, he blew Aria a kiss before stepping inside letting the portal close behind him. As he arrive in the underworld, Blake found that.....</span></div></div>",

I hope you're ready, because I know she is....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was completely confused as the Lord Samedi called over a strange shadow from afar.

Raven has been telling me how she has needed a test subject for quite sometime now....And she has told me how you would be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavens smile grew as she lifted her wand towards Blake, \"Samedi told me you need to survive a week with me!

The woman smirked up above him, lifting her foot off of the shrunken mage. Blake struggled to get up, or move at all, but found himself barely able to budge. His squished and twisted form was taking several moments to recover from his rival's aggressive stomp. He was completely powerless to resist as Raven reached down to pluck him from the ground. An inch away from snatching Blake up, however, Raven hesitated, and a callous smirk crossed her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gave a sigh of relief, thinking that Raven had reconsidered, but the sorceress continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Picking up with my fingers that is. That's just gross. All you are is foot dirt now, Blake.\" Blake's heart plummeted, as he watched Raven slide off her boot, revealing a pale, bare foot, glistening with sweat. Her foot hovered over Blake for several moments as Raven drank in her rival's humiliation. Then stomped down onto Blake, instantly undoing all of Blake's progress in reconstituting himself. Raven scraped her foot back and forth over Blake several moments, crushing and flattening him under her sole, like putty, before lifting up. For one long, agonizing moment, Blake felt himself painfully pulled between the ground and Raven's foot. Just like gum. Dammit, Raven had turned him into human gum! Unfortunately for Blake, Raven's foot won the tug of war, and he snapped up into her sole. stuck fast. Raven giggled like a school girl as she slowly took hold of her boot. True she could have done all this much faster, but she wanted to savor this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven drew her boot closer, and then, making sure Blake had as good a view as possible, began to slide her foot inside. Blake's world began to dim, and grow hotter as Raven pulled her tight, suffocating boot on. Blake found he was struggling to breathe. The air was so thick and humid in here. One couldn't say that Raven's feet were the worst smelling things he'd ever encountered, to be fair. It seemed she cared for at least basic hygiene. But a day up on her feet, in <i>these</i> boots, was sure to cause anyone's feet to develop the atmosphere Blake found himself suffering in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, and without warning, he felt a tremendous pressure crush down on him. To be honest.... To merely call it \"pressure\" was to do it disservice. It was unlikely that any human had ever experienced this kind of weight pressed upon them, without expiring instantly. Before they had the chance to feel much pain at all. Blake, was not so fortunate. Blake tried to scream out in pain, but had no breath for it. He then realized that this unbelievable crushing pressure-- as though a mountain was placed on top of him, was nothing more than Raven standing. The heat, the pressure, the stink... If hell existed (and Blake was fairly certain it did), this must be something of what it was like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Raven started walking. The process was dizzying, and, in some ways, even worse than the consistent pressure. Blake experienced vertigo, as her foot lifted and fell again, crushing him with new force each and every time. From his small size, it felt like Raven was moving impossibly fast, not slow and ponderous as a giant might be expected. And with every step, it was as though a meteor was falling on Blake. And yet, her spell held true and Blake wasn't killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven, meanwhile, had an extra skip in her step. This was amazing! Her foolish rival, practically gift wrapped for her. And she had an entire week to do with as she pleased with him. One hundred and sixty eight hours. Over ten thousand minutes. And she knew, with a wicked smile, that every one of those minutes would feel like days to Blake. But as she followed this line of thought, she began to wonder. Maybe this didn't have to be limited to only a week. She paused for a moment, pressing as much weight as possible onto Blake, and feeling the tiny mage squish pleasantly under her sole. Did she really have to release Blake after an entire week? Or could she maybe figure out a loophole in her rival's contract to keep him longer? After all, she had lots of experiments, and Blake <i>did</i> feel good underfoot. But then again, while Lord Samedi could respect a good argument, he was equally dangerous to cross or disappoint. As her rival underfoot right now could attest. As Raven considered this, she began to tap her foot on Blake, tormenting him further, but also so that she could feel that wonderful little \"squish\" as her foot came down each time. She smiled. This was like a gel insole, only even better! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven quickly came to a decision and began to stride off again. Raven's decision was....</span></div></div>",

There had to be a way to keep Blake in his proper place, and she was determined to find the loophole to do so. Giving a firm stomp, Raven let out a delighted chuckle as the young mage smeared across her toes. \"Lord Samedi takes time in writing his deals, but something tells me he didn't quite think this one through for you, Blake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven happily stomped her way back to the place she called home. A small Manor sat on a hill, raised over the rest of the surrounding area. It might seen as just a typical \"spooky\" location, but Raven had chosen that spot specifically so she could always know she was above everyone else. That included the stain in her boot looking to fix his true love. This Aria girl was just an innocent caught in the way of Ravens goal; but it was the price to pay to put Blake where he belonged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Raven entered her home she made her way straight to the letter sent by Lord Samedi, just as Blake had entered the underworld. \"If Blake should choose an alternative trial, he shall be entrusted to you for a week. You may do whatever you wish with him, but he must be freed and rewarded at the end.\" Raven looked over this passage again and again. It wasn't a long agreement, yet the wording made her think this would work in her favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Blake was left to be idly toyed with as Raven tried to find any excuse to keep him longer. Each of the toes drummed away on the squished mage's body. A small symphony of squishes and weak groans echoing inside Ravens boot. Any chance of relief for Blake was instantly shot down by the firm clenching of the toes surrounding his face. \"AHA! That's it! Oh Blake, you're in for the long haul now~\" she said with a devilish smirk, quickly grabbing a potion meant to take her straight to Lord Samedi in the event of an emergency. To Raven, this was of the upmost importance~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Samedi was sitting in his personal throne, as if expecting Ravens arrival all this time. When the black clad figure finally appeared before him, the silence was quickly broken. \"What is it now, Raven. Come to argue against my deal...again?\" Normally, in a situation like this, she would be terrified of upsetting Lord Samedi when things were going her way. But confidence was running through Raven, she knew she could win this debate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in fact, I have and with good reasoning too. You weren't clear when you set the length of time to a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence overtook the chamber, Lord Samedi's expression staying mute as the words sunk in. \"....a week means a week, Raven.\" He plainly said, quickly being countered by Raven. \"But for how long? You didn't say if it was by underworld time, earth time, other planets, or other plains of existence. If I were to go...say somewhere else where a week isn't seven days, then your deal isn't over untill a week passes there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Samedi's expression perked up a bit, he was impressed. It was rare that a being could win a debate against him, especially when a deal was on the line. Blake on the other hand was terrified. The thought of being stuck with Raven as a test subject for more than a week was unthinkable! He had to get that potion to help Aria, what was she thinking back home? Alone and becoming a spirit with each passing moment; and it was all Blake's fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven...I can't believe I'm saying this, but by my own deal...you are correct. If Blake is in a realm where time moves at a different pace, then his week lasts as long as it does in that world.\" Raven nearly screamed with joy right then and there. Instead, her toes slapped down in excitement. Five massive roommates welcoming there newest friend to an extended stay. \"Thank you, Lord Samedi, I just want to clarify that little detail before I ventured off with Blake. I've got some tests to try out in him at our new destination~ Which of course will be the Venuclear Plain, where a single day is 243 days on Earth. Blake will either learn to enjoy his position...or I might get bored and bring him back~ Now then, farewell Lord Samedi, I'm off to try out my next test on Blake.

The mage felt a certain stuffiness in the underworld air, but it was still manageable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in the clearing appeared a dark-cloaked figure. He was a rather tall fellow compared to Blake, and he wore a top hat decorated with skulls.

For a deity of death, he was surprisingly friendly with visitors. \"I know of your little...predicament.

But together, you might have a chance! ...Not much of a chance, but still a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Lord Samedi vanished in a burst of black smoke before leaving some last guidance. \"Your first ingredient waits at the volcanic heart of Volatile Valley, just east from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn't believe what he'd gotten himself into...but if he wanted to save his crush from onlivion, he'd have to press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Blake...\" Raven sighed. \"I REALLY don't like you. But, since my own existence could be at risk, as well as my social life, I'll help you out on your little quest. Besides, there's the saying 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Blake spoke at last. \"Well, Lord Samedi isn't really my enemy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, THAT'S why I don't like you.\"</span></div></div>",

The black marks from earlier magical explosions clung around his fingers, bringing their prints out. There were still a few dark specks across his glasses, too, narrowing his range of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Cough*...Another night without results...\" He murmured, head pointed to the ground. A small green vial rested in his hand, so loose it nearly dragged across the school's tiled floor. The mage glanced over it, twisting it back and forth. \"This muscle-growth liquid... this last one should work, but... class starts soon, and... *zzz*... the last twelve all ended up just... growing my ears... nose...\" Failing to hide his tiredness, his soles slid in a slow pattern, while his droning voice slipped and slurred over words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther students stepped out of the way. As if a hex or invisible force field surrounded the boy, they avoided his path. Even ambush-ready bullies looked in the other direction. Something foul, more than the lingering musk, had caught on him during the magical experiments. He barely took notice of the reactions around. His eyelids sagged, to say nothing of the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnh... I'll try it right after... Zzz...\" He shook his head, black hair floating around, concentrating on moving one foot in front of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one person was brave enough to stand in his way. One young woman approached Blake, ignoring the subconscious warning lights and sirens in her head. A girl following her golden heart and logic through that inexplicable fear. Her lemon-tinted shoes shuffled hesitantly, soft eyes looking her friend over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat person, Aria, finally walked up to her friend. Blake didn't stop walking, his brain still set on auto-drive (and eyes still covered by sleep and soot). So she scooted up, slender fingers interlocked behind her skirt, and asked: \"Hey, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time his ears registered his crush's voice, and his brain processed the question, the young man had already walked right into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both sputtered in surprise almost simultaneously. The teens crashed to the ground together. A snickering crowd stared from the nearby lockers as they got up, making their already-blushing faces even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria was the first to rise, dusting her clothes off. Her fingers felt a touch heavier, her head dizzy from the impact... and a little wet. She slowly offered her hand to the dark-haired boy. \"Do you need help? I really should've been more careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, nearly ready to collapse to the floor, groaned out: \"Sorry, sorry, no, you're - you're good... I can... get up...\" He pushed himself from the floor, on his knees - then instantly crashed down from fatigue. He shook his head. \"Yes. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their fingers touched, the boy's poor heart lit up for a second. In front of all these people, it was more than embarrassing. He'd get teased for this a lot in the future. But just for a moment, he felt separate from all that. He was in another world at his lover's Midas Touch. Her hand was much larger and warmer than he remembered, and he had to stretch his fingers out to fit around it. In fact, it was getting bigger every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe froze. His tired eyes snapped open, a chilling realization rushing over him - like the time Nora put ice cubes into his gym shorts. When he looked at the girl before him, he had to gaze up to make eye contact. And the vial wasn't in his hands. He shivered. \"A-Aria... where's that... that thing I was holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to him with curiosity, surprised at having to move her neck down. Her eyes came across a bit of green liquid dripping down her clothes. It ended at her shoes, where the vial lay - empty. She put a hand to her mouth, immediately leaning over to pick it up. \"Oh, sorry! Was it something important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shivered. He'd intended to use the potion on himself, get beefy - even just for a day - but his last few attempts had all sorts of effects. He still didn't know if this one would work out. Come to think of it, Aria's hold was stronger than any girl he'd met - even the ones giving him swirlies. (Then again, that was his main frame of reference for female contact.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lied: \"No... nothing big...\" His shaking hands reached into his bag, pulling out a backup shirt. \"Here... To... to make up for it... It might be a bit large, s-sorry...\" Was it just his tiredness, or was the hallway smaller compared to this girl? He didn't dare speak. The crowd edged away more, chattering things he couldn't make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving picked up the container - which fit easily between her index and thumb - she took for up the shirt, and held it to her chest. Even with the sleeves spread out, they didn't reach her shoulders. She stood up to get a better sense - hand her brown hair crashed into a ceiling light. \"Ow!\" She cried out more in surprise than pain. The sound vibrated through the halls, sounding out loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople now began running away, leaving the two in relative privacy. At least, until a few concerned teachers and friends gazed from the hall, a safe distance away. Aria was clearly growing. She had to lie down to even fit in the hallway. Her face had a pained expression across it, glancing left and right in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh no...\" She shut her eyes, but could still feel the lockers brushing against her thighs and arms. Within a few seconds, she flattened them into scrap metal. Her face clenched, and she didn't dare to speak beyond a whisper - or several whimpers that she let out in tiny spurts. \"What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake covered his eyes, too - and found Aria's ground-level chest pressing into him. He jumped away instantly, but found the thing pushing him again. Her clothes had absorbed some of the magical liquid, which the mage was partly thankful for... He wouldn't have been able to forgive himself for publicly revealing her. But at the same time, the formula sunk deep into her skin. And it turned out, this one made one's body grow at an even rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sputtered out: \"Uhm... *gulp* That formula, it... It was sorta... important...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer, just holding her hands into fists to endure the process. The walls now cracked and groaned as soft skin and soft fabric made contact with them. Her expanding shape smashed open some windows, and twisted doors. She kept shuddering and shivering even after the process had ended. The schoolgirl was now 50 feet tall. Yellow dominated the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake now lay against her, trembling just as much. He did his best to say reassuring nothings, even though he could barely move his mouth. It looked like anything Aria did would make her smash the school apart. And by now, his secret life as a mage was in jeopardy. But most than that, he'd destroyed his friend's chances for a normal life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a step back, looking up over her. She was struggling to hide her own worry, standing still. She didn't say a word, feeling like even speaking would be destructive.</span></div></div>",

Looking up at the goddess that was Aria, Blake began to plan how he was going to get into her body. \"Well...

He would be able to see what happens to food first hand, without becoming part of it himself. Quickly he jogged over to Indigo's plate while she was busy looking over her room for something. She steps away from the plate, giving Blake enough time to sneak into the sandwich. This fills Blake with excitement and a little bit of nervousness. He didn't know quite what to expect. He mixes himself in with mustard, tomato, and lettuce and waits for Indigo to return. A short while later and his patience pays off. Indigo walks back into the kitchen then picks up the plate. Though he couldn't really see it, Blake had a sense of Vertigo as he was lifted quickly into the air, something most people don't really pay attention to when they're carrying light stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk Blake feels the plate lower and clank softly onto a surface. She must have moved back into her room. He peaks out from the sandwich and looks up to see Indigo moving around and looking at her screen. It looks like she's reading... a story or site of some kind...Before Blake can get a clear look, Indigo sits down and reaches for the sandwich and lifts it. Blake snaps back to reality and shuffles a bit back, not wanting to be part of the first bite. Just as he finishes shuffling a set of teeth tear into where Blake had just been. The sandwich pulls back and reveals Indigo's blissfully unaware face as she simply eats her lunch. Blake watches as she chews the bit of food in her mouth, a look of satisfaction coming across her face. Some time passes between the next bite as she reads the site. Then she brings the sandwich back to her face, revealing the inside to Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second Blake sees so much detail. Indigo's tongue, red with bits of mashed bread. Her perfect teeth stained from bits of lettuce and specks of tomato. Deeper into her mouth are her molars, uvula and her throat itself. Her molars are just like the rest of her teeth, left with traces of pulverized food.He sees the uvula in the back darker red and very plush looking. and just beyond and under that is her throat.. the entry point to her body's digestive system. As soon as he finishes analyzing the scenery, Indigo snaps her teeth into sandwich behind Blake and brings him inside her mouth. Immediately Blake slips out before she can move him to her teeth and just in time too as Indigo begins to chew. Blake watches first hand how a person eats their food. While a bit gross, it was still fascinating. Blake watched around him as the sandwich he had hid himself in became nothing more than mush that collected on Indigo's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after enough of the sandwich was chewed the wad of mush was moved by Indigo's colossal tongue. Blake was swept into the mess as well, accidentally taking a small mouthful of the food as well. While he spit most of it out some of it he accidentally swallowed, blushing brightly. He tried to wiggle out but found he was stuck and could not move. Indigo let out soft sigh that let Blake catch a glimpse of the outside world, a view that he most likely wouldn't see for a while. Then Indigo swallows Blake, along with the mass, down into her. Peristalsis takes ahold of the wad and pulls and compresses it downward towards Indigo's gut. Indigo's warm flesh rubbed and brushed against Blake on his descent and caused the mage to blush some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way down he could actually hear the deep breaths of Indigo, taking in oxygen and dispersing it through her body and into her thunderous heart which he also passed as well. The loud thumping nearly deafening Blake as he slipped deeper into his unaware friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his journey was brought to a halt as the wad bumped onto something... then oozed into what could only be, the stomach. The fall, saliva as well as peristalsis helped ease and break down the food around Blake and helped him slip out of the masticated food. It was dark as one would expect the inside of the human body to be, but Blake could still faintly see the red walls and the lake of digestive fluids already starting to break down the first bite of food. Saliva and mucus lined to stomach walls making everything look and feel very wet, slippery, and squishy. Blake took a few steps and found the \"floor\" had a lot of give but still had an underlining of muscle that supported him. Deep above him he could hear a giggle.followed by a gentle whirring from outside... Indigo had lightly felt him moving around and his actions tickled her, confused she simply thought it was a trick of the mind and she resigned to just rub her belly to soothe herself. Blake looks around the cavern and wonders just what to do now.</span></div></div>",

Blake nodded and explained, \"So, I have a biology project and test really soon and I need help studying for it.\" Claire could hear a bit of worry in her son's voice. \"I assume that you forgot to study?\" She asked, which Blake hesitantly nodded to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed with a smirk, \"Let me guess. You were too busy daydreaming about Aria again.\" \"Maybe...\" Blake said with a blush. Claire chuckled and pat Blake on the back. \"Calm down. It's fine. I'll help you.\" She said, causing Blake to smile. \"Yes! Thank you!\" He nearly shouted. Claire covered her ears. \"You're welcome. Just try to not to shout next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck was apparently on the teenager's side once again. Now all he needed to do was shrink. Though a problem was that Claire would probably freak out if Blake started shrinking if she didn't know why. However, it's possible that she'd assume that it was to help Blake study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Blake do?</span></div></div>",

She did agree that it would help her, but she was still concerned with having the shrunken boy in her mouth. \"Like I said before, I'll be fine. I have spells that will protect me.\" Blake reassured.

She began rolling and tossing the boy with her tongue, trying to keep him away from her teeth as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake soon found himself underneath his mother's tongue. Soon, she began teasing him by licking him and bringing him near her throat, only to bring the boy back to the front of her mouth. Blake felt his face and lower body heat up. While Claire was unaware of this, Blake was desperately trying to calm himself down. Claire, on the other hand, moaned quietly as she began to get more comfortable with having Blake in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes of teasing the boy, she decided that she had enough fun and was comfortable enough to continue with Blake's request. She then brought Blake to the back of her throat and swallowed him. She winced in pain as she felt the boy travel down her esophagus. \"Ow. Okay, that was more painful than I thought it was going to be.\" She whispered, rubbing her neck. \"Blake, are you okay, hun?\" She asked, only to receive a moan in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" He said tiredly.

Claire sighed in relief and sat down on the couch. \"So, what now?\" She asked.

Claire, on the other hand, sat down on the couch, looking at her stomach, paranoid for her son's safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after a little shorter than a minute of time that he landed in Claire's stomach. Thankfully, his spells were keeping him safe from the acids around him. He then conjured up another spell to communicate with his mother. \"Mom?\" He called, nearly startling the worried Claire. \"Blake? Are you alright?\" She asked, quickly standing up in a mix of shock, worry, and relief. The movement caused the acids and partially digested food to move in a wave-like fashion, startling the tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down! Please!\" He shouted, freaking out in the acids around him. Worried, Claire sat back down and tried to calm herself down. After several seconds of excruciating patience, Blake let out a sigh of relief. \"Okay. Okay, I'm alright now.\" He said, hearing his mother sigh in relief and exhaustion. \"Don't scare me like that again, please.\" She said. She was going to have to be extremely careful about her movements now that Blake was inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you in there?\" She asked. Blake looked at his surroundings, before answering, \"I'm alright now.\" The sight of his own mother's stomach was incredible. He felt like he was in a cave that explorers and archeologists go into, aside from the partially digested food. \"It's strange. I...never knew what I would feel being in someone, but this..\" He paused, before continuing with complete honesty, \"This is incredible.\" Claire chuckled at the boy's sense of adventure. \"Well, I'm glad that I could help.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt the area shake suddenly, as if it was an earthquake. \"Um..Mom? Your stomach is rumb-\" the boy was cut off by an unexpected and loud burp from Claire. \"Ah, so that's why.\" He sighed, feeling his beating heart. \"Sorry.\" Claire apologized, blushing at how unexpectedly loud the burp was. After a couple minutes of silence, Claire asked, \"So, what now?\" Blake froze. In all honesty, he hadn't planned this far ahead. His spells would protect him for an infinite amount of time, until he was out of his mother's body. However, his biology test and project were going to happen very soon and he would rather not fail it. He then made his decision and said, \"I think I...\"</span></div></div>",

Claire turned around, gasping. \u201cBlake, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Claire asked. The various small objects went back to their original positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, can I ask you for help with something important?\u201d Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Blake's deep embarrassment, the part of the biology exam that he was having the most trouble with dealt with the female reproductive system. Having no experience with the opposite sex certainly didn't help matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it be okay if I explored your reproductive system?\u201d Blake asked. He could feel his face turn bright red. The spirit let out a surprised cough. \u201cI mean, only if you're okay with it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to go back to where you began, huh?\u201d Claire said with a chuckle. To Blake's immense relief, his mother didn't seem too upset. Her reddening cheeks showed that she was probably just as embarrassed as her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's just, all the tubes and things are really confusing, and to be honest, I probably spent too much time daydreaming in class,\u201d Blake said, nervously twiddling his thumbs. With a smile, Claire moved closer and planted a kiss on her son's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine. You know I'd do anything to help my little man,\u201d Claire said, rubbing Blake's shoulder. \u201cSpeaking of little, how exactly are you going to make yourself small enough for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a shrinking spell, but I have to get some stuff ready first,\u201d Blake said. \u201cCan you meet me in your bedroom in ten minutes? I'll be on your dresser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can't wait,\u201d Claire said, with a sly smile. She turned her attention back to the television as Blake hurried up the stairs to his room. He could feel his heart racing as he closed his bedroom door. He was really going to explore the human body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what exactly are you going to bring on this little expedition?\u201d the spirit asked, as Blake grabbed his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I figure I'll be doing a lot of spelunking, so I'll conjure up some rope and a grappling hook. Oh, and a high-powered headlamp, too,\u201d Blake said, as he created a magic circle on the floor. The items magically materialized, and Blake stuffed the rope and hook into the backpack, and fastened the LED headlamp into his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don't you have to pay for that?\u201d the spirit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine. I'll send them back to the Netherworld when I'm done,\u201d Blake said. He left his room and walked across the hall to his mother's bedroom. He opened the door and stepped onto the plush carpet. He spotted the perfectly-made bed and the ornate wooden dresser across the room. Stepping in front of the dresser, Blake ordered the spirit to shrink him to half an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere? Are you sure? Your mom might step on you!\u201d the spirit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry. I have a little surprise in store.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here goes nothing,\u201d the spirit said. A magic circle appeared at Blake's feet, and he felt a rush of magical energy flow into his body. In a flash so bright it hurt his eyes, Blake suddenly found himself among a forest of carpet fibers. Each thick strand was as tall as himself. He uncoiled the rope and hook from his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026 not to burst your bubble or anything, but that rope ain't long enough to reach all the way up there,\u201d the spirit said. Certainly, the top of the dresser loomed far above Blake's head. Undaunted, he began to twirl the grappling hook above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this was an ordinary rope, then you'd be right. But this is no ordinary rope! Observe!\u201d Blake said, releasing the rope. Magically, the hook shot straight up, making contact with the plateau of the dresser far above their heads. The rope grew in length as well, and all Blake had to do was hold on and he flew up the sheer surface of the wooden dresser. In no time at all, he was in top of the wooden surface, looking at his tiny reflection in the gargantuan mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'll be damned. But I guess I already am,\u201d the spirit said. Blake gathered up the rope, which magically shrunk to a much more manageable size. He put it back in his backpack and looked around at his surroundings. A nearby tube of lipstick towered over him, and it looked like he was small enough to comfortably fit on the tip. Blake's attention turned toward the door as he heard his mother's footsteps come down the hallway. He gasped in awe as she strode through the doorway. Even from across the room, Claire looked like a towering monument of femininity. \u201cBlake? Are you in here?\u201d Claire asked, looking around the room with a confused expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm over here, Mom!\u201d Blake said using his magic to amplify his voice. Claire walked over to the dresser, obviously confused. \u201cI can hear you, but where are you?\u201d Claire said. She stepped in front of the dresser, causing Blake to crane his head all the way up just to glimpse his mother's face. If Claire's distant visage was shrouded by clouds like a majestic, fog-covered mountaintop, then Blake wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Her crotch was directly in front of him, and the tiny boy found himself growing excited at the prospect of spelunking in his mother's sacred cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm down here!\u201d Blake said, blinking his headlamp on and off to catch his mother's eye. Claire bent down to investigate the flashing light, and gasped as she recognized her tiny son. \u201cBlake, is that really you? You're so tiny!\u201d Claire said, perplexed. \u201cI guess this wasn't all some kind of prank, after all!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, it's all magic,\u201d Blake said. \u201cSo, uh, how exactly do you want to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right! I guess I'll have to get undressed, won't I?\u201d Claire said with a giggle, as she started to blush. Blake turned away to give his mother some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018It's okay to look, Blakey. Consider it a review for your exam. Plus, I know boys your age can't look away from a beautiful woman!\u201d Claire said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn! You're a lucky kid,\u201d the spirit said. \u201cWell, the other kids at school are always teasing me about how pretty they think my mom is,\u201d Blake whispered to the spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked toward the bed and unbuckled her belt, then unzipped her skirt and let it fall to the floor. Next, she unbuttoned her dress shirt and took it off, leaving her in just her underwear and pantyhose. Blake marvelled at the tautness of his mother's abdomen. Claire had often used the gym at her workplace, and the results were on full display. She pulled her pantyhose down her long, lean legs. Her bare toes sank into the carpet as she stepped out of her tights. Reaching behind her back, she unclasped her bra, letting her large breasts hang free. Finally, she took off her panties, and Blake's eyes were immediately drawn to the spot between her legs that he longed to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid, if I had a mouth, I guarantee I would be drooling right now,\u201d the spirit said. Blake could only nod in agreement, speechless at the sight of his mother's gorgeous, nude body. Claire looked like a statue of a Greek goddess come to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked back to the dresser and bent over to look at her tiny son, causing her breasts to hang down like twin moons. \u201cWell, I guess we should get started,\u201d Claire said, putting her right hand palm down the dresser. Blake approached the outstretched fingers, amazed that he could see every whorl and spiral in his mom's fingerprints. He noticed that he was just about as tall as Claire's fingertip. He placed his hands on his mom's soft skin, feeling her warmth. He tried to climb onto Claire's fingertip, but the slight incline caused him to lose purchase on her skin, and he fell backwards. He could feel the hard surface of the edge of Claire's fingernail on his butt. The giant woman giggled softly at her son's failed attempt to summit her finger. Undaunted, Blake's moved around to the side of his mother's index finger and pulled himself up. His feet sank into her as he began to slowly walk toward her palm. He leapt over the ridge between her finger and palm and arrived at the center of Claire's hand after a short walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on tight, sweetie. Mommy wants to take a good look at you,\u201d Claire said softly. Blake felt a bit of vertigo as his mother gently lifted her hand up to her face. He first passed the canyon of his mother's abdominal muscles, then the twin mountains of Claire's breasts. Blake kept his balance on his mother's palm as he went by her slender neck, then her full lips and the small hill of her nose. His fleshy elevator finally stopped in front of the blue orbs of his mother's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're so tiny!\u201d Claire said, obviously astonished. Blake could feel her warm breath wash over his body. He waved up at his mom from her palm. He could see every pore and wrinkle in her beautiful face. He had to admit, his mom's skincare regimen worked wonders. In fact, Claire's body was in such great shape that Blake wanted to explore her mountains and valleys before he plunged into her cave. He wondered if he should ask his mom if he could climb her body before he descended into her depths.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Cliffs turned into plains as his mother laid back. After propping her head on a pillow, she gently placed her hand down on her groin, just below her belly button. Blake walked to the end of her finger and hopped down, gently landing on the soft, warm flesh. He looked back at his mom's smiling face, framed by the twin peaks of her breasts. He began the short walk to her hairless pubic mound. His mother's thighs gently rose on either side of his tiny body like rolling hills, and Blake could see Claire\u2019s bare feet reaching towards the heavens far away. The terrain began to slope downwards as Blake reached the end of Claire\u2019s pubic mound. The smooth cliff face under his feet was bisected by a pink curtain of flesh that appeared to be tightly closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mom, here I go!\u201d Blake called up to his mother\u2019s face. He was glad that his magic allowed her to hear him in case he got into any kind of trouble. \u201cBe careful, sweetie!\u201d Claire said. Blake turned around and got on his hands and knees, crawling backward until he felt his feet dangle over open air. He slowly climbed downward, using the small wrinkles of the pink flesh as hand and footholds. His hand brushed against a small mound of flesh, causing Claire to emit a loud gasp. Her whole body trembled enough to nearly throw the tiny boy to the bed. \u201cSorry Mom! Did I hurt you?\u201d Blake asked, worried. \u201cNo, not at all, sweetie! You just surprised me, that\u2019s all!\u201d Claire said. Blake was relieved that he didn\u2019t injure his mother in some way. He descended further down Claire\u2019s labia until he reached a point where her vagina should be, if he recalled his health class notes correctly. He moved over horizontally, feeling along the pink lips until his hands felt the groove that separates the inner labia from his mother's deeper folds. He stuck his hand inside, feeling the warm, sticky flesh against his hand. Arms straining, he tried to open the pink curtain enough to allow his tiny body to slip through. He slipped his arm up to the shoulder, but the lips remained closed. Defeated, the tiny boy climbed back up the labia. He collapsed in a sweaty heap onto his mother's pubic mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlakey? Are you alright? What happened?\u201d Claire asked, her voice tinged with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm fine, Mom,\u201d Blake said, looking up at her goddess-like face in the distance. \u201cI just can't find a way to get inside. It's all closed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026 that's probably because I'm still a bit nervous,\u201d Claire said. <br>\r\n\u201cUsually, couples will start with some foreplay to help their bodies get ready for sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, kissing and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right, Blakey. How about you climb on my hand again, and we'll start with some kissing? Then you'll see how my body starts to change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire set her hand on her stomach palm up, waiting for her tiny son to climb aboard. Blake sat at the center of his mother's hand as she gently lifted it into the air. The vast plains of Claire's body became cliffs again as she sat up. She brought her hand up until the heel of her hand was touching her chin, allowing her son to simply walk up to her mouth. At this close range, Blake could see every wrinkle in his mother's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I tell you this all the time, but I really do this think that you're really handsome,\u201d Claire said. Blake could see hints of his mother's sparkling white teeth and pink tongue hiding right behind her plump lips. Blake realized that his mother's mouth was another cavern he wanted to explore. She licked her lips seductively, and Blake felt droplets of saliva splash his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mom. And\u2026 I think you're really pretty,\u201d Blake said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, thanks sweetie. Now why don't you give Mommy a big ol smootch,\u201d Claire said, pursing her lips. Blake leaned into Claire's lower lip and tried to kiss her like he would do with a lover. Blake heard a deep moan come from his mother's throat. He felt some changes happening between his legs as Claire's lips enveloped his entire body like a warm blanket. Finally, Claire's lips pulled back, leaving Blake gasping for breath on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was really good, sweetie. Now, there's another place you can touch,\u201d Claire said. She laid back down on the bed and placed her hand at the base of her breasts. Blake looked up at the twin peaks that towered over him, each one capped by a pink peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy here, Mom?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, a woman's nipples get very sensitive when she gets in the mood to make love. Try climbing up there and giving my nipple one on your famous massages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was told, Blake stepped off his mother's hand and began to scale the breast. He marveled at a blue vein passing just under her skin, sending rivers of blood flowing through her body. Claire's large breasts were still quite firm, and Blake had no trouble climbing. The skin began to darken and turn bumpy as he reached the summit. The areola surrounded Claire's nipple, which was in a relaxed state. Blake cracked his knuckles and set to work kneading the nipple. Claire moaned again, a sound so deep he could feel it under his feet. To his surprise, the nipple began to grow and harden as he massaged the pink flesh. Claire's hand reached up and began to caress the nipple on the opposite peak. From the look of bliss on his mother's face, Blake guessed that he was doing a good job. Claire's other hand moved between her legs and began touching a spot that was currently out of the tiny boy\u2019s view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to touch you there next, Mom?\u201d Blake asked his mother, who was biting her lip with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh, sure, sweetie,\u201d Claire said softly, as if she just woke up from a dream. \u201cHop on.\u201d Claire's hand stopped moving between her legs and moved to the base of the breast that Blake was currently occupying. He sat on his butt and slid down the reverse slope of the breast, tumbling to a stop in the middle of his mother's palm. She moved her hand across her body once again, and Blake moved to the edge of the palm to gaze out at the scenery once more. He noticed that his mother's body had begun to sweat slightly. Claire's hand stopped near her navel, allowing him to step off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if you touch me down there a little bit, then I'll open up a little more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike this?\u201d Blake said, sitting down and rubbing the skin of her pubic mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry touching me here, honey,\u201d Claire's voice boomed from above. Blake ducked as his mother's hand soared over his head. Claire's hand came to rest on her pubic mound palm down, her thumb resting right next to her tiny son. Claire's whole body trembled as her index finger began to rub a spot where her labial lips came together. Curious as to what his mother was doing, Blake climbed onto Claire's thumb, using the ridges of her knuckle for support. He pulled himself onto her index finger and began to climb down. The small movements of her finger nearly shook him loose, but Blake continued his descent down the digit until he reached the short, natural fingernail. He slid down the smooth nail, falling a short distance through the air before bouncing off a fleshy bump. Claire let out a moan as her finger stopped moving. Blake finally saw what his mother was playing with: the small mound of flesh that had caused Claire to gasp when Blake had accidentally touched it earlier now had a pink ball in its center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's that, Mom?\u201d Blake asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's my clitoris, sweetie. A woman's clit emerges when she becomes aroused. If you touch it, then I'll definitely open up enough for you to climb on in,\u201d Claire said. Eager to continue his adventure, and happy that his mom seemed to be having so much fun, Blake placed his hands on the pink dome and began to rub. Blake looked over his shoulder as and saw that his mom's toes were curling with pleasure. Claire moaned again as Blake touched his mother's clitoris as if he was trying to squash a basketball. A new, distinct smell rose in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should be good now, sweetie,\u201d Claire said with husky breaths. \u201cYou should be able to go inside me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Mom!\u201d Blake said. Giving the clit one final flick for good luck, he began to climb back down the vaginal lips. He noticed that the pink flesh was now coated in a thin layer of slippery fluid. As he worked his way down, he noticed that the lips had parted slightly towards the bottom. Grabbing the lips with both hands, he swung his legs and launched himself into his mother's vagina. His forward momentum carried him a little ways into the warm flesh, but soon he was completely surrounded by the ribbed vaginal walls.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I'd be sweating, if I still had skin,\u201d the spirit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned on his headlamp. He was in a tunnel of undulating flesh, surrounded by cloying warmth. It was like being in a massive, living sleeping bag. Using his arms and legs, the tiny boy army-crawled his way forward. Blake could hear the thunderous drumbeat of his mother's heart in the distance, along with her steady breathing. Every so often, a single touch from Claire's tiny son against her moist walls would solicit a deep moan that would reverberate throughout the organic chamber. Eventually, the constricting flesh gave way to a slightly larger chamber. A round, button-shaped ring stood guard against the far wall. A small hole pierced its center. Curious, Blake took out his grappling hook and twirled it in the air, aiming for the hole. His aim was true, and the hook found its way through the center of the hole. When the grapples found purchase on the flesh, Claire unleashed a moan so powerful that it shook Blake right off his feet. Undaunted, he grabbed the rope and started to climb, bracing his feet against the flesh. When he reached the hole in the center, he found that he was once again too big to fit inside. He stuck his arm inside the hole, which caused a shudder to come from his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mom, what's this ring at the end of your vagina?\u201d Blake asked, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's my cervix, sweetie,\u201d Claire said. He could both hear her voice both from the flesh surrounding him and in his head thanks to his magic, creating a weird stereo effect. \u201cIt allows sperm into a woman's body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it's all closed up,\u201d Blake said, disappointed. He wanted to venture even deeper into his mother's reproductive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it dilates when a woman orgasms,\u201d Claire explained. \u201cIf you want to explore my womb, then do you want to help me orgasm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Mom! But how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust rub against my inner walls, sweetie. But things will start to get wet and wild, so be careful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow will I know when you orgasm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire chuckled, a sound that Blake felt vibrating in his bones. \u201cOh, you'll know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his grappling hook in place, Blake climbed back down the cervix. He ran back into the vagina, rubbing his entire body against the walls. The ribbed walls began to smoothen out and elongate, giving the tiny boy a little more breathing room. The heat and humidity began to increase to stifling levels as his mother's heartbeat pounded ever faster. Sticky, strong-smelling fluid surrounded him, drenching his clothes. He stuck his tongue out and licked the walls, letting the tangy fluid linger on his tongue. When his fingers touched a particularly spongy part of the fleshy wall, Claire let out a sharp gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Right there, sweetie! Keep touching that spot!\u201d Claire said through ragged breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rubbed the g-spot for all he was worth, even grinding his crotch against the flesh, which felt pretty good for him, too. Suddenly, Claire screamed in pleasure, and her vaginal muscles squeezed her tiny son in a warm, wet hug as she orgasmed. A tidal wave of fluid washed over Blake, sending him tumbling end over end towards the entrance of the vagina. When he finally came to a stop, he readjusted his crooked headlamp. He made his way back to the cervix, swimming through pools of thick fluid on the way. Just as his mother promised, the cervix was slightly opened. Excited, he grabbed onto the rope and climbed up. When he reached the hole, he found it was just large enough for the tiny boy to wriggle through.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two minutes? That would be a tough time to beat, especially at his size. One false move and he could immediately lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy bit his lip and nodded, \"Sounds good. Just let me know when you're ready?\" Claire nodded and began setting up the timer, before laying down on the bed and placing Blake at her collarbone. \"Alright. Almost set. You ready?\" She asked, receiving a eager nod from her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, she nodded and went back to the phone, \"Alright. On your mark...\" Blake got into position. \"Get set....

Blake immediately dashed towards his destination as fast as possible, going in between his mother's breasts and traveling across her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, running on living surface was more difficult than he expected, as he almost tripped up when he made it to Claire's abs. He did make it to the woman's nether regions though and immediately turned around to head back to his mother's collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty seconds left...\" Claire said, causing Blake to run faster. Once again, he struggled with going across the woman's abdomen, but managed to clear it as he went in between the woman's cleavage. \"Five, four...\" Claire started counting down, causing some panic for the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit!'

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake immediate began to regret covering his entire body with a hard shell of chocolate, as his dick began to stiffen at the intense experience of being inside his mother's mouth. But with nowhere to escape, Blake's dick pressed painfully against his chocolate-covered crotch. He wished he could break his arms free to release the pressure, but they remained pinned to his sides, as if he was a chocolate mummy. Claire's tongue rose up and pressed her tiny son against the roof of her mouth. She moaned as she held him there for a second before slowly dragging him against her hard palate. Blake could feel every ridge pressing against his body, as his dick cried out to be pressed against the warm, moist flesh. When he saw the chocolate smear he left behind on the roof of Claire\u2019s mouth, Blake realized that the combination of heat and saliva in his mother's mouth was slowly melting his chocolate shell. He could just barely wiggle his arms now, but he still couldn't reach down far enough to touch himself. Claire's tongue next moved him to the side of her mouth, gently depositing him on her molars. His tiny body fit neatly on the flat, crushing surface of the tooth. As he wondered what his mom was doing, he saw her jaw begin to close. The upper molars pressed against his body, squeezing him between the hard enamel. But rather than feel like he was squashed in a vice grip, the pressure was instead gentle, and Blake felt the chocolate shell begin to crack and flake off. Claire slowly worked her jaw up and down, and soon enough chocolate melted from Blake's crotch that his dick sprang free like a bird leaving its egg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard surface of Claire's molar pressed against his dick, inadvertently rubbing the sensitive head of his cock against the smooth surface. Before he could have a chance to cum, Claire's tongue returned to pick up her tiny son and move him to the front of her mouth. With his back to her front teeth and his feet on her gums, the tip of Claire's tongue began to sensually lick the front of Blake's body. Each lick covered him with warm saliva and removed another layer of the chocolate shell from his body. A puddle of melted brown chocolate began to form on her tongue, floating atop a thick layer of saliva. Claire's tongue worked its way from the top of Blake's head down to his feet, lingering sensually around his crotch long enough to send shivers of pleasure throughout his body, but moving on to his legs before he could reach climax. Blake felt certain that his mother could feel his rock-hard dick rubbing against her tongue, but wondered if she was trying to prolong his pleasure or just teasing her tiny son by denying him release. When his arms finally broke free of their chocolate restraints, he reached down to pleasure himself, but the thick saliva coating his body meant that he couldn't get a firm grip on his cock. Frustrated, he tried to move his hips to grind against the meaty surface as the tongue was a whale-sized lover. As if sensing Blake's distress, Claire's tongue came to the rescue, focusing all its attention on his suffering cock. Claire ran her tongue along the length of her son's shaft, gently probing his dick and even letting his balls rest on the surface of her tongue. Blake was surprised that Claire's tongue was dextrous enough to massage his cockhead, the massive tongue moving with the grace of a ballet dancer. It wasn't long before Blake came powerfully, grabbing two fistfuls of taste buds in his hands as his seed shot out in an arc, landing with a plop in a puddle of melted chocolate in the middle of his mother's tongue. He chuckled as the resulting concoction of chocolate and semen resembled a mix of white and dark chocolate. The tongue froze up for a second, as if savoring this new taste before Claire moaned erotically, the sound reverberating throughout the organic chamber. Blake offered no resistance as the tongue lifted Blake up and moved him to the center of the mouth. Blake lied on his back and tried to make a snow angel in the puddle of chocolate by spreading his arms out wide. Looking up, Blake saw his mother's uvula rise into the air, and he knew immediate what would come next. The suction pulled him down the throat, along with a bubble of chocolate, saliva, and semen. The fleshy tube squeezed his body as it moved him down, and he slipped through a muscular ring and landed on an island of chewed-up strawberries in his mom's stomach. He cast a spell to illuminate the humid chamber, watching with awe as his mother's gastric juices began to dissolve her latest meal and thankful that he cast protective spells on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Claire could literally feel how excited Blake was to be eaten, she wasn't surprised when she tasted the unmistakable flavor of her son's cum on her tongue. She was a little shocked, however, at the growing warmth in her own nether regions as she toyed with her miniscule son in her mouth. Her fingers slipped into the waistband of her panties when she swallowed Blake, but she decided that touching herself at the kitchen table was probably not the best idea. She rose from her seat and walked up to her bedroom, taking slow steps so as not to disturb her tiny passenger resting in her stomach. When she got to her room, she quickly slipped off her panties, noticing the dampness of her nether lips. Shortly after laying down, she slipped her fingers inside of herself. She bit her lip, but couldn't suppress a lewd moan when she felt movement inside her stomach. Figuring that Blake was also getting into the act, she quickly reached orgasm, shouting with release. Inside Claire's stomach, Blake blushed when he heard his mother's thunderous heartbeat quicken and her rapid movements left no doubt that she was pleasuring herself. Wanting to share this experience with his mother, he used his invincible hands to paddle his raft made of partially digested food over to the side of the stomach. He pressed his dick against the stomach wall, feeling a rush of pleasure as the stomach wall began to constrict and expand to digest the food in Claire's stomach. The movement of the fleshy wall rubbed against his cock, and he released at the same time he heard his mother make a deafening moan. His cum splashed against the stomach wall before dripping down and sliding down into the pool of stomach acid, to be digested along with the food. Blake sighed contentedly, happy that he was able to have such an amazing experience with the woman he loved. Just as he closed his eyes, he felt a rumble shake through the stomach. He got to his feet just as his mushy raft broke apart and sank into the bubbling ocean, leaving him treading water.</span></div></div>",

He then heard the water being turned off and froze in fear, \"Shit...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake immediately hid himself under the covers as best he could and poked his head out to watch his teacher drying her hair and air drying her body. The boy blushed heavily and hid his head in embarrassment. Feina stretched her arms and yawned. \"It's been a long day.\" She said tiredly. She could really use the sleep right now. She was already for bed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina laid on the king-sized bed and sighed. It was warm enough, so she didn't get under the comforter. She didn't even notice Blake, who was currently still hiding and blushing. This was possibly the most embarrassing moment of his life. Well, as of now, at least. Feina put an arm underneath her pillow to prop it up. She turned to look at a book on her nightstand and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too tired to read tonight and she was going to need the rest for tomorrow. Sighing, she closed her eyes and fell asleep. Hearing the soft light snores from his teacher, Blake poked his head out and found Feina asleep...and still nude. Blake blushed even more, but decided to be brave and do what he needed to do. The problem was... Where was he going to go on his teacher?</span></div></div>",

Next time you do something like this, tell me first and I can help you!\" \"No problem, Jade,\" Blake agreed. \"Now, PLEASE help me get back to normal. I have to get home and get to my spell book.

The mage was sitting home, bored out of his mind as he sat on his bed. With a sad sigh Blake looked down at his phone, with magical capabilities it allowed him to talk to anyone from the realm of the living and the dead. Sadly, anyone Blake would want to spend time with was out on vacation. Even Aria, the love of Blake's life, was on an extended stay in the Bahamas. \"Everyone gets to have fun except for me.\" Blake sighed, sinking into is bed as footsteps approached his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, honey, I'm heading off to my office party soon~\" came the sweet sounding voice of Blake's mom, Claire. She was as loving and caring of a mom that anyone could ask for. Claire was a happy mom at age 38, had short cut black hair, green eyes, and a nice tone body. Along with her basic motherly acts, she was a high ranked business woman at a company downtown called Jengain. The company specialized in building and delivering a wide variety of furniture and other products. Claire worked in the tower downtown to handle the business side of thing, and tonight was the annual office party. Blake had always wanted to see what went on there, as his mom always came home with a wonderful gift basket and a rather large bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left you some leftovers in the fridge, your sister is over at a friends house, and I should be back after midnight.\" she said happily to the mage. \"Alright mom, thank you. I love you, have fun.\" Blake happily replied. Even though they lived in the same house, Blake never let his mom find out that he was a mage. A crazy thought came into Blake's mind, what if he went along. As his mother walked back towards his room he thought about his plan, \"Everyone else is having fun tonight, I deserve to have a good time too!\" he said, grabbing his pocket spell book and moving into the living room. \"Alright, no turning back now. To enjoy the night and earn my prize, take my body and shrink my size!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash of light Blake now stood in the center of the living room at the height of two inches. \"Sweet, now to find my ride to the party.\" Blake said, looking around at his options of transportation. Near his current position sat his moms purse, her pair of black heels, and what appeared to be the scarf for her outfit. With the sound of his mom returning, Blake quickly ran towards....</span></div></div>",

The landing was surprisingly painless -- a side effect of his shrinkage? That must be it. The tiny mage looked around the purse with what little light the opening allowed him, noticing a tube of lipstick and a pack of breath mints. As his mother approached, Blake scurried into the darker side of the purse, completely out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire hummed a tune to herself as she put on her black heels, tied on her scarf, and picked up her purse before heading out the front door to her car. The gleeful mother ignited the engine, then started the drive toward her workplace for the party. And, of course, she had no idea that her son had shrunken himself and snuck into her purse in an effort to share in the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited in the purse of his unaware mother, Blake was bounced around unwillingly whenever the car would hit a bumpy spot on the road. At one point, he yelped from the sudden jolt shaking him up!

That was until his moms fingers came reaching in and wrapped around him. Before he even had a chance to react he was tossed into his mothers mouth. Blake didn't dare make a noise, even though he was scared to death. How would his mom react if she found out about him being a mage like this; and how would he even explain it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet maw of Claire proved to be a foul smelling place, probably why she grabbed the breath mint in the first place. Her tongue idly pushed Blake into her cheek, sucking on his tiny body. The motion from his mom pulled on his body, trying to move him to the throat, only to be brought back up and passed to the other side. \"Wow, this is a really good pack of mints. Lets see what it really tastes like.\" she said, moving her son onto her molars and crashing them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became increasingly harder for Blake to stay quiet as his mom started to chew on his body. \"Oh god make it stop\" Blake thought, not wanting to spending the evening as his mothers gum. As she chewed away, she was surprised to feel her 'mint' not disappear, 'Oh! I didn't know I grabbed a pack like this. Thank god, I would have had terrible breath for the party.\" She said, idly chewing away on her son before stepping out of her parked car and into the parking lot of her office. Blake had made it to the party, but not in anyway that he would have liked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would Blake make it inside alright?</span></div></div>",

All the questions, the scoldings, Blake decided to grit and bear this literal tongue-lashing to avoid a verbal one.  Besides, his flavor has to be running out soon right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother had always said he was a sweet kid and unfortunately she wasn't lying.  Those straight teeth continued to gnaw at his miniature form, the magic itself being the only thing keeping him from bursting.  Her monstrous pink tongue kept scooping him up, transporting him over to the other side for more nibbling.  With how disorienting the whole experience was, Blake couldn't even tell if he was on the left or right.  Not that it mattered, both sides had molars eager to mash him.  The rough taste-buds kept rubbing up on him too.  The slimy sensation of each cell grinding against him made Blake question his choice to remain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother's mouth was full of saliva at this point and with Blake not actually being a mint, it stank.  After bathing in the odorous liquid for so long, he dreaded how long of a shower he'd have to take to not reek of halitosis himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually however, the chomps of the teeth slowed and the tongue gave his face fewer visits.

The businesswoman spat out her \"mint\" and saw something rather surprising in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake?!\" Claire reacted to the sight of the tiny boy in her hand. \"How in the world did you get so small? And why were you in my mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny mage wasn't sure what to do at this point -- his attempt to sneak into his mother's office party had ultimately backfired, and now he'd been discovered by his mother, who now looked down at him with a stern, but concerned expression.

She was obviously incredibly concerned, but she trusted her son. \"Just be careful, okay?\" She asked, receiving a thumbs up from Blake. She smiled at his and gave a kiss for good luck. \"As soon as you're in there, use a spell to talk to me, alright?\" She said. Blake nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire bit her lip as she took a deep breath and hesitantly brought Blake into her mouth. She was going to take this slow and make it as enjoyable as possible for him. She started teasing him intensely, causing Blake to moan loudly. His waist felt like it was going to explode with pleasure from the teasing. At this point, Blake was too tired to attempt to resist if he even wanted to. Slowly, Claire's tongue pushed him to her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake found himself at the edge of his mother's throat and felt like he was going to fall in on his own accord. He moved himself to where he was facing away from Claire's throat and towards the inside of her lips. Claire slipped three fingers in to hold onto Blake's hands and delay his journey to her stomach as much as possible. Slowly, she pushed Blake to her throat and both moaned as Blake started to slide down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was now at the point that he was going to burst with pleasure at any second. As soon as his legs were pulled down, Claire used one of her fingers to pat Blake's head before pulling them out. Blake felt the throat muscles squeeze on his waist and finally burst into pleasure, causing both of them to moan. Soon, Blake was pulled down entirely and his mother gave a loud gulp. Claire soon looked at her stomach, worrying about her son's safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like forever to the exhausted Blake, but he soon reached his mother's empty stomach. As he landed, he crawled up to one of the walls and relaxed. \"That...was amazing. So worth...getting caught...\" The tired boy said with a smile. He made a mental note to try that experience again. He remembered about Claire wanting communication with him as soon as he got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately casted the spell and tapped on the inside of Claire's stomach. \"Blake? Are you okay, honey?\" His mother asked nervously. \"Yeah, I'm okay. Just tired.\" The tiny boy said. Claire sighed in relief and smiled. \"Then get some rest if you want.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Blake do?</span></div></div>",

He'd rather not fall asleep and wake up to being buried underneath food and drinks that his mother possibly might have. \"I'm gonna stay up for a while.\" He said, stretching his limbs. Claire hummed to herself. \"Alright. Just let me know if you need anything.\" Her voice echoed around the tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked around him and was still shocked that he was here. He was completely entranced by his mother's stomach and soon let his imagination run wild. \"This is...amazing...! Why have I not thought of this before?\" He asked himself, his mother's breathing and heartbeat echoing around him. His heart started to race again as his mind flash backed to when he was in Claire's mouth. Blake looked down at his waist and silently swore at himself for being too into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Claire was wondering in her own thoughts. It was fun teasing her son like that and it felt nice having him inside her, so long as Blake was safe, alive, and willing. Who knew that she would enjoy this as much as Blake did? \"Now that you're hidden safely, do  you mind telling me about your magic secrets?\" She asked. Blake sighed, he knew this question was going to come up. \"Okay. Yes, I'm a mage.\" He said. \"For how long?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I was...9 or 10 I think.\" Blake said. He had hidden his secret for so long that he didn't remember when he actually started practicing magic. \"I hid it from everyone because I was worried how anyone would react. I'm sorry.\" Blake said quietly. Claire just smiled. \"It's okay, honey. I understand why you hid your talents. I would have done the same.\" She said. \"Just...try to be careful and let me know next time, okay.\" Blake sighed in relief. \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's stomach soon rumbled in hunger. Blake and Claire went into silence. \"Um... Don't you think you should eat? Or drink something at least?\" Blake asked nervously. \"Are you sure?

I know now that I'm really into getting eaten and I know that spell lasts for at least a week, but still.\" He mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake let his mind wonder about what else he and his mother could do with him at this size. While he did enjoy the ideas, he smacked himself for thinking of them. Claire might have enjoyed having him in her stomach, but everything else was most likely a no-go. Oh well. He decided to wait until he got out so he could dream about his ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party had lasted quite longer than Blake expected. Thankfully, Claire kept him up to date with the current time. \"What time is now?\" The boy asked. Both of the two were surprised that Blake was able to keep himself up this late. \"About 11. I'm thinking of bringing us home now.\" His mother said. Blake nodded. \"Alright.\" He felt his face heat up again as he asked, \"Do you mind if I...ask you some personal questions about yourself?\" \"Not at all. Go ahead.\" Claire said, albeit a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fidgeted as his heartbeat and body warmth increased dramatically. \"Um... It might be a little inappropriate and uncomfortable...\" He mumbled, nervously. Claire let out a laugh. \"Blake, us enjoying you inside me was probably inappropriate as well. Nothing is really going to phase me anymore.\" She said, smiling. Blake's eyes widened. 'So she did actually enjoy it. Maybe this won't be so bad...hopefully.' He thought, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just don't do anything when I ask you.\" He said as Claire sat down. \"Alright. I'm just sitting down right now.\" She said. \"So what is this possibly inappropriate question you want to ask?\" Claire teased. Blake took a deep breath. \"What is...um...your b-bust s-s-size?\" He stuttered in absolute embarrassment. Claire blinked a few times to make sure she wasn't hearing things. Her face went as red as a tomato and facepalmed. \"Really, Blake?\" She asked. He did say it was inappropriate, but really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you.\" The tiny boy whispered. He was completely embarrassed now. \"Yes. Yes, I know.\" Claire said, sighing. \"I just didn't think you'd actually ask that.\" Maybe this was her penance for her own personal thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Claire do?</span></div></div>",

Blake's eyes widened as his face went hot,  only to curse at his waist for getting excited again. \"Are telling the truth?\" He asked. Claire hummed quietly. Her face felt like it was on fire at this point. \"Okay.\" Blake said, for lack of trying to find a better word. Claire blinked her eyes. \"I thought you were going to enjoy that information.\" She said. Blake went silent as his blush deepened several times. Claire smirked as Blake stayed silent. \"So you did enjoy it. Are you embarrassed by it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Blake shouted. He was sure his voice gave away his embarrassment. Claire just chuckled. \"Okay. Okay. I'll stop teasing you for now.\" She said. \"I want to take you out as soon as possible. Any ideas?\" She asked, startling her tiny embarrassed son. \"Um...maybe tie something to a line that isn't dissolvable. There are no digestive acids still, so it should be easy to do.\" He said. Claire immediately got up and walked to her desk. She opened it up to find a metal nut. Now she just needed to find a tether or something similar to one. She went through the desk's contents and finally found yarn. It wasn't what she was thinking of, but it would have to do. She tied the yarn around the nut as tight as possible and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake soon saw the nut and hopped on to it, grabbing a hold of the yarn. He tugged on the string, letting his mother know that he was on. Claire took a deep breath and pulled. Blake tightened his grip as he was raised up Claire's esophagus and back into her mouth. Claire pulled Blake out and took deep breaths to make sure she didn't vomit. \"Okay, that was stupid.\" She said. Blake could only nod in agreement. \"Now, where to hide you as we leave?\" She asked, calming down. Blake rubbed his chin in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should Blake hide next?</span></div></div>",

No one else is going to find out. I promise. Just our own little secrets, okay?\" She reassured. It took Blake a good few seconds to respond. He sighed in defeat; his blush deepening and body temperature rising. \"Alright, please just loosen your bra before placing me in.\" He mumbled. Claire smiled and gave the tiny a small kiss before heading to the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire set her tiny son on the edge of the sink as she removed her shirt to readjust her bra. \"You may be 15, but you're still not allowed to look.\" She said. Blake nodded, though he was honestly a little disappointed. After his mother finished, she took him and placed the boy firmly in her cleavage. She then put her shirt back on, keeping Blake hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire immediately went out of the restroom and said her quick goodbyes to her co-workers before heading to her car. She looked under her shirt to make sure Blake was still there. Apparently, he had fallen asleep, whether it was from staying up late or just from being in Claire's cleavage, she didn't know. He did look absolutely adorable though. Claire chuckled as she entered the car and started it's engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right around midnight when they got home. Claire looked under her shirt again to find her tiny boy still sleeping. She just smiled. \"Blake, wake up.\" She said, causing her son to stir. He groggily opened his eyes and yawned. \"What? Where are we?\" He asked, rubbing his eyes. \"We're home, honey.\" His mother said. \"I need you up for a bit so you can one: take a quick shower and two: restore yourself to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded tiredly. \"Okay.\" He yawned. \"Wish that could've lasted longer.\" He said without thinking.

I can expla-\" he was cut off by Claire's giggle. \"You, my tiny son...\" She started. \"Are absolutely adorable.\" She then smiled at him as she locked up her car and entered the house. \"Maybe we can try this again.

It should contain a spell to restore my size.\" Blake replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Claire opened Blake's door, she placed her son on his bed. She was surprised how easy it was to find the spell book, as she assumed that Blake would've hid it more difficultly. She opened the book to a page and showed it to Blake. \"Is this the correct page?\" She asked, receiving a nod from the tiny boy. She placed the opened book in front of her son. \"Alright. This might be a little flashy and bright, so you might want to step back a bit.\" He said with caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Claire was a good distance, Blake activated the spell and in a few seconds, he was back to his original 5' 4'' stature. He clothes also seemed to change back as well. He looked at his mother as the two sighed in relief.

He started up the water and removed his clothes. It had been quite an eventful day and he needed to unwind. As soon as the water was warm enough, he stepped in and began washing his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>------------------------------------------------------------------------{ /b}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower went by pretty quickly, all things considered. As soon as he was finished drying, he put his glasses back on and put on a spare t-shirt and sleep shorts. He walked into the living room to find his mother sitting on the couch, in a small shirt and regular shorts. \"Hey, please sit down. I just want to talk.\" She said, placing her glass of water down on the coffee table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Blake simply said, as he sat next to her. \"What do you want to talk about?\" He asked. Claire sighed as she scratched the back of her head. \"Well... I want to talk about tonight... And your talents.\" She said. \"I'm not angry. I just want to know if you know what you're getting yourself into.\" She reassured. Blake nodded, hesitantly. \"Yes, I do. I'll admit, I'm still a novice, but I'm currently using spell that can be easy to master and remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded. \"I hope you haven't tried anything TOO dangerous.\" She said. Blake huffed out a laugh. \"Not yet. Excluding the shrinking spell, of course.\" He said, giving Claire a little laugh. \"Alright. Now then, about tonight.\" She said. Blake slowly hung his head down. \"I'm still sorry.\" He said, gaining a rub on his shoulder. \"I told you. It's okay. I would have done the same thing in your position.\" Claire reassured. \"I'll be honest, I really enjoyed it.\" She said. \"And I'm happier that you survived through it.\" She said with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had constantly worried about Blake since she found him. Blake could see it in her facial expressions. Both knew that if something like this were to happen again, he would need to use the same spells. He was sure that neither of them wanted Blake to get killed...or worse. \"I'm glad you enjoyed it as much as I did.\" He said, blushing.

Claire almost spit out her water. How the hell did he see her abdomen? Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you peek at me? Even though I told not to?\" She asked, raising an eyebrow. Blake nodded hesitantly. \"I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. I'm teenage boy.\" He said, causing his mother to smirk and roll her. She sort of expected that. \"Yes, they are.

Claire stroked her chin, confused as to Blake's silence, until she grinned, teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to feel them?\" She asked, getting a comedic reaction from her son. \"Um... I...!\" was all he could say. After an awkward two minutes, he nodded. Claire giggled. Even as a teenager, he was still adorable. \"It's okay. Have a feel.\" She said and raised her shirt to show her well-toned abs. Once again, just like with his mother's mouth and stomach, Blake found himself in a trance as he brushed his fingers across Claire's midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lasted for a few minutes, until Blake started to move his hands towards Claire's chest and her waist, unaware. It was only when his mother spoke that he noticed. \"Um...Blake?\" She called out, waking her son from his trance. He blinked a few times before he noticed where his hands were dangerously close to. His blush deepened as he stuttered. \"I-I swear it was an a-a-accident!\" He shouted, waving his hands. Claire blushed and chewed on her lip. \"Well...I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.\" She said. Now it was her turn to be hesitant. Blake stared at her in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it weird, though?\" He asked. Claire shook her head. \"It's only weird if one or both of us make it that way. And I don't think you were, to be completely honest.\" She said. Blake just looked at her as both of their faces heated up immensely. Blake nodded, now feeling a bit better that he wasn't making things weird or awkward for them both. \"I think...I might want to this again at some point. And under the same conditions.\" The boy said, blushing. Much to his surprise, his mother nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might like that as well. Plus, we now know that your immortality and indestructible spells work, so if we remember that then you should be alright and I should be happy.\" She said. Blake nodded. He would remind himself to not die if this was to happen again. \"Our little secret, huh?\" He asked, smirking. Claire smiled and nodded. \"Our little secret.\"</span></div></div>",

Claire nodded in agreement. If he was going to have a relationship with his love interest, then she would need to know a few secrets. \"I'm gonna change my size and shower now.\" Her son said. Claire nodded and brought him to his room to get his spell book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Blake was back to normal and quickly showered. Once he got into some sleepwear, he looked at his mother on the couch, reading through one of her books. \"Um...\" He whispered. Claire looked at him. \"What is it, honey?\" She asked. All of a sudden, Blake's heartbeat accelerated as his mind started flashing back to his shrunken adventure. His face and body started heating up, causing him to slightly panic. He was very aware that his body wanted more shrunken fun with his mother. Claire got up and walked to him in concern. \"Blake, are you alright? Tell me what's wrong.\" She said. Blake bit his lip and slowly calmed his breathing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Blake say?</span></div></div>",

Please tell me so I can help.\" She said. Blake bit his lip as he clenched his hands, nervously. He was going to regret this one way or another, but he couldn't hide it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...um...body...\" He started, breathing rapidly. \"It...um...still wants more... And I can't really control myself any longer.\" He said, bracing himself for the aftermath. Claire was silent as she currently tried to process what her son just said. \"Alright.\" She finally said, almost startling her son. \"But we should go over some ground rules before any of us do anything, okay?\" She said. Blake nodded instantly and sat down with his mother on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, your shrinking spell should have a time limit. I don't want to wake up forgetting that you're tiny and accidentally harm you.\" She said. \"Which brings us to rule 2: make sure that you have your immortality and indestructible spells activated.\" Blake nodded at the rules and agreed whole-heartedly. \"Do you want me to use a communication spell?\" He asked, receiving a nod from Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now with that out of the way, when do you want to start?\" She asked with a teasing smile. Blake scratched the back of his neck in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen should the two have fun?</span></div></div>",

Once he remembered them all, he went to his dresser and changed into some swim trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on time, his mother stepped out of the bathroom, in her undergarments and hair damp. \"Blake, I'm whenever you are.\" She called to him as he held his breath. 'Here goes nothing.' He thought as he went to his mother's bedroom where she was sitting on the bed. \"Calm down, honey. It's only going to be you exploring me at a shrunken size.\" Claire reassured the nervous boy. Blake nodded as he sat down at the end of the bed. Claire smiled and kissed her son's forehead. \"Are you ready?\" She asked. Blake nodded and calmed down his breathing.</span></div></div>",

Claire could only giggle. \"My mouth again, huh?\" She said. \"Alright, but we need to take the necessary precautions first.\" She said, settling her son on the bed as she opened the drawer of her nightstand. She pulled out a long string of what seemed to be yarn or wire. \"Tie the ends of this to your arms. I'm not swallowing you this time.\" She instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded and tied the string to his arms as best he could, before using his magic to make sure that the string had a secure hold on him. Blake gave Claire the thumbs up and slowly Claire opened her mouth. Blake was hating how excited his waist was right now, though he couldn't really blame himself for enjoying this. Blake slowly stepped in and laid down on Claire's tongue. Claire closed her mouth and immediately began teasing the tiny boy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake moaned as his mother played with him. He already felt intense heat coming from between his legs. Blake tensed himself in alarm. 'Not now. Wait until I can't wait any more.' He told himself as his mother licked his small body. Not even a few minutes and already he was about to burst. Claire didn't need Blake to speak in order to noticed. Smiling, Claire brought her son to her throat and gulped on him. Thankfully, she pulled on the string, thus preventing Blake from being swallowed. Now he was lodged in her throat from the torso down. He knew she was playing with him and damn, did he enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire expertly teased the tiny boy by pulling him out of her throat, only to get lodged in again. Blake's body was screaming at him to finally relax and let his pleasure take control. Blake gripped tightly on the string and let the rest of him relax. Holding tightly to the string, Blake felt the heat in between his legs once again and did nothing to stop it. After being lodged in his mothers throat once again, he finally let out a load moan as he burst with pleasure. After sucking on her son's body one last time, Claire pulled the tired boy out of her mouth and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had fun?\" She asked, causing Blake to nod tiredly. \"Good. I enjoyed it as well.\" She said, kissing Blake's arm. Blake slowly used his magic to untie the string from his arms and sighed. \"That was nice...\" He said softly. After a couple minutes, Blake slowly got up and stretched his limbs. \"Okay. I'm ready again.\" He said, getting a chuckle from his mother. \"Alright, kiddo. Where to next?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should Blake have fun next?</span></div></div>",

They were enormous compared to him! They were literally like mountains! He immediately started climbing one of them as Claire smiled, enjoying every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slowly, but surely made it to his mother's nipple and realized it was starting to get erect. Blake and Claire blushed simultaneously. \"Well...\" Blake started, choosing his words carefully. \"I didn't expect that you might get...well...\" His voice lowered to a whisper at the last word, blushing immensely. Claire sighed. \"I...guess it can't be helped when it's this enjoyable.\" She said. Blake looked at her nipple, letting his curiosity take over. \"May I...?\" He asked and Claire nodded silently. Hesitantly, Blake started rubbing, causing Claire to moan. Almost startled, Blake ended up tripping backwards and rolled down until he was at the bottom of his mother's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smirked and decided to use the opportunity to slowly squeeze her son in between them. Blake was able to get up in time, only to be squeezed between the two lumps of soft flesh. He thanked what ever higher power there was that his spell was working at least. Claire could feel him squirming and lowered her hold on him, thus giving the boy some freedom of movement. She soon released him, only to receive an unamused glare. Claire chuckled. \"I'm sorry. It was too good of an opportunity and I just couldn't resist.\" She said. Blake just sighed. He couldn't say anything against that since he had been in worse places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around his mother's well-toned abs, causing her to giggle from being ticklish. Her son was absolutely intrigued by them. \"Was your abdomen always this fit?\" He asked and Claire nodded. \"Thanks to my workout routine, yes.\" She replied. \"Why not show it more often than?\" The boy asked. Claire sighed. \"Honey, you know that would violate my job's dress code.\" She said, causing Blake to pout a bit. \"Though...I might show my abs off more when I'm not working.\" His mother smirked. \"Now than, do you want more, or do you want to call it a night?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

A thought struck Claire's mind and her blushed tripled. \"Well...\" She started, hesitantly. \"There is ONE place you haven't been to yet.\" She then placed Blake on her nipple as she slowly removed her panties. It was only then that Blake got what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's blush was far redder than his mother's and looked at her, bewildered. \"Are you sure about this!?\" He asked, almost shouting. Claire nodded. Both knew how embarrassed they were, but DAMN, they wanted more. Might as well get more. Slowly, Blake hopped on his mother's hand as she brought him to her entrance. The tiny boy blushed heavily and crawled in, feeling himself getting warmer and more excited with every passing second. Needless to say, Claire was feeling the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surprisingly incredibly damp inside, causing Blake to have a bit of difficulty moving in his mother. Claire moaned as Blake struggled to move inside her, getting more wet as Blake attempted to travel further in her. Her son realized that his mother was starting to do the work for him, as he felt Claire pleasing herself. He moaned as he got caught up in Claire's movements, not bothering to move any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was total bliss for Claire and a fantasy come to life for Blake. Both burst at the same time, with pleasure and soon, Blake found himself panting on the bed and completely satisfied. Claire was the same story and slowly picked up the exhausted boy. She smiled. \"Now, are we satisfied?\" She asked, softly. Blake gave a tired smile and nodded. \"Good. Because I am beat.\" Claire said. She noticed that Blake had already fallen asleep and almost laughed, at risk of waking her son up. She put her underwear and bra back on before placing the boy started to slowly grow to a foot tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire took note that this process might take a while. She smiled and kissed her son on his forehead. \"Good night, kiddo.\" She whispered, before placing Blake near her breasts and falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b></b>The Next Day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire woke up to a heavy weight on her at 7:00 in the morning. She looked down groggily to noticed a normal sized Blake, sleeping next to her and using her breasts as a pillow. Thankfully, she remembered last night before she could freak out. She calmed her breathing and sighed with a smile. She brushed the boy's hair as he mumbled in his sleep. Claire just giggled. \"Blake, it's time to get up.\" She said, only for the boy to cuddle deeper. His mother snorted and giggled. \"Blake, honey, I got work soon. You also got school.\" She said. This time, Blake grunted and slowly got up, still half-asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed heavily as he started to wake up though. In shock, he accidentally fell over the side of the bed, hitting the floor. The teen grunted in pain, slowly getting up as his mother laughed. \"Are you alright?\" She asked. Her son nodded. \"Yes. So last night really did happen?\" He asked with a blush. Claire nodded, also blushing. \"Yeah. But I really liked it.\" She admitted truthfully with a smile.Blake looked at her for a good seven seconds before grinning. Claire chuckled. \"Alright, go get ready for school. I'm sure you don't want to be late.\" She said as Blake snapped out of his goofy smile and ran upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother giggled. Just because they had strange fantasies, didn't mean they would care for each other any less. In fact, Claire thought it actually made her and her son's bond stronger.</span></div></div>",

He found it hard to speak even if he wanted to. It made him want to shrink into an invisible little dot on the folds of her palm. Even at his current size, the plain white walls of the Jengain office towered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No answer?\" Claire massaged her temples, underneath her dark bangs. \"Hmph, this is too much. Can't we work together on this?\" Her breath blew out with that same smell - still foul. It turns out chewing on his body wasn't a very good freshener. Before he realized what he was doing, he lifted a hand to cover his nose. Her eyelids narrowed with repressed anger. Still, the shrunken teen didn't dare speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke again, nearly blowing her son offhand: \"Please. You're a nice boy. Don't make this hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, looking down with regret. Revealing his intentions would ruin chances of his future allowance raises. And revealing his magic skills - well, that'd ruin chances of his future, period. \"Really, mom, I - I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair flew a little as her head shook. \"But I know when you're hiding something. Even when your eyes are this small, I can still see right into them.\" Every time her mouth opened, he could see the full, horrifying details of the landscape he'd just escaped. The little drips of saliva from the edge of her uvula made him shiver as they caught the dim ceiling light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say!\" The mage paced backwards, trying to get away from the all-encompassing face before him. From his tiny perspective, he could make out a few blemishes and wrinkles that she'd hidden under thin makeup. A steep incline behind him halted his reverse voyage. Claire was curling her fingers up, forming a ramp, then a wall, then a shell around him as they fell more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her wrist- it didn't stop turning upwards. He could see the rug pattern below.  What was she doing? At this rate, Blake was starting to slide, and would soon end up dropping into her mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office worker still kept a hand to her forehead, as if attempting to hold back a migraine's throbbing. \"We're already late. Honey, if you feel like telling me later this night, go ahead.\" Her breath blew against his wet clothes, but wasn't enough to counter the force of gravity. The smell from the warm air was still fairly foul. \"But there was a reason I needed that breath mint. I didn't have time to brush my teeth. If you won't speak to me like a person, then you could at least help clean them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped, and instantly regretted it. Her face opened, like ancient doors to a forbidden realm; and in a second, he'd fall in. She wasn't smiling, or frowning; in fact, he'd never seen his mother so neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooom, don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, he fell back into the familiar darkness. Now, her jaw was held deathly still. Saliva pooled up at his ankles; the boy instinctively lifted one tiny shoe in disgust. He couldn't see a place he could put it down without landing in Claire's warm fluids once more. In fact, he could barely see anything, beyond a thin outline. To the left and the right, only vague, wet shimmers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder his breath, Blake chanted a spell. Dim light glowed from his hands, illuminating the area inside the monolithic mouth. He almost regretted that; with the brightness only covering the bottom half, it gave the area ominous shadows. Like when he'd put a flashlight under his chin to tell horror stories to Jade... The light flickered against the row of her firm, eggshell teeth, on and off. His magic couldn't keep going forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething caught his eye - and his nose. A brown chunk of something, with hints of leaf-like green. Yes, there was a bit of leftover lunch caught between her front teeth at the bottom; and it disgusted him how easily he could distinguish it. Club sandwich. Mayonnaise-heavy. He swallowed his pride - and his fear - and stepped towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his gentle footsteps made her tongue flex slightly in discomfort. He lost his footing once before getting to the end. \"M-mom... I can't believe this...\" Whether she heard him or not, she couldn't answer in a public place. Only a simple hum rang through his head and limbs, shaking through the cavern of thick saliva and pink muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the crumbs and lettuce sediments, tugging forward. No movement. With another hard pull, he only managed to dislodge some of it, breaking the food chunk in half. The rest remained stuck hard between the ivory towers of enamel. If only something could lubricate it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his breath, he reached below. His hands cupped, Blake quickly grabbed some of his mother's salty spit. Its pale, bubbly surface glowed a warm yellow from his illumination spell. In a rush, he spilled it over the lunchtime remains. Even after it splashed across the surface, he still felt the saliva clinging between his fingers; the sensation made him want to throw up. Especially when he realized that was only ONE tooth; many more formed an impenetrable wall, keeping him enclosed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back, he groaned. \"At least I'm not alone tonight.\" Shaking below made even this seated position uncomfortable; he quickly set back to cleaning Claire's teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Claire was walking down the halls of her building. Her legs moved gently, but quickly. Keeping her body language was more important with clients than coworkers. And even more crucial was keeping her son in check - whether that meant punishing him, or ensuring he wouldn't fall down her throat. Her eyes hit target after target, each turn and door a checkpoint where she'd flex her tongue gently to make sure Blake was still there. At the elevator, she felt him gripping hard on the muscle, trying to stay in place. She might have tossed a reassuring word to him if there weren't other people there with her. Instead, she maintained a natural smile. It wasn't too hard for her. Brightness was part of her personal brand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving scraped out only the third crumb from his mother's teeth, Blake was already about to collapse. The office lady's liquids soaked him, from casual clothing to brown hair. It dripped from his glasses to his feet, and there wasn't a single dry surface to wipe them on. His arms felt ready to drop to the ground, too. He panted desperately for air; but each inhale only brought more of that murky, foul breath into his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the dangers of admitting his whole past to his mother... How he'd gotten his magical book... The things he did behind her back... The ways he'd covered it up from her... It wouldn't work. She could spill it that to the entire world. Even if it just stayed their secret, she'd never trust him with anything again. She had to stay in the dark about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis magic light giving out, it seemed he'd be in the dark pretty soon, too. Things were getting desperate. Without thinking, he whispered another spell:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Misty mountains' rivers, oceans' ebb and flow - cast yourselves into my hands, and let my power grow!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, cold water erupted from his hands in a torrent. He struggled to control its currents, legs buckling on the squishy tongue against the force. Gritting his teeth, and keeping his arms pointed out to the white walls, he hosed them over slowly, washing away nearly imperceptible bits of dirt and food that added to the odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to hold himself, he fell over - and more of the water splashed across the roof of her mouth, before raining down upon him. Still not knowing how to conjure liquid, his spell only took whatever fluids it could find nearby. In this case, Claire's saliva came to his hands. And now, it crashed down on his unprepared face like a waterfall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food on the office tables was salivating. Almost alarmingly so - the businesswoman didn't remember drooling this much since her mother still cooked for her. She licked her lips. Suddenly, when they retreated, she felt a squirming against the plush surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMixed emotions filled Blake. On one hand, the torrent on his face ended. He'd escaped the deluge and musty air, and could see natural light. Only, he could also see the floor a precarious distance down, only a slide off his mother's lips. And anyone looking forward could probably see him. He grabbed hard, as the pink behemoth cast its shadow over him once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire effortlessly slurped her son back in upon realizing her mistake. She gave polite nods to everyone around, and spoke in monosyllabic greetings and responses that didn't use too many mouth movements - \"Hi\", \"Hello\", \"Oh\", \"I see\". Each time, she covered her mouth, as if laughing at some in-joke. Really, she'd have liked to add more in - but she also needed to make sure Blake learned to be respectful and honest with her. After all, she acted the same towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, those appetizers looked very enticing. Juicy fruits and vegetables. Crunchy, though... A friend seemed to take notice, of her curious gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the celery. It's from my garden!\" The woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shrugged \"Not hungry...\" She spoke without moving her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're worrying about a diet, aren't you? They're perfectly healthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands twitched - first in offense at that statement, then in fear. She suddenly recognized this woman: a manager of another Jengain branch. And with the company's budget cuts coming up... If she offended this manager somehow, vegetables wouldn't be the only thing on the chopping block. For the first time that night, Blake's mother felt very small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to...</span></div></div>",

The businesswoman picked up a stalk of the green veggie and raised it towards her opening maw, before taking a bite of the stuff. It was surprisingly tasty! Claire chewed the bit of celery for a good minute, savoring the flavor, and swallowed. Eager for more of this blissful bounty, she continued to eat the celery stalk leisurely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin his mother's mouth, Blake looked on with dread as he saw a great green stalk enter his prison. The tiny mage tried to yell for her to stop, but was halted by Claire's teeth coming down to chew her snack. Powerless to stall his fate, Blake and the masticated celery were flicked down the dark throat with a quick gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some futile struggling in his mom's throat, Blake finally fell into the depths of her stomach with a splash. It was hard to see much in here, and it smelt of Claire's pasta dinner. The walls pulsated steadily, and a greenish, acidic lake bubbled nearby. The shrunken boy, in a panic, rushed to the nearest fleshy wall and pounded his tiny fists against its surface repeatedly, yelling for help all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, having finished her celery stalk and started some small talk with the other woman, suddenly felt a cramp in her gut.

Worse, the acids of this organic prison cell were starting to rise to the tiny mage\u2019s feet and legs, irritating the skin they made contact with. The juices quickly overwhelmed poor Blake, and in mere moments he fell unconscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing down a baby carrot with a delicate gulp, Claire patted her tummy a few times, unaware that her son was dissolving away within it. Resuming her chat with the manager who\u2019d offered up these veggies, the oblivious businesswoman realized it would be a while before she could let Blake out of her mouth. \u201cEh, he\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Blake suddenly awoke, surprised that he could have survived being digested by his own mother.

The boy was unable to see or feel his arms...or his legs...or his body! \u201cWhat the..?\u201d Blake tried to speak, but noticed that no sound came out. However, he did feel a hand patting him, as well as a low gurgle behind him...then it all started to make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s body was digested completely, and his soul had now become trapped in his mom\u2019s abs!

Despite lacking physical form, Blake knew he had to get his mother\u2019s attention somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way into the ladies\u2019 restroom, Claire suddenly felt the strangest twinge coming from her abs.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake began to sweat profusely from the heat inside of his mother's shoe. He had been a tiny passenger in his mom's pump for what felt like hours, with only Claire's toes to keep him company in the cloying darkness. Each step his giantess mother made caused Blake's stomach to lurch as she walked around the party. Blake crouched down in the toe box, trying to keep from falling forward each time his mother's foot touched down. Her toes caused small indentations in the floor of the shoe, making Blake realize that this must be his mother's favorite, well-worn pair. The smell, while overwhelming, was not entirely unpleasant; the rich scent of expensive leather mixed with the smell of his mother's lotion. He wished his mother would just take a seat already, as his sweaty palms caused his grip to falter. His worst fears were realized when Claire seemed to stub her toe, and the ensuing shockwave that traveled through the shoe knocked Blake from his perch at the end of the toe box. He started sliding down the shoe, his fingers scratching for purchase on the smooth leather. Finding none, he continued to slide until he smashed face first into his mother's toes. His hands could feel every ridge in his mother's toeprints, a sensation that really drove home just how small he was. When he tried to push himself up, however, he fell right beneath the toes as they rose into the air. The toes came crashing down on top of the tiny boy like a wall of flesh as Claire took her next step. Blake was thankful the spell made him indestructible, as the toes smashed him into a ball after only a couple of steps. Blake was now totally surrounded by his mom's feet. He could only get gasping lungfuls of air in between footfalls, air that was drenched in his mother's heady smell. Her foot sweat began to soak into his clothes, and Blake wondered if he could ever get the smell out of his skin. Even when Claire wasn't moving, her tiny son was still subjected to torture as her toes idly played with her shrunken captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Claire's toes released their grip and Blake was thrust into the light as the foot emerged from the pump. Blake saw plush carpeting below him as he flew through the sky, still stuck between the ball of his mother's foot and her scrunched toes. With his arms pinned to his sides, he couldn't escape and could only go along for the ride until Claire reached down and dislodged her tiny son with her fingernail. Blake reformed in the air and landed gently in the fibers of the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust've had a rock in my shoe or something,\u201d Blake heard his mother say, followed by a round of feminine laughter. Blake looked around, and saw his mother's bare feet crash down near him, pale toes wiggling in the carpet. Her discarded pumps lay a bit aways like parked airliners. Claire was sitting on a couch with two women, seemingly away from the main party area. The first woman was wearing strappy, fashionable high heeled sandals, each containing a tanned foot with crimson-painted nails. Slender, bare legs led up to a skimpy dress. The woman, with her long blonde hair, was undeniably beautiful and looked like a model. The second woman wore black, knee-high boots with tights and a skirt, with a professional-looking blouse. She had short, dark hair framing an Asian face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust so he would know who he's dealing with, Blake whipped out his phone and used his magic to copy the directory in his mother's phone. By matching up the faces, he was able to identify the two women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanned woman with the sandals was Rachel Fairweather, age 28. Blake remembered his mother mentioning her name before. Claire suspected Rachel of being a spy for a rival company or country, using her feminine charms to steal corporate secrets. Claire thought that several of Rachel's background details seemed to have been fabricated, and that Rachel was promoted to her current position in marketing awfully quickly. But despite her suspicions, Claire was never able to catch Rachel in the act of spying. Perhaps Blake could secretly tag along with Rachel and gather evidence of her misdeeds. It would certainly make his mother look good, and perhaps get her a promotion. Plus, Blake found the idea of spying on a spy thrilling. And it may just be his hormonal teenage brain talking, but Rachel was really, really hot, and he wouldn't mind getting up close and personal with such a beauty. Of course, if Rachel really was a spy, then Blake could imagine many dangers to being caught. Rachel could sell him to the highest bidder, or simply swallow him to get rid of him. Blake was confident that his magic could get him out of any sticky situation, but he knew his mother would be worried about him if he got himself captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian woman with the boots was Dr. Amy Kobayashi, age 32. She and Claire were close friends, and Blake recognized her from when she would hang out at his house with his mom. She was a very pretty and elegant woman, and Blake had a bit of a crush on her. Amy was head of R&amp;D at Jengain, and Blake knew such an intelligent and curious woman would get a kick out of his size-changing abilities. He would love to help her out with some experiments, or just have some fun together. She was a very kind woman, so he wasn't worried about his safety around her, and he knew she could bring him back to his house when they were all done. Plus, her boots and tights would make for an easier climb than Rachel's sandals and dress. Blake blushed at the thought of climbing the gorgeous spy and getting caught in her generous cleavage. His mind went to more perverted places as he imagined himself shrunken and watching Amy shower. The sight of his mother's toes scrunched in the carpet brought him back to reality. He knew he would be safest sticking with his mother's feet until she went home, but his imagination was racing with thoughts of all the incredible adventures he could have upon the feminine landscape of the body of either of the two beautiful women sitting next side of his mother. Blake began walking towards a pair of feet\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Screw it, Blake thought. He didn't go through all the trouble of shrinking himself just to play it safe and hang out with his mother, bored out of his mind. He was going to have the adventure of a lifetime, and any good adventure starts off by taking a single step. In this case, it would be a step onto a foot. As he thought about which woman he should climb, he approached Rachel's strappy sandals. While Blake was no expert on fashion, they looked like an expensive, name brand piece of footwear. The straps on the sandals could serve as hand and footholds for climbing, but, while watching the tan toes flex against the straps, Blake wondered if the highly-trained spy could feel him walking across a sensitive part of her body. In addition, the bare, smooth legs offered nowhere to hide if Rachel decided to scratch an itch while Blake climbed. Rachel's toenails were expertly painted a blood-red crimson color, so shiny that Blake figured he could see his own reflection in the buffed surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing in front of his mother's feet, Blake then approached Amy's boots. The tough leather was thick and sturdy, made more for durability than fashion. The thick material of her shoes made it less likely that the scientist would feel Blake starting his ascent up her body, and her tights would be easy to climb. In addition, Amy's skirt doubtlessly had pockets that Blake could sneak into if it seemed like she was going to leave the party before Blake made it to her upper body. However, her short hair would make it harder to climb to her face, if he decided to get her attention by dangling in front of her almond-shaped eyes. He bet he could help her with some experiments; for instance, maybe he could wear a tiny camera and let her swallow him so he could record her digestive tract. Blake was always so nervous when Amy was over his house, to the point where he couldn\u2019t even ask her if she wanted a drink. This could be his chance to get to know her better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake knew he had to make a decision soon, lest he be stranded here when the party broke up.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Excited, Blake quickly ran over to the battleship-sized sandals. His head could barely peek over the edge of the shoe, placing Blake face-to-face with the toes. He walked around to the side, noticing how Rachel\u2019s slender foot gradually rose with the shape of the heel. When he arrived at the heel, he was shocked to realize that he was small enough that he could walk under the heel without having to duck his head. He placed his hand against the pillar-like heel, amazed that it could so easily hold the weight of the woman above him. Of course, the shoe was normal-sized and Blake was the one who was a different size than normal. Mesmerized, he walked back to the toes, feeling small vibrations in the carpet whenever someone moved. He pulled himself up onto the edge of the sandal, the toes looming over him. He could easily see the delicate design of her toeprints. The thong separating her big toe from the rest of her toes looked like an inviting place to climb, so he carefully walked next to the massive big toe and climbed up the strap. He was glad he cast a spell to increase his grip, because upper body strength was certainly not his forte. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he pulled himself up, he turned around and gazed at the five beautiful toes arrayed in front of his eyes. The crimson nail polish was expertly applied, and the color was so beautiful that Blake couldn't help but take a closer look. He walked over to the big toe and stepped over the joint, and soon he arrived at the expanse of the nail. The finish was mirror-smooth, so reflective that Blake could see his own face. He was so distracted that he didn't even notice that Rachel scrunched her toes until he began to slide downward. His fingers scrabbled for purchase on the nail, but the polished surface was too smooth for him to get a grip. His heart leapt into his throat as he looked back and saw the carpet rapidly approaching. He tried to cast a levitation spell, but the tiny mage bit his tongue and he fumbled the words. The crimson surface rushed away from him, but then Blake felt his lower body hang out into empty space. He was finally able to halt his momentum, right at the edge of the nail. His legs dangled in free space, as the toenail was long enough that his lower body didn't touch her toe. He was small enough that the thickness of her toenail was just as wide as his own chest. Blake was thankful that Rachel grew out her nails, as a collision with the tip of her big toe might've sent him tumbling to the floor below. He used what little upper-body strength he possessed to pull himself up and into the nail, which was now flat as the toe returned to its resting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the sweat off his face, Blake walked up the nail, stepping onto the cuticle and onto the toe. Thankfully, Rachel kept her feet still, giving Blake an easy walk across the knuckle connecting her toe to the foot. The heel of the shoe gave the foot an upward incline, and Blake used the sandal's straps to make his way up the foot. A gentle scent greeted his nostrils, a mixture of vanilla-scented lotion tinged with the more heady scent of skin. Working his way up the straps, he occasionally had to drop down and work his way across bare skin. He knelt down and ran his hand across a prominent vein, feeling the warmth of the blood pumping right underneath his fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making it to the ankle, Blake craned his neck to look up the pillar of Rachel's leg. The smooth leg rose into the heavens, capped by the summit of her knee. Rachel's upper body seemed impossibly far away. Blake placed his hands on the smooth skin and tried to pull himself up, but the flawless flesh gave him no purchase. Not willing to give up just yet, Blake cast a spell to increase his grip even further. He rubbed his sticky palms together, feeling his newfound gripping strength. Planting his feet on Rachel's ankle bone, he grabbed two handfuls of skin and began to climb upward. Rachel's leg was lightly toned with muscle, which he could feel under his fingertips. The rippled muscle soon gave way to hard bone as Blake began to ascend her shin. Blake was grateful for his enhanced grip, as the sheer surface was like trying to scale a smooth rock face. His arms were burning as he crested the slope of Rachel's knee. He pulled himself up onto the flatter ground and wiped the sweat from his brow. Gently walking over to the slope, Blake looked down at the mountain that he had just conquered. Rachel's leg descended a precarious distance to the ground, underscoring the tremendous vertical height he had just climbed. He could see Rachel's crimson toenails sparkling at the base of this feminine mountain. Turning around, Blake gazed up at the rest of the towering landscape of the woman's body that he had yet to climb. Her face was hidden by the twin swells of her breasts, which jiggled when Rachel laughed at something his mother said. Long blonde hair fell about her shoulders like the clouds surrounding a misty mountain. One of her bare arms suddenly moved, causing Blake to duck as one of Rachel's hands swooped down, fingers outstretched. Worried that she felt him climbing her body, Blake leapt to his side, causing him up roll down her knee and land onto the couch, between her thighs. He watched as Rachel scratched her knee with long, crimson nails. If he didn't dive away in time, he could've been a dark stain on those nails. He found himself in a similarly precarious situation now, as he could be squished if Rachel brought her thighs together. The hem of her red dress lay draped on the couch in front of him, like a theater curtain hiding the treasure of her womanhood from his sight. As if reading his mind, Rachel adjusted her dress, lifting it up just enough to give Blake a peek at her underwear. She wore a pair of lacy red panties, the same color as the blood that now ran from Blake's nose. She held up her dress just long enough to tease Blake before releasing it, once again concealing her most sacred area. Blake swallowed hard, feeling blood rushing to his own nether regions. This might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get up close and personal with this beautiful woman. But then again, there was still so much more of Rachel's body that Blake had yet to explore.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the considerable temptation, Blake wanted to continue climbing up Rachel's body, to see what other surprises are in store for him on this feminine landscape. Before he could move, however, he saw movement out of the corner of his eye, causing him to once again throw himself to the ground. He watched as Rachel's leg effortlessly rose into the air, before crossing over his head and coming to rest on her other leg. To a normal person, it would just look like a woman crossing her legs, but Blake was small enough that he could see every ripple cascading through her muscles as her thighs crashed together like two colliding battleships. This added a new obstacle for Blake to overcome, as climbing from one thigh to another would be quite difficult. As he pondered how he could climb the tower of flesh, he watched as Rachel leaned forward and rested her arm on her leg, her hand dangling over her knees. With her fingers draped over her thigh, the tips of her long, crimson fingernails just reached the surface of the couch. Rachel's fingers were long and slender, looking just like a hand model. Blake walked up to her middle finger, noticing that her nail was smooth enough that he could see his own reflection. He took the time to straighten out his hair before he rubbed his fingers across the surface of the nail, feeling its impeccable smoothness. Knowing that he needed to take advantage of this opportunity, Blake pressed his body up against the red nail and began to climb the sheer surface. Not wanting to be flicked off into oblivion, Blake scrambled up the vertical surface until he made it past the cuticle and onto her finger. Thankfully, Rachel kept her finger still while Blake climbed, as any movement of her hand might've spelled doom for the tiny explorer. The wrinkles surrounding her knuckles helped Blake make his way up the vertically-inclined finger. Soon Blake came across a golden band wrapped around Rachel's finger. Blake wracked his brain trying to figure out what it was, then it hit him: it was a ring! At his tiny size, even a simple ring was bigger than a hula hoop. The metal was twisted in a Celtic design, and Blake had to be careful he didn't get a leg caught as he awkwardly clambered over the piece of jewelry. The gold looked positively regal against Rachel's tanned skin. He then traversed the small hill of her knuckle before arriving at the back of Rachel's hand. Small veins crisscrossed the surface, and Blake could feel the tendons move under his feet when Rachel flexed her fingers. He made his way up her hand, using a prominent vein for guidance until he came to the wrist. The tiny climber\u2019s progress was once again blocked by a larger-than-life piece of jewelry, this time a bracelet. But this time, Blake had to simply climb over the golden roadblock, and then the way up Rachel's arm was clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the position of her hand resting on her leg, Rachel's forearm was relatively straight, allowing Blake to simply walk across her warm skin. His leisurely stroll was a nice change of pace from so the climbing he had been doing. Rachel's sleeveless dress meant that there was no clothing to help aid his exploration, just acres of smooth, tan flesh to cross. He whistled a tune as he walked, as if taking a jaunt across a woman's arm was an everyday occurrence for the miniscule mage. He knew that the easy part was over once he arrived at the crook of her elbow. Her upper arm soared into the sky, topped by her shoulder. For once, Blake got a glimpse of Rachel's face, now that he was no longer in the shadow of her breasts. Readying himself for the final climb, Blake jumped to and used his enhanced grip to pull himself up the woman's arm. He could feel the lean muscle of her bicep as he climbed, and by looking to the side, he saw that he was level with the peaks of her breasts. They were massive! The boobs defied gravity, the huge orbs seemingly levitating. Blake sidled over on the arm until he was next to the closest breast, then reached out a hand and touched it. He blushed as he rubbed his palm over the boob. Even though he could only really feel the texture of the dress, it was still incredibly exciting. He poked a finger into the side of the boob, giggling as his digit was swallowed up by the breast flesh, which quickly bounced back when he withdrew his finger. Not wanting to accidentally get noticed by Rachel while touching her boobs, Blake got back to climbing her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at Rachel's shoulder, Blake was greeted by a waterfall of blonde hair. He reached out and grabbed one of the golden locks, which smelled like fresh strawberries. From his new perch on her shoulder, Blake finally got a good view of Rachel's face. Her full lips were accented with crimson lipstick, and her nose was well-shaped and elegant. Her deep blue eyes, emphasized by long, flirty eyelashes, took his breath away. When she laughed, Blake caught a glimpse of her perfectly straight, white teeth. He had a sudden urge to leap off her bottom lip like a diving board to land directly on her pink tongue. When he walked closer to the base of her neck, he looked up and saw that Rachel was wearing a pair of dangling earrings that were just in his reach. They would make a good way for Blake to climb up to her ear, perhaps to whisper sweet nothings. Or, he could explore her face. Looking down, he saw that the plunging neckline of her dress made her breasts form a massive canyon in the middle where they met. It was a ravine made entirely of smooth flesh. It could easily swallow him up.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The massive breasts were so mesmerizing that Blake didn't even notice that he was losing his footing until he began to slip. Flailing, he tried to grab onto some skin to halt his descent, but Rachel's collarbone effectively funneled him like a slide directly to the center of her cleavage. Blake gulped as he saw the dark crevasse closing in on him. Knowing he had no hope of bouncing off one of the breasts like a trampoline, Blake tucked in his arms and legs and braced for impact. The soft flesh engulfed the tiny boy as he rocketed into the boobs, and he finally slowed to a stop. He was surrounded on every side by the all-encompassing breast flesh. He finally came to a rest, trapped deep within the cleavage. Unable to move his arms or legs, Blake couldn't free himself from his fleshy prison. Not that he really wanted to, of course. The warmth of Rachel's body made the enclosed space as hot as a furnace, and the heady scent of her perfume tickled Blake's nostrils. He could hear the woman's heartbeat pounding deep within her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of movement jiggled the flesh surrounding the mage, but he remained solidly in place. From the steady up-and-down movements, Blake surmised that Rachel was leaving the party, with her tiny passenger aboard. Blake decided not to use his clairvoyance to see where she was going. Instead, he'd rather be surprised so that he could enjoy this adventure to the fullest. After what he assumed was a short car ride later, Blake suddenly felt a release in pressure. With his arms and legs asleep, he couldn't stop his descent, and fell through the air, the cliff-face of Rachel's bare stomach rushing before his eyes. He landed with a soft thud upon a smooth surface. Looking around, his eyes adjusting to the dimly-lit room, Blake realized that he had fallen onto the silk sheet of a fancy bed. Rachel's discarded dress lay flat on the bed, and he had to dive out of the way to avoid her bra as it fell from the sky like an offering from the gods. The cups were deep enough to hold a mountain, with room to spare. The flickering of a candle caused deep shadows to spread across the bed, and Blake hoped he was hidden in the darkness. He looked around the bedroom, seeing a large mirror and what seemed to be a small fortune in sparkling jewelry spread atop an armoire. The sight that really took his breath away, though, was seeing Rachel topless, her breasts no longer restrained by clothing. They seemed to defy gravity, perfectly perky despite their immense size. Each peak was topped by a pink nipple, which Blake would love to surmount. Her stomach was flat and toned, indicating that she must stick to a strict exercise and diet regimen. A long waterfall of blonde hair cascaded down her back and shoulders. Blake felt himself growing aroused. Rachel then turned her back to the tiny boy, fingers slipping into the waistband of her panties. Blake got a great view of Rachel's bare ass as she slipped the undergarment down her endless legs. Once she stepped out of the panties, Blake braced himself for the sight of a lifetime, but instead Rachel tossed the panties over her shoulder. Frozen stiff in place, Blake could only stare as the panties slowly floated downwards like a descending parachute until they landed directly on top of him, knocking him down to the bed. Covered by the lacy panties, Blake could feel the residual warmth of the cloth, as well as smell something unmistakably feminine and primal. He grabbed two fistfuls of material and breathed deeply, taking in the secret scent. His mind was in heaven, so much so that he didn't even notice the pair of fingers grabbing him until he was dragged out from underneath the panties. Blake was lifted into the air, the back of his shirt pinched between the long nails of Rachel's thumb and forefinger. Although his heart was in his throat, Blake enjoyed the view as he was slowly lifted up past Rachel's breasts, whose nipples seemed to have hardened in the woman's excitement. Looking up in terror, Blade locked eyes with his captress, leaving no doubt that she had discovered the tiny mage. The candlelight was reflected in her blue irises, and a serpentine tongue emerged to lick the billboard-sized lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy the show, my little peeping Tom?\" Rachel said, her voice low and seductive. \u201cI\u2019m impressed you were able to make your way up my body, despite all the obstacles I threw in your path. You must be quite the little agent.\u201d So she did feel him the entire time! Blake felt himself be lowered into the palm of Rachel's other hand. He swallowed hard, uncertain of what he should say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working for Jengain!\" Blake said. \"I know you're a spy!\" His voice trembled, and he immediately thought he sounded like a dork. He was so scared that his arms and legs felt like they were made out of rubber, and he could only remain sitting on his butt on the woman's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, you must know that I plan on stealing Jengain's shrinking technology, which you obviously used to spy on me,\" Rachel said. Blade knew she was mistaken, since he used his spells to shrink himself. But wait, his mother's company was working on a shrinking ray? This might be intriguing, Blake thought. His thoughts were interrupted when Rachel's finger gently separated his legs and began massaging his crotch. He moaned as the fingertip gently pressed down on his swollen arousal. The candlelight glinted off the fingernail that rested on his chest, the tip looking sharp enough to cut him to ribbons. A hint of amusement played on Rachel's lips as she toyed with the tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know, I don't plan on letting you leave here with my secret,\" Rachel said. \"But whether this night ends with pleasure...\" she said, moving her fingertip in a circle on Blake's crotch and bringing him close to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or pain\u2026\" she said, moving her nail to press against Blake's throat, \"... is up to you, my little voyeur.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The golden earring had an interlocking diamond pattern, the perfect shape for Blake to have convenient hand and foot holds. It would be little different from climbing a rope ladder. He grasped the first rung with his fingertips, pulling himself up until he could set his feet on the bottom of the first chevron. Continuing in this way, he slowly ascended into the air, as if he was climbing a ladder into a hovering helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny mage had to hold on for dear life when Rachel tilted her head back to take a sip of wine. The entire earring began to sway back and forth like a pendulum, causing rushing air currents to swirl around his body. He watched as gallons of pink wine rushed past the woman's lips, listening with awe to the sound of her swallowing the river of alcohol down the waterfall of her throat, flowing deep into her body. When she put the wine glass down, Blake had to wait until both the earring and his stomach ceased their undulations before continuing his climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Blake reached Rachel's earlobe, where a hook the size of a boat anchor was threaded through a hole in the skin. Blake climbed up the hook until the could grab onto the warm skin. He moved past the piercing until he pulled himself up onto the shelf of Rachel's ear. The ear was as delicately whorled as as a seashell. A small cave surrounded by fine hairs marked the entrance to her inner ear canal. Blake could shrink himself down further, and go spelunking in that cave. Indeed, the mysteries that he could discover that lay hidden within this woman's head beckoned to him. A whole new adventure awaited him inside that cave. Or, he could continue his exploration of Rachel's face. Perhaps he could clamber over to the corner of her mouth, in hopes that he could be gathered up by her tongue as if he was a stray crumb, to allow him to explore the cavern of her mouth. He could also climb higher and run through the field of golden blonde hair at the top of her head, and maybe play on her nose like a slide.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake was always fascinated by the inner workings of the human body. In particular, the tiny bones of the inner ear looked as if they were crafted by an expert artisan in a miniature workshop. The tiny mage cast a spell to make him even tinier, until he could walk into the ear canal without even having to duck his head. Brushing aside the small hairs guarding the entrance to the ear, Blake couldn't help but grin as he made his way into the ever-darker cave. He cast another spell to let him see in the dark, which illuminated the puddles of wax littering the ground. Blake heard a squishing sound as his foot landed right in a glob of yellow wax, and he nearly lost his sneaker pulling his foot free. Rachel's inner guardians would have to try harder than that to keep this intrepid explorer out! He knew that if he lost his shoe, the little hairs would eventually carry it to the cliff edge of Rachel's throat, where the sneaker would be unceremoniously dumped over the edge to be dissolved in the woman's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperature increased as Blake walked deeper into the organic tunnel. The hairs and wax soon gave way to smooth walls, and Blake ran his hand across the warm flesh. He finally came to a roadblock, in the form of a fleshy membrane that spanned from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall. Blake could hear the sounds of the party, and could even pick out his mother's voice. The vibrations of the membrane told him that he had arrived at the eardrum. Placing his hand up against the organic wall, he could feel the vibrations pulse through his fingertips. He tapped out a beat on the eardrum with his fists, curious as to whether or not it would be translated into sound in Rachel's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to hurt his host, he cast a spell allowing him to phase through matter, and stepped through the eardrum. On the other side, he found himself surrounded by the intricate machinery of the inner ear. Bones in the shape of a hammer and anvil moved in tune with the eardrum. Overhead, a system of tubes curled around each other like a sleeping octopus. A spiral-shaped structure dominated the rear of the area. Curious, Blake climbed atop one of the tubes and gave it a good squeeze. He could feel the fluid slosh around under his fingers. He shook the tube around like a garden hose, then his world took a tumble. Suddenly airborne, the tiny mage flew into the bony hammer, which whacked him in the back and sent him sailing until he crash-landed onto the fleshy spiral. Picking himself up, he adjusted his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, are you alright?\" Blake heard his mother ask. \"You look dizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, really,\" Rachel said. \"I must've had too much to drink.\" Blake could hear Rachel's voice reverberate through her skull, formed by her tongue and lips to reach the ears of her tiny passenger. Well then, that tube must've controlled Rachel's sense of balance. Blake was certainly learning a lot during his little adventure inside the human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake walked to the end of the fleshy spiral. He saw what looked like a wire plugged into the end of the spiral that crackled with electricity. As soon as his fingertips touched the wire, he could hear every sound of the party as if he heard it with his own ears. He knew at once that he was holding Rachel's auditory nerve, which had a direct link to her brain. The control center of the human body would be the ultimate destination for the tiny explorer, and this nerve would give him easy access to her brain. Otherwise, Blake would have to find a way to get through the fortress of the skull and past the pesky blood-brain barrier. He casted a spell that turned his body into pure electricity, and he zoomed through the highway of the neural pathway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping back into a physical form, Blake found himself surrounded by grey, spongy flesh that crackled with electricity in the darkness. Red and blue veins criss-crossed the flesh, supplying necessary nutrition to the hungry organ. Immersed in a thick, viscous fluid, Blake was able to swim around like an underwater diver. He knew that the auditory region of the brain was located deep in the center of the organ. By brushing his fingertips against the flesh, Blake received snippets of the sounds of the party. A little to the left, and he got a taste of the wine Rachel drank. To his right, he was able to smell the perfume his mother was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was curious to confirm his suspicions of Rachel being a spy, so he swam around the brain, touching various parts to see what they controlled until he found himself at Rachel's memory banks. Like a movie playing in his mind, he watched through Rachel's eyes as her memories were replayed. He saw her accept a job to spy on Jengain, then watched as she stole some classified documents from Dr. Kobayashi's computer. That seals it, Rachel's definitely a spy. He fast-forwarded to just a few minutes ago, when he was climbing Rachel's body. She felt him climb, and she even got sexually aroused at the thought that a tiny intruder was exploring her body. Blake realized that this might be the first time he's ever gotten a woman aroused. Blake saw that Rachel was impressed by Blake's ingenuity at overcoming the obstacles she threw at him, as he continued to find new routes to continue his climb. She figured that a counter-spy had used the shrinking technology that she was trying to steal to spy on her. Rachel was a little disappointed, though, that Blake didn't give in to temptation and dive into her panties, even after she gave him a sneak peek. His tiny body exploring her most sacred area would've helped alleviate the burning sensation she felt between her thighs. She thought he was quite bold to cop a feel of her breast on his way to her shoulder. She felt a moment of panic, however, when she felt a tickle in her ear, followed by a dizzy spell. Little did she know that her tiny intruder had found his way to her brain, and that her mind was an open book to the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wondered if he could take control of Rachel's body. Firing lightning from his fingertips, he took control of all of the areas of the brain, which lit up like a Christmas tree. He then saw his mother, and realized that he was looking through Rachel's eyes. Testing to see how much control he had, he tried to make his host talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, I'm going to run to the bathroom, okay?\" Blake said, as Rachel. Her voice was sexy and feminine, quite unlike Blake's awkward voice, which always cracked at the most annoying times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll go get us some more drinks,\" Claire said. She had no idea that she was really talking to her son. Blake got up off the couch, wobbling a bit when he stood. High heels sure are annoying, he thought. Even without heels on, Rachel was quite a bit taller than the mage at normal size, and it was a little strange to control a body that had such longer arms and legs. He moved through the party, with no one the wiser. Blake was a little grossed out at all the guys that were smiling at him, until he remembered that his host was pretty hot. When he got to the bathroom, Blake was glad that it seemed to be empty. He looked at himself in the mirror, still shocked to see Rachel's face staring back at him. He leaned in towards the mirror and opened Rachel's mouth wide, looking at her perfect teeth. He stuck her tongue out a few times, then swallowed and watched her uvula bounce around. He then grabbed Rachel's boobs, feeling their full-size softness. After making sure he really was alone, he lifted up Rachel's dress and stuck a finger inside her panties. He felt an electric shock of arousal as he touched her cleft. Man, Blake thought, climbing this woman really turned her on! Blake wondered if he could use his magic while in this body. He pointed a slender finger at a garbage can, and chanted a shrinking spell. To his surprise, the garbage can began to diminish in size until it was the size of a soda can. Grinning, he raised Rachel's foot and stomped on the can, feeling it crush under her toes. When he lifted the sandal, the can was a ball of scrap metal. He felt a rush of excitement, but wasn't sure how much of it came from his own mind, and how much of it came from the mind of his host. Either way, Blake was brimming with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind racing with ideas, Blake returned to the party. His mom still wasn't back yet, and Amy had fallen asleep on the couch. He searched Rachel's mind, and saw where she parked her car. He even downloaded the information on how to drive, since the tiny mage wasn't old enough to get a permit. Blake could bring Rachel back to her apartment and sexually torture her until she begs for release, as punishment for spying on his mom's company. He could project some clones outside her body, to arouse her in many different ways. Or, he could shrink Claire and Amy, and take them back to Rachel's apartment where Blake could play with them using his borrowed body.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake decides to climb up Dr. Amy Kobayashi\u2019s boots, considering how much he wanted to get to know her, as well as have some shrunken fun with the beautiful and mature woman. And given his other option, besides going back to Claire, which would be choosing the possible spy; approaching Amy might be the wiser choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd going back to Claire would be like giving up, so Blake can't retreat to the (relative) safety of her toes without trying first! Even though he was always too nervous to speak with her in the past, now that he's improved as a mage, he was feeling a bit more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked a bit closer to Amy, Blake's confidence was shattered when she suddenly tapped her foot, just barely missing Blake's tiny body by a few inches. While he slowly got back up, he hears her laugh while saying \u201cThis really is a nice party! It's great that Jengain can give us some extra bonuses now and then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that, Claire sighs and says \u201cI always enjoy the office parties, but they can get a bit stressful for me at times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods and says \u201cYou do need to do a lot more schmoozing than I do, so I don't envy you at all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy and Claire continued to chat, Blake takes another look up towards Amy. Her boots looked spectacularly tall and mighty, but there seemed to be plenty of buckles and things to grab onto, which could shape for an easier climb. That would only be the start of his journey, but he'd feel better knowing he was making progress, especially since her tights would be equally manageable to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thanks to Blake's invulnerability, he didn't have to worry about much, since even if she stepped on him, it'd only delay him. So he runs up to her boot and starts his long climb, not wanting to give her a chance to unintentionally stomp him flat first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed as he climbed was a powerful scent, which smelled heavily of roses, making him wonder if this was from her perfume. While he was sure that it wouldn't be this overpowering normally, since he was so small right now, Blake truly enjoyed the aroma. And as he climbed up, it only reminded him of his crush on Amy, making him hope even more that she'd want to thoroughly test his size and durability once he was found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Blake reached halfway up her knee-high boot, she suddenly crosses her legs, forcing him to hold tightly as he was thoughtlessly dangled in the air. While he remained in this position, he could see his mom continuing to happily chat with Amy, although he also noticed that Rachel seemed to have left, which was good for his overall safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Blake gripped tightly onto one of Amy's boot buckles, he sees his mom shuffle her feet toward her black pumps, reminding him that they were bare. She immediately starts to play with the pumps, moving them about idly, as she seemed to feel more relaxed while sitting with her close friend. It also made him glad that he left the area when he did since that would surely be a hectic experience, but he also wondered if it would be enjoyable too. Blake tries to ignore those thoughts though since she is his mom after all, so he instead turns his attention back to her incredibly beautiful friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was still dangling in the air, Blake doesn't let that stop him as he continues to climb toward Amy's knee, occasionally moving so he'd be closer to the shin side of her leg. It was a challenging climb, especially since Blake wasn't the fittest person around, but the shrinking spell seemed to be compensating a bit. And as Blake continued his long climb, the women continued their idle conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, their discussion eventually shifted toward Blake, causing him to stop and listen closely. And the strangest part was that Amy brought the topic up, as she says \u201cHow's Blake doing in school? I can't believe he's already making it through high school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire quietly laughs and says \u201cYou're telling me, Amy\u2026 He really grew up so fast. I just wish he stopped with all his \u2018magic\u2019 nonsense\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake freezes when he hears this since he was sure that he stopped sharing that stuff with her since she always assumed that he was playing pretend. But Amy looks over curiously, as she says \u201cMagic\u2026? What do you mean Claire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sighs and says \u201cWell, Blake used to always brag to me how he could cast spells as if he was in a fantasy novel. I used to find it adorable, but I think he's still obsessed with that stuff. I've found a few books in his room that looked directly out of a fantasy movie.\u201d Then she quietly laughs and adds, saying \u201cI just wish he'd spend his allowance on stuff kids buy, like sports gear or video games\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was feeling a bit down about the conversation, but Amy just smiles and says \u201cI think you should be proud that Blake still has a wonderful imagination. It's good when kids can think creatively. Maybe you should get him to try writing? It could be a good outlet for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiles back and says \u201cI never thought of it that way. I guess I worry a bit too much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just quietly laughs and says \u201cIt's good to worry a little bit. I'm happy to hear that he's doing well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she was concerned with Blake made him feel warm inside, which inspired him to move even faster along her boot, hoping to get her attention before she decided to stand back up. And after a few more minutes, Blake reaches the end of the boot, close to her knee, so he decides to take a short break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat decision soon proved to be an unwise one, as Amy suddenly moved her legs again, threatening to throw Blake back onto the floor. Right after that, she reaches toward him and tugs on her boot, creating a small gap along her leg. Blake managed to keep his balance, but an odd tingling at the back of his neck worried him, as he hears one of the spirits whisper \u201cWe're sorry Blake, but we're having trouble maintaining your current size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do anything else, he feels himself get even tinier, causing him to fall through that gap into Amy's knee-high boot. Blake continued to fall until he crashed into her instep, which was covered by a thick wool sock. Thankfully it was incredibly soft and fluffy, but the sweaty and hot environment quickly hit his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Blake was even tinier than before, Amy seemed to notice him in the back of her mind, prompting her to subtly move her foot, causing him to slide directly under her warm sole. While he was here, his nose and mouth were assaulted by the strange mixture between oppressive sweat and sweet strawberries. And as unique as it seemed, it was incredible to Blake, finding Amy's boot to be far nicer than his mom's pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut due to the extreme weight of Amy's foot, Blake couldn't move a muscle, so he takes the chance to adjust to his surroundings while enveloped by her heavenly scent. Using a magic spell, Blake scans himself to find out just how much he just shrank, realizing that he was now \u00bd of an inch tall. This would probably make getting discovered by Amy a lot harder, but that was a part of the challenge after all. Besides, his invulnerability was still present, so it wasn't like he was in any danger. And since he was inside her boot now, no matter what happened, he'd be able to get her attention eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted once Amy stood up, putting her full weight onto him, as she says \u201cI'm grabbing a drink. Do you want anything, Claire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire starts to rub her temples while saying \u201cYou know what? Can you get me a stiff drink, Amy? I think I could use one\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy begins to laugh while tapping her foot and unintentionally flattening Blake repeatedly, as she says \u201cDon't worry Claire, I'll get you something nice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Following that, Amy walks back toward the party bar, stomping tiny Blake with each and every step\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy made her to the bar, wanting to get her and Claire some nice drinks. Even though she didn't need to feel as stressed since her role as the R&amp;D head allowed her to avoid some of the pressure that Claire felt since she had fewer people to please. Even though Claire had a high-ranked position too, she needed to mingle more closely with all of the outside company guests, which was why she was so stressed. Amy only needed to worry about a few direct bosses and her R&amp;D staff, and internal stuff at Jengain was normally more on the relaxed side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Amy decides to get herself a beer and her friend a nice glass of hard liquor and another glass of soda. As she waits for her drinks to be prepared, she begins to shift her weight back and forth, inadvertently giving Blake a forceful massage. And once the drinks were ready, Amy slowly walks back to the couch, not wanting to spill a drop. Due to that, Blake was thoroughly crushed with each step, since her movements were far more deliberate and careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, Amy gets back to the couch, and hands Claire her drink. As they begin to enjoy their beverages, Blake closes his eyes and simply basks in the radiating warmth of her ginormous foot. Even though he was shielded from harm, he was still vulnerable both emotionally and mentally, and this was a crazy experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that Blake disliked this; it was far from it as he was having a great time, even being his mom's unaware toe toy had its charms, even if that environment was a tad too intense for him. But he was drained, which caused him to quickly fall asleep, while Amy and Claire chatted for hours longer, as neither of them knew of their tiny guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In fact, by the time Blake woke up, Amy had brought him to a completely different location. The big question was, where was Amy now\u2026?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake slowly got back up, feeling a bit groggy, but surprisingly well rested despite taking a nap under Amy\u2019s socked foot. As he brushed himself off he noticed the biggest change; Amy\u2019s massive foot was no longer pinning him into the boot\u2019s insole. And with that revelation, Blake proceeds to escape from her humid and smelly boot, walking across the insole while trying to avoid the larger indents along the way. As he walked, he noticed that the insole was pressed down, perfectly matching to her foot. At one point he walks past the number \u20189.5\u2019, meaning that Amy had slightly larger than average feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reaches the pillar-like opening of the boot, Blake activates some wind magic, allowing him to soar up to the exit. Now even though he was doing this now, trying to climb Amy with this spell would have been far too risky, since he was not as skilled with navigating while flying through the air. But a straight flight upwards was easy for him, allowing him to escape the boot and crash back onto the carpet near the discarded shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after he brushes himself off again and rubs his eyes, he looks around and notices that Amy was sitting on her couch, comfortably sprawled out while working on her laptop and watching the television at the same time. Currently, she was wearing a loose fitting pink T-shirt and an off-white pair of sweatpants, without socks on. Her hair looked a little messier than before, with a few strands sticking up, giving Blake a peek at her casual demeanor. Since it must\u2019ve been incredibly late right now, it made sense for her to be dressed so casually, and Blake found he just as stunning as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while he was still farther away from Amy, he decides to use his scanning magic on her, finding out that she was 5\u201911\u201d. She also had size 9.5 feet, and even though he learned the size of Amy\u2019s boot, there could've been a chance that she wore either too large or too small shoes. He wasn't able to glean all that much more about her, which meant that Blake still needed to practice in certain areas, but his curiosity was satisfied for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he walks closer to the lounging giantess, hoping to make contact with her before she went to sleep. Soon, he nears her bare foot, noticing that her toenails were painted a light shade of purple, though they were slightly faded. There was a potent odor present too, possibly because Amy's feet were now able to air out, though he found her sweaty and rose-like aroma to be amazing. But while Blake was admiring Amy's titanic foot, she loudly yawns and moves her leg forward. Blake is unprepared, as her towering toes rapidly approached him, tackling him into the soft carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then begins to rub her foot into the carpet, pinning Blake down harshly while stretching her arms and saying \u201c<i>Talk about a late night\u2026</i>\u201d She then wiggles her toes, scooping Blake up and depositing him between them, giving him a forceful hug. Her toes felt ridiculously soft, for even though they were treating him roughly, Blake was in bliss from the attention, while the radiating warmth soothed him. As he struggled against the gigantic toes, which were at least twice his size, Amy yawns again and mumbles, saying \u201cMaybe I should get ready for bed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that statement, Amy stands up and shuffles on a pair of fluffy moccasins, wanting to keep her feet warm until she got to her bedroom. Blake was forced to experience darkness yet again, so he tries out a night vision spell, allowing him to see more clearly. He could see that Amy's toes were relatively clean, with a few grimy patches in the tight spaces, which actually impressed him a bit. Oddly enough, Blake had a momentary idea to clean Amy's toe spaces for her, but he ignores that thought while he still needed to get her attention. But as Blake\u2019s mind was still racing of things to do once she found him, Amy scrunches her toes into the soft fluff, forcing his face into the same filthy spaces that he was daydreaming about a second ago. And as he was being brutalized unknowingly, he was made fully aware that cleaning Amy\u2019s toe spaces would be a laborious task, but he still felt like he could accomplish it if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Amy begins walking to her bathroom, causing Blake to be pounded into with every step. She had a decently large house, probably because she was the head of Jengain\u2019s R&amp;D department, but that only elongated your experience. And once she gets to the bathroom, she starts brushing her teeth, tapping her toes the entire time. Blake was glad that her slipper was incredibly soft, but it was also highly insulated, which caused her foot to sweat a bit more. And that caused Blake to get coated by Amy\u2019s sweat, as the salty and not very viscous liquid got absorbed into the moccasin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it still wasn't as bad as when he was in his mom's pump, it was still intense, but Blake surprisingly found it to still be enjoyable; possibly because of his crush on Amy. And despite his magical invulnerability, getting mashed into by a set of gigantic toes was still a little bit scary, especially when they were only a small part of the whole titaness. But because of how soft Amy\u2019s toes were, it felt almost relaxing at times for Blake, since those beasts would continually press him into the fluffy ground of her slipper. And after about 2 minutes, Amy finishes with brushing her teeth and goes to wash her face, scrunching her toes at the same time. That provided Blake with another round of punishment, as he was ruthlessly squeezed between those long and slender toes, making him feel much more like a grape than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Amy was finished in the bathroom, she walked over to her bedroom and kicks off her slippers, while you remained crammed between her mighty toes. After that, she shuffled into her bed, going to check her phone one final time before bed. While Blake was stuck under the warm covers, where he was feeling stuffier by the minute, while she would constantly wiggle her toes, rubbing him vigorously. As she checks her phone, Amy notices that Claire sent her a message. When she realizes that, she squeezes her toes in anticipation, unwittingly mashing him even deeper between the warm and incredibly constrictive space. Apparently, Blake wasn\u2019t home when she got home, and Claire was worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy reads that, she sighs and says to herself, mumbling \u201c<i>Oh Claire\u2026</i> Hopefully, Blake just went out and forgot to tell her, like a typical kid\u2026\u201d Right as she quietly said this, she forcefully wiggled her toes, brutalizing Blake against those pillars of flesh while preventing him from hearing a bit of what she just said. Unfortunately, Blake never thought about what would happen when his mom would get home, but he needed to focus more on Amy and her possessive toes. And since she was more relaxed right now, her toes stopped moving and writhing as frequently, inspiring Blake to try and do something to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was still super tiny, he had a few spells at his disposal, so he tries to cast a medium level wind spell, hoping that it would be enough to alert Amy of his position. But she simply squeezes her toes in response, stopping his magecraft in its tracks. It made Blake feel like Amy was disciplining him for his actions, which was a surprisingly enticing thought, but it was more likely that she barely even registered his actions. She continues to clench and unclench her toes, brutally manhandling Blake while thinking that something soft was caught between them, but feeling a tad too tired and lazy to check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once those toes settled down, Blake changes tactics and tries to cast a more powerful ice spell, hoping that the sudden decrease in temperature would get her to inspect his general location. Because of his size, even an ice spell wouldn\u2019t actually harm Amy, which would have been a major concern for him, but it would surely annoy her enough to react in some way. At first, Amy doesn\u2019t even react, prompting him to spread the ice spell all along her toe, putting extra effort in near the tips of her toes. That finally causes Amy to act upon his attempts, but he was only filled with dread as the toes he was pestering rapidly smashed against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after experiencing that warm and soft sandwich, Amy\u2019s toes begin to wiggle, massaging Blake aggressively between those fleshy beasts, as she mumbles \u201cMy foot\u2019s getting a bit chilly\u2026 <i>How strange</i>, even though it\u2019s the middle of Summer\u2026\u201d After that, she stretches again while still in bed, vigorously squeezing her toes at the same time, accidentally burying him deep between the sticky toe space in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, she lifts the blanket, filling Blake with a moment of hope. Amy was staring down in his direction with a look that was filled with sleepiness, with a hint of annoyance mixed in. Even though he didn\u2019t want to disturb Amy, he had to do something drastic to prevent her from falling asleep before finding him. So he casts another ice spell, this time in the direction of her cramped toe space, causing her to squeeze those toes yet again, enveloping him in her unyielding flesh. As she does this, she grumbles and says \u201cWhy in the world are my toes getting so <i>cold\u2026?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It looks like Blake finally prompted the giantess to act, but the big question though was, what was Amy planning on doing in response\u2026?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy was definitely feeling a bit confused, since she felt two sudden waves of coldness coming from her foot, even though she felt fine everywhere else. Because of that, she decides to take a closer look, sitting up and leaning closer, not expecting to find all that much. As she leans forward, Blake realizes that Amy was about to look in his direction, so he tries to free himself so he could get her attention. Unfortunately, Amy\u2019s toes were just sweaty enough to keep most of his body stuck to the soft flesh, where only his torso and right arm were free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tries his best to wave, while Amy looks at her toes, not noticing anything out of the ordinary. Due to the lack of light, Amy\u2019s eyes kept on passing over the tiny Blake, despite his feeble attempts. But as his hopes were dwindling, he comes up with an idea, so he aims up and casts a fire spell, creating a small surge of light near Amy\u2019s toes. She immediately notices this, as she gasps and says \u201cWhat in the world\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turns on her bed lamp and takes another look at her toes, this time noticing a small object lodged between them. As she sees this, she giggles to herself and says \u201cI can\u2019t believe I never noticed this\u2026 Might as well remove it before going to bed.\u201d So she reaches toward Blake, effortlessly peeling off of her toe, as she lifts him in the air carelessly. And because of what she said, he knew that he wasn\u2019t safe yet, so he casts another fire spell, causing her to stop in shock. She continues to stare, before she rubs her eyes tiredly and mumbles \u201cI don\u2019t think I drank enough to hallucinate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he immediately begins screaming for help, shouting nearly incoherently. Luckily for him, Amy was able to hear his squeaks for assistance, causing her jaw to drop as she mutters, saying \u201c<i>Blake\u2026?</i>\u201d Once Amy utters that word, Blake stops and nods slowly, not wanting to spook the titaness, causing her to take a deep breath and smile, before saying \u201cAre you okay\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiles and nods again, before saying \u201c<i>Umm\u2026</i> I\u2019m okay D\u2026 Dr. Amy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then carefully rubs his head with her pinky finger, while saying \u201cYou look so adorable right now, Blake\u2026 I hope you\u2019ll fill me in, but for now, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re safe.\u201d With that, Amy walks over to her desk and grabs her phone, before saying \u201cBut before any of that, we should call your mom, okay Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he tilts his head and says \u201cShe might be asleep by now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowns though, and says \u201cYou probably weren\u2019t aware Blake, but Claire is <i>very</i> worried about you. She has no idea where you went, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019d want to learn that you were safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when Blake hears this, he looks down sadly and says \u201cI just wanted to have a fun adventure\u2026 <i>I didn\u2019t want to worry her\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she hears this, Amy raises an eyebrow and says \u201cSo you did this to yourself? Fascinating\u2026\u201d Then she clears her throat and adds, saying \u201cI\u2019ll call her right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy gives Claire a call, explaining that she just found Blake. But Claire just sighs and says \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t just dream that up\u2026? I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re worried too, but I\u2019ll handle it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Amy taps her chin, before saying \u201cI know words won\u2019t convince you, so let\u2019s change to a video call\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy smiles and says \u201cYou should sit down first if you aren\u2019t\u2026\u201d And then, she moves the phone so the video was centered on Blake, as he nervously waves at his confused mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stares at the sight of her much smaller son for nearly a minute, before finally shouting \u201cB\u2026 <i>Blake??</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake in turn rubs the back of his neck nervously and says \u201c<i>Umm</i>\u2026 Hi mom\u2026 How was the party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire just rubs her temples, before loudly sighing and saying \u201cIt was very fun Blake\u2026 I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re at Amy\u2019s house now, but I\u2019m <i>so</i> happy that you\u2019re safe\u2026\u201d Blake sighs back, thinking that he got away with this without a punishment, but then Claire narrows her gaze and asks \u201cHow\u2019d you end up at Amy\u2019s house and at your current size? I expect the truth, <i>Blake Heart\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears his full name being dropped by his mom, he knew that he was on the road to trouble, so he explains everything, from how he shrunk himself and the rest of his magic, to how he snuck to the party in her black pump. And once Claire heard all of that, she sighs again, before smiling and saying \u201c<i>First</i>, let me be clear that I\u2019m incredibly relieved that you\u2019re okay, Blake.\u201d Then she pauses for a moment, before her eyes widen as she says \u201c<i>Blake\u2026</i> That rock I felt in my shoe back at the party, <i>was that you??</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wordlessly nods, causing Claire to sigh again and mutter \u201cI can't believe I treated my own son so carelessly. I even used him as a stress reliever with my toes...\u201d When she noticed that Blake heard her, she quickly clears her throat and says \u201cI hope you reflect on how dangerous your little stunt was!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he hears that, he immediately stands up straight, as she sighs says \u201cWe can talk about your <i>punishment</i> when you get home. I\u2019ll come get you right away\u2026\u201d It seems like Blake hadn't dodged the consequences of his actions just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Amy interjects and says \u201cBlake can stay the night here, Claire! It\u2019s way too late anyway\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiles and says \u201cI appreciate the offer, but I don\u2019t want to put you out, Amy. Blake isn't the easiest kid to deal with...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was filled with embarrassment by that statement, but Amy quietly laughs and says \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine Claire\u2026 Besides, at his <i>current</i> size, he won't be able to act out even if he wants to. Right, Blake\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods quietly, before saying \u201cI\u2019ll behave for Dr. Amy, mom! You should get some rest\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then smiles again and says \u201cI\u2019m happy my boy has good manners, even if his judgement was a <i>bit</i> skewed today.\u201d Then she sighs and says \u201cFine, you can stay Blake\u2026 I expect you to be on your best behavior!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods again, causing Amy to giggle and say \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be completely fine. He can stay a few days if he really wants to. I\u2019ve got some time off, so I wouldn\u2019t complain\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire taps her chin and says \u201cYou and Blake can figure that out I guess. Let me know if you need anything of his, Amy.\u201d Then she turns to Blake again and says \u201cGood night, sweety\u2026 I love you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiles back and says \u201cI love you too mom! <i>Sorry for worrying you\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, their video call ends, as Amy places Black down on her desk, as they prepare to have their own chat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy starts things off by smiling at Blake and asking him \u201cAre you hungry or thirsty? You must not have eaten for a little while\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake taps his chin, before saying \u201cCould I have some water? I\u2019m not very hungry though. Thanks Dr. Amy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Amy lightly chuckles to herself, before saying \u201cI\u2019ll be right back then, Blake. And you can just call me \u2018Amy\u2019 if you\u2019d like. I don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d Then, she stands up and walks to the bathroom, before coming back with a bottle cap filled with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once Blake had access to his drink, he quickly quenches his thirst, before smiling and saying \u201cThat was nice! Thanks, <i>umm</i> Amy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiles when she hears that, while saying \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit Blake! I\u2019m a bit younger than your mom, so you can think of me as one of her cool friends\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winks at Blake, causing him to smile back, before she adds, saying \u201cBut before we move on, do you need a shower or anything? I understand the gist of what you went through, so I\u2019m sure you could use a chance to clean off\u2026\u201d Then she adds saying \u201cAnd are you sure you're not hungry? Because of me, you were stuck effectively by yourself for hours. I do still feel guilty since I was eating and drinking throughout the party, and you couldn't even get a scrap of food. The <i>least</i> I could do is cook you a quick meal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thinks for a moment, wondering what he should do next. It might be nice to be bathed by Amy, since you were definitely too small to do so on your own, so this could be a rare opportunity for you. You did hope to have some hot and exciting adventures with Amy when she found you, and this was your first real chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though he said otherwise before, having a bite to eat might be a good idea, especially since Blake hadn't eaten much all day, mainly because of how bored he was. It could be wise to have something before going to bed, since he wouldn't be able to wake Amy once she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eventually, Blake comes to a decision. What does he choose to do\u2026?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>I\u2019m splitting this chapter in two, because I went a bit over the character limit this time. So please don\u2019t add to the first choice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy smiles again in response, before saying \u201cI\u2019m more than happy with continuing our conversation, Blake. I\u2019ll ask Claire to bring some of your clothes over, and we\u2019ll see what we can do with them for you.\u201d Following that, Amy asks \u201cCould you share with me how you ended up at my house though, Blake? I\u2019m quite curious of your little adventure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt like he would do whatever Amy asked, so he readily tells her all about his journey here. And when he described his attempts at climbing her boot, falling within it, and ending up stuck between her toes while she prepared to go to sleep, Amy stared at him wordlessly. Once he was finished, Amy gently rubs his head with her index finger, while saying \u201cYou must have been so miserable Blake\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t notice you sooner\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Blake wanted was for Amy to feel guilty, so he quickly shakes his head and says \u201cDon\u2019t worry Amy! I actually\u2026 kinda\u2026 enjoyed the experience\u2026\u201d His face grew redder with each word, as Amy\u2019s eyes widened with surprise, before she finally smiled at him warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to his shock, she simply says \u201cColor me surprised, Blake\u2026 I never would have guessed you\u2019d have a thing for feet. Was that why you climbed into Claire\u2019s shoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake adamantly shook his head, while saying \u201cNo way! I just thought that\u2019d be the best way to get to her party\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy hums to herself, before saying \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty likely that you never realized that about yourself. Are you sexually active, Blake\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that Amy would eventually ask some embarrassing questions, but Blake never thought they\u2019d get that crazy, causing him to blush heavily while quietly saying \u201cN\u2026 <i>no\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Amy lightly pokes Blake\u2019s cheek, while saying \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel embarrassed, Blake. I was just curious. You\u2019re still young, so don\u2019t worry too much about that. But that\u2019s probably why you never realized that you liked feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this was the second time Amy dropped that phrase, Blake scratches his hair and says \u201cDoes that make me <i>weird\u2026?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shakes her head and says \u201cOf <i>course not</i> Blake! As you get older, you\u2019ll find that plenty of people have things that they enjoy that are outside the mainstream. Personally, I think that as long as you do things in a respectful and consenting manner, you\u2019ll be just fine in that regard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake never expected to have this kind of conversation with Amy, especially since he could barely say two words to her the last time he saw her. But he nods and says \u201cI\u2019ll keep your advice in mind. Thank you Amy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut following that, Amy smirks and says \u201cI also think that being a bit weird is a good thing. Sometimes that can let you stand out, especially if you have a lot of passion for your potentially weird hobbies and interests.\u201d Blake nods again, as Amy adds, saying \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re plenty unique, Mr. Mage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, she adds, saying \u201cAnd I must say Blake, I'm impressed by just how much more confident you are now. I remember how you could barely ask if I wanted a drink the last time I visited Claire. You were such a little cutie\u2026 Well you still are, but more of a mature cutie, but <i>extra</i> little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he smiles and slightly blushes while saying \u201cThanks Amy\u2026 I guess shrinking down to this size and seeing you like this made my nervousness feel inconsequential.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy quietly laughs when she hears that, as she says \u201cThat does make sense. After your intense experience that I no doubt made more challenging? I can see how that could get you over your shyness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods, feeling much less nervous around Amy after his long date with her foot and toes, but then she sighs and says \u201cYour magic must be so cool though\u2026 You'll give me all the details, <i>right?</i> The researcher in me wants to know so bad, I'll even let you have whatever crazy experiences with my feet while you stay with me. Or maybe some other things, if you want a break from my feet, since you've already become so closely familiar with them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Blake knew that he\u2019d have to explain all his magic stuff to Amy and her offer was insanely tempting, but then he suddenly yawns. When Amy notices this, she lightly giggles and says \u201cYou must be so exhausted, Blake\u2026 After spending hours in my boot while I enjoyed the office party, <i>and then</i> getting dragged along for my bedtime routine in my moccasin, not to mention how many times I probably messed with your body without noticing, I\u2019m impressed that you didn\u2019t pass out yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after she says this, she begins to rub your head softly while saying \u201c<i>Now that I think about it</i>, I probably didn\u2019t treat you very gently, especially when you were stuck in my moccasin. I doubt my toes showed much restraint once you were near them either, even though you were their guest. <i>Honestly</i>, I barely notice half the things my feet and toes do, even more so when I'm focusing on three things at once, and it didn't help that I was exhausted from the party. It wouldn't surprise me if I put you through some rough punishment once you ended up between my toes too, but I really didn't think anything of it, and in my defense; why would I? I didn\u2019t even feel you while you were in my boot, but I guess I\u2019m glad you fell inside of it, instead of you getting left at the office without Claire or myself. Even if you were trapped in my stuffy boot, I would have dragged you back to my house eventually even without noticing you, so I think you can forgive me for stomping on you all night long\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to laugh to herself after saying that, possibly realizing that she hadn't let Blake respond for a few minutes. Blake was well that Amy was a straightforward person, so describing what happened in this great of detail was perfectly expected of her. After that, she warmly smiles and asks \u201cYou weren\u2019t afraid from all of that, <i>were you Blake?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that long rant, which actually did more to excite the tiny Blake, he would have gladly listened to her speak for hours about practically anything. And even though his experience with her powerful feet was mainly exciting, he had to be honest with Amy, as he says \u201cIt was mostly fun, but it did get a little scary at times\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears this, she immediately grabs Blake and presses him against her cheek, as if trying to reassure the tiny human. She then starts to rub him up and down it, treating him like one might a small animal, as she says \u201cOh you\u2019re <i>so brave</i>, Blake! I\u2019m sorry if things got too frightening for you. I had no idea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy eventually frees him, as he dusts himself off and says \u201cReally, it was a fun kind of scary. I wanted to go on an epic adventure, so you really helped make it even more exciting. Your toes didn't exactly show me mercy, but I kinda liked it that way. And the spirits made me practically invulnerable to harm, so I had nothing to worry about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears this, her eyes light up as she says \u201cSpirits\u2026? Invulnerable to harm...? You just keep on piquing my curiosity, Blake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Amy\u2019s investigative mind was fired back up, Blake gets ready to explain further as he assumed that she\u2019d take back her offer to go to bed now. But then she carefully picks him back up, enveloping him in her soft skin for a moment, putting his mind at ease. After that, she brings him closer to her face, giving him a clearer picture of just how much larger she was than him. And then, she smiles and says \u201cPutting my selfish curiosity aside for a moment; would you like to go to bed now, Blake? I don\u2019t mind saving our chat for the morning...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thinks to himself for a moment, before saying \u201cWhere would I sleep though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy taps her chin a few times, before saying \u201cWell, you can always sleep with me if you think you\u2019ll get chilly. With your smaller body, it could be more difficult to retain body heat, although I\u2019m not the magic expert here. But if you\u2019d like to go with this, I\u2019ll be extra careful tonight. I\u2019d never want to lose Claire\u2019s cute kid after she left him with me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Amy\u2019s suggestion, Blake starts to blush again, even more than last time, causing her to giggle while saying \u201cYou look so adorable Blake\u2026 If you\u2019d feel uncomfortable with that, we can always use my moccasin as a bed. It\u2019s the same one you were in before, so it\u2019ll keep you warm, and I can even throw in the sock I wore for the party as a sort of blanket for you\u2026\u201d Then she smirks and adds, saying \u201cI usually slip them back on when I wake up, so I might forget to take you out beforehand, but I\u2019ll make sure I won\u2019t forget you for too long. I\u2019m much too fascinated by all your mage business for you to slip my mind! And with this strange invulnerability of yours, we won\u2019t have much to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was a bit nerve wracking to think about this stuff, this was the chance for Blake to have some really hot adventures with Amy, and it\u2019d be crazy if he didn\u2019t make the most of this chance. So after a few more minutes of deliberating, Blake eventually comes to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does he decide to do\u2026?</i></span></div></div>",

I actually fell asleep at some point while in your boot, so I feel okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears this, she scratches her chin and says \u201cYou fell asleep while in there? Talk about impressive\u2026\u201d But then she smiles and adds, saying \u201cIn that case, I want to hear all the details with your mage business!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that request, Blake begins, saying \u201cIt all started with those spirits, the same ones I mentioned earlier. Back when I was little, they made contact with me because I had a natural talent for magic, according to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then interjects, saying \u201cThat's impressive, Blake! Those must be wise spirits, because it's good to foster talent at an early age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake proceeds to blush when he hears her compliment, causing her to giggle and gently rub his chin, while saying \u201cSorry for interrupting you. You may continue\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Blake says \u201cThey taught me all of my magic spells, so I kept on practicing with them, but I'm still barely an intermediate mage, since I had to keep up with my school work too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods when she hears this, as she says \u201cThat's very common for students. But learning how to juggle all that stuff can really prepare you for adult life. You're just a bit more unique, since I doubt there are other mages at your school\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he smiles and says \u201cI'm actually friends with a few other mages at school. They're different kinds of mages, but they're nice, so we try to help each other out when we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeds to lightly giggle when she hears that, as she says \u201cI never would have guessed\u2026\u201d Then, she taps her chin a few times, before her eyes light up as she says \u201cSo how did you shrink? You said something about those spirits helping you, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and explains, saying \u201cThat's one spell that was way too advanced for me. I needed to find a few materials for them first, but it was worth it in the end, since it made me invulnerable too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears that, she nods and says \u201cIt would have been far more dangerous if you didn't have that invulnerability. It makes me shudder when just thinking about it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cYeah\u2026 I just wish I stayed at a consistent size\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy suddenly raises her eyebrow, while asking \u201cWhat's that supposed to mean, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake explains, saying \u201cWhen I first cast the spell, I shrunk down to 2 inches. But while I was climbing up your boot, I shrunk down to \u00bd of an inch. That's how I fell in your boot too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears that, she hums to herself while saying \u201cNo wonder I never noticed you Blake! I'd have felt so embarrassed if I couldn't feel a 2 inch tall object in my shoe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cYeah! I wasn't expecting to get even smaller, so I'm glad you noticed when you did\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiles in response and says \u201cIt was all because my foot kept getting chilly. Was that you, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods in confirmation as he says \u201cI needed to get your attention somehow, so a cast a few ice spells. Sorry if I bothered you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just giggles quietly at the tiny Blake, as she says \u201cYou don't need to apologize to me\u2026 I think it's quite impressive. Was the flash of light one of your spells too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cThat was my fire spell. I made sure not to aim it near you. Unlike my ice spell, my fire spell could actually hurt you, even at this size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then smiles at Blake, while saying \u201cWell thank you for being so concerned with my well being, even while I was treating you like a piece of junk between my toes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shakes his head in response and says \u201cYou didn't know it was me, so don't feel guilty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods and then says \u201cThat's true. If I knew it was you, I'd have at least asked you if you wanted a break occasionally\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after that, she smirks and says \u201cBut anyway, I would love a tiny little mage to cool down my feet after a hot day, so I should be thanking you for using your spells! I would have never guessed it was you, which was why I didn't respond kindly to your hard work, so I'm sorry if things got a bit too rough for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake heard Amy's request, it made him wish to do whatever she needed, as just her warm appreciative smile could melt his heart. So he starts to stammer out a response, while blushing heavily and saying \u201cI'd do an\u2026\u201d He then clears his throat and tries again, saying \u201cI\u2019d do anything to make you more comfortable, Amy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeds to lightly blush while saying \u201cThat's so sweet of you, Blake\u2026 You really are a little charmer!\u201d After that, she smirks and adds, saying \u201cCareful though\u2026 I might put you to work after we wake up tomorrow! I could even test out your invulnerability with with a morning jog, and I'd gladly give you a front row seat to my toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he proudly folds his arms and says \u201cI'd do it! I'm not afraid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Amy hears that, begins to giggle while saying \u201cIn that case, we'll need to fully test that theory tomorrow! I might even be able to get Claire to go easy on you if I really work you to the bone\u2026 Just make sure you reflect on why she was upset at you, so she doesn't yell at me\u2026 And you'd be able to fit into some really tight spots, so I don't think I'll have much trouble with thinking up jobs for you to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's eyes widened, as he realized that he'd get to have all kinds of insane fun with Amy, while potentially lessening his upcoming punishment too. Then, Blake grins and yells, saying \u201cIt\u2019s a deal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy shifts the subject slightly, and asks \u201cYou said that you couldn't cast your shrinking spell on your own, right? Do you know how to return to normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake taps his chin a few times, before saying \u201cNot really\u2026 But I could commune with the spirits when I get tired of this size though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods and says \u201cWell that's good. You can stay at this size for as long as you want, Blake. As I mentioned before, I have almost two weeks off, so I'm not in any rush. And I'd love to thoroughly test out your new size\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulps his saliva nervously, as he quietly nods, causing Amy to laugh and say \u201cI love how cute you act when you get flustered, Blake\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, Blake loudly yawns, prompting Amy to yawn in turn, blowing him down onto the floor during the exhale toward her discarded moccasin. Unfortunately for Blake, Amy closed her eyes right as he started his fall. This was a pivotal moment for Blake\u2019s future, which depended entirely on what Amy was able to see once she opened her eyes back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she notice Blake tumble into her moccasin at the last second? Or does she miss it and lose the tiny boy before their first night ended? Either were equally likely, but which occurred\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Another case of writing a bit too much and needing to split things up. But I guess that means more branching paths for everyone else.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortunately for Blake, Amy was able to see that he fell down toward her open moccasin, as her eyes widen with concern. He lands within it, causing him to roll down into the toe section, while  Amy gasps and says \u201c<i>Are you okay, Blake\u2026?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slowly gets up and nods, causing her to giggle and say \u201cI guess we <i>both</i> stayed up a bit too late. But I think I know the <i>perfect</i> place to keep you while we sleep\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Amy shuffles her bare foot into the moccasin, surprising Blake as her mamouth toes approached him rapidly, cutting off the light. Once they were close enough, she tackles him with her foot, using her toes to grasp at the tiny mage blindly. As she does this, she says \u201cHold still Blake\u2026 I'll get you eventually\u2026 I don\u2019t mind working hard for <i>your</i> sake...\u201d She continues to wiggle her toes, endlessly smacking his body with those snake-like appendages, reminding him just how amazing they felt. As she continues to struggle with grabbing at Blake, she sighs and says \u201cYou really are slippery\u2026 And tiny\u2026 But I think I've <i>almost</i> got you! Hopefully you're enjoying it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was 100% loving what was happening right now, as Amy's soft and slightly sticky toes were attacking him aggressively, and it was even better knowing that he was so entertaining to her. But after almost a minute of trying and failing, Amy finally captures Blake and moves him between her 2nd and 3rd toes. And now that he was here, she slips her foot out of the moccasin and claps to herself and says \u201c<i>Yay!</i> I caught the bug mage!\u201d Following that, she affectionately squeezes her toes, smothering Blake in the warm and soft flesh as she says \u201cI think I'll let you sleep right here, between my toes, little Blake. Do you object\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head and yells up, shouting \u201cI like this plan! Thanks Amy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeds to giggle while saying, \u201c<i>Great!</i>\u201d Then she pauses and adds, saying \u201cI'm surprised I can even hear you from down there\u2026\u201d She then scrunches her toes, smothering Blake in the warm flesh, as she says \u201cYou feel so <i>strange</i> Blake, but in a good way I think. I can understand why my toes were so <i>possessive</i> of you earlier, even though I wish they were kinder to you, since you\u2019re just so cute and lovable. A part of me doesn't want to let you go\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then starts to giggle profusely, before adding \u201cWhen you get home, you might want to offer to let <i>Claire</i> have a turn with you. I can tell that you'd be an excellent stress reliever, especially since I can squeeze you as hard as I like without worrying. Your body has an excellent texture, and you contort in just the right ways as I squeeze you. The satisfaction I feel when I squish your body against my tired skin is hard to describe, but it\u2019s almost therapeutic in a way, so I'm sure she'd appreciate it. And if she\u2019s still a bit frustrated with you, she can take it out on you in a healthy manner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses for a moment, before exaggeratedly waving her arm while saying \u201c<i>I can picture it now</i>, Claire relaxing after a long day at work after wearing her cute yet uncomfortable pumps all day, using her thoughtful son as the greatest stress toy a lady can ask for. I\u2019ll be sure to bring it up to her later\u2026 I might even sneak you inside and say you're an actual stress toy, just so she can use you to your fullest\u2026 <i>Wouldn\u2019t that be hilarious\u2026?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wonders about that, since if Amy liked to use him <i>this</i> much, his mom might feel the same way. And Blake still felt guilty for worrying her, so that could be a good way to make it up to her, even if he loved Amy's toes far more. Following that, she walks over to her bed, pounding Blake relentlessly with each step, before sitting down and opening her drawer. Once she had it opened up, she pulled out a pair of thin socks that stay below the ankle, as she says \u201cI think I'll put these socks on. At your size, you're sure to get chilly tonight, so this will give you an extra layer of warmth.\u201d But then she pauses and adds, saying \u201cAlthough I say this, you might want a break from my toes, since you've practically become best friends with all 5 of them, even though they treated you far harsher than a friend should, so would you rather sleep somewhere else? I wouldn't mind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake could respond, Amy clenches her toes, preventing him from speaking as the walls of flesh closed in on him, while she happily sighs and says \u201cAhh\u2026 It feels incredible to squeeze you like that. If you have a crush on somebody at school, do this for them and I'm sure they'd be appreciative. High school can be filled with stress, if it hadn\u2019t changed since I went, so a personal stress reliever would be the perfect gift.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses for a moment, before skillfully moving Blake between her 3rd and 4th toes next, brutally squeezing him right after that. After doing that, she sighs and says \u201cI\u2019ll use me as an example! If I were back in high school and one of my friends willingly acted as my toe toy, letting me use him through all of my tough classes, allowing me to abuse him whenever a teacher annoyed me, or whatever else; I\u2019d probably fall for them. I\u2019ll bet that if you had a crush, they\u2019d be the same as I was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake immediately thinks of his main crush Aria, but he also thinks about many of the other mage girls he's befriended, like Vixen. Maybe this was the key to getting them to like Blake as more than a friend\u2026? As he considered that, Amy stretches her legs and vigorously clenches her toes, burying Blake even deeper into the grimy space between them as she says \u201cSorry if I keep on doing this, but you\u2019re just so soothing to toy with\u2026\u201d Then, she loudly sighs to herself and adds, saying in a much more authoritative tone \u201c<i>I had a <b>really</b> long day, so I need a few more minutes\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this, Blake had a feeling that Amy wouldn\u2019t ask for his thoughts on her request, which was confirmed when she quickly began scrunching her toes with an extreme vigor. Amy does as she promised, putting Blake through a truly hellish experience, as took all of the day\u2019s stress out on him. Sometimes she\u2019d squeeze Blake so hard that he wondered if he\u2019d really pop, and other times she\u2019d wiggle her toes so ferociously that he thought he\u2019d be grinded to dust, making him realize just so effortlessly Amy could dominate him right now. But he was absolutely enthralled by the idea, as his powerlessness strangely excited him, while her soft toes vigorously mashed his body, forcing him into more and more awkward positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, it became clear to Blake that Amy would not merely use him for <i>\u2018a few more minutes\u2019</i>, as she soon became distracted by a fascinating scientific article. Due to that, she decides to skim it, prompting her toes to work the tiny mage far harder and faster, to the point where he was struggling for air. But despite this harsher treatment, Blake was perfectly fine with the situation, since she was just so pretty and cool to him. And her toes, with all their minor imperfections and sweat, proved to relax him completely as his own stress was smashed away. More than anything else, it reminded Blake of just how small he was now, as he could nothing to stop Amy\u2019s toes and their onslaught, even though he had no desire for them to slow down really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finishes with the article, she looks around while mumbling \u201cWait, what was I doing\u2026?\u201d After a short moment of silence where Blake worried that Amy actually forgot about him, he hears her loudly gasp while saying \u201cOh shoot, I forgot all about Blake!\u201d She then separates her toes and looks at Blake warmly, while saying \u201cSorry about that Blake\u2026 Are you okay? I really only planned on going for a few more minutes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was feeling pretty drained at this point, in no small part due to how well her toes aggressively used him, so he just gives Amy a thumbs up, causing her to sigh again and say \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not upset\u2026\u201d Then, she clears her throat and says \u201cMy original point was that, instead of telling me where you wanted to sleep, why don't you give me a signal? I wouldn't want you to strain your voice any more than you already have\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat idea made sense, so Amy continues, saying \u201cI'll keep a close eye on you, and you can cast a spell to give your answer. If you're okay with the current arrangements, cast a fire spell. If not, cast an ice spell. Would that work for you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Blake was currently mashed between her long and powerful toes, he manages to nod, causing Amy to smile and say \u201cPerfect! Whenever you're ready Blake. I want to accommodate you as best as I am able. I am the host after all, so I can't have you feeling uncomfortable...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short thinking break, Blake comes to a decision, casting his chosen spell. Which spell does he choose\u2026?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Blake casts a fire spell away from Amy's toes, showing her a short burst of light. When she sees that, she smiles and says \u201cThat really <i>does</i> look impressive\u2026 And that sounds good to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy scrunches her toes yet again, smothering the puny Blake while she shook out her thin sock. And once she was ready, she waves in his direction and says \u201c<i>Goodnight little Blake!</i> I hope you enjoy your company\u2026 I'm a bit of a morning person, so I hope you're ready for a <i>bright and early</i> start...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right before Amy goes to put the sock on, she suddenly giggles and says \u201cLet's hope my toes don't keep you up <i>all</i> night. You'll need to let me know how it goes, because I have no clue and I'm <i>curious\u2026</i>\u201d That statement was a bit worrying for Blake, but exciting too, since he wouldn't mind a bit of unconscious punishment from Amy as she innocently slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Amy blows Blake a kiss, before saying \u201c<i>Sweet dreams</i> Blake\u2026\u201d That act caused Blake's heart to melt as it was both incredibly cute and enticing, but he tries his best to wave back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also manages to squeak out \u201cGoodnight to you too, Amy\u2026 And thanks again for letting me stay with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy simply giggles and says \u201cOh Blake. I <i>quite</i> enjoy your <i>tiny</i> company\u2026\u201d That statement caused him to blush, but Amy failed to notice as she slowly pulled her socks on. Once her sock was on, he buries his face into one of the slightly moist folds in her toe space, causing her to giggle again while saying \u201cDon't tickle me, Blake\u2026 <i>It's bedtime now!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy squeezes her toes while shuffling under the covers, immobilizing Blake as she got comfortable. After a few moments of moving about, Amy deeply sighed before quickly falling asleep, as the sound of her breathing filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after the day Blake had, and because of just how often he was ruthlessly played with by Amy's energetic toes, he soon falls asleep too. Her toes and sock proved to keep him toasty warm, as the incredibly soft skin made him feel like he was resting on the best mattress in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slept for about an hour, before he was woken up by Amy's toes, as they began to scrunch into him. As he got roughed up more and more, he hears Amy groan in her sleep while mumbling \u201c<i>Blake\u2026 If you don't pamper me properly, then I'll just squish you like a bug\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like Amy had a bit of a mean side buried down below, but Blake didn't really mind it, so he decides to try kissing her toes, wondering how it would feel. And put plainly, it felt strange to Blake, mainly because he felt like he was kissing a soft wall, but it was still fun to him. As he continued doing this, Amy moans in her sleep and mumbles, saying \u201c<i>That's right Blake\u2026 Serve me\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy drifted back into a deep sleep, as her toes sandwiched Blake softly. He would have never have guessed that Amy would treat him this way, but she was dreaming after all, and he had to admit that she did get pretty commanding with him by the end of the night. Despite that, Blake found it oddly enjoyable when Amy forced him to be her stress toy without even asking him. It made him briefly wonder if he'd like it if Aria or another of his lady friends bossed him around like Any occasionally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he thought for too long, Amy's toes affectionately squeezed him tightly, as if instructing him to go back to sleep. And since he was an agreeable mage, Blake complies and snuggles closer to her toes, swiftly falling back to sleep as they kept him warm and comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Blake manages to sleep for two whole more hours, before Amy's toes rub into him to wake him back up. And while he rubbed his eyes, Amy giggles in her sleep while muttering \u201c<i>I need more attention, Mr. Bug Mage\u2026</i>\u201d It seems like Amy was far more domineering in her sleep, as she barely gives him a moment to react before she clenches her toes forcefully, smothering Blake in the warm flesh, as she mumbles \u201c<i>Too slow\u2026 time to\u2026 punish the buggy\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wasn't sure what to expect, but he was both excited and afraid for what Amy planned to do, since her sleeping mind barely showed him a shred of mercy. She begins by scrunching and unscrunching her toes, brutally mashing him deeper between him, as she groans with satisfaction. As she has her way with you, she sleepily mumbles, saying \u201cTiny Blakey needs to\u2026 learn how to\u2026 treat\u2026\u201d She surprisingly trailed off before finishing her sentence, but the meaning was not lost on Blake, who mentally prepared himself for more intense toe action. The tiny mage was becoming more and more disturbed by just how cruel Amy got as she innocently slept, but he figures that she means no real harm since he was invulnerable to any harm, so he just appreciates it while it lasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Blake\u2019s surprise, Amy drifted back to her deep sleep soon after that, sparing him from experiencing whatever her dreaming mind thought up to abuse him. And now that things quieted down, and the only noise in the room was Amy's light snoring, Blake collects his thoughts. Even though this was the second time Amy woke him up, he didn't feel groggy at all, making him wonder if his shrinking allowed him to survive off of short bursts of rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Amy continued to snooze, Blake noticed that the smell of sweat wasn't as heavy now, making him wonder if her scent dissipated as she slept. Despite that, it was still present enough to be distinct for each of Blake's senses, but that sweaty aroma almost relaxed him even more anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Blake falls back asleep, and rests undisturbed until morning, as Amy seemed to have gotten her fill of her nighttime abuse toward him. And once morning came, Amy woke back up, vigorously squeezing her toes and jolting Blake awake too. As sudden as that was, Blake couldn\u2019t think of a better way to be woken up, as her toes embraced him with their heavenly texture and aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after that, she swung her legs out and onto the carpet, grinding her feet onto it sleepily, while mumbling \u201cTalk about a late night\u2026\u201d That caused Blake to be harshly crushed, as her toes made sure that he remained their personal plaything, making him hope that she didn't forget about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, she starts to rub her temple, while muttering \u201cWhat a headache. Guess I got a bit of a hangover. I should have gone straight to bed\u2026\u201d Following she quickly plucks off her socks, briefly giving Blake some fresh air, before shoving her feet into her fluffy moccasins. He was already closely familiar with these babies, as the heat already caused Amy's toes to sweat a bit, which of course impacted the tiny mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she stands up and vigorously presses her toes into the shoe, while sighing and saying \u201cAt least my moccasins know how to put me in a better mood. Might as well take a pain pill for this headache though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, she walks to her bathroom, treading on Blake as she moved, still not yet remembering the tiny boy. And once she got there, she takes a pill and before bending down to wash her face. Due to how much Amy's toes were now sweating, a distinct odor soon formed around Blake, as the powerful scent was almost intoxicating to the puny mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waits a minute for the water to get warmer, while forcefully squeezing her toes, cramming little Blake even deeper between them. Despite how vividly she described how her toes \u2018most likely\u2019 treated Blake last night in an attempt to apologize, they acted just as brutally as before. It seemed like whenever she wasn't clearly thinking of Blake, she punished him with an insane level of severity. Despite how much he enjoyed it, he was still a bit disturbed by how cruel Amy could get without realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blake liked just how effortlessly Amy dominated him, especially when she was just performing a routine task up above. Speaking of that though, by this time she had finally started washing her face, scrubbing it down with her moisturizing soap. And as she did that, her toes continued to scrub Blake too, mashing him into each and every crack and crevice that formed along and between them. She was abusing him so rapidly and relentlessly that he could barely catch his breath, as her toes didn't need air breaks like the bug they were battering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was all finished, she dries her face and sighs while saying \u201cTime for some breakfast. <i>I'm starved\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Blake knew that Any wouldn't remember him on her own, so he needed to take some initiative, so he prepares to cast an ice spell into the sticky space between her 3rd and 4th toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he mentally prepared himself, he hurls the spell and hopes for the best. Does Blake succeed at reminding Amy of his existence\u2026?</span></div></div>",

It feels oddly familiar and <i>strangely</i> pleasant\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of thought, Amy's eyes widen as she yells \u201c<i>Oh no!</i> I forgot all about Blake!!\u201d Following that relieving statement, Amy lifts her foot and shakes off the moccasin, allowing Blake to breathe fresh air again, as she carefully pries him out from between her sticky toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she gets him on her palm, she looks at him sadly and says \u201cThis was all my bad\u2026 <i>Are you okay</i>, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake takes a deep breath, before nodding while saying \u201cI'm good Amy! I just wasn't expecting all of that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then quietly laughs and says \u201cI wasn't planning that either. I feel a bit better knowing that you most likely enjoyed the experience, but it kind of scares me by just how harsh I can be with you if you ever slip my mind\u2026\u201d But then she smiles and gently strokes Blake's head, while saying \u201cDid you have a good sleep...? I hope my toes let you rest in peace, <i>at the very least\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he laughs nervously and asks \u201cDo you want the truth\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeds to frown with worry as she says \u201c<i>Oh no\u2026 How bad was I\u2026?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake proceeds to explain his night between her toes, describing the things she said and did, leaving Amy speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once Blake was finished, her jaw drops as she mutters \u201c<i>Jesus\u2026 I sound like a nut\u2026</i>\u201d Then she clears her throat and says \u201cSo I said all of that?\u201d Blake nods, causing her to rub the back of her neck while mumbling \u201cJust what was I dreaming about\u2026? I don't think I want to know, and I'm <i>normally</i> fascinated by that stuff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake agrees, before saying \u201cI still slept enough to feel good. And I had fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then sighs with relief as she says \u201cI'm lucky you're such a forgiving buggy\u2026 But, I'll cook us some breakfast!\u201d Then she smirks and adds, saying \u201cAnd I know the perfect place to store you in, Blake\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy bends down and drops him into her moccasin, allowing him to land with a thud. And as Blake stood back up, she angled the shoe up with her foot, causing him to roll down back into the hot and humid toe area. Once he was there, Amy shuffles her foot back into the moccasin, barely giving him a moment before pouncing on him with her gigantic toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she does this, she giggles and says \u201cI'll make us a wonderful breakfast, so you can spend a quick shift as my stress toy again. I hope you're ready for even more fun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy proceeded to thoroughly dominate Blake with those long and slender toes, forcing him into plenty of awkward positions in the process. At some points he felt like she was trying to fold him up until he was mashed into a ball, but this time, Blake wanted to try fighting back if only to see how it'd go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy quickly notices his struggles while she cracked two eggs on the frying pan, causing her to giggle and say \u201cAre you trying to be tough, Blake\u2026? Let's see how long you can manage against me\u2026\u201d It soon became a fierce battle, as Amy's toes seemed to always hold the advantage, but Blake occasionally managed to slip away and resist, amusing the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this great struggle was occurring, Amy was happily cooking the eggs, only really paying attention to Blake in the corner of her mind. In a way, that might have been why he was having a moderate level of success, but he had no way of knowing that personally. And since Amy wanted her meal to be tasty for her and Blake, she let him feel like he was holding the advantage, finding his spirited resistance to be incredibly adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy fried the eggs, she got another pan to cook a small strip of scrapple too, wanting to make sure both she and Blake had a varied breakfast. Around this time, he managed to avoid her 3rd to, inspiring him to try and wrestle with her 4th one, causing Amy to lightly chuckle while saying \u201cLook at you\u2026 You've sure got a lot of energy!\u201d Right after saying this, she pins Blake down under that toe, immobilizing him while saying \u201cYou'll need to try <i>a lot</i> harder\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Blake was pinned, he grabs that toe and squeezes it as hard as he can, causing Amy to giggle and say \u201c<i>Aww\u2026</i> You're hugging the very same toe that so meanly bullied you all night\u2026? You're <i>so</i> precious\u2026\u201d But now that the eggs were almost done, Amy shifts her attention back to the stove, while allowing Blake to win a few minor victories against her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she focused on the eggs, she puts a slice of rye bread in the toaster, while Blake started punching her 4th toe. Because of his puny size, it only really tickled her slightly, so she allowed him to continue unobstructed, as if to repay him for aggressively abusing him all night and into the morning without ever realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the breakfast was finally ready, so she starts piling it onto her plate neatly, before walking to the table. To her surprise, Blake prepared himself for this, as he managed to crawl on top of her 3rd and 4th toes. She decides to give Blake this victory, since it was a clever move, before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was seated, she shakes off her moccasins, threatening to toss Blake to the floor. And when he looks up, he sees Amy grinning down at him, before swiftly capturing him with her other set of toes. Now that he was successfully transferred, she squeezes and mashes him with great vigor, overpowering the tiny mage in an instant. As she does this, she laughs and says \u201cI'm impressed Blake, but I hope you remember that you only win <i>if</i> I don't feel like trying\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to manhandle Blake ceaselessly, scrunching him again and again, while saying \u201cSo long as you remain <i>this</i> fun to play with, you'll be my <i>favorite</i> little boy toy\u2026\u201d After that, Amy frees Blake and places him on her palm, allowing him to dust himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while he shakes away his dizziness, she giggles and says \u201cYou really tried hard, so feel proud of yourself for that!\u201d Blake beamed proudly when he heard that, but then she smirks and adds, saying \u201cIf we've learned one thing though, it's that my toes are deadly weapons for tiny mages, and whether or not I notice those tiny mages doesn't seem to matter to them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy frees Blake and drops him onto her plate of food while saying \u201cAt your size, I think we can safely share everything. You don't mind, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods, before saying \u201cI'm cool with it, but please watch out for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears that, she nods back and says \u201cOf course Blake! If Claire found out I accidentally ate you, I think she might <i>actually</i> kill me\u2026\u201d She then nervously laughs and says \u201cLet's both be careful. You're not the easiest guy to keep track of at your size\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that excellent point, Blake and Amy both begin eating, as they each tried to do so carefully. Unfortunately, they were both ravenously hungry, causing them to both get more careless as they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big question is, does Blake eat his breakfast without an accidental disturbance by Amy\u2026? Or does he get scooped up by the starved giant by mistake...?</span></div></div>",

It was more than a bit intimidating for him to watch her devour her food, especially since he could easily get stuck to her food without her ever noticing in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with that thought, Blake climbs off of her plate and wait for her to finish, thinking about how lucky he was that Amy discovered. From the beginning, she was incredibly fun with him, indulging him with his size-related interests without a complaint. And it was even more fun when she lost track of him, as her toes seemed hardwired to thoroughly abuse him, which was awesome in his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he looks down toward the floor, and notices her furiously playing with her moccasins, idly shuffling and tossing them about, making him wonder how he never noticed that about her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes though, Amy puts her utensils down and smiles, before saying \u201cThat hit the spot\u2026 Did you eat enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cYeah I'm full. It tasted great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy playful rubs Blake's head while saying \u201cYou're <i>so</i> sweet Blake\u2026 Are you ready to get to our tests? <i>I'm excited\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods again and says \u201cYep! What are we doing first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Amy grins and snatches the tiny mage up, bringing him into her personal lab. Once she set him down, he looks around and sees all the different machines and piles of papers, as Amy giggles and says \u201cIt can get a little messy in here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy pulls out a computer chip half the size of Blake, before quietly tinkering with it. As she does this, she apathetically says \u201c<i>Give me a few minutes\u2026</i> Wanna go in my moccasin so you don't get bored?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a side of Amy that Blake heard about from his mom, since he'd only seen her when she was relaxing at their house. Apparently, whenever she was doing stuff in her lab or at work, everything else around her became unimportant. And after hearing about Amy\u2019s behavior while in her lab, Blake was incredibly interested in seeing what it would be like, even more so if he could be her small toe toy while she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blake nods and says \u201cI'd like that, thanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that, Amy merely says \u201c<i>Sure...</i>\u201d After that uninterested reply, Amy grabs Blake uncaringly and deposits him into her left moccasin. Once he was there, he notices that the potent odor from before was just as noticeable at the moment, as the smell of sweat caused him to cough a bit. And before he could get readjusted to this location, she shuffles her foot inside and begins to toy with him, barely giving him a chance to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes squeeze and writhe, smothering Blake with a brutal efficiency, while their master tinkers up above. They continue to manipulate the tiny mage, treating like a piece of dough to be kneaded, overwhelming him with her sweat all throughout the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remains the researcher's plaything for nearly 15 minutes, as he gets repeatedly slammed against her warm and affectionate toes. She doesn't even give him a moment to breathe, vigorously mashing him between her sweaty toes, while intently focused on her work up above. And whenever he would slip away to catch his breath, her toes would immediately recapture him, as if they wanted him to pass out first. After that time passed, which felt far longer for the diminutive mage, Amy cheers to herself and exclaims \u201c<i>And\u2026</i> done! <i>That's</i> how the head of R&amp;D rolls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy frees Blake, lifting him up to her desk while saying \u201cYou did a great job as my thinking tool! You should consider a career in this\u2026 I know I'd give you plenty of business, personally\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushes when he hears that, as he smiles and says \u201c<i>Yeah\u2026</i> I'm glad you've got my back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy proceeds to explain what she was working on, as she says \u201cI set this device up so it'd accurately record your vitals and basically everything else about you, since I've got a few challenging tasks in mind for today. This way we'll have some data, <i>besides</i> your testimony!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he looks up and says \u201cWow! You work crazy fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy happy grins when she hears that, as she says \u201cThanks for the compliment, Blake! <i>What else did you expect from me?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Blake asks \u201cHow does that thing work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled in response and says \u201cI'm glad you asked! Basically, it's able to record the vitals of anything within a certain range. So even if I don't attach it to you, it'll still work fine. Normally, we'd place it under your skin since it's so thin, but I'm afraid we can't make chips small enough for mages of your <i>super puny</i> stature just yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cThat's fair\u2026 So what's the first test?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeds to smirk while saying \u201cThis is right around when I take my morning jog, so what could be a better stress test than stuffing you in my sock while I go\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he grows excited as he says \u201cYou'll really let me go with you??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods and says \u201cOf course! Remember what I said last night? I'll make sure to <i>thoroughly</i> punish you so Claire might go easier on you; but we can ignore the fact that you'll <i>definitely</i> like my acts of discipline\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods in agreement, as he says \u201cI like your plan! I'm ready when you are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy brings Blake back into her room, pulling out a pair of light pink ankle socks. After that, she grabs her dark pink running shoes and stitches the computer chip into the side of the sneaker, making sure that it was working properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she seemed ready, Amy smiles and says \u201c<i>For the record</i>, you can go outside my sock if you\u2019d rather do that. I\u2019ll get my data regardless, but I\u2019d feel you better if you went in my sock. Especially since I\u2019ll be able to <i>really</i> feel your tiny struggles, so I\u2019d personally prefer it if you did that. But I\u2019m not here to boss you around!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake prepares to retort, but Amy cuts him off as she says \u201cI should restate that; I\u2019m not bossing you around <i>this</i> time. Apparently I\u2019ve got a bad habit of pushing you around, but can you blame me when you\u2019re <i>so</i> teeny tiny and easy to bully\u2026? Consider it a compliment, Blake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Blake rather do? (And no, this isn\u2019t a last minute choice because I originally made the chapter too long for the character limit.

Once he was secure, she tugs her sock on while saying \u201cI'll see you a bit later, Blake\u2026 <i>Have fun!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her sock was on and Blake was trapped in darkness, he casts his night vision spell again as Amy put on her sneakers.

Blake was caught off guard, as her toes crushed him to harshly that the air was knocked out if him. Then, Amy checked the readings, while saying \u201cAll of your vitals look how they should after experiencing something sudden and dangerous. <i>It works like a charm!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, she laughs and says \u201cI hope you're ready to exercise, because I'm planning on working up a sweat\u2026\u201d After that final tease, Amy walks out her front door and starts her run, pounding Blake mercilessly with every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Any was outside and moving, Blake was forced to contend with the full brunt of her immense weight. Even though she started with a slower jog, practically every step made him feel like his body might explode, even though he didn't notice a bit of actual damage. He briefly wonders if the psychological impacts of this overrode everything else, even though he knew he'd be just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Amy jogged down her block, she laughs and says \u201cI'm going to start listening to my music now Blake\u2026 <i>But I've got a little surprise for you\u2026</i>\u201d He wasn't sure what to expect, but then he suddenly heard what sounded like the main theme for the game <b>Chrono Trigger</b>, as she giggles and says \u201cI did some tinkering on that sneaker while you weren't looking, and added a few tiny speakers for my equally tiny bug boy. Now you can enjoy the music with me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Blake was concerned, Amy was a genius, and her stunning beauty and only elevated his opinion of her in his mind. And despite how often he was getting crushed by her, he was simply proud of himself for getting over his shyness while around her. Then, Blake wonders if he could convince the spirits to shrink him on a regular basis, as he was sure that Amy would assist him in obtaining whatever they required for the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts are interrupted Amy suddenly stops, overwhelming him as her toe flesh bared down on him, sandwiching him entirely between that and her warm sock. As she does this, she laughs and says \u201cSorry\u2026 Needed to stop at a red light\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Amy waited for the light to change, she started tapping her feet to the music, as Frog\u2019s Theme was now playing, which was highly upbeat. Blake kept on getting smashed down under her sweaty toes, as the track played in the shoe, giving him something nice to listen to while she happily dominated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the light changed, allowing Amy to continue, battering him endlessly with each step. She continues at this leisurely pace for about 20 minutes, while Blake was starting to really feel the burn. He was never the most active kid, since he would rather read or play video games, but just being in Amy's sock gave him a heavy workout, and she wasn't even finished yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy stops for a moment and says \u201c<i>Doing okay in there, Blake\u2026</i>? You didn't pass out on me, did you?\u201d She then starts to scrunch her toes, burying you among the sweaty flesh. As she does this, she taps her chin and says \u201cI can't really tell if you're awake or not\u2026 Why don't you cast an ice spell for me if you're still kicking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake does as he was asked, shooting an ice spell toward the space between her 2nd and 3rd toes, causing her to happily grin and say \u201cOh that feels wonderful, Blake! You're such a convenient little guy\u2026\u201d But now that she knew that he was still awake, she giggles and says \u201cI forgot to warn you, but I like to go all out for the last 10 minutes of my run. <i>You should prepare yourself\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that statement, Amy speeds up, getting herself up to a fast running pace, putting Blake through an even more intense experience. Each time her food collided with the sidewalk, he thought that his body would be obliterated underfoot. And right after the initial collision, her toes would dig into him as she prepared to lift the other leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll during this, Blake could feel his body get flatter by the second, as her sweat kept him lubricated within the stuffy sock. Everything became a blur at this point, as he could no longer process what was happening properly, as the pounding of her toes became almost normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to that, Blake continued to space out until Amy finished her run, after which she popped off her sneakers and yanked off her socks. And now that Blake could feel fresh air again, Amy reaches down and frees him, before placing him on her palm. Now that he was free, he was able to see how she was currently dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was presently wearing a red tank top and a white pair of short shorts, as her dark and short hair looked messy and damp with sweat. When she notices Blake's stares, she giggles to herself and says \u201cY<i>ou okay Blake\u2026?</i> I look pretty gross right now, don't I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shakes his head though and says \u201cYou look amazing Amy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears that, her eyes widen as she says \u201cOh you're <i>such</i> a tiny charmer\u2026!\u201d She then reaches down and plants her gigantic lips on the tiny boy, wanting to give him a quick kiss. Blake felt like he was going to get sucked into her mouth as his mind was overwhelmed by this awesome occurrence, before she ended this kiss and looked down at him happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she suddenly scowls, as her face scrunched as she says \u201c<i>Eww\u2026</i> You taste awful! Are you sure you <i>actually</i> like my feet and aren't just crazy\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shakes head, while stumbling from that unexpected kiss, before saying \u2018Your feet are incredible! I'd stay near them all day if you let me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears this, she smiles and says \u201c<i>That could be arranged\u2026</i> You know how much I adore your presence near them, and we both know that my toes are your biggest fans, even if they seem to enjoy bullying you most of all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after that, she smiles and says \u201cWould you like to get washed off? I have something designed to clean small devices, so it should handle your clothes just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods, but then she slyly grins and says \u201c<i>Though</i>, I need to take a shower too, since I'm just covered in sweat. You can always join <i>me</i>, if you think you'll need assistance with washing yourself. I have no issues with the tiny mage being <i>my</i> shower buddy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was a unique and powerful chance for Blake. When he first saw Amy at this size, he briefly fantasized watching her shower in secret, but now she gave him an open invitation to join her! How could he pass up on this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, Blake was given a choice, so he eventually makes his decision\u2026</span></div></div>",

Let's get you all set up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy jury rigs a small shower for Blake, taking some time to make sure it would work properly for him. Before she starts though, she stares at him slyly, worrying him as she suddenly grabs him while saying \u201cI\u2019ll need to work some of my own magic to get your shower working properly, so I\u2019ll need some <i>heavy</i> motivation\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t mind letting me use your services again, <i>would you?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Blake had no issue with the idea, he feels like being snarky, so he says \u201cBut I\u2019ve literally been away from your foot for less than five minutes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy merely laughs and says \u201c<i>I know\u2026</i> I have a feeling that my toes might be a <i>bit</i> obsessed with you, because they already miss you like crazy\u2026\u201d But then she smirks and adds, saying \u201c<i>Now that I think about it</i>, why <i>should</i> I have to ask my little buggy guest\u2026? He should jump at the chance to assist me, since I\u2019m being <i>so</i> accommodating\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Amy drops Blake onto the carpet, allowing him to bounce on the soft flooring until he came to a stop. And once he could stand up, he brushed himself off as a dark shadow formed over him, causing him to look back and see Amy\u2019s sweat soaked foot raised overhead. This time though, Blake didn\u2019t want to be an easy target, so he casts a speed boosting spell and a jump increase spell, making him far more agile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to that, he avoids Amy\u2019s toes just in time, as she giggles and says \u201cThat was <i>pretty</i> clever Blake\u2026\u201d Then she grins and adds, saying \u201cIf you want me to earn my toe toy, then I\u2019m game! Let\u2019s see how long you can keep this up, <i>little mage boy\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that declaration of war, Blake continued to dodge Amy\u2019s foot at the last possible second every time, making him wonder if she was actually toying with him, like how a cat might treat their prey. He doesn\u2019t let that distract him though, since Amy barely gave him a second to spare, as she started to slam her foot harder and harder. And as the resulting shockwaves and dust clouds made it more difficult for Blake to see, Amy giggles and says \u201cYou\u2019re definitely a quick little bug, but will your stamina outlast mine\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to how often Amy was stomping her foot, it was becoming difficult for Blake to see clearly, and he had to many spells active already to improve his vision too. And any time he tried to escape the general area, she made sure to block his path with her giant foot, ensuring that she remained in full control of the general situation. Despite all of that, it still felt good for him to be able to avoid Amy\u2019s foot for this long, as it was a major magic confidence booster for him. Since he lived a fairly normal life so far, without going on any dangerous adventures, he never needed to use his magic to this degree. But he was maintaining the two spells fairly well, while somehow avoiding Amy\u2019s constantly stomping foot, even though he was starting to lose focus a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as Blake went to dodge Amy\u2019s foot yet again, she surprises him by trying to swipe him with her other foot, sending him flying back from the resulting gust of wind, nearly colliding with the nearby wall. While he struggled to get back up, Amy haughtily laughed and said \u201cDid you get this worked up and forget that I\u2019ve got two feet at my disposal\u2026? You\u2019re definitely a skilled little mage, but you\u2019ve gotta think outside the box\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake could get back up, Amy uses her feet to corner him against the wall, he grins while saying \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m giving up just yet!\u201d Following that, he casts a stronger jump boost spell while deactivating his speed spell, before leaping high up in the air. Amy watches him curiously, as he then casts a wind spell, propelling him forward and under her chair, officially escaping from her for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he scurries further under the chair, Amy whistles to herself while saying \u201cOkay, <b>that\u2019s</b> pretty clever Blake! I\u2019ve still got one more trick up my sleeve though\u2026\u201d Following that, she starts to rub her feet together slowly, while loudly sighing and saying \u201cI can\u2019t <i>wait</i> until I can get cleaned off\u2026 My feet feel <i>so</i> gross right now\u2026 Might as we get back to work\u2026\u201d Blake wasn\u2019t sure what Amy was planning, but then she adds, saying \u201cWithout something to keep my toes busy, it\u2019ll probably take twice as long to set up Blake\u2019s shower. What a shame\u2026 I would have <i>loved</i> to feel his tiny body between my toes, but I would have felt so bad, since they\u2019re so <i>sweaty</i>. What can a lady do\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like Amy\u2019s final strategy was to guilt and seduction, and despite Blake\u2019s previous boasts, this was having a powerful effect on him. As he debated to himself about what to do next, Amy slides her legs back, before crossing her ankles and flicking her toes against each other, providing the small mage with an engaging show. And while she continued to flex her footwork to him, he was drawn closer like a moth to a flame, eventually touching her right big toe before even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy notices this instantly, and scoops him up and trapping him between that toe and the ball of her foot. As she toys with him, Amy profusely giggles while saying \u201c<i>See that Blake?</i> Mental warfare sometimes is the most effective\u2026\u201d After that, she clenches her toes even harder, burying Blake deeply in the soft and moistened flesh, while saying \u201cYou get an A from me though, especially with that little escape move! And you\u2019ll <i>always</i> get an A+ when it comes to being my toe toy, so you should be proud Blake...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy walks barefoot toward her lab, wanting to make a nice shower area for Blake to use, feeling quite happy that she got her personal pebble back between her toes. Once she got there, she got to work, as her toes abused Blake with extreme vigor, reminding him how aggressive they got whenever their master was busying \u2018inventing\u2019 things. But Blake was a huge fan of when Amy got like this, as getting absolutely dominated by her toes felt amazing to him, and he felt even better since he actually lasted a while with avoiding her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she continued to tinker at her desk, she dully mumbles, saying \u201cLooking good so far\u2026\u201d The coolest part of this was that despite how bored Amy sounded while working on her inventions, her toes remained spirited and energetic, as if they stole away her typical fun and excitable personality. His thoughts were interrupted though, as she begins to slam the ball of her foot into the hardwood floor repeatedly, as if she wanted to crush his body into a fine paste. Thankfully, Blake\u2019s durability held strong, as Amy continued to work on his shower, spending almost twenty minutes hard at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right when Blake thought he\u2019d pass out from being intensely used by Amy\u2019s sweat coated toes, she suddenly cheers to herself while yelling \u201cAnd... done!!\u201d Following that, she quickly picks him out from deep between her toes, as she giggles while saying \u201cI thank you for your noble sacrifice, Blake\u2026 I was worried that it\u2019d take me an hour to get that prepared, so now I can shower too!\u201d Blake only gives Amy a weak thumbs up, as he was still a bit dizzy from his passionate date with her possessive and affectionate toes, so she brings him and the new shower into the bathroom with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Blake removes his clothes and places them in a small washing device that Amy set up next to his shower, while she prepared to start her own shower. But since they were currently in the same room, Blake hides behind a wall nervously as he says \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be in the other room??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy merely giggles and says \u201c<i>This\u2019ll be just fine Blake\u2026</i>\u201d After saying that, she went into a nearby closet to grab a washcloth, wanting to get herself ready before teasing Blake further. And at the very same time, Blake snuck closer to the sink\u2019s edge, wanting to get a clear view of the room before Amy returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he was looking around, Amy walked into the room and suddenly tripped, causing her washcloth to fall directly below where Blake was standing. As he watched it fall, he turned around and saw Amy crashing down in his direction, as she hastily grabbed the sink. The location that she grabbed at was dangerously close to him, causing a strong enough vibration to knock Blake off his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he fell down, he hoped that nothing bad would happen. Where does Blake land\u2026?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully, Blake only falls on his butt behind him, prompting him to run back into his shower before Amy could accidentally impede him further. And as she picked up her washcloth and stand back up, she sighs and says \u201cSorry for the scare, Blake\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heads into the shower, glad that nothing bad happened as Amy draped a towel over his shower box, preventing him from seeing anything outside of it and making him feel less bashful. After that, Amy strips down, happy to peel her hot and sweaty clothes off, before stepping into her shower. And as she washed off, the roar of the shower filled Blake\u2019s ears even from down at the sink area, but then a different noise started to spread around the room. To Blake\u2019s surprise, Amy started to sing to herself while basking under the warm stream of water, and he thought that she sounded beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Blake got to have a relaxing shower while getting to listen to Amy\u2019s wonderful singing voice, before he finishes and gets his now dry clothes. As he got dressed, he heard Amy\u2019s shower stop, as she quickly pulled away the towel covering his area, allowing him to see a stunning sight. In front of Blake was Amy, towering over him, fully nude and dripping wet, causing him to freeze while blushing. And as Amy stared at him, still soaking wet and naked, she merely giggles and says \u201cDid I forget to tell you that this was my towel\u2026? Consider this my little reward for always making my toes feel happy\u2026 Plus for dealing with how much I wind up pushing you around, which is only sometimes intended...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Amy gave him her blessing, he sat down fully dressed and watched as she stood in front of him, checking her face in a nearby mirror. At his angle, he could see more of Amy than he ever thought he would, making him feel lucky to be alive. Her breasts were insanely huge right now, although he\u2019d have no way of guessing how large they\u2019d be to a normally sized person, but he couldn\u2019t help that since he was small enough that one of her boobs seemed more like a small mountain to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he was positioned a bit too high up to see her private area, as he might actually faint from shock if that was visible to him. But in general, Amy had a very slender body type, but also looked slightly curvy overall, and this only made him view her as even more visually stunning. His chance to simply watch Amy as she stood still didn\u2019t last that long though, as she quickly started to dry off, rubbing her large fluffy towel all across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake continued to observe Amy as she did this, getting see look at her from every angle as she constantly turned about while drying off. At one point, Amy turned around and revealed her butt to Blake, causing his eyes to widen at the sight. Because of how unexpected that was, he fell back, while noting that it looked like how expected a butt to look, without being able to make any other clear observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Amy finished and picked Blake up, carrying him back into her bedroom, still fully naked. As she carried him in her open palm, he covered his eyes while yelling \u201cA\u2026 Amy!! Shouldn\u2019t y\u2026 you cover yourself up??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just laughs and says \u201cWhy? It\u2019s just us\u2026 And I don\u2019t mind you taking a peek now and then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she throws her damp towel onto her bed, before throwing Blake onto it next, causing him to crash into the soft mass. As he climbed out to freedom, Amy giggled while saying \u201cIf you got this embarrassed by seeing me after my shower, imagine how flustered you'd have been if you joined me for it\u2026? I would have loved to see that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy smiles and says \u201cFeel free to look if you want\u2026 It won\u2019t take long for me to get dressed\u2026\u201d With that invitation, Blake watches intently as Amy started by slipping on a pair of pink panties with a white star design, causing him to immediately blush. Amy watches him with extreme amusement, as she continues to get dressed in front of the tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was dressed, he turns around and sees that she was now wearing a light blue blouse shirt and a black skirt, along with matching black flats. After that, she smiles and says \u201cHow do I look\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe merely stares for a few seconds, before simply saying \u201c...Stunning\u2026\u201d Amy found his antics as adorable as ever, so she picks him up and brings him into her living room. Once she was there, she places him in her palm, before looking at him happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she smiles and says \u201cWhat do you want to do next? I have a few ideas. Want to hear them\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cSure! What did you have in mind, Amy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grins after that and says \u201cSo my first idea is to invite Claire over. I meant what I said before about being her toe toy, and I really think she'd like it. I'm sure she'd want to see you and hold you herself, at the very least.\u201d But then she smirks and says \u201cIf you wanna surprise her, I can always say you're sleeping in, and just sneak you in her shoe. That could be a fun little experience. Do you think her toes will be as mean as mine get with you, or do you think they'll recognize and want to spoil you instead? I'm fascinated, personally\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she continues, saying \u201cI also have more experimental ideas for you. I can always test your size limits in more and more different ways. At the very least, that shower left my toes feeling lonely, so you might just need to act as my personal pebble for another shift. I might even have some tinkering to do, so you'll surely have a wild time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't think of inviting his mom, but it sounded like an interesting idea. And he would be willing to act as her toe toy if it'd make his mom feel better, especially if it'd get her to lessen his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Amy's first experiment was incredibly fun, so doing more of that sounded like the perfect idea. And after that first experience between her toes while she was actively inventing might have been his most intense bout with Amy's fleshy beasts yet, so that'd also be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Blake comes to a decision\u2026</span></div></div>",

How are you feeling\u2026?\u201d She then releases him and starts to poke and prod at him while saying \u201cYou didn't get injured at all, right? Amy took good care of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods at both questions, as Amy laughs and says \u201cHe was quite well behaved. I even got to learn all about his magic stuff. Wanna hear about it Claire\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nods, so Amy explains everything she learned from Blake, leaving Claire speechless. Once she learned about everything, Claire took a deep breath and said \u201cI never knew you were keeping all of this a secret\u2026 I wish you told me, Blake\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looks down and says \u201cSorry mom\u2026 I thought you'd not let me continue to practice magic\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then sighs and says \u201cHonestly, I probably would have stopped you. But at this point, I can't exactly do that, can I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy smiles and says \u201cTo change the subject, I made quite the discovery with little Blake\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looks at her friend curiously and says \u201cDid you learn how to reverse this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shakes her head and says \u201cNope. For that, I think he'll need to visit those spirits again. But there's no need to rush\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then looks at Amy with a hint of confusion, as she says \u201cWell what did you both discover?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Amy informs Claire about Blake's little fetish for feet and how he ended up being an excellent stress toy for your toes. As she listened, she stared with wide, shock filled eyes, while Blake looked down with extreme embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Amy finishes explaining all of that, Claire glares at her friend and says \u201cYou put Blake in your shoe?? What in the world is wrong with you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy merely chuckles and says \u201cI'm just doing the little guy a favor. He was a huge fan of the idea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shakes her head and says \u201cHe could have been injured!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy merely sighs and says \u201cDid you hear the whole magic thing? Blake invulnerable to harm at this size. I doubt we'd actually be able to hurt him even if we wanted to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire proceeds to scratch at her hair in a  frustrated manner, while saying \u201cThis is just crazy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Blake smiles up at his mom and says \u201cI'd like to make you feel more relaxed, so can I please do this for you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire finally gives in and sighs, before saying \u201cI'll admit that I do have a bad headache from the party, so maybe I could use some stress relief. You're 100% sure that you'll be safe with this, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cDefinitely! I ended up falling in Amy's boot at the party, and I was under her foot for hours, and I was fine!\u201d He then laughs proudly to himself and adds, saying \u201cI even went in Amy's sock during her morning run, and I ended up totally okay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire hears this, she glares at Amy again and says \u201cWere you trying to kill my baby boy\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy simply giggles and says \u201cIt was all for research, I swear\u2026!\u201d But then she smirks and adds, saying \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna do it, I\u2019d be willing to make use of Blake instead. I\u2019m a big fan of his stress relieving ability\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighs when she hears that, as she says \u201cYou just want to bully my son some more\u2026 If he didn\u2019t enjoy it then I\u2019d have some serious words for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just shrugs and says \u201cThat\u2019s fair\u2026 You can make the decision though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thinks for a moment, apparently not feeling the need to ask for Blake\u2019s opinion, but he\u2019d have no issue regardless of her choice. He definitely wanted his mom to have a chance, since it\u2019d be a great way to relieve her stress, and he definitely still felt guilty for making her worry last night. But getting ruthlessly abused by Amy\u2019s toes was a new but beloved pastime for him, so that\u2019d be awesome to him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does Claire decide to do\u2026?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This was another case of character limits. I\u2019ll post the more action centered chapter tomorrow, so look forward to that. It\u2019ll involve Claire, so feel free to add for the Amy option if you want. I probably won\u2019t, at least not for awhile.)</span></div></div>",

He did make the offer to me, so it\u2019d be rude of me to just pass him on to you, Amy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just sighs and says \u201cAnd I was <i>this</i> close to getting him back\u2026 I can guarantee that you\u2019ll appreciate his decision\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Claire nods and says \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it, Amy. We\u2019d might as well get started...\u201d Now that Claire was ready, she carefully lowers Blake while slipping her right foot out of her flat, before placing him inside of her shoe. Then, she looks down at her son and says \u201cIf you change your mind, just cast one of your spells on me. But I\u2019m putting my shoe back on now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Claire shuffles her foot into the flat, unintentionally ramming Blake with her 2nd toe. When she notices this, she gasps and stops her foot, ushering him deeper into the flat instead. And once she got it on, Blake places his hands on her 2nd toe, causing to to rise away from him as she quietly laughs and says \u201cOh sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to startle you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Claire brings her toe back down, inspiring Blake to try rubbing it, providing his mom with a small massage. Unfortunately, Claire couldn\u2019t feel him very clearly, prompting her to slowly wiggle her toe, causing him to lose his balance and trip between her 2nd and 3rd toes. Once he ends up there, she scrunches her toes, weakly smothering him in the soft flesh as she says \u201cYou\u2019re going great so far, sweety! Fire a spell at me if I get too rough with you, okay? I want you to feel safe with me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like Claire was going to work Blake a bit harder, trusting him to not need to be too coddled by her, as she turned to face her close friend. After that, she smiles and says \u201cSo what are your thoughts about all the magic stuff, Amy\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that, Amy grins and says \u201cOh it\u2019s incredibly interesting! Your Blake knows quite a few neat tricks. I bet he could even figure out how to shrink/grow himself on his own, without help, if he practiced long enough\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire\u2019s eyes widened, still shocked that she never noticed this side of Blake. After that, she says \u201cYou really think he\u2019s that capable? He\u2019s never put much effort into his school work, but I wonder if it was because his time was taken up by practicing magic\u2026\u201d As she ponders this, she squeezes her toes forcefully, flattening the tiny boy along the soft ridges of those toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy nods and says \u201cHe pulled off a few cool spells while trying to get my attention. He can shoot fire and ice, which is pretty impressive by itself, but he can apparently even fly through the air, although he says that he\u2019s still learning how to navigate effectively.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then smiles when she hears this, as she says \u201cThat really is impressive. Maybe I should get him some more reading material\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t even know what to get him though\u2026\u201d While she thinks about that, she begins to wiggle her toes vigorously, rubbing Blake against her somewhat sweaty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then taps her chin a few times before saying \u201cYou could always ask Blake for what he\u2019d need\u2026 I bet I could whip up cool gadgets for him too. I can\u2019t let him completely abandon technology, at least not while I\u2019ve got his back\u2026\u201d She laughs as she says this, while idly spinning her own flats, already missing his presence between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire hears this, she tightly clenches her toes in surprise, overwhelming Blake in an instant as she says \u201cYou\u2019d do that for him\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods and says \u201cAfter all the fun he\u2019s provided for me so far, how can I not? And besides, I apparently get way too rough with him whenever I lose track of him, so I\u2019ll think of them as apology gifts\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nervously frowns while shuffling her feet out of her flats, providing Blake with some fresh air while keeping him lodged between her toes, before saying \u201cI wish you\u2019d keep that stuff to yourself\u2026 You\u2019re lucky he seems to enjoy the whole experience, as well as your company\u2026\u201d Her slight annoyance at her laidback friend was expressed through her toes, as they clamped down on Blake, burying him in the warm and sticky flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods again while giggling, before saying \u201cI\u2019d never do all that to him if he disliked it. If that were the case, then I\u2019d just keep him on my desk or something. I like to push the envelope with him specifically because he likes it when I do so. But Blake really has matured in such a short amount of time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiles and nods, while saying \u201cHe really has\u2026 I remember just last year when you stopped by for a drink, and Blake could barely say three words to you without stammering up a storm\u2026 Now look at him, chatting with you like you\u2019re his buddy\u2026\u201d Her toes proceed to clamp down on Blake hard, as if hugging him with loving care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughs quietly in response as she says \u201cI remember those days\u2026 It was so adorable to see him get so flustered around me, but now he\u2019d totally cool about it, and he even throws out the occasional charming line. I think he could get himself a cute girlfriend if he keeps this up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire proceeds to flex her foot, rotating her ankle slowly and making Blake feel like he was on an intense roller coaster, as she says \u201cI just want Blake to be happy\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, Amy changes the subject and says \u201cHey! Do you wanna get some ice cream real quick? I\u2019m sure Blake would find a frozen treat at his size to be amazing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire taps her chin while endlessly scrunching her toes, dominating that puny mage as she says \u201cIt is hot out today\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I should leave him in my flat in that case\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smirks in response and says \u201cWhy not? That\u2019s half the fun!\u201d But then she laughs and adds, saying \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel like it, I\u2019d gladly swap with you and claim the little toe boy for myself for a little while\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire merely sighs and says \u201cI think you\u2019re getting a bit obsessed\u2026\u201d But then she smiles and whispers, preventing Blake from hearing as she says \u201cI don\u2019t mind doing that, since Blake has his little crush on you after all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggles a bit more and whispers back, saying \u201cI know\u2026 He\u2019s so sweet with me, even when I unintentionally abuse him with my toes, so I\u2019m trying to indulge him as thanks for putting up with me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the girls wonder if they should go out for some cold treats, while also wondering who should get Blake during the ensuing walk. What happens next\u2026?</span></div></div>",

Back when you jogged with him, which I still do not enjoy the idea of, by the way. Do you mind sharing it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smirks and says \u201cDon\u2019t knock it til you try it Claire\u2026 It\u2019d be an easy way for him to exercise more, and you\u2019d even get to bond as mother and son\u2026\u201d Claire stares at Amy with a highly un-amused expression, so Amy laughs and says \u201cIgnore me\u2026 But we can look at my data. We\u2019ll need to head to my personal lab first\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy leads Claire along, as Blake is rhythmically crushed under his mom\u2019s foot, reminding him how it felt to be dominated by her toes, since the last time he was significantly larger than before. But as she treaded over him, he briefly thought that he had it slightly easier than before, since wasn\u2019t wearing her favorite and well-worn black pump at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the reached Amy\u2019s lab, she takes the miniature chip and connects it to her computer, transferring the data quickly. After it was ready, Amy begins to pour over the data, quietly muttering \u201cLevels seem normal for a boy of his age\u2026 adrenaline is high\u2026 high dopamine levels too\u2026\u201d Claire was well aware that Amy got like this when looking over her data, so she simply waits and continues to use Blake as a toe toy, surprised that he did in fact feel good to mess around with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe aggressively squeezes Blake, finding his oddly squishy body to feel good on her skin, hoping that he really did find the whole thing enjoyable. Of course since she was his mother, she hoped that he didn\u2019t find this stimulating in a sexual way, since that\u2019d be a whole different and major issue. She wasn\u2019t the type to shy away from those topics while around Blake, wanting him to be properly educated rather than ignorant about sex. And while Blake did find his mom\u2019s toes to be stimulating, he only viewed them in the same way one might a professional massage, setting a clear mental boundary that Claire would agree with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Amy looks up and says \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve got a good read on the data!\u201d Claire proceeds to listen, as Amy says \u201cFirst of all, his vitals were incredibly normal all throughout the jog. Even when I sped up near the end, nothing really changed there, so that\u2019s very good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire first squints her eyes and says \u201cYou should have just adjusted your run in that case; there was no need to be that hard on him\u2026\u201d But then she sighs and says \u201cMoving on; I think that\u2019s excellent news. Anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods and says \u201cYep! His adrenaline was high, since it probably was super excited to be in my sock while I ran, so no surprise there. And his dopamine, plus a few other chemicals, were high as well, since he considered the experience to be incredibly fun.\u201d She then pauses and adds, saying \u201cIn summary, nothing out of the ordinary! And nothing else was detected, like broken bones or damaged muscles\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire hears this, her eyes widen as she says \u201cThat device could even act as an x-ray\u2026?\u201d As she says this, she drags her legs back and puts her weight onto the balls of her feet, allowing her flats to pop off her heels while furiously scrunching her toes, endlessly dominating the mini mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proudly grins in response and says \u201cI\u2019m the best, right? And only the best is enough for Claire\u2019s super adorable kiddo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire just sighs and says \u201cYou\u2019ll spoil him at this rate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smirks and replies, saying \u201cI\u2019m allowed to, since I\u2019m the cool friend. And besides, I only spoil him because I unintentionally get so rough with the little guy. I get a bit disturbed myself when he tells me about how I treat him if he slips my mind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire hears this, she frowns with worry as she says \u201cThe less I know about it the better. Since I know that he\u2019ll be fine with the invulnerability, I\u2019m less concerned as long as he still enjoys himself. Please remember to give him breaks though\u2026\u201d As she says that, she begins to grind the balls of her feet against the floor, smothering Blake intensely. After that, she crosses her ankles, giving Blake a short break from the pressure before beginning to squeeze her toes yet again, cramming him deeply into the fairly moist flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found it humorous that his mom was lecturing Amy on giving him breaks while she was quite aggressively using him as her stress toy, but he didn\u2019t mind, since it probably was making her feel great. It was also surprising that she was using Blake so thoroughly, completely overwhelming him with her energetic and warm toes, coating him in her sweat in the process. If he learned one thing so far about his mom, it was that no matter how much she cared for him, her toes seemed to act much stricter with their tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy looks back at her data again, before saying \u201cOh yeah, his stamina seems to be abnormally high for someone of his age and build. I\u2019m guessing that it was increased due to the shrinking spell, so Blake should be able to handle a lot more throughout the day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire scratches her chin as she says \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Just don\u2019t let that give you an excuse to push him around too much, okay Amy?\u201d Amy mischievously smirks, as Claire adds, saying \u201cDid Blake sleep well last night?\u201d As she asks this, Claire shakes off her right flat and begins to shift Blake around, using her toes to move him about idly. She had a strong hold on him, and could skillfully manipulate him, until depositing him in the space between her 3rd and 4th toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy begins to nervously laugh in response to that question, as she says \u201cWell, he slept well, but I didn\u2019t exactly make it easy for him\u2026\u201d She then explains that she kept him in her sock between her toes for the night, mainly for warmth, and also explains that she got excessively harsh with him as she slept. Amy then describes how she apparently woke Blake up every few hours, pestering him roughly, before suddenly leaving him alone again. But he seemed to feel perfectly fine in the morning, which she was glad about. After that, she says \u201cThis is just my guess, but I think that Blake doesn\u2019t need as much time to sleep as he normally would. I\u2019d need to collect data on him tonight though, so I can have something to work off of, just to be sure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Claire smirks and says \u201cMaybe you have some pent up aggression, Amy\u2026?\u201d As she says this, she clenches her toes, plastering Blake against her soft flesh, finding him to be enjoyable to toy with regardless of where he was located on her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s eyes widen when she hears this, as she says \u201cThat\u2019s cold, Claire! I\u2019ll have you know that Blake has enjoyed it each and every time I\u2019ve absentmindedly bullied him.\u201d She then smirks and adds, saying \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re treating him any better right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire folds her arms and says \u201cBlake asked me to make use of him, so I am. He wouldn\u2019t want me to baby him.\u201d Blake thought that his mom had a point, since he\u2019d rather her actually de-stress with him rather than worry about him the entire time, since he was gifted with physical invulnerability. He still found it amusing that his mom kept on scolding Amy for her rough treatment of him without ever slowing down herself, but he honestly enjoyed it when they pushed him to his limits. At the very least, it gave him a better idea of how much he could take while under the shrinking spell\u2019s effects, and there was nothing wrong with building up his endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Blake remained between Claire's toes for nearly an hour, while she and Amy happily chatted over drinks. During the course of that, Claire's toes never lost interest in the tiny boy, mashing and squishing him repeatedly against their warm and sticky flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Claire felt ready to leave, the girls began to say their goodbyes, without actually acknowledging Blake. And as his mom stood up and Amy walked him out, he wondered if they both forgot about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to that, Blake casts an ice spell toward the space between Claire's 2nd and 3rd toes, hoping that would jolt her memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, does that work\u2026?</span></div></div>",

As long as you continue to reflect on your actions from the party last night while you're with Amy, I think we can shelve any punishment. Is that fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon receiving that piece of good news, Blake jumps for joy while saying \u201cThat's totally fair with me! I'll keep on reflecting here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after that, Claire says \u201cI've also made a decision about your mage practice\u2026\u201d Blake listens as his mom explains, saying \u201cI'd rather you get to use your spending money on fun things, so I'll provide you with whatever you need for your magic myself. As your mother, I'd like to help you cultivate your natural talents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's eyes widen as he hears this, never expecting this kind of development, so he merely says \u201cThanks so much, mom!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire grins in response and says \u201cYou're most welcome sweety\u2026 Now you keep behaving for Amy, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods, as Claire turns to Amy and says \u201cAnd you should try acting a bit more mature around him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy taps her chin a few times, before smirking and saying \u201cNah... \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire merely shakes her head while saying \u201cWhy did I expect that\u2026?\u201d Then, she turns back to Blake and says \u201cI love you sweety\u2026\u201d She then leans in for a kiss, not even making contact with his body, but the meaning was still clear between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Blake waves and says \u201cI love you too mom! If you're feeling stressed then just come get me again. I like making you feel more relaxed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire quietly giggles and says \u201cYou really have a big heart, just like our namesake. I'll keep your offer in mind, Blake\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Claire exited the house, leaving Blake and Amy alone together again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Amy had Blake for herself again, she smirks and says \u201cLook at you\u2026 Weaseling your way out of getting punished\u2026 I guess getting toyed with by Claire's toes was enough\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shrugs and says \u201cMaybe? I'm just glad I made her feel better, plus it felt like a massage to me, so I didn't mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy starts to giggle as she hears that, as she says \u201cYou're such a good little guy\u2026 Aren't you glad I invited her over\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cYeah, thanks again Amy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Amy hears that, she excitedly grins while saying \u201cYou can thank me by hopping into my flat! Seeing you get roughly handled by Claire's toes made me a bit jealous, so I really wanna bully you\u2026\u201d Blake smiles nervously, feeling both excited and worried, as Amy adds in a commanding tone \u201cAnd I'm getting my turn with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could make a sound, Amy lowers him toward the floor and drops him into her left flat, allowing him to roll toward the toe area. After that, her toes pounced on him, tackling him the same way a large animal would on a hunt, reminding Blake how they felt and smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy forcefully scrunches her toes, smothering Blake as she happily sighs while saying \u201cI can't believe I missed you <i>this</i> much and it's been less than two hours since I last had you under my toes\u2026\u201d She then runs her 2nd toe along his small body, dragging him along the soft insole as she adds, saying \u201cCan you imagine how rough I'll get if I need to wait a whole week between sessions\u2026?\u201d She then energetically yells, shouting \u201cYou'd better master shrinking magic soon, because I want to have you <i>whenever</i> I want and for <i>as long</i> as I want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she deeply exhales and smothering Blake under her big toe, while saying \u201c<i>That's better\u2026</i> I'm a bit calmer now\u2026 I can settle for just the weekends and maybe when you're off from school, occasionally. I can\u2019t hog you all to myself, especially when you\u2019ve still got your life to live...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she suddenly hums to herself loudly, as she says \u201cOh yeah, I almost forgot! I wanna help you with your mage stuff too.\u201d She then pauses, before skillfully moving Blake between her 2nd and 3rd toes, loving how easy it was for her to keep him trapped. Then she adds, saying \u201cI'm actually planning on making a little machine for you so you can practice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one major question, and that was what Amy planned on making. And what she would choose depended entirely on what she thought Blake should focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Amy decide for Blake\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(my overall draft is finished, so expect a chapter every day or so until this whole story is over.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy smiles while saying \"I think that's a great idea, Blake! I'll make sure to work ya to the bone, so get ready\u2026\" As she says this, she squeezes her toes again, smothering him in the meaty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't exactly have many chances to just practice casting spells, so this should be good for him. But he wasn't sure what Amy had planned, though he didn\u2019t have much time to ponder that while she continues to brutalize him with her toes, before standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her full weight was pressed into him, Amy starts to walk back to her lab, ready to create a fancy device to give Blake a good environment to practice in. Once she got there, she immediately started to work, putting all of her focus on her invention, like usual. And as she focused entirely on her work, her toes put all of their attention on Blake, reminding him that Amy was at her most dangerous while she was at her lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the invention was a bit more complicated this time, it takes Amy roughly 40 minutes to completely build her intended device, leaving plenty of time for Blake to be assaulted by her massive toes. And no matter what he did, he was unable to resist those beasts, getting deeply shoved into the tight spaces between them. He only resisted to test his own limits, and his conclusion was that as long as Amy focused on her inventions, it would be impossible for him to out maneuver her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an extremely long session as Amy's toe toy, she finally finishes her project while happily saying \u201cSweet!\u201d Following that, she plucks Blake out from between her toes and places him on her palm, while staring at him with a highly amused expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could react, she suddenly plunges him into a nearby cup of soapy water, thoroughly and roughly scrubbing him down. At one point, she ruthlessly squeezes him between her palms, smothering him in her soapy flesh. After that, she turns on a nearby faucet and plunges him under it, as Blake shrieks from how cold it was. Unfortunately, Amy doesn't hear Blake's cries or feel his struggles, forcing him to experience a highly cold shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished and Blake was clean a well as soaked, she grins and says \u201cFeel better now\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shakes his head and shivers, while saying \u201cNo\u2026 t-that was way t-too cold\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy hears this, her eyes widen as she squeezes him between her palms, while saying \u201cI didn't even notice\u2026 I'm sorry Blake\u2026\u201d Her hands were definitely warm, so this did make him feel better, until she drops him into a small box, while saying \u201cThis thing should warm you up while drying your clothes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Amy turned on the device, he was instantly filled with warmth, as his wet clothes were quickly drying too. In less than a minute Blake was completely dry, making him feel far better, causing her to take him out and place him back on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she smiles and says \u201cI hope you're still full of energy Blake, because your magic training is about to begin\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \u201cI'm ready Amy! I definitely want to practice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeds to giggle when she hears that, as she says \u201cWell don't worry Blake...I'll force you to work as hard as possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Amy shows him the device she built, which looked a bit like a large wall. There was also a treadmill scaled to his size too, which surprised him. As he looks, she explains, saying \u201cI want you to start with a jog to get your blood pumping. We'll do the magic stuff once I say that you've worked up enough of a sweat. Though I thought it'd be boring for you, so I'm getting creative with your stakes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a worrying statement, but Blake continues to listen as he is placed on the treadmill, while she says \u201cYou need to stay on the treadmill at all times, so no sneaking off to the side. And to make sure you don't slack off, there will be a penalty if you stop running\u2026\u201d She then brings her face closer to the back of the treadmill, making him a bit nervous, as her steamy breath washed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she smirks and says \u201cIf you wind up falling off the back of this thing, you'll land directly in my mouth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake hears this, he nervously takes a step back as he says \u201cWait, what?? Why\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy simply nods and says \u201cYep! I've been quite curious of if you'd be a good substitute for gum, so this will be a perfect research opportunity\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Blake really wanted to explore Amy's mouth and be treated like her gum, he still objected, but Amy laughs and says \u201cYou're not getting out of this one\u2026 I wanna see what my favorite bug boy tastes like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that statement, she activates the treadmill, having it start at a slow pace. Blake made sure to keep up with it without tiring himself out too quickly, as Amy places her lips directly behind the machine. That was intimidating enough to keep him moving, but her hot breath worried him even more, as the machine gradually sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Blake continues to run, Amy smiles and says \u201cDoing okay so far, Blake\u2026? If you need a break, my mouth would welcome you\u2026\u201d She was incredibly skilled at distracting him, but Blake presses on, not wanting to look lame in her eyes. He continues on for about 15 more minutes, as he was starting to tire out, since he was never the most physically fit person in the world. And even though the shrinking spell improved his durability, it didn't seem to be helping with his stamina, which Amy quickly notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly smirks and says \u201cYou're doing such a good job\u2026 Don't you think you've earned a little rest...? I'll even go easier on you...\u201d Blake shakes his head and continues, causing her to pout, while saying \u201cYou\u2019ve run enough\u2026 Now it\u2019s time for a bit of cheating\u2026!\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure what she had planned, but then she smirked before blowing on him and launching him toward the front wall of the device. That act stuns him long enough to be brought back toward Amy, who opens her mouth wide to capture her tiny prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake could get up and continue running, he falls off the treadmill and lands in Amy's gaping maw, who happily toys with the tiny boy. She starts by poking him with her massive slimy tongue, thoroughly investigating his body and covering him in her spit. Then, she starts to slide him all around the surface of her tongue, occasionally dropping him between her cheeks too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake was manhandled by that tongue, he reflected on just how humid and warm the inside of Amy's mouth was, finding it to feel amazing. And due to his size, he could clearly smell the food that she ate previously for breakfast, which was odd to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when she suddenly says \u201cYou don't taste half bad Blake\u2026 But let's see how you do as gum\u2026\u201d as her voice reverberated all around him. Less than a second later, Amy chomps down hard on the tiny mage, flattening him under her huge molars. He could feel his body conform to the outline of her tooth, until she suddenly released her grip, causing him to be lifted up into the air. It seems like he was stuck to her upper molar, forcing him to close his eyes as Amy brought that tooth back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was then crushed between those masses of solid calcium, as Amy savored him as her personal stick of gum. This process continued many times over, confirming for Blake that despite his invulnerability, the sheer intimidation that he felt as she thoroughly chewed him couldn't be resisted. Eventually, his body flattened heavily, inspiring Amy to roll him into a ball, contorting his body further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake was rolled around Amy's mouth and covered in saliva, she giggled while saying \u201cThat spell must have completely altered your anatomy! There's no way this could be possible otherwise\u2026\u201d He was honestly impressed too, since this was all so crazy to him, but then she allows him to fall back into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Blake had trouble reforming himself, causing Amy to say \u201cUh oh\u2026 Guess I got too rough with you again, huh? If you gave up when I asked, I might have chewed you a bit softer...\u201d If Blake could move his body properly he'd nod, but she simply forcefully untangled his body, eventually undoing the damage she caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished, she grins and says \u201cFor my report, you are an excellent substitute for gum. Do you think I could blow a bubble out of you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's eyes widen, as he says \u201cThat sounds way too scary to me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy taps her chin while nodding, while saying \u201cYeah, that might be taking things just a bit too far\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she grins and says \u201cReady to start the magic training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and gets ready to continue, before Amy says \u201cWe can stick with this style if you want, or I can add a different activity if you'd like\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he hears that, he asks \u201cWhat did you have in mind, Amy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smirks while answering, saying \u201cWell, I'm not sure yet, but I could have the next activity involve my feet. I'll be sure to make it unique though\u2026 Or I could just toss you back in my mouth or something. I'm feeling creative, so go ahead and shoot your own idea my way if you've got one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Blake makes his decision\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake decides to circle back to feet, causing Amy to smirk and say \"You're predictable, if nothing else, Blake\u2026\" After that, she moves him to the new magic training area, while saying \"I want you to fire off the same spell at the device over there. For this set, focus on shooting spells as fast as you can. And if you do well enough, I'll stick you in my moccasin for 5 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all made sense and sounded awesome, but then Blake asks \"What happens if I fail? Something bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grins and nods, before saying \"Yep, probably the worst thing for you. Nothing!\" Blake doesn't really understand, so she explains further, saying \"Well, I want you to feel rewarded when you succeed, so this will hopefully push you to try until you meet my expectations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all of that, Blake starts, choosing to cast ice spells first. Amy times him, as he gets about 7 out in a minute, causing her to tap her chin and say \"Not bad, but try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods and does so a second time, this time firing 12 ice spells in a minute, causing Amy to smile and say \"<i>That's better!</i> Keep going.\" The next time, he gets 13, having a lower increase than before. After that, she pouts and says \"I was expecting more\u2026 I think I need motivate you some more\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy lifts her foot and plants it in front of him, while slowly wiggling her toes and sweetly saying \"Oh my toes miss their little Blake <i>sooo</i> much\u2026 They want to <i>squeeze</i> him, <i>rub</i> him, <i>bully</i> him, <i>and pamper</i> him. He's their favorite little mage, and they can't wait to reunite with him!\" Then she smirks and pokes him lightly with her 2nd toes while adding, saying \"Will you really make them wait for you, Blake\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat alone inspired Blake strongly, as he casts nearly 20 spells the next time, causing Amy to clap and say \u201cWonderful, Blake! And because you did such an awesome job, I'm giving you 15 minutes in my moccasin. Hard work pays off in my house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake grins in response, before sighing and saying \"That was tough! Thanks Amy\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Amy picks him up and drops him into her fluffy and well-worn moccasin, looking forward to giving him his reward\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy begins by tilting her moccasin, causing Blake to roll down toward the toe area, as she giggles and says \"I hope you can excuse just how dirty it is in there. I never wear socks with my moccasins, but I know that you'll have no complaints\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could have realistically heard him, he would have agreed with Amy. Soon, he crashed into the toe area just as she drops the moccasin to shuffle her foot in, looking forward to having another session with her favorite boy toy. Blake gets up and wipes his eyes, only to see her titanic foot charging forward, threatening to crash into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another instant, Amy's 3rd toe pushes into him, skillfully shoving him under it against the sweat soaked fluff of the moccasin. And now that she had him tightly in her grasp, she laughs to herself and says \"I'll never get tired of how great you feel as a stress toy. You have my word that I'll attempt to thoroughly break you under my foot, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy loved to push things extra far, but that sounded crazy, as she giggles and says \"Which do you think is stronger? My toes or your magical durability\u2026? <i>Let's find out together, Blake!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like things were about to get really intense, as Amy plops down on a nearby couch and begins to read, aggressively scrunching her toes at the same time. While you were being crammed deeper between them, Amy happily sighs and says \"You <i>really</i> hit the spot, Blake\u2026 By the time I'm finished with you, you'll be motivated for <i>all</i> of our future magic training sessions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wasn't sure what Amy meant by 'future sessions' but this was incredible to him all the same. And she was not lying at all with this, as her toes vigorously used his body as their private plaything, keeping him in a state of bliss. While her toes worked their magic on Blake, Amy enjoyed some light reading, enjoying that she could mess with his body as she focused on more important things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, Amy moves him under her pinky toe, as she says \"Even my littlest of toes want a piece of you, Blake\u2026 You're <i>highly</i> popular as far as my feet are concerned.\" As she continued to affectionately dominate him, he noticed that her toes were sweating like crazy, coating him in the sticky liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy seems to notice this too, as she giggles and says \"Unfortunately, my feet sweat more than I would like while I wear these moccasins. Would you be so kind and do something about it Blake? I'll bet your tongue will be effective\u2026\" As soon as she asks this, she clamps her toe down on him, squeezes him like a grape. That alone told him that this was not something he could refuse, so he quickly gets to work, licking the bottom of her pinky toe as much as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs in response, as she says \"That feels amazing, Blake! Your new job is to lick my toes until I say you can stop. I'll even extend your reward time to 30 minutes, because I like you that much!\" Blake had no issues with this, and getting twice as much time in her moccasin was even better, so he proceeds to lick each and every wrinkle and crack along her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after 30 minutes, an alarm goes off, prompting Amy to remove Blake from his own personal heaven and onto her palm. As he catches his breath, she warmly smiles and says \"How was your reward? Feeling inspired to get back to practicing? Just to put it out there, you did an awesome job pampering my toes. So expect regular assignments with them from now on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods a few times while brushing himself off, while saying \"Yes! I'll keep on improving my spellcasting Amy\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responds with a thumbs up as she says \"Perfect!\" But then she wistfully sighs and says \"You know Blake, it made me so incredibly happy when I found you and you told me everything. The fact that you trusted me enough to climb me during the party warms my heart. Thank you Blake\u2026\" He blushes as she adds, saying \"You're a sweet cutie, and I have no doubts that you'll get yourself a nice girlfriend. I appreciate you putting up with my silliness and unintentional roughness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing all of that, Blake smiles and says \"Thanks Amy! And you're super cool, so I'm really glad I got to actually talk to you for a change\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeds to giggle, before saying \"You did really impress me with that change. I can't even believe that the last time I saw you, you could barely look me in the eye\u2026\" But then she bites her lower lip and mumbles, saying \"Now I'm imagining how fun it would've been to have you at this size back when you were so meek and timid around me, even though that was only a few weeks ago\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like something might have awakened in Amy, but she shakes it away before saying \"Well, enough sappy stuff\u2026 Time for more training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so this was how the rest of the afternoon went for Blake, with magic practice sessions followed by longer and longer stints between Amy's toes, as just could not resist having him at her mercy. A little while later, evening comes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Final chapter of route next)</b></span></div></div>",

She decided to wear a loose T-shirt and really short shorts, before placing Blake on the bed with her. Then, she places him on her stomach, before gently patting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after getting him seated, she sighs and says \"I have the next two weeks off. You are welcome to stay with me if you don't have other plans, Blake. <i>I'll keep you entertained\u2026</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods and says \"Really?? I've been really bored this month, because all my friends are away, so thanks a ton Amy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then picks him up while giggling and saying \"Oh you're so cute when you're excited, Blake\u2026\" She then proceeds to lightly kiss Blake's tiny body, peppering him with very brief but still nice smooches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Blake wipes himself off, causing her to kiss him again while saying \"You'd better stop struggling Blake\u2026 Unless you want to know what I'm like when I get <i>super</i> excited\u2026 I can still pull all nighters, so I can <i>promise</i> that you wouldn't sleep a <i>wink</i> until I'd gotten my fill.\" That was simultaneously scary and alluring, but he chooses to listen to her, as she gradually slows down with the kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that finished, Amy smiles and says \"We'll spend a wonderful two weeks together. I'll even help build your confidence up, so you'll be able to actually ask out your little crush\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was kind of Amy, so he thanks her, causing her to grin and say \"I've gotta pay you back somehow for constantly making you spend time with my overly aggressive toes, not to mention the few times I lost track of you and proceeded to put you through a personal hell. And we both know I'll forget about you plenty more times to come. <i>Maybe I'll make a tracker for you\u2026?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was now rambling, so Blake waits as her fingers start to absentmindedly explore him, pressing him against her warm belly in the process. Due to the lights being out right now, Amy couldn't even see him, so she incorrectly assumed that he was totally fine. While her fingers continued to feel him up, she says \"I wonder if I could make something that'd make me forget about you for a day? Or even make me think that you were an actual bug\u2026? Or even some weird perverted stranger who just shrank to peep on me?? I would do anything to make that happen, if only so I could learn from you how I acted and treated you. It would be such an intriguing opportunity\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, her pinky had slipped under Blake's shirt, threatening to tear it off while she was still lost in thought. And before he could shout to her, she idly covers his mouth, forcing him to just endure Amy's forgetful mind. As he was toyed with by her slender fingers, she says \"I'd need to add some safety features, so you'd never be put in truly serious danger. Or maybe I could test you further by keeping you in my sock all day long\u2026? That'd be interesting\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Blake was hooked against her pinky finger without a way to free himself, as she lazily brings her hand under her shirt while mumbling \"<i>Itchy\u2026</i>\" Following that quiet statement, she starts to scratch at her left breast, grinding Blake against the soft mound of flesh. As she does this, she says \"I still want to sneak you into Claire's shoes. Maybe I'll convince her to go to the gym with me, and I'll hide you in her sneaker or sock before we leave. I wonder how long it would take for her to notice\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, Amy failed to notice that she was still grinding Blake against her boob, but then she moves her hand and dusts it off without looking, as she mumbles \"<i>That felt nice\u2026</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake stood up, he noticed that he was standing right in front of Amy's waistband, inspiring him to try to return to where he started. Before he could get far, she brings her finger back toward him, while saying \"I need to adjust something, so don't you be a <i>naughty boy</i> and look\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't react fast enough, as he was pushed into her shorts and proceeded to get ground into her thigh as she messed with her pants. Then, her finger slid back, accidentally causing him to get snagged against her absolutely massive vagina. When she feels that, she quietly gasps to herself while bringing her legs together, smothering him and sending him just a tiny bit deeper inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Blake tries to struggle, but when that only makes her squirm more, which in turn sends him deeper. So he instead keeps still, preventing his escape but also from sinking deeper into the cavern of her vagina. Amy proceeds to speak, still thinking that he was sitting on her stomach in front of her, unaware of his true location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she says \"I really like the idea of making myself temporarily forget about you for the day. And if you get my attention by the end of the day, you'd win a prize! I could even put a camera on you so I could see things from your perspective after the fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she says that, she sneakily scratches at her crotch, shoving Blake even deeper into her now moist vagina. But after that, she says \"The whole making me think you're a random pervert idea sounds super cool too. <i>How meanly do you think I'd treat you\u2026?</i> I'm normally really nice, but maybe I'd become some demon if I thought you were a devious stranger and pervert. <i>Wouldn't that be fun to test out?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses for a moment before scratching her chin and saying \"You've been pretty quiet Blake\u2026 Did you fall asleep?\" Amy then motions for the lights to turn back on, finally realizing that he was missing. With that revelation, she mutters \"Oh boy\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she looks around, unintentionally squirming and mashing Blake against her vaginal walls. Eventually, she notices the oddly pleasant sensation in her shorts, causing her to smirk and say \"Speaking of all that, you\u2019re a bit of a <i>pervy</i> little boy, Blake\u2026 Maybe I really should treat you like a <i>sneaky creep</i> after all\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, she pulls Blake out of her vagina, noticing that his clothes were torn and his body was coated in her juices. Due to that, she quickly washes him off, scrubbing him hard and aggressively. Once he was clean, she sets him on her palm in the nude, as she frowns and says \"You crossed <i>one</i> too many boundaries tonight. Do I need to instruct you on the word 'consent' Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake proceeds to fold his arms and say \"I had nothing to do with this. It was your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeds to raise an eyebrow and say \"<i>Really now\u2026?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was clear that she was skeptical, Blake explained everything, causing Amy's eyes to widen with shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished, she just sighs and says \"And after all that moral grandstanding. <i>Sorry Blake\u2026</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she takes a deep breath and says \"Why don't we go to bed\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods, so Amy pulls out a book and separates her toes, before shoving him between them while saying \"My toes will ensure that you sleep well, Blake. If you have a bad dream, feel free to hug them. They'll <i>surely</i> love you right back, in their <i>uniquely savage</i> way\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reads her book, content with Blake lodged between her toes, until they both fall asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And thus ended their first full day together, which would surely be followed by many more over the next two weeks. Amy somehow came up with inventions that turned her fantastical scenarios into a reality, and Blake had a crazy time during each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also spent plenty of time having him practice his mage craft, wanting him to become a powerful little mage one day. Blake also was given plenty of pointers on how to talk to the classmates he had crushes on, since he always struggled with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those two weeks, Blake returns to his normal size without much trouble, leaving him with plenty of great memories. Unfortunately, Amy kept on pestering him to go to the spirits so they would shrink him again, turning this into a somewhat regular experience. Thankfully, she only made him spend time with her every few weeks or so, and she always had him put his school life ahead. But whenever he spent those shrunken days with Amy, she always pushed him to his limits, giving him very little time to himself during those \u2018vacations\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, shrinking and sneaking off to Claire's office party ended up working out great for him, since he was able to foster a great friendship with Amy. And besides all the fun times she had with him, she proved to be an even better life resource once his shrinking wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this experience behind him, Blake finds new confidence, ready to one day to confess his feelings for Aria (or Vixen depending on how he felt and who was writing for him)...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>This is the end of this whole story, but maybe you want to explore one of the scenarios that Amy crafted during their time together. Those can be started in the next chapter. I may or may not add to those, so don't feel shy if you'd like to try your hand at it!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>What do you want to see occur during the rest of Blake's two weeks while shrunken with Amy?</b></i></u><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy's body towered over Blake as she positioned herself between the tiny mage and his mother. She held up a finger to her lips, shushing the boy. He was confused, until he saw Amy's hand descend from the sky and gently enclose him in her closed hand. Her skin was warm, as her fingers held him against her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clair, I invented a new bra at work that's suuuper comfy. Do you want to try it on?\" Amy asked, her voice muffled by the wall of skin surrounding Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I always have trouble finding one that fits,\" Claire said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had a bad feeling about this as he felt Amy carry him upstairs. When her palm opened, he saw a bra lying on Amy's bed. While it looked normal on the outside, when Amy placed him next to one of the cups, Blake saw it had a rather unique modification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a\u2026\" Blake said, not sure he really wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! It's a tiny seat belt, for a tiny passenger. We'll send you back home, in style,\" Amy said happily. Rolling his eyes, Blake climbed into the bra cup, and buckled himself in with the Velcro strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm ready!\" Blake said, his voice echoing off the inside of the bra. He felt himself rise into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is!\" Amy said, showing the outside of the bra to Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks nice! Can I try it on now? Wait, my little son isn't going to perv in me, will he?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, he said he was tired and wanted to sleep in my room. You'll have him back tomorrow,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake heard the sound of his mother taking her shirt and bra off, then was lifted into the air again. He watched as his mother's boob approached in slow motion until it filled up the cup. Claire's nipple pushed up against Blake's body. Soon, the cup was filled with the heat and smell of Claire's body. Blake reached out, taking his mother's nipple in his hands. He rubbed the bumpy surface, watching as the nipple hardened in response to his touch. He summoned a cooling breeze, which swirled around the breast, carrying away the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this bra have cooling gel in the cups? It feels great!\" Claire said, her voice suddenly much louder. \"It feels like nipples are being gently held. They haven't felt this good since before I started breastfeeding Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's a little secret. Anyway, why don't you borrow it for a day? Let me know how it feels tomorrow at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Blake was gently bounced around along with Claire's boobs as she went about her day. He continued to cool and caress her nipple, even kissing it at times to give it some extra affection. When the pressure was finally released, Blake found himself\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

After all, that's kinda how I wound up here in the first place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was quick to waste no time to scoop up Blake, excitedly taking his slight confidence as full reason to speed ahead with the idea. \"Then its a yes!\" She beams down at the half-inch boy in her hands. \"I'll call, but ask Claire to come tomorrow--Before that, we need to head to the lab! I'm probably about to pull an all-nighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake grimaces and sits with his arms held out in Amy's palm in a vain attempt to steady himself against Amy's excited jitters. \"Uh, why take so long? Can't you just call my mom and have her come over now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shook her head. \"We're doing this without telling Claire, right? I need to get a tracker on you, or else Claire might lose you without you knowing...\" Her other hand lifted to lightly tap against her cheek the smile growing more mischievous,. \"And maybe, just maybe, add some other features too.\" Amy suddenly forces a serious expression, barely hiding her emotions to Blake. \"Entirely intended to keep you safe. Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blinks up at Amy, largely unamused and mildly concerned with her intent. Still he gives in, getting the feeling he hasn't much choice at this point. \"Well, I suppose you're right. You've probably got got knows what kind of data you want to get from this whole experience too so; do your worst?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you asked...\" Amy trailed off, letting out a dark chuckle and succeeding in making Blake yet more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of said \"all-nighter\", Blake awoke with a stir on a table in Amy's lab, with Amy looking directly over him with a gleeful smile. \"Well, the tracker is in! Do you feel alright? No pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake groggily tried to sit up and examine himself. Amy had managed to put him to sleep for... <i>Whatever she did</i>, but upon a thorough examination he couldn't find any signs of cuts, scars, or any other means by which she could have put a tracker in him. Weird. \"I feel alright, surprisingly.\" Blake reported to Amy. \"Not sure how but I'm not hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squint, Amy bent down to get a better look with her own eyes at Blake. \"Well, judging by how you don't seem to be wincing, I'll take that as confirmation that you aren't lying.\" She grinned down to him. \"Now, we've only got an hour before Claire comes over. You ready to get into position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her looming face, yet again put at unease, Blake questioned. \"You're really taking this seriously? Did you cook up some crazy plan to make this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked away momentarily, dusting off her lab coat. \"I did indeed--but the plan will work out better if I don't tell you what it is.\" She chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shook his head, now uncertain but still committed. \"Let's do this, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Blake had been placed on a table in the foyer of Amy's house. Amy was quick to instruct him to hide behind a large candle in a glass jar and wait until she had come back to place him in Claire's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire soon knocked on the door, and Amy came to answer it promptly. \"Hello, Claire! How's your day going so far?\" Amy had managed a normal enough smile to hide her intent from Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stepped in, and Blake momentarily saw that she was wearing a dark-green blouse, denim capri pants, and the same heels he had hidden in to get to the party. \"I'm good, but I'm still worried about Blake! Speaking of which, where is he?\" She questioned, looking around. Blake managed to retreat back behind the candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gave a sigh. \"Well, I'm afraid he stayed up longer than he wanted to last night, so he's grabbing some more shut eye, but I suspect he might not wake up until the evening at best.\" Before Claire could respond, Amy motioned toward the blonde's feet and changed the subject. \"I'd hate to ask you this, but could you please leave your shoes at the door? I just had new flooring put in and I'm trying to keep in clean before we put a coat of wax on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stammers, somewhat taken by surprise with the sudden change in tone. \"Well, of course, but I think I'll have to talk with Blake about staying awake so late.\" She gently slides her feet out of her heels before the two women walked into the living room to have a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slowly walked out from behind the candle, looking over the table and down at Claire's black heels, seeing the silver insole on the inside. A part of him was a little excited to do this--even though it was his mother's shoes and feet. Was Amy having this effect on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, okay, I know I promised Blake that I'd keep this a secret, but you are his mother, I have to tell you.\" Amy interjected in the middle of their conversation about her escapades with Blake. \"I know he said that he shrunk himself to try and hitch a ride to the party; but we both know how little sense that makes. Do you know what it really is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ladies were sitting on opposite sides of the couch in Amy's living room, and just where Blake couldn't make out the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, already concerned with what Amy had been doing with her son only raised an eyebrow out of concern. \"I have no idea, what would the actual reason be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled, but nearly cracked a smirk, the only sign that she was about to lie-- \"He wanted to be in your shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shook her head, sitting up and curling her legs inward onto the couch. \"I'm sorry, but, he <i>wanted</i> to be in my shoe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded with a chuckle. \"I know, right? This whole time he's been enjoying being under my foot, but he's always been saying 'I kinda want to do this with mom too' with almost everything. He even said he wanted to shrink even smaller so he could be in those heels you wear to work all the time without you knowing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked to the side, somewhat confused but starting to process what Amy had been saying, even if it was incorrect. \"Now that you mention it, I did once notice Blake looking at my shoes...\" She trailed off in thought, con. \"But I assumed that was just a matter of coincidence. You're saying that he had possibly been planning this because he has a thing for feet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde lightly sighed. \"Perhaps I'll make that part of his punishment. I'll leave him in my shoe for a day to try and figure out if that was what he was really after.\" Claire took a moment to stretch, letting her feet contact with the floor again. \"Well, this has been an enlightening conversation, Amy, but I'm afraid I have errands I have to run before noon. If you don't mind, where is your bathroom? I need to go before I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled again, knowing her chance had come. She pointed behind her. \"Second door on the left down that hallway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could hear the bathroom door closing, followed by the footsteps of Amy headed over to where he had been hiding. Seeing her approach, Blake emerged from his hiding spot prompting Amy to quickly and unceremoniously grab him gently between two fingers and drop him into Claire's left heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seems to be going well!\" Blake looked around in his instep of his mother's work shoe. \"What did you and my mom talk about anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smirked. \"Oh, nothing too important...\" Amy's hand went inside one of her lab coat's pockets, pressing some sort of button before another flash of light engulfed Blake, sending him into a minor panic before the light dissipated. He had to be another 1/10 of his former size now, maybe even less. At his best guess, he was either a millimeter or 1/25th of an inch tall, not that the difference between the two would matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake freaked out wondering if this had been Amy's doing, before her voice boomed down to answer the question he was probably too small to ask now. \"I'm sorry, Blake, but I think you'll understand in time.\" She moved to stand up. \"As much as I am enjoying this, the truth is if I'm to commercialize anything from this, I first need to know how long someone can last underfoot in good health.\" The smirk grew into a more devious grin. \"Now, don't worry, that tracker will monitor your vitals and I'll come get you from Claire the moment something goes completely South but, for now, you won't mind spending a month or two living off the sweat and dirt in Claire's shoe, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was utterly devastated at Amy going to these lengths. Sure she had some crazy things planned but going to this level? He was too dumbfounded to try and respond as Amy stood back up and waited by the door for Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in time too, as the bathroom door had opened and Claire's footsteps were quickly approaching the foyer...</span></div></div>",

The teenage mage Blake Heart was hanging out at the local bowling alley with his male friends, Rainer Storm (an African-American who wore blue and was a fan of pirates) and Kendal Flicker (a Japanese fellow in red who favored ninjas).

Why don\u2019t you conjure up a little spell to make us tiny?

A purple glow surrounded the boys, and in a bright flash, they were no longer outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otherworldly luminescence brought the trio into what appeared to be a living room. No other people were in the room, but the furniture looked much taller than it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking spell...it actually worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the looks of it...\u201d Rainer deduced out loud, \u201c...it seems we\u2019re now in...\u201d</span></div></div>",

In a rather large and fancy residence, the goth-like girl, Violet Andross, had discovered a new book of spells in her family's library. She decided to invite her friend, Blake Heart, as well as his sister Jade, over to her house to show them the mysterious tome (Blake and Jade didn't tell their mother about the magic part, of course). After a decent walk, the two siblings arrived at the front door of Violet's house, greeted by the normally-shy goth girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Violet!\" Jade smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Violet,\" Blake followed up, \"so where's that spellbook you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in the library, still...\" Violet stated, leading her friends into the fairly large and sophisticated room of bookshelves, telescopes, and...more bookshelves. On a small wooden table rested the strange new book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what kind of spells are in here?\" Blake asked, eager to know what he was in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Violet blushed, \"...I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low growl suddenly interrupted the conversation. Letting out an embarrassed sigh, Jade put a hand to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Jade apologized. \"Got any snacks around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Violet grinned. \"They're in the kitchen, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth girl trotted toward the kitchen, leaving the Heart siblings alone with the eerie spellbook. Not a smart choice, admittedly. Jade, brimming with curiosity, opened the book and flipped through pages, not seeming to care for the paper's condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, be careful with that!\" Blake ordered, grabbing onto the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm just having fun over here!\" Jade responded, not about to let her party-pooper of a brother ruin her enjoyment. As the two tugged at the tome, it suddenly began to glow an ominous purple, before emitting a bright flash that knocked them out cold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously, they regained their senses rather quickly. Blake looked around the room, noticing something wasn't quite right. Jade's eyes widened as she and her brother saw the bookshelves tower over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat book had shrunken the siblings to half an inch in size!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it, Jade!!\" Blake scolded his sister. \"You need to be careful! Magic is unpredictable, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bro...\" Jade frowned. \"But we need to find Violet and get her help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that...</span></div></div>",

When they arrive, Blake and Jade spotted Violet at the counter, fixing a couple of sandwiches for her guests, still unaware that they are in the kitchen, shrunken. As Violet was about to finish the snack preparations, her cell phone begins to ring in a calm musical tone, though it's deafening to the Heart siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...? Oh hey...yeah, Blake and his sister Jade are over here....Yeah, you can come over if you like...\" Violet talks to the caller. While being preoccupied, Blake and Jade are getting closer to her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least she's not moving, but what do we do now? Climbing her would take us forever!\" Jade asked her older brother while heading towards Violet's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do this, of course!\" Blake said before grabbing his sister's hand. \"Wind!

We should reach up to her face in no time!\" Blake grins, very confident of his magic while Jade frighteningly clings on his arm, hoping not to fall at the increasing height as they go up higher and higher.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flew past her towering skirt, passing through the frills of it, reaching to her bare stomach level, hearing her stomach rumbles in hunger, and finally reach to her chest which made Blake blushes like crazy from the sight of her now mountain size breasts...did they make it to her face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her skirt didn't have any pockets though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so this is the safest place I can keep you guys.\" Violet blushed as she lowered them to her chest.

W-wait a second!!\" Blake tired to shout as he and Jade slid off Violet's palm onto a hill of bare skin.

They were now pinned against an enormous mound of pale flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet peered down at the shrunken siblings as she picked up her half-eaten sandwhich. \"Like I said, you guys should be safe in there.\" She said through a mouthful. \"I thought it'd be better than my cleavage.

The building-sized sandwhich soared past their line of vision repeatedly, considerably smaller each time. Eventually it vanished entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet stifled a giggle as she put her plate in the sink. Their tiny bodies tickled against her skin. \"Try not to squirm around too much.\" She said, sheepish cupping a hand over them. <i>This is probably even more awkward for them than it is for me.</i></span></div></div>",

This is covert. I still have to get used to keeping secrets... It's frightening\" Even when murmuring, her voice has a melodious presence and energy. Like a camera lens in ancient ruins, the young woman's eyes flashed around to take in the sights, blinking quickly. Until meeting Blake, she'd never have thought to walk around here. Everything was so overwhelming, but still cozy and quaint... They neared a bookshop. \"But we <i>are</i> right around the spot? Just feet away from a portal to the underground world of magic... Metaphorically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I think. I saw books hidden on this store's shelves by M. Alabaster and R. Carmine - they were part of the same mage circle as the one who wrote my own spellbook. And up there - \" He pointed covertly to a spot hidden by shadows in the wall, an etching of an eye with complex lines coming from that could easily be mistaken for cracks \" - is a protection symbol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria squinted up, tracing out the pathways on the aging stone midair. \"That's so observant.\" She turned her gaze to the door, standing quietly. Her shoulder leaned gently on his. He realized the young woman beside him was trusting him to lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral times over the past week, the teenage mage had to take a deep breath, leave his inhibitions aside, and go forward. He did this again, entering the shop - unaware that the stone eye wasn't the only one watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne whole week. Almost impossible to believe. Even after a week, the warm touch of Aria's lips over his then half-inch body still stuck with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a journey, for sure, ever since he made that bargain with the mischievous specters who gave him amazing strength in exchange for his size. A quest full of self-discovery and introspection, where he found feelings inside himself that he never knew about. And he grew closer to some friends, too, learning about the secret things they kept inside of them. (For example: digestive acids.) The greatest of his challenges - more taxing than any physical labor to lift away stomps, more horrifying than scaling mountain-sized body parts - was finally admitting his feelings for Aria. Aria, the sweet girl who was already magnificent and unreachable at normal size... Even in her hands, she looked more distant than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he survived. Finally, he revealed himself. And under her loving, accepting gaze, it took no time at all for the spell to wear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week since all that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscles quivering, he pushed back the door's wooden handle, as if it would explode in his hand. Size changing and strength changing, even in small doses, tended to throw one's sense of perspective and awareness of strength off completely. He practically stumbled into the dusty room, pulling Aria with him. There was a different shopkeeper than yesterday. A grey-haired woman looked from the counter, scanning the new entries before returning to her book. \"Nice to see youngsters here. Not many who really know the power of reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria held him tighter. With her other hand, she brushed over a box of old comics, glancing over the dot-colored covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer newly-minted boyfriend awkwardly slipped out \"Yeah\", half-coughing on the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if you need help with anything.\" Her voice was still crisp and fresh, betraying the wrinkles that crossed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just browsing.\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything by an M. Alabaster?\" Aria said at the exact same time, drowning him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a long stare, and checked through a paper catalog, glancing up in suspicion from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake awkwardly looked back to the shelves, ready to dart away, or even shrink away. <i>Whelp, there it goes. Another person learning my secret life. No - our secret lives, now.</i> Glancing over the same box Aria did, he noticed a cover for \"Batman 241\". <i>How did you ever keep that hidden identity thing going, Bruce?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman's voice rang out: \"He can do it because he's rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young mage twisted his head in surprise. She was still looking down, checking the list of books through fogged glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you two here, really?\" She said this all without moving her mouth. Telepathy - so she was a mage, too. An experienced one, at that. The elder went on: \"A curious young spellcaster, I can understand. Bringing a normal girl with you? Very dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of the answer. \"She's not a normal girl. She's the nicest person ever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to have some closure after the adventure. But nicer, still, was knowing that it was the start of something else - not just a return to normality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, the two teenagers had forged a bond. They were officially a couple. Both had so much more to learn from each other, about each other, challenges to face together... It was exciting. He could walk the halls with a smile, for the first time in ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his body used to changing sizes, some good will from the spirits, and Aria's support, Blake managed to perform a spell he could never get the hang of before: shrinking. In an instant, he could regain his half-inch stature. It was a taxing action, for sure; he'd have to wait 30 minutes each time before conjuring the energy to reverse it. But he got the hang quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe graceful young woman, herself, showed a slight interest in the spell-weaving arts. Gazing over his books, picking up a few phrases here and there. She knew that it would take lots of practice to reach her boyfriend's level. But it was nice, at least, to finally see what he was doing. The whole thing intrigued her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both knew that there would be excitement in the future. But they couldn't have predicted its form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMid-thought, the door swung open. Two figures entered quietly. First was a short, formally-dressed woman with reddish hair and gloves. She paced directly to the middle of the room. A man with a similar uniform and flowing blonde hair followed behind, his broad shoulders hitting the doorframe. He waved. Blake awkwardly nodded back; Aria smiled; the old woman looked up, and started slowly walking away from the desk, still holding the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out,\" she said telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought: \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman's voice cut him off: \"You can still save yourself from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly grabbed Aria. She seemed to understand, too - a look of anxiety crossed her face. The smiling man stood in the way, taking up the whole frame. In his arms was an old piece of stone, bearing an eye... The same one that was on the outside wall before, now split in half. \"Vermillion couldn't have found this without you! <i>Merci beaucoup!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenagers both gulped, looking at each other. Then, Aria's nose twitched. She turned back, and gulped, moving the boy's head to match hers. That small woman - Vermillion - had a cigarette lighter in one hand, and an oil can in the other. Before the store owner could react, she lit the bookshelves, her face beaming in the flames. \"Keep blocking the door, Chartreuse. As of two seconds ago, these three are suspected arsonists. We'll do the community a service and take them in for questioning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the side, the old woman briefly chanted - and a thunderbolt emerged from her palm, directed right at Vermillion. Blake did the same. She held up a hand, letting it collapse against the rubber glove - then grabbing the elder sorceress by the wrist. They'd researched the old woman's powers before, Blake realized. One bolt bounced off her coated palm, hitting Aria directly in the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Blake called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell right into Chartreuse's arms, eyes looking blank. He fumbled for a moment, before grabbing her by the arms. \"This feels good! Keeping dangerous magic out of the wrong hands, holding back kids who could destroy history with unholy influences... I'm glad I joined the Group for Total Security!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held the woman by the arms, and took out what looked like a tazer. \"You sound like a salesman. <i>Join GTS, save the world, retake humanity's destiny from ghouls and demons</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"QUAKE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic, Blake cast the spell. The ground shook, setting both of the agents off their footing. The man got up quickly, and charged for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on automatic, the boy chanted - and shrunk to a minuscule scale. Set off-guard by the sudden change, Chartreuse tripped towards the burning flames. He screamed from the searing pain, rushing out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermillion swore, and tossed the panting older woman aside. She scanned the ground, immediately locating the fleeing Blake. Her leg lifted to the sky, glowing with the embers of ancient knowledge destroyed. Her heel was just too big. The inch-high boy couldn't dodge as she stomped down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a gust of wind hit her, sending her body into the fire. The mage-hunter screamed, following her partner out. \"You'll regret this! GTS will overcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood shocked, looking up. In an instant, huge jets of foamy water spurted out from above, cooling the fires out. He looked, and they came from the hand of - who else, but his wonderful girlfriend, Aria? Underneath a golden shoe, she smothered out the last few bits of fire.</span></div></div>",

She quickly stroked his body, checking for any damage. \"Are you alright? Did they hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trembled, still frozen from surprise. Her hand felt cool and soothing. \"No, I'm fine. But... what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her palms, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl has elemental powers now.\" The older woman spoke telepathically - and this time, Aria could hear, too. \"From our magic crossing. I didn't mean for any of this... Now, she's a target for GTS, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked up, confused. \"GTS?\" He felt a bit of Aria's soft skin cross his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder looked down solemnly. \"The Group for Total Security. Founded by old witch-hunter clans coming together, they want to make the world safe for normal humans - by 'subduing' everyone using magic.\" Her head shook. \"Those books are gone, no helping that. But they're after <i>people</i>, too. Some members are just scared, or confused. But some are looking for anything to kill and subdue... Or even to take the secrets for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria stepped forward quickly, shaking Blake. \"But we can stop, them, right? I mean - I have the powers, now! I don't have the experience you do, but with my boyfriend's help...\" She looked to him, a little worried. \"You'll... help, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated. So many times before, he'd barely fled danger, was left with lives flashing before his eyes. Just moments ago, he was sure he'd be smothered to death. Would he put himself back into that, and leave the safety of his normal life that past week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that terror was the same experience that the old woman had - that other mages would have - it wasn't a question. He'd made the decision long ago, when he picked up his spellbook. Blake smiled. \"Of course! I'll do anything I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old women nodded solemnly. She slid her hand across a tile, revealing a set of old masks. One of them gold, glimmering in the light. The other sleek vantablack, hidden in the shadows. When she spoke again, she was speaking normally, not telepathically. \"I can't stop you if you want to. But please, you'll need to hide your identities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria nearly jumped, then remembered her passenger. \"Like superheroes! My secret name will be... Hm. Wonder Thunder? Mahou Kamen? Golden Symphony?\" She glanced over the charred books, identifying one about crafts - with glitter on the cover. \"Ah! Glimmer Gal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought for a second. \"If we're going for alliteration, I guess I'll be Mini Mage. It rolls of the tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder clasped her hands together. \"Good. Now use those powers wisely. And if you find any young mages led astray, or under threat - look for another store like this one. I know where they can find shelter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the teenagers nodded, and simultaneously thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Now get out, whippersnappers. They'll find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria went to the door, then stopped. She picked up a book on costume-making. \"First, may I purchase this? We have books on the ancient art of magic already, but that won't help with the ancient art of fashion design...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vermillion, it huuuurts. It hurts really bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burn scars - OW - will heal. It's no obstacle for - URGH - GTS! We shall overcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two agents sat in an alley, patching each other up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you think Boss Sylvia will give us new uniforms? These ones are all scorched. Urrrgh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, these uniforms don't make us who we are. We're just concerned citizens. OH! JEEZ-\" She smiled fiercely, applying a bandage to him. \"We'll do the next job undercover. Street clothes. Nobody will recognize us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned back. \"Yeah! -Ow! <i>Merde...</i> Nobody will recognize you with your hair, either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman put a hand to her neck - only to find emptiness. The fire had seared a healthy chunk of her long, red hair out. Her smile only grew wider. Her hands fell loose, dropping the medical tools. She started chuckling, despite herself. \"Crushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Vermillion?\" The blonde man scooted back - his hair now longer than his partner's. His bulky back hit a wall, sending a piercing pain through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crushed. Yes. They'll pay for this. The entire mage world, like insects gnawing away at rotting wood... Down to the last birthday party magician... Will be extinguished, only a footnote in history... But those two, in particular, will be given special treatment...\" She kept laughing, now reeling over in a mix of burning pain and inexplicable mirth. \"THEY'LL PAY FOR MY HAIR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, patting her head - and letting another spike of agony pierce her. \"That's the spirit!... I... think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busy street onlookers gave a quick, confused glances to the two.</span></div></div>",

Equiping their newly-received masks, Blake and Aria -- no, Mini Mage and Glimmer Gal -- rushed onto the scene. As it turned out, New Opal Bank was being subjected to a holdup -- the second one this week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands where I can see 'em!\" The redheaded criminal in black yelled, armed with a machine gun and pointing it towards cowering civilians and tellers. He slowly approached one of the tellers, pointing his weapon at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme all your cash, lady!\" The robber demanded. \"ALL OF IT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly afraid that saying a word would get her killed, the teller quietly and carefully made her way to the bank's vault, inputting the security code and opening the safe, before fearfully moving out of the robber's way as he stomped into the vault full of moolah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the bank, Mini Mage concentrated his mind, and chanted a spell: \"Shrink!\" In an instant, the boy was once again half an inch in size and standing atop Glimmer Gal's palm. It was a good thing his clothes shrunk with him! ...strange, but still handy. \"Glimmer Gal, I need you to throw me into the air vent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you'll be alright?\" Glimmer Gal asked, concerned for the safety of the tiny hero in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not, but this is a risk we have to take!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Glimmer Gal flung her fellow crime-fighter into the vent opening, where he wormed his way through the steely tunnel. It took a minute for him to find a way to the bank vault, but he soon made it -- falling on his back in a pile of money. Seeing this, the robber laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you tryin' you stop me, little guy?\" The criminal taunted. \"Well, too bad! 'Cause all this money is -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn electric shock struck the thief in the back, knocking him out cold. Glimmer Gal, her hand smoking for a second, ran over to her partner and scooped him up, checking his body for injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you too...\" the teller from before stammered. \"You stopped this criminal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think so...\" Mini Mage replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered. \"Hooray, the bank is saved!\" \"You're heroes!\" \"Thanks a million!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't mention it,\" Glimmer Gal smiled, \"we're just doing our job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, the two teenage superheroes had left the scene.</span></div></div>",

She gazed around others seated at the table, to check if anyone had noticed. That guy with the thin nose and earring, making this presentation, was new; a result of GTS' recruitment programs? She'd seen him around the streets before, but he looked different in their blue uniform. Really didn't suit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Success or failure, these occurrences are still data in this great system.\" He spoke, with a map of the city - and jabbed a black pin in the spot where the bookstore would be. Others were scattered around, where the sister teams across the table had encountered magic users.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over in her chair, staring at the ceiling. \"These are more than marks on a map, you know. They're training little kids to make a magic army...\" She pounded her chest, turning red. \"That really hurts me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermillion felt pressure on her left, making her cringe. She turned to see Chartreuse leaning over in his chair. \"It hurt me, too. Right here - and here - and here...\" The blond pointed all over his hefty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacking the map with another pin, the presenter harrumphed. \"To paraphrase Sheng-ji Yang: pain is just information. You have the input; now act on it.\" He waved to another mage hunter seated at the table. \"Now, from the IT group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With <i>pleasure</i>.\" A woman got up, a sleepy look in her eyes, giving a wide smile to the duo. \"I've gained the trust of a suspected magician through chat rooms. A rookie, with very little we can squeeze out of her - but she thinks she's speaking to a real master. We needed a lot of data to so perfectly, <i>flawlessly</i> emulate a magician. For that, I must thank the small fries - *ahem* - my ground team associates' <i>unique</i> information gathering mechanisms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Glad to help!\" Chartreuse had to hold his partner back from lunging like a rabid dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermillion grumbled. Averting her gaze, she looked to a spot on the map where the roughly-scattered marks conjoined. \"Huh. I wonder...\" Her glove loomed over the city block on the paper. The fingertips brushed each little pin, before the shadow of one index finger blotted out a great building. She smiled, and ground her finger into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there, right?\" Aria tapped the city map. A water ball levitated over her palm. This time, she was a little slow to follow her boyfriend. \"Are you sure this is fine? I'm so new to this magic thing. I've never been to a ritual, and there'll be so many other mages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded, patting her on the back. \"Hey, you're fine. I know they'll like you.\" He led her through the alleyways, glancing down at the directions. \"And it's quiet here. Nobody will make a big deal if they see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just feel so strange. I have these powers instantly, that everyone else needed so much practice to get... It doesn't feel fair.\" Still experimenting with her spells, she glanced wide-eyed at the liquid in her hand. She tapped it, dispelling the enchantment - and splashing both their faces. \"Well, I guess I still need <i>some</i> practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Blake laughed. \"But you're doing a great thing with it. Nobody's complaining about Glimmer Gal stopping crime!\" He patted the uniforms in his backpack, next to the magical focuses and books. \"I'm kinda surprised about the designs you made for us, though. Are...\" The dark-haired boy rubbed his glasses. \"Are disguises really supposed to show so much skin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette now sped ahead to get in front of Blake. \"Think about the headlines. 'Nobody has seen her face, but everybody has seen her midriff'! But more importantly - it draws attention away from the eyes or face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... revealing it on both of our costumes?\" He came to the door, knocking four times, pausing for exactly seven seconds, and ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled. \"It turns heads, that's all we need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open. A man in a dark mask spoke in a strained voice: \"I am here to borrow some - no, <i>merde</i>, YOU say that.\" He closed the door, and re-opened it. \"What is your business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake answered in the code phrase: \"We are here to borrow some sugar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teens stared at the paintings in the entrance. They followed their guide down a flight of stairs. Five people sat inside around chalk etchings and scattered materials. A traditional ritual; Blake didn't know much about this one, but he'd used the same rosemary ash his own summoning. Only candles lit the magic circle, as they all chanted quietly. Aria gulped - but her boyfriend's smile made her know they were doing well. The two newcomers walked into the dark basement, making their way into the group and joined hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow-clad girl held Blake's palm with her left hand, and a young boy's with her right. He looked up at her, still chanting with the same seriousness the adults were. The black-clad boy had joined hands with a shorter woman in gloves. She glanced to him, blinked in surprise, then instantly looked back to the dust lifting from the floor. The woman started a speech:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are gathered today to overcome. To seek out greater things, to surpass what the surface world shows us.\" With a kick of her boot, the dust floated higher. Blake sucked a bit in, sneezing - making two of the circle's members glare him down. Aria's tender eyes, though, brought his spirits back up. \"So the old sects will smile upon us, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice trailed off. The dark-haired boy felt the hand on his right slipping out. His girlfriend had her eyes shut. More dust flew into his nostrils, with a burning odor. The fires on the candles were too bright. Wax melted, dripping onto the floor. His eyes shut, and he felt himself getting heavier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-come on! I love you...\" That was Aria's voice. \"Oh! Oh, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy's voice: \"He's awake. That's all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world was hazy. Blake rubbed his messy hair, feeling around him. Something cold to the touch, like a bar. That's right - he was in that room for the ritual. After inhaling that dust, he fell asleep. And after he rubbed his eyes, taking in the world around him - he realized where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a small room, devoid of features, he was locked in a small cell - with his bag of spell focuses leaned against the wall. Nine other cages were around the room, with four of them holding people. Aria sat in one across from him, trying her hardest to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're anti-magic bars,\" one girl said. \"This is terrible... I got you all trapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake recognized them all from the summoning. But - with him and Aria, there were seven people total. That girl he'd held hands with and one other woman were missing. Where were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, that woman who nearly burned down the bookstore trod through the door. Vermillion stared over the group of trapped mages. They all spoke at once:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! You can't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think you can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored them, walking right towards Blake's cell - and spat in it. \"You're lucky my fists don't fit through those bars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy reeled back, then stood up. \"Y-you're... with the GTS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead nodded - her wig coming loose. In a hurry, she put it back in place. \"Yes - we mage hunters organized this ritual. And you're all mage hunter's prey, caught in our trap.\" She turned to the others, clasping her hands together. \"Don't worry, we have a great deprogramming method for completely relieving you of magic influence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria shouted: \"Deprogramming? That just means torture!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, seven knocks. A pause. The doorbell rang. Vermillion slipped a mage costume over her coat, and waved to them. \"...You'll get to experience it firsthand, once we have some more of your kind.\" She shut the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tried calling out spells. Flame, quake, flight, shrink - nothing. The bars were really blocking out his abilities. But he couldn't give up - with all these people, and his girlfriend's smile, all on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aria! Try tipping your cage over. Take my bag, it might have something in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed once, then twice - then, with all of her might, slammed into the cage wall. It leaned forward. She grasped onto Blake's backpack, and looked inside. Magic dust, book of spells - there! A spare pair of glasses! She jammed them in the lock, fiddling it around slowly - and managed to set herself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she rushed to her boyfriend's cell, undoing his lock. He ran out, sharing a brief hug with his savior. Quickly, Blake called out his shrink spell, and jumped into another mage's lock - as Aria undid one more with her makeshift lockpick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they could get far, footsteps rang out on the other end. The GTS members were coming back! Aria quickly called to Blake: \"Get in my mouth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to hide, or they'll kill you! And they can just confiscate the bag. So - \" She opened her mouth, leaning over to the miniature mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Blake jumped onto her tongue - the wet surface felt uncomfortable beneath his feet. As she closed her jaw, the world outside disappeared. He could only hear her pulse, racing as she prepared her next move. Blake lay back, hoping it'd only be temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman looked around, trying not to move too much - or the little hero in her mouth could end up gulped down. She kept her jaw a little loose, hoping to give him breathing room. She tried her best to finish unlocking the young boy's cage, but the steps got closer. Her little boyfriend's shivers transferred through her. If only she could close her eyes, and make this a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Glimmer Gal had to do something. These people believed in her. She had to be bold, but not panic. Smart, but decisive. As the door opened, Aria...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aria paused at the door. What if Blake and her couldn't face them alone? What kinds of horrors would GTS subject them to if they didn't make it out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard Blake's voice within her mouth: \"Do you think they've caught anyone else in the ritual?\" He was feeling a little cramped - and the straight row of teeth blocked his sight. But a small vision spell, and the small flexes in her muscles gave him all the crucial details. Anyways, he trusted his partner. He held on tightly to the closest bit of her tongue's massive, wet surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words made Aria realize: these people in the room weren't the only ones in danger. She shook her head, and answered: \"We're not going to let them hurt anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...She hoped that didn't slosh Blake around too much inside. It had to be hard, moving from one cage to another; but she couldn't leave him behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall woman grabbed the doorknob, clad in fake mage robes and a smug smile that touched her eyes. \"My, Vermillion and Chartreuse are <i>such</i> good prison wardens. Leaving a backpack that could have magic objects lying around, for any captive to grab...\" She snickered. \"It's a good thing the cunning GTS Information Officer, Lady Lavender, is here to pick up after them. They should thank me for soundproofing the ritual room, too; otherwise, our guests might be hearing some very unpleasant things.\" She covered a laugh as she pulled back the handle. \"I'll reward myself by <i>reappropriating</i> some of these mages' extra supplies for <i>further research</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she opened the door, Lavender noticed three things. First: two cages were open. Second: a bag had moved. Third: a young woman stood before her, clad in a glistening mask, an outfit revealing her taut midriff, and a pointing finger. In the time it took the GTS member to register this, she was also registering a solid blow of magic energy to the gut, the sensation of flying backwards through the air, and the wall impacting against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer Gal had suited up just in time - and in the same spell, Blake changed to his Micro Mage persona. Feeling Aria's slimy muscle brush up against him made him especially uncomfortable by how much skin his outfit revealed. She stood in surprise for a moment again, finger trembling in place. It took a few congratulations from the trapped mages to get them back into reality:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! I saw you on TV!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" the younger boy smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back - then felt a tap on the roof of her mouth. The boy inside crawled out on her tongue, eliciting some giggles from her. \"Hey - she's moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer groaned, stumbling up. Micro Mage signaled his companion - who sprang towards the foe, pinning her against the wall. She focused all her strength in keeping this woman's arms down. \"We don't want to hurt you; just help us get them out!\" The force in her voice shook him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender shook her head, holding back giggles with an unnaturally large grin. \"Swallow your food before talking, child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, let them out!\" Now, the shout spat her companion right out of her lips. He landed into the woman's chest. Her clothing beneath the robes was rather sparse - making him fall right in the bosom beneath, which gave way easily to his body. He was in shock for a moment. That was the first time he'd heard Aria speak that loudly, even having been shrunken around her for a week. And this spot was far closer to the enemy than he'd ever imagined being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetraying her wide smile, both heroes could feel her breaths getting deeper. \"Ha, that's one way of clearing your mouth.\" She noticed Aria's hands warming up with mana. \"Tsk tsk! If you cast a spell now, it'll hit your little partner. And if you let go of me, I'll trigger an alarm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teeny teen squirmed, blushing like mad. A strong perfume assaulted his nose, like the scent of... what was it? Of course, lavender. He felt like any moment, she could press the buxom mountains together and crush him flat. But something caught his eye: between her shirt's bursting buttons, Aria was still there, glaring down. Her anger was alien, nearly horrifying; but she was protecting him... No, giving him a chance to save the others. With his shoulders bumping against unfamiliar skin, he rubbed both hands, and asked: \"Spirits, show me the way to undo the bondage on my fellow mages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shut his eyes. A blurred vision came before the boy, slowly focusing - and making him groan. \"...like... seriously, spirits?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReveling in her foe's anger and bewilderment, the woman tried to move an arm. \"Do you really expect me, Lady Lavender, to - GAAAH~!?\" A yelp of surprise flew out of her mouth, interrupting her gloating. She looked to her chest, shaking her head. A little shape was moving in there, under her shirt! Her arms quivered, attempting to break from Glimmer Gal's hold. \"Oh-ho-ho-ho, that tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria stood still for a moment, hiding her face. It was embarrassing to look at that bulge moving down there, in the villain's clothes. Her mind raced with questions... But when she looked back to see the caged mages, she knew she had to help give him a chance. \"Micro Mage! What's happening down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe messaged back: \"I found the keys to unlock the cages, just keep holding on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicro Mage felt surrounded, kneaded on all sides by mounds of bulbous flesh and muscle. He scurried through it, nudging the oppressive, silky surfaces aside. With his magical senses, he knew the keys were close, hidden somewhere on this massive body. So he kept facing forward, the spongy floor below bursting into sweat and shivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My!\" The word merged with an exaggerated moan. \"Is your boyfriend always this upfront with women he's just met?\" Her eyes narrowed, cheeks lifting higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen above shook her head.\"You're trying to distract me, it won't work! We won't let you kidnap the mages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pinned woman moaned out a little harder and longer than was really necessary, her eyes rolling upwards and legs kicking. \"Ah~ But this is for your own safety! All sorts of things can go wrong when you misuse their powers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy from the side looked over in worry. \"Don't - don't say that! I...\" He looked at the other people trapped around. What would their fate be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volume of Lavender's voice, shaking through her vocal cords, put Blake off balance. He fell face-first into her navel. It took a brief struggle to unglue his head from the crevice. Finally, right near her wide hip, the keys were in sight, dangling by a rope-like chain. He picked them, filling both of his arms, and signaled: \"Got them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer Gal grinned, letting out a tense breath. \"She's still down, can you get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her robes are blocking some of the path. I'll fly out, and over to them!\" He felt mana flowing and charging in his hands, which he pushed behind himself, and tilted his head roughly towards the prisoners. \"WIND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as he called the spell out, Lavender made her move. She kicked against the ground, pushing Glimmer Gal back. The mage's relief had weakened her grasp; Aria was taken off-guard. While still holding on, she stumbled to the side. Blake's flight path ended up ramming his face into her bare stomach. Her could feel her yelping in surprise. And the wind spell's gust didn't stop, dragging him further and further across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis flight ended up sending him hurdling towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wind bounced him off both of the titaness' chests, back and forth - like a pinball. He ended up in the air, right above Lavender's wide smile, which just grew wider and wider...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil it snapped at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GTS officer's jaw closed right around his legs and cape, sucking backwards. She forced herself back into a sitting position. The keys dangled right from his hands. Her gigantic tongue pulled him in, like she was licking a lollipop or slurping spaghetti. The slimy organ tugged back, pushing his waist past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah!\" His heart pounded like a drum, slowly drowned out by the wet sloshing behind him. His kicking only seemed to make her hum happily, and return playful jabs and licks with the snakelike muscle. People around broke into gasps and confused murmurs. Blake's tiny arms pushed back against the slick, pink surface - but they slipped unevenly. They couldn't compare to the sheer strength of Lavender's giggling mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria gulped. She couldn't let go, or her foe would escape - but Blake was right there, getting sucked into their enemy's smug smile! If only she'd pushed back harder! Now her boyfriend would be gobbled up - again - along with the keys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...The keys! She shouted: \"Micro Mage, use those keys as a lasso with my mouth!\" She held her jaw open, saliva dripping from the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took a second to overcome the rushing terror. He swung the chain in a circle. The suction behind his stomach turn, but he could still aim well. The keys landed right on his girlfriend's great tongue. She started sucking back on it, making the chain bridge the gap between both titanic mouths. Blake grabbed on and tugged himself forward, trying to climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender's long neck twisted and turned away. Glimmer Gal did the same, trying to wrestle it away. Dizzied by the slurps, which wobbled the wire, Micro Mage maneuvered forward - eyeing the bright face at the end of the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GTS officer tried tickling him with the slimy muscle to make him let go, lathering around his legs. A bold gulp from Aria, and a strong push from Blake's arms, brought him closer to his goal. His girlfriend's giant lips soon surrounded his head once more. It was like a soothing kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the dark-haired woman didn't relent; without warning, her own immense tongue dove deep into Aria's mouth. The latter blushed, trying to push back. Pink muscle from both titans surrounded Blake on either side, covering his face in moisture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph-mph!\" Aria mumbled indignant cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmh~\" Lavender cooed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wrestled over the little boy, tossing him back and forth. He was slammed into the woman's gigantic white molars. They pressed down, getting a firm hold on him that removed the wind from his lungs - until Aria's mouth sucked back, sending him shooting towards the roof of her mouth. As it tried to keep him in place, her tongue ground the minuscule teen against the roof of the mouth. Lavender's pink monster hungrily brushed against him, prodding, nudging, trying to break the hold. Presently, it curled around the chain holding the key, and tugged back - pulling him into her jaws completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria had her eyes shut, just relying on her sense of touch to fight back. She resisted urges to draw back in embarrassment, forcing herself with deep breaths to keep a hold on Blake... and her lunch. The interior of her opponent's mouth felt wide, slick with gross liquid, and way too active. Every miniature giggle and snicker wobbled through the throat and shook the jaw, sending vibrations through the girl's tongue. She felt dread when imagining how much they shook Blake - poor Blake, nobody deserved this! It was probably rattling his bones, terrifying him to the core!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender felt another vicious jab from her opponent's mouth. As long as their lips were locked, and their arms were locked - Glimmer Gal was helpless. She only had to stall for time, and those dim minions from the ground team would come to her aid.  Despite their lack of prison guard skills, there were a few little things she could depend on Vermillion and Chartreuse for help with. Protection. Arson. Death traps. Re-education. Beer runs. Income tax. Grief counseling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlimmer Gal, Micro Mage... to think, she'd see them so soon. They didn't hide their fears well at all; but they were good at overcoming them. Did they even know about GTS' higher-level structure? Every lick from her and enticing wiggle from him fed more information. She tilted the boy around in her mouth, rubbing his facial features deep into the taste buds. Her eyes stared right into the girl, and felt her heartbeat. Lavender remembered that face. Just like her little sister, in the times before. Before those mages came...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smirked, and swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was nearly sucked in completely down the throat. He saw the uvula dangling above him, and emerald stomach acids down a nearly-endless muscular tunnel below. But the chain was still in his hands, still pulling back. He gripped hard, gritting his teeth, and dragged himself up. The back of the monstrous tongue brushed against his partly-exposed chest, sending swampy warm liquid down it. But he climbed still, guided by a dim light that shone off her teeth - and ended back up. Instantly, a tongue pushed down on him, planting his face in a pool of saliva. He was slowly, stickily, dragged back into the oral fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting lips transferred the boy back and forth between jaws, neither of the girls ready to relent. The GTS officer kept twirling him around; pushing him in dangerous positions; hoping to prolong the torture until her companions' return. The magic-struck heroine tried breaking the stalemate with a definitive yank. She opened wider, and slowed down her sloshing, trying to give her minuscule partner room to breathe. But she could feel him and the keys sliding right out, unable to match her opponent's pull. Any hesitation could mean losing him. So, she went back in with increased determination, her hands clenched around the arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe endured it all - twists, turns, an entire war within a pair of glistening caves. All he could do was hold on, squirm away from gaping throats, and keep holding onto the mages' keys. Any spells he cast might hurt Aria's mouth, and give Lavender victory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Come to think of it, which of them was Aria's mouth? He'd been tossed back and forth so many times, he lost track. It was hard to tell which of the great, overpowering tongues was which when both great muscles sandwiched him and squeezed him thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, having been thoroughly sucked, squeezed, and tickled; after every part of him dripped with one girl's spit or his own sweat; he squirmed the wrong way, right down a throat. Endless organic surfaces flew past him as he was tossed towards one of the giant uvulas. The other tongue dove in after him, but ended just short of him, sending spittle in his direction. Blake reached out helplessly, letting out a scream that echoed off the white teeth, lost in thick layers of flesh, bone, and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicro Mage couldn't tell if it was his heart throbbing, or his swallower's. Way back, his teacher taught him deep breathing techniques for stress. Trying them now, the boy just inhaled more musty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and the keys plunged down helplessly through contracting throat walls, which masticated his teensy frame, squashing his limbs against one another. Wet squelches sounded around, each shaking him to the core - simply from the subconscious, unremarkable act of swallowing. Nobody outside would even tell he was more than a lump passing gently down someone's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA valve of muscle pushed below him. He gasped as it slowly gave way beneath his trembling legs, sending putrid gas bubbled from below. Unable to keep his footing, he gripped for the walls - the soft surface gave way easily between his fingers, but it was too wet and smooth to hold onto. He fell right in, plummeting into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep pool of churning acids greeted him, splashing around his costume-clad chest. A piece of half-digested food splashed against him. He paddled wildly, trying to make his way up above the waves. As soon as Blake's head made it out, he panted madly, tasting the murky air. A sickly-sweet aftertaste attacked him. He looked around the meaty walls, a few of which merged into relatively dry spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he gulped, rubbing his hair free of the digestive liquids. \"Take it easy, Micro Mage. You've been in a belly before. Your powers protected you. Well, the curse did, really - and you got the shrink spell later - but it works out to be the same, r-right?\" A strange itching took his legs. He forced himself to ignore it. Groans echoed in the wobbly chamber, making him tremble. \"You just gotta swim over to the safe zone, and - wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his palm. \"The keys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chain had plunged deeper, and whirlpools of acid were dragging it away. He dove in after them, not daring to open his eyes in the liquid - just tapping the floor with both hands. He felt like the currents pulled him, too, rising up in mighty tides. By the dull whacks outside, booming below, and the shifting gravity, the boy could tell the giantesses outside were fighting. He pressed forward, knowing that the keys could still save the mages caught outside... At last, he touched a thin bit of metal. His hand drew back in surprise, then in again, chasing it down. There it was! He got a hold of it, and pulled the chain to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rose up to a dry spot, and lifted the key into the air in triumph. He smiled for a moment, before snorting and choking out the gross acids he'd taken in. Degrading, for sure - but anything to save the people. He patted the wall, resting in it. Soon, the little mage felt a finger poking back at him, pushing into his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight - whose stomach was this? In the clash of titanic tongues, he'd lost track which muscle belonged to which woman. It was just as he wondered this, though, that a voice boomed from above, answering his question...</span></div></div>",

Blake had landed in the bowels of his gorgeous girlfriend, someone who cared for him and could help him out. Even without a solid way to escape from her digestive movements, it was better than being held captive in Lavender's gigantic gut. The miniaturized hero rested his head against the towering pink stomach wall, catching a long breath of the thin air. A bit of green liquid sloshed against his costume's shoe, and the keys. \"You can do it... Glimmer Gal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroine tossed her opponent back, sweat dripping down behind her mask. She felt her exposed midriff in horror, poking a finger into it. Was that her imagination - or did she felt the slightest bit of pressure back? Her stomach groaned, making her cringe. What did that sound like to her boyfriend, deep inside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes snapped back to the snickering woman before her, who tossed her robes to the floor. \"Ohoho, what was that? You couldn't control your appetite?\" The Information Officer shook her head slowly. \"Well, the Group for Total Security thanks you for your contribution. I'll update our databases with Micro Mage's current status: mush in his former partner's tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no hesitation, Glimmer Gal launched another lighting bolt towards the woman. Lavender sidestepped it, and delivered a hook right into the girl's stomach. It shook Blake, sending him flying across the squishy room - and right into another barrier of the stomach tissue. The strength made the seas shake below him, but he kept a hold on the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria noticed a wall behind her, where entrapped mages looked on in shock. She stuck her boot out and pushed off it, ramming right into her opponent's torso headfirst. It knocked her opponent back to the ground. \"Don't try and gloat! Micro Mage isn't with you, so I won't hold back anymore!\" She stepped over and delivered a flurry of punches towards her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn succession, they hit - until the woman grabbed her by the arms once again, stopping the assault. Her narrow eyes stared into Aria's. \"Is he in <i>here</i>?\" She jabbed her knee right into the girl, knocking the wind from the superhero. \"I think I feel him! <i>Hellooooo!</i>\" Her knee ground brutally against Glimmer Gal's belly, digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tried to stay calm amid the churning seas sweeping over him. He switched quickly between flying in gassy stomach air, and being plunged into opaque water or heaps of partly-digested mush. From the small yelps around him, he knew his girlfriend was in trouble. If only he could get out and help. He tried climbing the walls, but the smooth, liquid-coated surface made his hands slip. The boy groaned, splashing into water again with a new blow. \"Spider-Man made this look so easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heartbeat around him was uneven, and sped up quickly. Blake shut his eyes to the stinging acids, wishing there was some way, any way at all, that he could rejoin Glimmer Gal in combat. But for now, he just had to hold his breath, as more goop that was once his friend's meal flew into his face. He repeated: \"I believe in you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the superhero jumped off the ground. Both her legs kicked out against Lavender's stomach. Her leg power, and the sudden shock, overcame Lavender's arms. The woman glared as Aria slipped back, getting her feet steady once again. Cheers from the captured mages encouraged her - she focused on them, casting aside her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cast a wave spell behind her, the liquid jets propelling her towards her enemy. The latter pulled off a spectacular leap, flipping through the air and onto the other side of the girl altogether. She landed firm onto the wet ground as Aria slammed against the wall, holding her hands out to block the impact. The woman's face was lit up, chuckles still emerging from her mouth. \"Ohohoho, <i>I</i> could cast a better spell than that.\" She prepared to dive forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even looking, Aria shouted \"thunder!\", and flung a bold back from her waist. It fell right at Lavender's feet, which swept aside. Instantly, the wet floor lit into a field of sparks, sending a harsh shockwave through the GTS member's spine. She lept in the air with a jolt, and came back down with her eyes off-kilter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha... Oh, ohoho...\" Her laughter continued, fading out as her eyes glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiled from within the depths of the gut. The shaking was less severe; now, it felt more like a beach's waves washing over him. Did they win? Yes; he knew it. Even if he didn't do much, a smile still crept on his face. Logically, he should be paddling over to the dry spot again. But for now, the sounds of his girlfriend's pulse slowing down made him feel heavy and slow. He could just lie back and let the waves carry him where they wanted to. After all, he trusted her. They were lovers now. He could just sink into her expanse for a moment, and trust that she'd know what to do. The storm had passed. The liquid's sting was more like a tingle, then like a soft massage. The corners of Micro Mage's brain screaming at him to get up and back into action slowly sunk into the impenetrable depths, as he felt himself rocked by the pulsating, muscular mass, and the footsteps below...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his fingers still gripped the key. They needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after one, Aria unlocked the cages. It was harder, just using makeshift lock-picking tools rather than the keys. And after Blake went through so much trouble to get them... But the smile from the young boy as she freed him made her briefly forget his plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Glimmer Gal!\" He waved up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted his back. That was it - the last cage open. \"It's okay. Our secret identity's safe with you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded back. \"Let me help you! My spells aren't super-good, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The important thing is that you're safe. And besides, we don't know what GTS can do with you if you don't have a secret identity.\" Aria pointed to the large door, where the other mages were already escaping. \"We'll handle the rest for now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed her stomach. \"Is Micro Mage gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry!\" Her eyes shut, as her hands gently pushed him to the door. If she said it out loud, she thought she might believe herself. They'd reached victory, but at such a huge cost... Were the two of them really cut out to be heroes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria didn't know if any more mages were being held. She ran through the halls, trying to find the villains. But the house felt larger than when she entered - the directions didn't make sense. Finally, the ritual room was right ahead of her. She entered inside... and felt something cold strike her shoulders. Electricity ran through her spine, sending her to the ground in small spasms. Blake's body crashed against her gut. Gazing up at the dull ceiling lights, Chartreuse stood above her, peering down with a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him, Vermillion sprinkled the floor with motor oil: \"Can't leave any evidence. Restrain her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alley-oop.\" He bowed down, lifting Aria as she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stirred. Something was too still about Aria. Her breathing was still resonating in the background, but far quieter. The footsteps below didn't shake his body. A small sensation told him to rest back in the liquid again, relax after his hard work - but no, the warm waters were TOO warm now. Aria's body temperature was rising; and Blake, within her, felt a good deal of that washing over him. The key was still in his hand. Good. He pushed his other down, and murmured: \"wind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small bubble erupted from the green waters, splashing over his dark hair. He groaned, and repeated: \"Wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother splash, no bigger than the last. He focused all his strength in each arm. Stumbling upwards, Blake stood in the calm sea of Aria's stomach, all his senses kicking back in at once. One solid burst, and he could fly out - he hoped. He pointed down, and yelled: \"Wind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing came out. However, from his sloshing, a greater bubble formed around the hero, surrounding him. He stood as still as possible as the thing floated upwards, through Aria's gullet. Slowly, a shape came into view in the air: her uvula. Blake took a great leap of faith out, over the gums and past the lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And into the frying pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole building was blazing in a mass of flames. He gulped in smoke-tainted air. GTS was burning the whole building down. The heroes were both stuck inside an anti-magic cage. Aria sat limp, tied in ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake swung the keys towards one of the bars, letting its weight carry him forward. He quickly jammed it into the lock, pulling the door open. \"Water!\" his attempts at quelling the flames were for naught; they just made the blazes larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, oh gosh...\" He ran back to Aria, and - with the key as a blade - cut through the ropes binding her. The boy shouted into the unconscious girl's ear, trying to stir her back up. With no response, and no idea what to expect, he went to her mouth, and planted a small kiss into the pink lips. If this was the end, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... UH!\" She darted up, eyes snapping open suddenly. Her brown hair darted back and forth at the embers. She jumped out, and shouted: \"WIND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake joined her: \"Water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, their spell came out as a wet foam. Creaking sounds resonated around, like the foundation was breaking apart. With a few more called spells, Micro Mage and Glimmer Gal spread the liquid around the room. The flames were completely extinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah...\" Blake felt himself expanding to normal size again. Everything ached. He fell forward into Aria's arms; she rested her head against him, also panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back. \"We... I got the captives out, but you - saved me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"Way to go. You did great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no threats nearby, they lay down together, hand in hand.</span></div></div>",

Her shoulders were slurped in next, followed by her chest, her belly and back, then her legs; Jade\u2019s body was being devoured at an impeccable, and extremely terrifying, speed. Soon, all that remained of her to the outside world was her feet, before Bertha hungrily snapped them up too. The entirety of the girl was quickly sent careening down into her gut with a loud and booming <i>gulp</i>. A chill rushed down Blake\u2019s spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge sunk behind gigantic, froggy breasts and was dumped into the predator\u2019s stomach, causing the chamber to expand larger than humanly possible and spill over Bertha\u2019s legs. The flesh hugged Jade tightly, exposing every nook and cranny of her curled-up form within the belly. She futilely struggled against the walls, hardly able to move within the confines of her prison, and the imprint of her face bore an expression of fear as she mouthed muffled pleas into the skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was aghast at what he had just witnessed, his mouth hanging open in complete shock. Bertha let out a resounding belch before patting her overflowing tummy in satisfaction. \u201c<i>Oooohh!</i> That was delicious! Almost as good as you were, hunny!\u201d She teased, turning her head to wink towards her tiny husband. The look of horror he wore gave her pause. \u201cWhat's the matter, dear?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake managed to swallow down the fear that threatened to clog his throat. \u201cThat\u2026 was my <i>sister!</i>\u201d His voice began weak, but quickly it evolved into a roar. His sister was in trouble! \u201cLet her out now!\u201d He yelled up at the frog girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha was taken aback. \u201cYour sister\u2026?\u201d She croaked, staring down wide-eyed at the outline of her wiggling meal. A smile came to her lips. \u201cMy sister-in-law, huh?\u201d Reaching down, she took the stomach between her hands, playfully squeezing the groaning girl inside. She lifted it up, and held it for a few seconds, before letting it drop down with onto her legs again with unnerving <i>slorp</i>. \u201cNice to met you, dearest sister-in-law! Or should I say\u2026 <i>eat</i> you?\u201d The frog giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was growing impatient. \u201cSpit her out, Bertha! <i>Now!</i> Or I\u2019ll never be your husband!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha stared down at him. A glint flashed in her eyes that made Blake suddenly remember the difference in size and magical power between the two. Nonetheless he stood his ground and kept his gaze locked with hers, even as that smile of her\u2019s widened. </span></div></div>",

I would never harm my husband's family; just give them a bit of scare, that's all!\" She said, you letting out a sigh of relief as she rubs her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank god for that! Now then, spit her out and I'll let you sleep with me for the time being,\" you said, only for her to shake her head no.<br>\r\n\"While I can spit her out and wipe her memory, I don't want to. She was tasty and she feels so good in there, especially when she wasn't able to hear our conversation,\" she replies, slapping her gut and making Jade move around as much as she could.<br>\r\n\"Of course, you wouldn't let her go that easily. I just wished I knew why you would do such a thing in the first place,\" you muttered to yourself, reaching Bertha's ears.<br>\r\n\"That also reminds me, because of my semi-restoration, my enemies are probably aware that I'm back and you should be on guard for while until I'm fully back. Because of that, I thought your sister was one of them when she entered your room and I tried to eliminate her,\" she warns, her face becoming very serious.<br>\r\n\"But for now, let's cuddle! Wife and husband need to know each other to make the relationship better!\" She said, eventually losing her serious look and looks at you all lovey-dovey as you're teleported onto her belly, directly on Jade's head, much to your displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a cloaked figure stares at your house and a wind blows by, revealing the figure to be a muscular woman. While the woman didn't look anything different, despite the clothes being in the way, an oddity could be found in the muscle gut she sported. Her belly bulged out to form a human being inside, though the muscles made it hard to tell.<br>\r\n\"Alright, Miss Nora, time to work,\" she said as her green and heavily scaled hand pats her belly as she smiles at it, exposing some gator like teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, after Bertha regurgitate your sister and clean her memories, you found a magic tool not too far from you, with a note nearby. Reading that it would temporary restore your size, you take it, growing back to normal and do your usual morning ritual. As you head down, you could smell food and you enter the kitchen to see Bertha wearing just an apron. Even worse, she has the same kind of belly from yesterday, just larger.<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me...\"<br>\r\n\"I thought I would cook for my husband and when your mother came in, I couldn't resist,\" she confesses, stroking her stomach, revealing the figure of your mother inside of it with a horrified expression on her face.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll spit her out and wipe her memory too. It's just that your family is too delicious! Oh, hi sweetie!\" She adds in, changing her tone when Jade entered the room.<br>\r\n\"Hey mom! The food smells great!\" She said, not realizing her mother was inside the imposter and you realized she's using an illusion spell on herself, drawing a sigh of defeat from you. Once breakfast was over, you head over to school as Bertha stays behind to learn much about the era she's in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The school day transpired like any other school day. There were brief moments when things felt amiss, when he would catch fleeting figures out of the corner of his eye, but all-in-all it was a calm and mundane day. While normally the routine was beyond boring to the young mage, after the strange little journey he had recently been through \u2013 being turned into a fly, eaten by a frog, that frog actually being a gorgeous and powerful woman who was adamant about marrying him, and had a nack for snacking on his family members \u2013 Blake was honestly extremely grateful for a period of relative sanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, he had little doubt that sanity would crumble away once he returned home. And indeed, as he shut the front door of the house behind him, Blake felt a chill fall upon him like a heavy curtain; a weight that spiked to a crushing degree as a sultry purr from the depths of the building snaked into his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, <i>honeeeey</i>~!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shuddered, the blood in his veins running cold. He pondered for a moment over the extremely tempting idea of throwing the door open and making a break for it, but he quickly brushed that thought away as he recalled the overwhelming magical prowess of his would-be pursuer. Any attempt to escape her would no doubt prove futile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great effort, Blake pried his hand from the handle and hesitantly turned around. What he saw made him wish he hadn\u2019t. (Sorta. His body was kinda fifty-fifty.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the hallway, separated from him by only a minute gap, was Bertha, adorned in what was, with little doubt, the skimpiest lingerie he had ever seen. The wicked web of white fabric stretched from her neck to her neither region, keeping her all naughty bits hidden away while teasingly exposing the smooth green skin beneath. The intent of the clothing was made even more obvious by the naughty expression the frog woman kept upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight stirred something primal withing Blake. A mighty need to reach forth and enjoy the willing and supple beauty before him. Yet he resisted it, unsure if it was a spell inflicting the feeling upon him or not, and clamped his hands over his eyes. \u201cW-Where did you get that?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha giggled, obviously amused by the boy\u2019s embarrassment. \u201cYour mother\u2019s closet. She was nice enough to let me borrow it for our date tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-date?\u201d Blake muttered in confusion. \u201cBertha, wha-<i>Mmmpph</i>!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hands blocking his vision, he never saw Bertha close the distance between them, and was only made aware she had moved when her bosom hungrily engulfed the young mage\u2019s head. \u201cHush, dearest.\u201d She whispered, softly stroking the back of his head. \u201cYou just relax and let your loving wife take the lead.\u201d Her husband safe within her grasp, she began her trek up the stairs towards Blake\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particularly bounce of Bertha\u2019s body as she cleared another step freed Blake\u2019s head from it\u2019s enclosure. He gasped for air before looking up at the frog woman. \u201cWait, Bertha, please-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Bertha, after giving him a somewhat sympathetic look, forced his face into the canyon of her tits. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Blake,\u201d She said as she finally reached the top of the stairs. \u201cBut no can do. I sensed a few of my old enemies hovering around your school. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t get any closer, but I was so worried about you! Just thinking about all the terrible things they could've done if they had caught you \u2013 oh, it makes my blood boil!\u201d She viciously growled, making her breasts vibrate around Blake. Approaching the bedroom door, the voluptuous woman smacked it open with her massive rump, too impatient to open it by hand. \u201cI <i>have</i> to keep you safe. And my body is the perfect safe for my most precious item!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, she instantly cast Blake towards the bed with frightening accuracy. He landed with a small thump against the mattress, disorientating him slightly, and before he had any chance to recover Bertha was atop him, cutting off any form of escape. She flicked the door shut with her frog tongue and, after recalling it back into her mouth, starred down at the mage below her with a seductive smile. \u201cBesides, isn\u2019t this a great way for newlyweds to bond?\u201d </span></div></div>",

Blake flies again near face, hoping to be able to talk to her through her ear and it works, Jade hears him.. or more specifically his buzzing.

Her spoon misses the bowl and clangs right next to Blake, startling him and making him loose his balance and fall into the bowl! Blake is throw into the milk and swims back to the surface and coughs of the milk. \"This isn't good\" Blake thinks to himself so he starts to shout. \"Jade! I'm down here! I fell into your cereal! Help!\" He tries to flail above the milk, also making his way to the sides of the bowl as well, hoping to get out before something bad happens... but its too late. Just as he gets towards the edge Jade sends down her spoon again ... and scoops up her tiny brother along with bits of cereal. Blake yelps as he is pulled to the bottom of the spoon as Jade lifts it to her face. She smiles and looks at her phone and opens her mouth , ready to take in the cereal. Blake can only watch in horror as he is lifted towards his little sister's mouth! He shouts at her just as she places him into her mouth. </span></div></div>",

Jade then sucks the contents off the spoon pulling everything off as the spoon retreats. Leaving the cereal and Blake... to begin the process of digestion. Immediately, Blake falls onto the floor that is Jade's massive tongue and everything begins to be thrown and bucked around from the tongue under him, the orchestrator of it all. It moves and pushes the cereal to her pearly whites and she begins to chew, destroying everything in her mouth while Blake helplessly attempts to hold onto the slippery muscle. The teeth destroy and crunch the cereal into oblivion, a normal everyday action for nutrition for Jade, a nightmare for her big brother. Blake grips onto the small taste buds as the cereal and milk join together as saliva coats the tiny fly boy, soaking his wings. She keeps chewing until the cereal is a soft mush before moving it all on top of Blake in the middle of her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh, JADE!\" Blake cries out from under the pile but again his cries fall upon deaf ears as Jade is back again focusing on her phone ignoring what is in her mouth as she readies another scoop. She moves what is in her mouth, including her downsized brother to the back of her mouth, near her awaiting throat. Blake's titaness of a sisters wastes no time as she swallows everything down... spit, cereal, milk and all. Blake tries to hold on as the powerful suction threatens to pull him down. And for a brief moment of salvation she opens her mouth... just in time for Blake to see the next spoonful arrive. Saliva pools up quickly around him as Jade salivates... and swallows again, sending the tiny mage down against her slick, powerful throat as Jade's lips close around the spoon, starting the process all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade is none the wiser as she hear nothing and simply chewed her food. She tasted a peculiar piece that had a unique flavor compared to the rest of her cereal of which she was quite familiar with. Although not enough to pull her conscious mind to it she noted that is was tastier than the rest and went about her business, eating her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, Blake is being pulled down quickly with the rest of his sister's spit to her waiting stomach. The thought of being covered in his little sister's spit grosses him out a bit but he stays calm.. even though he can her massive heart beating in his ears. As quickly as it arrive it fades away as the grumbles of Jade's hungry belly slip through the organic tube. A gust of stale wind blows up past Blake as he audibly hears his younger sister burp, quite loudly too. Soon Blake hits a firm \"floor\" before it opens up below him and spills him onto digested mush along with the cereal he came in with. Blake's eyes adjust to the darkness of the belly around him as his ears are assaulted by the groans and the sounds of the constrictions around his ribbed prison. The \"cereal\" and juice have become unrecognizable as they bubble and begin to break down even further into bile. Blake blushes and tries to quickly think of a plan to get out of this mess, figuratively and literally.</span></div></div>",

It was still odd seeing all her features spread out before him, magnified many times over, from his half-inch form. \"You're kidding! Didn't you say this was serious? Besides, I...\" He shook, hiding his face in the pale glove - feeling its latex touch his hair. \"I don't think I can do this... She'll be so huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the queen, this last complaint didn't help his case. She shook her great head, the <i>swish</i> of her hair making sonic booms for him, and patted his head - tilting it around. \"You can't keep running from every suitor. Please, at least humor this one - I'm sure she's a very nice girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of immense, rose lips engulfed him and silenced his calls. The wettest kiss he'd ever experienced, it drenched his shirt and made him scarlet in embarrassment. The pressure from either pillow-like mass of flesh, and sucking within, made the little teen squirm, unable to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a black embroidered cushion from his bed, and placing the royal family's son atop it, the queen - followed by her servants - carried him to the castle garden. The bumpy ride tossed him upwards and downwards, each step like a thunderstorm below. Once-familiar halls in glowing shades became towering monoliths, the lights through windows blinding him, the portraits making him shudder in terror as they looked upon him. The open air battered against his pitch-black robes; it was lucky that woman's hex shrunk his pajamas with him, though the clothes did little to make him feel much less exposed to the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she placed him down, Blake gazed up at the rushing, flowing dress his mother wore, swishing like great sails on the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale spoke up. \"I've already let the reception know of the prince's stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded in approval. \"Commendable. Then, don't let me get in the way, Blake! You'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed: \"No, I need help here --!\" But it went unheard, drowned out by the echo of footsteps as the royals left the garden - and the sound of someone new coming in. His head darted to the entrance, bracing himself, as odd noises crashed through his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wide doors creaked as they opened. A small progression of handmaidens entered, heads bowed in perfect order; each of them carried a gift. From the miniature prince's perspective, he could still make out some of the details. Some of them, great dishes of cakes and fruits prepared just the way he liked them, ornamented with almost-supernatural frosting. Some of them clothes fitted for his earlier scale, in a dashing black - now probably able to hold him completely in one sleeve. Along with that, iron works with gears and pipes that he couldn't understand at all. Was that some sort of weapon in one titanic maiden's hand? Their sandals crushed the tree-like blades of grass below him, as they entered in a circle, surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went silent for a moment. With her servants ordered carefully in the entrance, still and mighty as statues, Blake wondered about getting up, darting away. Nobody could see him, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a carpet rolled out, right up to his makeshift platform. He gulped, as light from the rising sun framed the delicate silhouette of his next suitor: Princess Indigo of Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about his age, and stood shorter than many of the dark-haired women who entered; but compared to the insect-like boy, she was larger than the entire castle. The first thing Prince Blake saw, looking forward, were wooden sandals, tightened around pale socks. Those delicate toes, with her measured stride, would be able to crush most of the village's huts and stores beneath their weight. Indigo's socks lifted up higher and higher, each a pale, silky tower that flexed around her thin muscles, transforming into a web of folds every time she took a step forward. Her hands, smoother than anything he'd ever seen, brushed across her purple dress. (was that from a lotion given by the Lee house? It smelt vaguely of mandarins.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, staying in place, head craned up - just taking everything in. That one handmaiden holding an iron tool, which Blake took as a weapon, held it over a bowl and pressed a switch - making a smoothie for the princess. The princess took it in her hand, bowing. \"Thank you for this drink, Jun. It will help me calm my nerves. I'm glad I brought my blender invention with me.\" A machine to blend fruits together, amazing! The Topaz Kingdom had a lot to learn from these creations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant - Jun? - replied. \"Her highness has practiced the local language well. I hear no accent or errors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued ahead, bringing more of her body in view for the shrunken prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit, itself, was unlike anything that Blake knew from the Topaz kingdom, and not just because of how jaw-droppingly large it was. From his scale, as she approached, he could see every detail of the minuscule silk that went into sewing it. The material was light, and allowed for great comfort and mobility from the massively-sized visitor - which she showed off with how gracefully she trod, each fall of her feet like a drop in a pond of water. Despite this practicality, it was no less formal or impressive: embroidered designs rushed along it like the mighty paintings at great cathedral ceilings. It illustrated a map of stars and constellations, fully accurate to what the Topaz Kingdom saw in the night sky. Blue ribbons tied around the back gave form to her chest and hips. The shoulders weren't present, exposing part of her neck and collar. Detached sleeves, hanging on her arms at either end, were large enough to hold an entire army between them. Her arms held still so as not to rustle them much, but they swayed like curtains still as she sipped her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Indigo's servants did up her dark hair in two tight buns, with blue-and-purple ribbons around them. Her bangs were straight; they brought out her solid eyebrows, thick lashes, and chocolatey eyes. They seemed to analyze everything that came before them, from the flowers to the stone walls. Blake had some suitors from nations further east before, and was familiar with some of their makeup trends. While not as heavy as some preceding her, this princess had a few touch-ups to accent the depth of her eyes, and the roundness of her cheeks and chin. At once demure and striking, she was the kind of woman who might hold back quietly in a hallway - but when she gazed upon the cushion, it was like steel turned in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake waved up: \"Hello!... Hi there!\" She didn't budge. \"Uh, nin hao? Neih hou? Annyeong...hasim...nikka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid the young woman even hear him? Continuing to gaze down to the pillow with him atop, she nodded. \"Prince Blake must still be preparing himself, after that incident. I assume the Topazian court set this cushion as my seat?\" She brushed her hair, sighing. \"A strange local custom, but I suppose it can't be helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, no. His black robes and hair blended in with his pillow - Indigo hadn't seen him! Her backside, draped in fine silk, crashed like a meteor from above. He tried to scurry away, but before even a second had passed, astounding pressure from above crashed on his back, driving him deep into the fabrics. Princess Indigo sat on his pillow, inadvertently pancaking him between it and her titanic rear. While she rested back, the weight shifted above, smearing his head into the weave of intricate white strings. He could feel her sigh above, rushing through his body and echoing. Soon after, her booming voice followed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spell on Prince Blake... and here I thought I could get away from my country's superstition. I'm sure there's a rationale behind this all.\" Another nudge of her backside, sensing something uncomfortable below - and it rolled Prince Blake around, engulfing him entirely in the warm undergarments.</span></div></div>",

This is absolutely ridiculous!\" Princess Indigo stands up and looks down to her cushion and looks it over. \"How a kingdom can come so far yet not make suitable seats is beyond me.\" Indigo sighs and thinks for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake groans from the sudden reprieve and takes in a much-needed breathe of fresh air. His body, too tired to move, lies plastered to the seat. Blake looks up to the towering princess as she turns and inspects the cushion. Blake tries to move and call out to get her attention but fails, his voice already tired from his prior attempts. He watches as the giant princess inspects the cushion, hoping that she will find him against the cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's no surprise this thing feels so uncomfortable,\" the princess surmises. \"Everything about its structure seems entirely off...

Yeah. The design definitely seems better in that regard. Hm... let's try it.\" Princess Indigo grabs the pillow and sets it on the floor. She sits back down and slips off her tight slippers and sighs. \"Feels good to be out of those. Mm.. now let's try this out.\" She rests her soles on either side of Blake and presses her feet deep into the cushion. Blake blushes and coughs from the strong scent of lavender and sweaty feet. Indigo wiggles her toes and leans back into the seat and smiles. \"Ah, this is much better.\" Blake tries one last time to get away before her toes grab him in their wigglings, but is too late as Indigo's second and third toes grab him and rub him against her slick toe flesh. \"There we go, precisely what that button is for,\" the princess coos. Indigo continues to rub and batter the prince with her mighty digits, continuously dragging his beaten form under her toes. Her giant foot pinning Blake to the pillow and rubbing ruthlessly against him. Indigo dragged and lifted her sole against the young prince and pillow, wiping her sweat and the dirt collected from insider her slippers onto Blake's body and<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">seat</span> footrest. Her toes danced and squirmed, elated to finally be free from her their confines and start wiggling freely again, gripping the fibers of the cushion. \"I must say this is quite therapeutic. I should ask them if I could have one of their cushions. Or this one since it's already covered in my feet smell.\" Indigo giggles and continues to wipe her sweaty feet onto the cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo sighs and smiles seeming to have enjoyed her foot fun while Blake, if he could muster up the energy to speak, would wholeheartedly disagree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I must say that was lovely... but as much as I would love to continue I must wonder where Prince Blake is!\" Indigo firmly plants her feet into the cushion, trapping Blake against her musty sole, the scent of her warm musty feet filling his senses that he can practically taste her. \"Hm. This won't do.\" Indigo withdraws her feet and slips them back into her slippers, shoving them on quite roughly. \"I suppose I can wait a little longer, but any more and we will have to leave. It's impolite to keep a lady, no less a princess waiting.\" Blake mentally panics at this and tries to rest, in hopes of getting her attention.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake found himself glued to the flexing foot: flattened by the dexterous digits; engulfed in the soft, worn flesh; and stuck by the humidity and warmth. The impossibly huge royal visitor lifted her leg, the constellation dress slipping across it; then directed it for the mouth of the blue shoes. The visiting princess slammed the shrunken boy into her slipper! His shouts of anguish drowned into the sweaty surface of her sole, smothering his lips beneath the wrinkles. Indigo, standing at her full height, pressed all her weight on the prince's puny body - the supple skin shifting slightly on his torso. Already lathered in a thick layer of stale sweat from being the dark-haired beauty's footrest, Blake was now practically drowning in the pools of liquid that gathered in the filthy insole. Tastes of lavender, mandarins, and salt conquered his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo shoved her toes harder into the footwear, her thin lips in a disgusted frown. \"Nggh. I much preferred the sandals I wore earlier.\" She wrung her feet in circles, twisting her ankle - unconsciously massaging Blake, the valleys of travel-weary wrinkles grinding into his minuscule torso. \"These slippers are so... constricting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't lying. The shoe tightly hugged her ped on every side, giving it barely any room. The discomfort made her keep fidgeting and squirming actively, kneading the spongy surface. And with his body stuck so tightly to her gigantic flesh, the puny Prince rocked with each twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handmaiden, Jun, patted the noblewoman on her exposed shoulder. \"Please maintain your composure, your Highness. This design shows off your refinement and taste. Prince Blake will adore them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngido sighed, squeezing her slender digits together. \"If only he knew how uncomfortable it is in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake groaned, pain shooting through his minuscule nerves. Every time he flexed a muscle to force the moist skin away, he just found himself pinned down. With each breath he took into his compressed lungs, the putrid aroma of imperceptible dirt stung his nostrils. He couldn't even twist his head aside from the unyielding odor and wetness - the harsh pressure from the massive, soaking surface prevented all movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Princess Indigo was cramped in her shoes, Prince Blake was outright pancaked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal daughter pulled out a miniature clock of her own design, the arms still ticking on the Lee House's local time. Fine silk draped as she crossed her arms, and tapped her foot. \"We've stood for some time. There's shyness, and then there's simple disrespect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun nodded. \"I'm sure his highness is near.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Indigo tapped harder, grinding her shoe into the ground. No matter what position she put it, there was something looking her inside it. Perhaps a pebble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's whole world lifted up with her immense shoe. The force squeezed his arms deeper into the sweaty surface. He gasped in terror. The next second - <i>SLAM!</i> She drove him into the ground. He squealed weakly, wind rushing from his lungs like a flattened whoopee cushion. Gravity pulled him up, giving him a brief sensation of weightlessness, until - <i>SLAM!</i> That one was even have than the last; the princess in blue was losing patience rapidly. <i>SLAM! SLAM! SLAM!</i> She scrunched the prince deep into the center of her sole, launching an attack on him. Impact after impact with the ground mangled and numbed his body further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes blurred together; nobody came. The longer the princess stood, the tighter her footwear felt, and the warmer the sun beat on their procession. She nudged, wiggled, rocked, stamped, and rubbed her tired peds. She brushed them on top of each other, attempting to knead out the soreness. Whole avalanches of skin caught Blake, grinding him deeper in. It was starting to mold around him, accepting him as a clump or dirt caught on its underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the solar rays grew hotter, more sweat built up in the criss-crossing wrinkles and prints. Rivers of salty-sweet fluid flowed through the miniature folds, splashing the shrunken teen's face. He reeled his face away, coughing and hacking. But with every slide away from the sole, another idle fidget or terrifying <i>SLAM</i> squished him flatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the door to the main hall creaked. Princess Indigo jumped into a straight posture - wincing as something crunched beneath her sole. She'd investigate later. The procession bowed quietly, and she cupped her hands before her, welcoming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...A girl with a short green dress, dark hair, and a huge tiara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Princess!\" She pointed to the mechanical dragon hovering in the sky. \"Can I take a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo blinked, looking to her ride. She'd heard about a younger heir to the Throne of Heart. \"Princess Jade?\" She took a step away from Jade, twisting her toes into the ground - a little surprised at how forthright this little noble was. \"I'm all for cultural exchange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rough pat on her shoulder. Jun coughed. She understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a glance away, the noblewoman in blue continued: \"... But Tian Long's on a path to the Central Kingdom after this. If any royals from your kingdom come aboard without the proper procedures, it would violate our age-old treaties.\" She whispered: \"They might consider you a spy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade threw her arms out, smile fading. \"C'mon. What kind of spy would wear this kinda clothing?\" She curtsied furiously, showing off her Emerald garbs. \"If I wanted to stay hidden, I'd dress in black!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-clothed prince kicked from beneath the shoe, desperate for attention. He called out: \"Indigo!... Sis! In here!\" - but every word came out muffled. The foot above him twisted, left and right. From the skies, his unaware captor spoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Where might your brother be? It's past time he appeared.\" She looked everywhere for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade thought for a moment, then shrugged. \"Probably hiding. He gets the jitters, you know? Always starts screaming and squirming when a princess visits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, the prince screamed and squirmed, trying his best to get either princess' attention. His world lifted- and <i>Slam</i>ed down again, keeping him firmly stuck to the weary skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then,\" Indigo bowed, \"I'll respect his wishes. Jun, please start the engines. We're leaving.\" She tugged at her assistant's sleeve, forcing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's face lit up. \"Ooh, enjoy your trip! I'll be down here, watching you lift off!\" She gave a thumbs-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering at the gesture, Indigo slowly mimicked it, as she stepped across the carpet and up the stairs. The handmaidens followed, flashing the same single-thumb salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>ThunkThunkThunk...</i> The steps, each feeling higher than the last, would have made Blake hurl - if he'd eaten before the spell shrunk him. His blood rushed to his head, even as his other senses grew numb. Thundering footsteps interrupted his racing mind. \"Leaving?\" <i>SLAM!</i> So that meant Indigo was walking inside that dragon airship! <i>SLAM!</i> He had to alert her - <i>SLAM!</i> - or one of the assistants - <i>SLAM!</i> - or she'd carry him with her back to - <i>SLAM!</i> - her country!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo slammed the carpets, traversing the hard wood. How dare they disrespect a potential suitor, after her whole castle had gone to so much trouble dressing her up for the occasion? She headed for her chambers. It had been a long day, and she wanted to be home as soon as possible. She sat on an elegant blue mattress, resting her tired buttocks on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure released from the prince's chest. He breathed deeply, regaining lost air - even if that meant taking in Indigo's less-than-clean odor. Almost as soon as the shaking from her steps stopped, another trembling began. A harsh rumble, like steam traveling through pipes, and gears twisting together in a clockwork rhythm. His sense of time faltered as he lay soaked in sweat, against a swampy insole. It may have been minutes or hours that he was in there. It should be too soon for them to lift off! And yet, the roaring became steadier and steadier, and the pressure change drastically. Tian Long, the dragon aircraft, had taken to the skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, something launched Blake upwards. He slipped slightly in the perspiration - but was too tightly compressed to move much. He flew back and forth, jerked around carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo kicked her legs as she read a book on etiquette, to occupy herself for the long voyage ahead. They had finally crossed out of the Topaz Kingdom's borders - and not a second too soon. She just wanted to forget the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, someone knocked at her door. Jun entered, holding her hands behind her. \"It's unfortunate that they were so disrespectful. But please, don't consider this journey a complete loss. I arranged a small trade deal before packing up.\" She revealed the cushion she stretched her feet on earlier, in midnight black. The footrest! The one that made her aching feet feel so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo clapped her hands together - then coughed, and regained her composure. \"Thank you. I look forward to the next visit.\" As Jun left, she giggled, wiggling her toes - and slowly slid them out from the confines of her tight footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken prince's spine dragged on the slick surface of the slipper. The princess' toes rocketed into the air, and onto the \"footrest\" once more. Having been subjected to her continual steps, he was a mere sticker on her sole. The titanic girl brushed her feet against the fabric, cooing in relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Blake grabbed a tiny loose thread. The massaging motions above peeled him off the foot, finally giving him a bit of fresh air. He gathered his spirits, looked up to the vast landscape of a woman, and shouted: \"Princess Indigo! Look here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge eyelids blinked. She glanced down. Her mouth went flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Indigo spoke:</span></div></div>",

B-but I'm not! I-I was on the pillow you were rubbing your feet on when you first arrived and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't matter what I think sir Blake.\" The Violet clad princess interrupted \"I have a feeling you weren't- wait... on the pillow? For how long?\" Indigo's face started to blush. Blake saw this and looked away, this was hardly the way to make a good first impression on a suitor and knew he should have fought harder to avoid a conversation like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-since... since you entered the courtyard. I was on the pillow the entire time.\" Indigo's eyes widened as she realized the button that was missing from the center wasn't a button but was actually Blake. PRINCE BLAKE. She had been rubbing her sweaty feet all over him! Thoughts raced through her head about how vile she must have appeared before the Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sir B-blake I-I had no idea you were on there and of your... a-affliction.\" The princess apologized profusely. \" I had no idea. I would never mean to hurt you. E-especially with... \" She pulled her feet away and Blake blushed, relieved he didn't have to be smothered under her hot foot flesh again but guilty he made the princess feel self-conscious about her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's fine your highness and ... I wasn't just on there but.. t-that's beside the point. There are no... hard feelings.\" Indigo's gaze grew more concerned and more defensive at the prince's point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean you weren't just on the pillow? Is that not how you got here?\" Blake blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... it..... it's not. When you were finished with my... cushion I was stuck to your feet. I ... was plastered to your foot, your highness.\" Indigo's face reddened more than before as she reached over and started to fan herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great... I stepped on my suitor...\" Indigo mumbled to herself, Blake could see she was struggling with this. She sighed and looked back at him. \"Well... I'll try to figure out a way to get you home Prince Blake. It will save us a lot of headache if the rest of the crew don't know you're here. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, not really. Why can't they know I'm here? I think it would be best if I had more people to... help me.\" The violet princess sighed heavily and reached a hand down to scoop up the tiny prince. She carefully gestured for him to climb on. Blake hesitantly agreed and she lifted him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We passed your borders already. If my crew find you here they must obey Topaz law and... well... hold you as a prisoner until they can set a court. They could believe you to be a spy and I fear my parents may assume the worst. They believe superstitious nonsense and I have no doubt they would warp this into some prophecy of some sort due to your affliction. I'm certain there is a logical explanation for this but... you have to trust me, Prince Blake.\" Blake looked up to her town-sized face and blushed. There was not much else he could do so, for now, his suitor was his only way to get home. And if what she said was true, it seemed like she was the only one who would want to help. Just then Both the princess heard a knock on the door!</span></div></div>",

He is sealed in darkness and is immediately thrown about as Indigo's giant muscle wakes and salivates under him. Spit soaks his royal garments, coated in another secretion of the princess. Having been around Jade, she had told Blake he would eventually swap spit with another princess, but this is the farthest thing Blake had expected. Blake blushes and wiggles trying to avoid his gross fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Indigo! Let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Indigo. I thought heard you conversing with someone. Is everything alright?\" Indigo blushes as she feels the tiny prince wiggle uncomfortably in her mouth. Her senses lit up with different pleasurable and unique flavors, the most prominent ones being sweet licorice and sweaty lavender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake feels Indigo's giant tongue pause and hears the muffled voice of a stranger outside. He now understood why Indigo has tossed him in here, but that doesn't mean he has to like it. He blushes and tries to wiggle and right himself into a more comfortable position. The spongey tongue writhing beneath him. Then something unexpected happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, what? Oh no, I was just... talking... to myself,\" the princess replies with a mouthful. She tries to move her tiny acquaintance in her mouth around without hurting him, attempting to move him under her tongue, but seemingly failing as the prince struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming voice of the princess rings across Blake's ears and he hugs his head tightly to drown out the loud voice. Her voice was all around him. One wrong slip and the princess' entire being would be literally all around him. Indigo's tongue tries to keep pulling the tiny Prince down towards the bottom of her mouth as she fidgets to try and act calm. Blake, however, is the least bit calm and tries to push her tongue away. However, the massive plush yet firm muscle easily punishes the young prince and forces him under the tongue. Blake groans in disgust and is pressed into the bottom of the princess's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun notices something writhing within the princesses mouth and grows curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady... are you... eating something,\" Jun asks unsure of what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Jun. I uh... it was a treat the prince's sister gave me. I-I should have told you. My apologies.\" Blake groans and braces himself again as Indigo speaks. Jun eyes the princess suspiciously. </span></div></div>",

A world of shifting blue and peach tones engulfed the shrunken boy, cutting off all signs of light. He landed snugly, blushing furiously, in pale cloth that bound her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lump caught in Indigo's neck, and traveled under Blake's body. \"Everything's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun entered, turning her neck. \"I heard voices...\" Ornaments on the door reflected light over the princess' pool-sized eyes. The dark irises twitched nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe folding, swaying fabrics partly muffled the soft voice. But as soon as it reached them, the girl in blue stood straight. Blake could tell; even when secured by the undergarments, Indigo's buoyant bosom bounced enough to toss him up. The breast mountains sloped at a vertical angle. He slipped down their slick surface, towards the cleavage. He gripped for support, but couldn't get a hold on the surface. This noblewoman obviously took good care of her skin. It was unblemished; felt silkier and smoother than her dress; and had the same fragrant lavender lotions coating it. His friction was practically nonexistent against her tracts of land. The boy was sliding backwards towards an enormous cloth bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo coughed. \"I was simply... Practicing public speaking.\" It wouldn't have been audible to anyone normal-sized; but inside her elegant clothes, her racing heart was an earthquake to the little thing. His tiny body brushed along the sensitive curve of her gland. It tickled. She fidgeted, curled her fists, subtly rolling her immense neck and round shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady, you're tense.\" The older woman patted her on her ribbon-decorated hair, her eyes shut. \"I know this is embarrassing, but please understand that it wasn't your fault. Prince Blake was simply shy. No amount of dialogue would have brought you together.\" She pointed to the cushion. \"Maybe you'd like to have a longer massage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple act of a servant touching Indigo jolted her stowaway more. \"No - AURGH!\" He bounced off the mound, slammed against an ornate embroidery. Then, his black-clad legs slipped into her cleavage. The dark crevice ate him up, covering him in moisture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTight walls limited his movement. Mounds of skin blocked his visibility and filled his senses. Before him, a damp cloth kept him in place. But at the same time, it didn't feel sturdy. He was already slippery with the girl's foot sweat. Indigo's twitches, breaths, even her heartbeat made the humid microcosm quiver, loosening and contracting. Ever second was more humid, sweltering, and unstable. There was nothing under him but the hundred-foot-long drop down her massive, flat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't possibly imagine what this gaping cavern would look like at normal size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young noblewoman's forehead went white, then red. The rushed, uneven motion in her chest became worse. Goosebumps popped up over her. \"No - NO - no thank you, Jun... It's fine, I just need time to read...\" She squeezed her arms together, resisting the urge to swat the squirming speck. The wet surfaces pressed together, holding Blake between them - and sending jolts through her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer servant rubbed the girl's thin shoulders, feeling around the joints and kinks. \"It's not a problem, Your Highness. Please, relax.\" She smiled, moving her thumb deep into her. \"Let that little prince go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake yelped. \"D-don't let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo quivered. She fidgeting away from the touch, trying to keep the mini passenger out of view - but too worried to make sudden motions. \"Let's not discuss him...\" She began reciting poetry under her breath to focus, and bear with the overwhelming tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom either side of the tiny boy, the walls came crashing together. The simple motion buried his face in an avalanche of tit, choking him and cutting off every trace of light. Her quivering arms sloshed her boobs upwards and downwards, grinding and mashing his torso deeper into the marshmallow trap. He pushed against the skin, desperate for air - but knowing that too much movement might reveal him... Or have him drop to his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivers traversed Indigo's spine. That bite-sized prince slipped into her bra... The delicate touch of his hands tickled her. But if she moved too much, he'd fall. She mumbled in annoyance: \"My breasts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun leaned into her eat. \"Pardon me? Your chest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, the princess waved her hands. \"...Y-yes! This dress is almost as uncomfortable as my shoes! It's...\" She used the opportunity to jump away. \"...It's too tight!\" She pulled on the opening, itching at the ribbons that gave it form - careful not to rub too hard, or pulverize her tiny passenger. \"I must be excused to the changing room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it rattled him to the core. Again and again, the doughy surfaces kneaded him. The pressure was starting to make him light-headed, and the constant twisting turned his stomach in knots. He tried to stay stiff, not wanting to alert the gigantic handmaiden. But the continually-shifting landscapes and immense drops of sweat made him budge. It was getting hard to hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scanned the blue designs, tilting her head sideways. \"It was specifically fitted for you, and woven by ten women from specially-picked silk.\" She pointed to the stars decorating it. \"I know you struggle with our nation's traditions. But you should wear these garments with pride. Many people's wishes are in those stars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped. \"I wish I were anywhere else...\" The heart behind him pounded quicker. Along with the shifting forces of spongy tissue, the heat wasn't helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant felt her charge's forehead, with a concerned look in her eyes. \"You're warm, your Highness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling side to side, Indigo tried for another excuse. \"I'm not... I mean... Yes! Warm!\" She grabbed a paper fan hastily, and waved it to her neck with a twitching hand. \"We must be moving through a high pressure system!\" The princess paused, rolling her fingers nervously around the handle. \"I need hydration. Please bring me juice from the storage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant fanning motion from her arm slightly wiggled Blake. He clutched tightly to the soft breast, wishing he had some kind of belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA discouraged frown crossed Jun's face. She brushed Indigo's bangs with the side of her hand. \"Very well. But if you feel the need to confide anything, I'll be here.\" Her arms stretched out. She hugged her princess' petite body. Their tits pressed against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo turned pale. She felt like dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned purple. He felt like he <i>was</i> dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne pair of smothering boobs was enough. Now, this boy was sandwiched in a puffy, bulging hell of two sets of towering tits. Jun's steady pulse throbbed in his ear, joining Indigo's hurried heartbeat. The heat from two bodies joined to absolutely steam him, making his vigor drain. All his struggling and squirming only succeeded in moving the silky curtains that formed Indigo's dress' collar; giving him an even more intimate experience with the older woman's heaving bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole time, he'd thought the princess' chest to be the largest thing he'd ever seen. Vast, meaty mountains that easily pushed him around. But what he experienced atop him in that moment... It made the boy speechless. Looming, milky orb as far as his vision stretched. Cotton hills and valleys shivering with tension, trying to hold in the bursting mega mammaries. Every subconscious sway of her torso mashed him flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jun were this big, either of the meteoric boobs could easily squish Topaz Castle flat. And create earthquakes strong enough to turn neighboring villages to rubble. In this incredible force, and dizzying trembles, Blake had no options but to sit tight and hope for it to end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopaz Castle was in a state of emergency. Claire called out over and over for her son; and nobody answered. Guards scoured the kingdom for clues of his whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the heart of the storm, Jade fluttered the throne room, holding tickets. \"Mom, I'm gonna borrow the carriage to the concert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until we find your brother, nobody travels in or out!\" The queen declared. She pondered, forehead in her glove. \"If only we could find Blake's cushion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perky princess shrugged. \"The black pillow? One of Indigo's maids took it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's jaw fell agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade put a finger to her mouth. \"Weird, though... She called it a footrest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire screamed internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said, 'Princess Indigo will adore using it for massages!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire screamed externally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in green skipped out. \"Whatever, I'll just ask my friend for that carriage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son... B-Blake... foot massages...\" The ruler sputtered, slumping into her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div class=\"bquote\">Within Queen Claire's Imagination:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Blake begged, on his tiny hands and knees, dirty and worn from work. \"Please, goddess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Indigo squinted down at him from a spiked throne, cackling and sipping wine. \"Prisoners don't get breaks! If you want to live, little man... worship my big, smelly feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former prince wailed, as the sadistic giantess rubbed her filthy soles on him. \"Mommy! Help!\"</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shouted: \"Grey! Dale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe advisors sprung in, saluting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That princess kidnapped my son! She's escaping in that awful steel dragon! Bring him back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey brushed his mustache. \"If we attack openly, they could hurt him. We'll need someone stealthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale nodded sagely. \"Luckily, I know a good bounty hunter. A girl in red...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jun pulled away from the hug, walking to the storage room - leaving Indigo blushing and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the... most embarrassing experience... of my life... Is she losing it?\" She took a long breath, feeling her chest deflate. \"I hope we can clear this up soon... Prince Blake?\"</span></div></div>",

The minuscule motions rolled him from her underwear to beneath her dress. He thrashed about, trying to escape from the plush posterior - hands sinking helplessly into the fine blue silk. Every way he threw himself, he hit part of the gorgeous princess' landscape tush. Constellation patterns extended as far as the eye could see, gracing her body with an even greater sense of scale. The astronomical ass squeezed its tiny victim frame into the Crab Nebula, as the behemoth sighed, stretching her legs out into the courtyard. Pillowy folds of muscle dragged the puny prince over rolling fields of black cushion; like clothes through a wringer, the two surfaces forced pressure on either side. He struggled for a small breath of sweet courtyard air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep breaths. Indigo gazed at her sandals, tilting them side to side. Then her head pointed at the large, oaken entrance. She tapped her fingers on the castle floor. \"Perhaps... he's preparing a present.\" She turned to a handmaiden, the ribbons on her hairbuns flowing like waves. \"Jun, could you please retrieve my tools?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minuscule twist of her waist ground Blake deeper into the cushion. Her voice reverberated around him, powerful and steady. He shouted: \"I'm - I'm down here! Be-beneath your... uh...\" His words were lost in space; a flex interrupted him. \"...Tools?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another invention?\" Jun unfolded her hands, and pointed to the dark-haired women that had followed them in, holding all sorts of gifts. \"The Lee are already displaying contraptions and automatons that will amaze His Majesty Heart. What could Your Majesty desire to build for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo shook her head. \"It's... for me. Building something will help my nerves.\" Her back stiffened, and she shifted her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pull off her muscles scooped Blake between the cheeks. Even the delicate rear of a slender, fair maiden had greater strength than his whole body - twisting his tiny limbs in their quest for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun bowed, and made a quick sign to two other servants - who began fanning the princess. \"Please, relax. His Majesty Heart is probably just as stressed as Her Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery twitch and pound from Indigo pushed Blake with increased harshness. The continual shifts drive him deep into the silky fibers, brushing him from star to star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess rubbed her backside on the pillow, kneading the fabric beneath her. Droplets of sweat trickled over her made-up forehead. Relax. Deep breathing, like her parents taught her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inhale...\" Blake lay stuck to her rising rump, pulled up into the air, little feet dangling hopelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Exhale.\" As the blue-blood released her wind, her muscles relaxed - and her rear slammed down onto the shrunken teen, sending his own wind rushing out of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attempts at meditation did very little to calm down the miniature prince!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant finally returned, her steps silent even to Blake's tiny ears, carrying an unornamented wooden box. With the flick of a switch, she set it on the ground; it unfolded with three clicks. The gears locked, making the box a workbench. Blake noticed a little change in the princess' heartbeat, like something clicking inside her. She grabbed the wrench from the case, twisting it against scraps of steel and copper. Her almond eyes turned to blueprints on parchment, adorned with shorthand characters at junction points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready lost in the nuts and bolts, the raven-haired girl needed a moment to tug herself away from her tinkering. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her Majesty still appears uncomfortable.\" Jun started preparing a second smoothie. Just the noise made Blake's mouth water. He found himself slowly opening his lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And receiving a mouthful of perfumed silk when the princess shifted in her seat again. She pushed a delicate hand against her blue-class backside, clicking here tongue. \"I'm just not used to dresses without pants underneath. It feels like I'm sitting on a zipper or a jewel...\" Her rump ground into the cushion again, landscapes of fabric molding around her massive curves - with a little boy caught in between. \"...It's still there, no matter how I move.\" With no result, she leaned over her workbench once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me!\" Blake swing his fists anew, vying for attention in his soft, squishy prison. \"You're feeling me!\" Amid punches, he tried to catch his breath - no small feat with the weight of a mountain on top of him. The thin outfit allowed him to feel an uncomfortable amount of skin underneath, his hands and legs sinking into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun loomed, putting the mixer aside. \"Indigo... Has Her Majesty ever contemplated the Western tale of the Princess and the Pea?\" She re-did a loosening knot in the shorter girl's hair ribbons. \"The prince rejected many suitors, until one girl came to stay on a rainy night, claiming she was a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo kept hacking away. The noises rang through the shrunken boy's ears. Each twist of a cog twisted him as well. She groaned softly as the little prince kicked - and rolled back, flattening him once more under the mass of muscle. Something still itched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when she awoke, she complained that she tossed and turned in the night, because she felt a pea underneath her mattresses. They knew she was a suitable princess for marriage, due to how sensitive her skin was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo fidgeted in her seat, unable to find a comfortable spot. She kept cranking her device, adding new components. Her painted brow furrowed. Slowly, her pace grew quicker, her motions wilder- dragging Blake along with each thrust of her sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...\" Jun finished, \"they hid a pea under Her Majesty's cushion, as a test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl paused, twisting her device around. \"Hm. If anything, I'd assume thick skin was best for a public figure.\" She eyed the knobs and curves of the machine, tapping it carefully. \"Strange customs, to discomfort a visitor so much... Whether she was a princess or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake groaned from the continual, crushing pain. Why did he have to go ahead with the reception - in THIS state? If he were in his princely clothes, he might have had a brooch to prick the gigantic butt tormenting him; but in his pajamas, he was weak, exposed, and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surface around him was smooth enough that he felt almost able to squirm out from the mass above, But when he crawled towards the courtyard light, the kneading movements from above undid his progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, brushing the bangs from her forehead, Indigo lifted herself up. The prince remained glued to her seat for a moment, before he dropped to the pillow below. A weak noise fluttered up: \"...Ow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking notice, Indigo turned - the movement looked like a curtain opening on a stage. Blake found himself stared down directly by her piercing eyes for the first time. They sucked all his words out, as she analyzed the pillow. The size difference magnified every pore of her skin several times over. Finally, she leaned over, and began patting the cushion. When the folds moved, she finally saw the prince, sprawled out, hair all messy, with traces of fabric coating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally spoke: \"...Prince Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis aching back lifted up, and he performed a small bow. \"At your service, Princess Indigooooooh...\" With a load moan of pain, he fell to the pillow. At last, she'd noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo looked away, covering her mouth. \"I... Formally apologize. I'm not used to these encounters - I kept thinking I had to study harder, or just have patience...\" She brushed the side of his bruised cheek, the massive hand slightly tilting his neck. \"I hope my error does not tarnish the bonds of our families.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pleasant smile, Jun patted her on the head, followed by tapping Blake. \"Don't be embarrassed. This may just be a pleasant story for your majesties' children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake went red. \"Ch-children? B-b-but... I can't...\" He gulped, the jaw-dropping frame around him not helping his jitters about relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, please, Jun.\" Indigo seemed red, too. \"We must first deal with the matter of the Prince's stature. Within that... moment of weakness...\" She shut her huge eyes, showing the lashes. \"...I designed a device that could restore him to normal. Hopefully, this can make it up to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unveiled what she was working on. It was a cylinder, looking like a firecracker, with dented sides and a string. The bronzed surface caught in the sun's reflection, casting a ray of light on Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun held her hands behind her back. \"If I'm not mistaken, most of these hexes can be reversed with true love's kiss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, a sly smile crept across the teenage princess' face; for once, the introvert appeared truly excited about something. She looked right at Blake. \"Our kingdoms not interfere with magicians, and magicians should leave our kingdoms alone. Whatever the person who cursed you wants, I refuse to comply. You will not play into her hands.\" She held a finger on the string, apparently the growth machine's trigger. \"Our nations, our marriage, they don't matter at this instant. What matters is that we show this enchanter who the boss is. We need no magic spells or enchanters to decide our destinies. We will forge our own happy endings from blueprints and steel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that oration, Blake stood, stunned. She seemed really set on showing up that witch. Did she have some kind of grudge against them?... Well, he had no reason to worry. After all, he wasn't a magician. He lifted his tiny hands up, and smiled. \"Thank you! Please, grow me back to normal size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're all set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo pulled the string, and released the cylinder to the ground with a <i>clunk</i>. The servants took a step away. Smoke poured out in shades of red, blue, and purple, making Blake cough. Something changed over his body, creeping up his spine and through his bones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, Blake saw the results of the invention:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been quite the adventure for Blake Heart, the shy and timid mage. Getting himself shrunken after a deal with the spirits was far from what he'd planned that fateful day -- enduring the stomps of unaware students' shoes, tossed from one oblivious girl's cleavage to another's hair, and even following one girl's meal...the whole way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps the greatest challenge for Blake was confessing his romantic feelings to Aria Gleam, the beautiful, wonderful girl he'd been crushing on since middle school. While difficult, he managed to pull it off after getting her attention. Under her caring, accepting gaze, it took very little time for the ghosts' spell to wear off, returning Blake to normal size (but also costing him his superhuman durability).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple dated for a good few years, until Blake decided he wanted to tie the knot. Kneeling before Aria in front of New Opal's marble fountain, the dark-haired young man pulled out a diamond ring and asked for his love interest's hand in marriage. With an eager \"Yes!\", the two were engaged to one another, getting married by the next summer. Some months after their sacred vows, Aria gave birth to a daughter -- she and Blake agreed to name their child Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, a new generation of adventure began, with Ember now in her teen years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember, I'm going food shopping!\" Aria called to her daughter. \"You and your father stay out of trouble, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Mom!\" Ember smiled...with crossed fingers behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father, Blake, was napping on the couch in the family room -- a tiring week of engineering had taken a lot of energy out of him. He figured it was  quite fortunate for Ember to have gained magic powers at adolescence. And man, was he dead wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiptoeing up close to her snoozing father, Ember whispered a chant in the mages' language...</span></div></div>",

She finished her chant as her hands began to glow with power, and she hovered them over her father's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was a magical prodigy.  Her father had figured that she may not ever develop magic powers considering her mother did not have any, but boy was he dead wrong.  In her early teen years, she began developing abilities to a degree her father could only dream of.  By age 11, she was more powerful than he was, and now the comparison was merely laughable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Blake was proud.... for a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>When mom's away, Ember will play!</i> she thought to herself, sniggering.  Funny how the non-magical parent was the only one who could keep her in line.  Her father was her go-to guinea pig for her magical experiments or the butt of her magical hijinx for when she was feeling playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with her mom gone, it was time to shrink him.  One of her favorite spells, not to use on herself of course, but one she didn't use that often.  Since she liked it so much, perhaps it was time to start using it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber shook her head as her father peacefully snoozed away even as the spell's effects began to work.  She pushed a strand of blue hair from her bangs behind her ear, a streak of dye running through her naturally dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a hand on her hip and jutted it out, smirking as Blake passed below three feet.  Thoughts passed through her head about what she could do today.  She looked down at her black foam flip-flips.  Her toes were feeling a bit lonely; perhaps they could use a companion?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the process was almost complete, Blake finally woke up.  In his bleariness, he noted that everything was bigger than normal and his sense became alert as a result.  There was a monolithic figure looming over him, and his field of vision allowed him to see something.  A red shirt that revealed cleavage and an exposed midriff, and a well-manicured hand resting on the hip of the exposed midriff.  Large breasts, very large breasts that strained against the shirt barely able to hold them in. A skirt that ended rather quickly to some long legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to look at her face to know who it was.  The exposed midriff and cleavage with that red shirt was Ember's signature look, and there was no one else who could've done this to him involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daughter loomed over him, but the question was: what did she plan to do with him?</span></div></div>",

The features of his face, his peaceful expression, his clothes, the way his chest rose and fell with his breathing; her hungry gaze took it all in, for soon he would not be there anymore. Well, he would be. Just not as he was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips, curled up into an overjoyed smile, softly parted as they released the last word needed to finish the spell. The enchantment complete, the teenage girl watched with eyes wide as Blake was consumed head-to-toe in a wash of light. She watched the figure of her father begin to shrink, his arms, legs and head slurped up into his depleting chest, till all that was left was a tiny orb sitting in the middle of the coach. Then the light faded, revealing to Ember her parent\u2019s new form: a squire of gum wrapped up neatly in a white sheet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d done it. She\u2019d actually done it! Her dad was candy! What had once been a person so familiar to her, one who she truly loves with all her heart, was now nothing more than a sweet. A treat to enter a dripping maw, to please taste-buds and to entertain teeth, to disappear down a yearning throat and to plop into needy belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in this case, <i>her</i> needy belly. Though not needy out of hungry, but instead needy of the thrill of swallowing her father. Of taking him into her, of surrounding him entirely, of <i>digesting</i> and adding <i>him</i> to <i>her</i>, turning him into an indistinguishable glob of flab somewhere on her body. Would he end up bouncing on her ass or on her breasts? Her rapturous mind pondered, and both options made her shiver. She <i>needed</i> him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking with excitement, she reached down to pluck up the piece of Blake-candy, taking it gently between her fingers. She dropped him carefully into the palm of her other hand, and took a seat on the now-vacant couch as she examined her conquest. Taking great care not to damage her treat, she pulled away his covering with her nails, eager to see his true being. The sight did not disappoint her: her father\u2019s form was a thick, supple slab of the juiciest red gum she\u2019d ever seen! Her already watering mouth kicked saliva production into overdrive, forcing her to swallow down the ensuing flood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward, she closed the distance between her mouth and the gum, until her lips were maybe an inch or two away from the sweet. Then she spoke in a playful tone, purposefully pushing out her hot breath so it would wash over her soon-to-be snack. \u201cImpressed, daddy?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Trying to yell up, he was shocked to discover that no sound would come out, leaving only one other means of communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmber!!\u201d Blake yelled through telepathy. \u201cWhat did you do to me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber couldn\u2019t stifle a playful giggle. \u201cI turned you into gum, silly! And now you\u2019ll be heading into my cute little tummy!\u201d She lowered her gum to her exposed midriff and patted her belly with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you can\u2019t be serious! Change me back, NOW!\u201d Despite his anger at his daughter, Blake was actually quite terrified about what she was about to do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber raised her helpless father back up toward her lips. \u201cSorry, daddy, but you\u2019re in no position to protest. In you go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, the girl tossed Blake into her open mouth, the salivating tongue already coating the poor piece of gum in her spit. Surprisingly, however, Ember didn\u2019t feel the urge to chew on her father \u2014 the slippery tongue abruptly flicked Blake into the darkness of his daughter\u2019s throat, swallowed with a swift gulp. Ember used a finger to trace her treat\u2019s descent down her neck, past her chest, and into her depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slid down the tight esophagus before finally falling through a small sphincter and landing with a wet plop in his daughter\u2019s stomach. It was hard to see much in here, and it smelt of cereal and strawberries. The walls pulsated steadily, and a greenish lake of acid bubbled nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Blake blacked out as his sweet body started to digest, and his consciousness would become trapped in Ember\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

A part of her couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d done what she had just done \u2013 turned her beloved father into a simply piece of candy and swallowed him down so easily. She had expected her conscience to stop her from carrying out her wicked little scheme. To talk her down as she hovered over her sleeping father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet in the end, it turned out unable to hold back the dark thrill that boiled up inside her. Every time she thought about it, her heart boomed with a level of excitement she\u2019d never felt before. And as she stared across his napping form, it soared into a thunderous rhythm that filled her entire body with a wondrous warmth and drowned out any uncertainty or doubt. She <i>had</i> to have him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And now I do</i>, Ember mused with a soft glance down at her midriff. It had quietened down now, clearly finished processing it\u2019s impromptu snack and handed it down for absorption. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what Blake was going through within her. She pictured him spinning, churning, sloshing about within her busy stomach, helpless against the digestive tides in his little gummy body. Her slimy sack mashing him down with all it\u2019s might into a more absorb-able state, before pumping down into her eager intestines. There, the walls would caress and squeeze as they took all that they wanted from him; and if those walls were anything like their master, that would be <i>everything</i>. Then all that was left was to distribute what was taken. He would rush through her veins, powerless against the current, to be used in whatever way his daughter\u2019s body saw fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber\u2019s heart was beating faster than ever as her daydream came to an end. \u201cOh, daddy\u2026\u201d She purred with burning cheeks, and gave her tummy a few loving pats. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>sooooo</i> good to me\u2026 I love you <i>sooooo</i> much.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her heart was quite quick to calm into a steady beat, the heat that had spread throughout her entire being refused to calm down with it. Some teasing words and a fantasy were not nearly enough to sate it. It demanded more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, hazily, Ember reached an unsteady hand down. Down past her belly. Down towards-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmber\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s voice seared through Ember\u2019s frenzied mind like a hot knife through butter. The teenager very nearly rocketed off the coach in fright \u2013 though said fright came less from the clear anger in the telepathic call, and more from the situation she had very nearly been caught in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-O-OH! H-Hi, daddy! Ha-ha, ha\u2026 Fi-Finally settled inside my c-cute body, huh?\u201d Ember said as she tried to save face. Her smile was clearly slapped on in a haste, it\u2019s corners faltering and flickering, and her voice failed her too, sounding less like a woman in complete control and more like a girl who had almost been caught-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desperate Ember interjected before her father had the chance to say anything about anything. \u201cN-No! No, no! Don\u2019t tell! L-Let me find out for myself\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quiet incantation, a magical light encased the tip of her index finger. It was an easy-to-learn spell meant originally for dowsing, but could be easily tweaked to seek out other things; such as this variation, which sought out souls. Ember hovered her finger around her body, dowsing herself for wherever her father\u2019s soul had ended up, until finally the spell glowed as bright as possible above Ember\u2019s\u2026  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, well this just looks delicious! And this, and this! Oh, but a girl can't eat too much... I wouldn't want to ruin my wonderful figure... guess I'll just have to pick and choose.\" The demoness mused to herself as she pawed through the contents of Blake's family's well-stocked kitchen. Eventually the tall, curvy, crimson-skinned woman decided upon several containers positively heaped with food. But as she neared the dinner table where Blake's family traditionally ate, her eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say, those chairs look awfully unappealing. Maybe fit for a bunch of mortals, but a woman of my stature deserves something more... fitting.\" Gathering her magic in her hands, she pointed at the chair closest to her. Swirling lights surrounded the previously unassuming chair before transforming into a richly-padded, high backed throne fit for a queen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to turn that back to normal, right? It doesn't really fit with the rest of the kitchen, and it kind of... takes up a lot of space.\" And Blake's words were absolutely true- the demoness had finished rearranging the kitchen furniture, and she was left at the head of the table with her magnificent throne, while all the other chairs had been shoved up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why would I ever bother with that? This is MY house, now. It may not be much right now, but just wait a week and I'll have a castle fit for a queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped, he really didn't like the sound of that. But there was nothing he could right now, stuck as he was in the rock-solid abdominal muscles of the demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, even if he'd tried to argue with her, she wasn't in any mood to talk with him- not when she was practically drooling over the food laid out in front of her. Before Blake could so much as make a sound, Scarlet tore into the first container, a covered bowl filled to the brim with spaghetti. The demoness squirmed in delight at the taste, relishing each and every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed, and Scarlet neared the end of the bowl. Blake could hardly believe she'd eaten it all so quickly- sure Scarlet was a tall, rather well-built (if how toned her abs and thighs were was any indication) woman, but she shouldn't have been able to devour it all so quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, hee hee hee! *Urp.* Oh my, excuse me!\" The demon cooed, running one hand over the warm, bare flesh of her stomach. Blake tried desperately not to think about how good it felt, having her run her hand over his location on her midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey... that was a lot of Spaghetti... but you're done now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close, mortal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the demoness practically tore the top off a box of pizza and lifted the first cheesy slice to her plump, ruby-red lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, hold on a moment... there we go!\" Even down in his fleshy prison Blake felt the sudden surge of magic energy, focusing on the slice of pizza in Scarlet's hand. The previously cool slice of pizza was soon perfectly reheated, as hot as if the box had just been received from the delivery guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went, the demoness reheating each slice of pizza, downing it slowly and savoring each and every bite, while Blake could only groan and squirm. Scarlet may've had a naturally big stomach stomach, but during the demoness's pizza binge the organ reached the point where it was completely filled to the brim. But even then, Scarlet showed no signs of stopping, and every new addition would stretch her tummy just a little further, swelling it bite by bite, piece by piece. Every so often, the demoness's free hand would glide down her middle, caressing her overfilled tummy. Blake wished that he didn't get pleasure from this, but his prison was so tight, so stretched that her pats and rubs were the only things capable of lessening his torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that hit the spot. Its been <i>ages</i> since I last had pizza! Mmm... I just want to curl up and take a nap now!\" Stretching like a cat, Scarlet took a moment to playfully pat her slightly-bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough, mortal? Because my stomach is plenty stuffed! You must be feeling the pressure in there!\" And that was certainly true- you were feeling like you were being squeezed and pressed down on by all sides, as if a vast amount of weight was somehow wrapping you up completely. You groaned out to your captor to relent, to show mercy- even a little more of this and you were going to feel like you were being completely crushed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you look like you're in pain... too bad for you, your torment hasn't ended yet!\" Scarlet cackled, tugging a big box of donuts over to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...wait. Those are... for my mom's... office party!\" You gasped out, having to exert more energy to form the words thanks to the pressure in the demoness's distended belly forcing the surface area of her abdomen that you occupied to stretch apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this now? Backtalk? None of that, mortal! Know your place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Whap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped in pain at the sudden harsh slap, despite how full her stomach was she hadn't had any second thoughts about giving you a firm slap. With her belly being both bare to the world and bulging slightly from her huge meal, her slap really stung. You couldn't do anything except whimper from the stinging sensation now spreading throughout your 'body.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the demoness, she didn't seem to be in any pain despite having slapped her own stomach, but a loud, unladylike belch tore from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beeelch* \"Oof, that was a tad louder than I was expecting... still, what were you thinking? Trying to order me around? You are the slave and I am the master! And if I want to eat something, you have no say in stopping me!\" The demoness smirked as she gave several smaller slaps to her tight tummy, relishing the feeling of you recoiling from each sharp pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you no longer interrupting her, Scarlet tore into the box of donuts. She cooed and groaned in delight as each new pastry entered her mouth- truly, it had been far too long since she'd last been able to indulge herself like this! Taking no time at all to devour the contents of the box, Scarlet sat back in her chair groaning in contentment. Her stomach was rounded and bulging out a little bit, evidence of her massive meal. Still, she'd restrained herself from going completely overboard- at least this way she only looked like she had a food baby, and not an actual baby in her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, this was the life! Scarlet smirked, pondering what to do with herself now. It had been so long since she' been summoned to the human world- she couldn't wait to see what had changed. And the foolish child who had summoned her hadn't set any failsafe's or precautions to keep her in check, meaning she was free to do as she pleased!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling another burp coming up, Scarlet stifled it with a hand and brought her other hand down to caress her stuffed, rounded stomach. The perfectly smooth surface (save for the concave of her belly button) was taut and unyielding to the touch, and she could still feel the pathetic mortal who had summoned her within. He was quiet now, likely trying to recover from the ordeal she had just put him through. Still absentmindedly stroking her bloated stomach, Scarlet hefted herself out of her throne as she made her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. An immortal demon like her has all the time in the world to do what she wants! Why not relax some more?<br>\r\n2. Eh, she should probably take precautions to prevent herself from being forcibly expelled from the human realm. Best check out that mage's room to make sure there's nothing that could be used against her in there.<br>\r\n3. Scarlet's plans for the future have met another interruption! Someone knocks on the front door to Blake's house!</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, his thoughts strayed into the mind of the demoness, who smirked at her abdominal prisoner\u2019s arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019re on board with that idea!\u201d Scarlet teased, rubbing her tummy some more before walking over to face her reflection in a nearby mirror. \u201cHold on tight, little man! Here I go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was unable to protest as Scarlet immediately began moving her midsection sensuously to the rhythm of imaginary Arabian music. Instead of painful rocking, however, the assimilated mage felt large doses of pleasure from the seductive motions of his hostess. He moaned in ecstasy throughout the dance - part of him didn\u2019t want this sensation to ever stop, but the other half begged desperately to have his physical body restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Scarlet concluded her belly dance with a taunting flex of her abdomen, which brought Blake out of his trance and back to reality. He wiggled and thrashed around, causing more little reverberations in the demonic flesh of his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit squirming in there, you!\u201d Scarlet demanded, slapping her gut and sending a jolt of pain through her captive. \u201cMaybe I should punish you for misbehaving...\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was so sudden and so bizarre that it honestly left the poor summoner feeling dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet of course giggled at her summoner's predicament and waited for his consciousness to right itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the world finally stopped shifting and the fog cleared, Blake was surprised to find himself in what appeared to be some kind of demonic gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Scarlet cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where exactly is here?\" Blake dare ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why my own personal gym of course.\" Scarlet answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Blake could gulp he would. From his perspective he could make out the crimson matts, the scarlet medicine balls, the maroon weights, and the orange jump ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the memory of what the demoness said earlier returned to him. \"You said you were going to work on your core muscles, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness smirked. \"Oh yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake began to tremble and the demon witch felt it. \"Is this gonna hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirk didn't fade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, how could you not see something like this coming, summoning all willy-nilly?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he hated to, Blake had to admit that was a good question. He had been banking so much on the idea of summoning someone benevolent, he hadn\u2019t even considered what he\u2019d do if he got someone malevolent. And now he was paying for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her finger free from her fleshy backside, Scarlet gave a mighty stretch, not unlike that of a cat, and advanced towards the bed, stepping over or shoving aside any ritual-displaced objects that got in her way, before she stopped and softly patted her rump again. \u201cNow hush up, will ya? A body like this needs a lot of beauty sleep to maintain!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Scarlet leaped ass-first towards Blake\u2019s disheveled bed, landing on the mattress with a mutted thud. Her plump cheeks spilled outwards at the impact, crushed between their master\u2019s weight and momentum and the fabric beneath her, with Blake mercilessly squished in the middle. The mage squealed in pain as he was compressed against his will inside the demonic flesh that was now his prison, and he was sure Scarlet heard it, and was relishing in it, as she ground her booty against the mattress for a good minute or so to annoy her passenger even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after she was satisfied with torturing the boy, Scarlet flipped herself over and came to rest upon her stomach, ass pointing up towards the ceiling. She wrapped her arms around a pillow and nuzzled her face into it, thoroughly enamored with it\u2019s palpable softness, for it was not often she got to enjoy the sensations of the human realm. It wasn\u2019t long before she felt her eyelids grow heavy, so she eagerly obliged, and, after loudly slapping her cheeks together to torment her prisoner one last time, quickly settled into a peaceful sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took a moment to review the situation, as well as to also recuperate from the beat down he had just received from his captor. \u201cScarlet?\u201d He asked, barely louder than a whisper, not really wanting to wake his tormentor. No response came, except for the demonness\u2019 gentle breathing as she slumbered. He was unsure if Scarlet was truly asleep, or if it was all just a ruse to get his hopes up so she could crush them right in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Blake took this moment of peace to begin brainstorming an escape plan. Using his magic sight to scan the room for his spellbook, he could not find hide nor hair of it. Had it been buried by the ritual\u2019s storm? He switched to a different spell, one used for sensing magic energies, and focused. The book, a treasure trove of spells, naturally reeked of magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was!\u2026 tucked deeply under his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. Oh how he wished the hadn\u2019t skipped practicing Telekinesis! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a loss, Blake bitterly mused on what to do now. He only knew a few spells from memory, and none of them would be any help getting free of this situation\u2026 except maybe\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, the summoning circle still crackled with remnant energy, just barely enough to reach out and beckon something forth once again. The enchantment was still fresh in his mind, word for word he still remembered it perfectly. Even being well aware of the dangers, Blake knew he had little choice, less he spend who-knows how long as this horrible creature\u2019s backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe concentrated, and began the incantation\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDammit!\u201d Blake thought as his focus failed for the umpteenth time. He had been trying to duplicate the summoning ritual for the last four hours only to be met with failure after failure. \u201cI don't understand, what am I doing wrong!?\u201d The young mage-turned-sentient demoness rump wondered. \u201cWhy isn't this working?\u201d He suspected that the innate demonic energies being given off by Scarlet were interfering with his own abilities.The former mage exhaled an exasperated breathe and slumped back, the action-given his current form-merely translated into the sleeping fiend\u2019s prominent, red backside jiggling a little bit, and prompted a snort from his dark captress. However, Blake\u2019s sigh was more figurative than anything else.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAt this rate,\u201d the boy thought, \u201cI\u2019ll be a this demon\u2019s fat ass for all of eternity!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of fat, Blake was struggling to come to terms with the recent chain of events. Just a few hours ago he was a young man, a mage with a bright future, now he was so much fat and tissue on the butt of a demon woman. He had noticed his body mirror haphazardly propped up against the wall near the foot of his bed, no doubt displaced by the maelstrom of magical energy released with the initial summoning. From his position he could see Scarlet and more importantly himself in its reflective surface. He could see himself, and yet it was not himself. Blake didn't see the face of a dorky guy with glasses, he saw a scantily leather-clad hellspawn with a-virtually bare-plump, rotund ass right where he should have been, sleeping on his bed. And he was very plump indeed. Scarlet\u2019s rear was enormous. He was enormous. Blake was always captivated by the female form, especially large butts, thick thighs and long legs, and Scarlet had all this including more in spades. She was gorgeous, and Blake hated himself for seeing her as such. Then he remembered that he was part of her, and that she took his life away. His attraction left him. He wondered just how many other poor souls had fallen for her deceptive good looks and met similar fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness had originally been shapely to say the least, but after consuming him, her already sizable, red buttocks had increased in size to resemble a pair of smooth, fleshy volleyballs, or even soccer balls. It made some sense, all things considered. All of his absorbed mass had to go somewhere, and though he was loath to admit it he was genuinely impressed that he had made the raven haired demoness\u2019 butt so big. So Why then was he not even bigger? Should not Scarlet now have an absurdly huge ass? She assimilated an entire person, should she not now have a person sized rear as a result? The fact that she didn't only proved to frighten the former boy. Perhaps whatever profane sorcery Scarlet had employed necessitated some of his previous biomass to be metabolized and converted into energy to power the tainted rite. If so then what was taken would be lost forever. What would happen if he was returned to normal? If it was at all possible. Blake did not like where his train of thought was heading so he decided to quickly change his focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the deathly silent darkness of his mess of a room, the only sounds he had were the subtle creaking of his bed springs whenever the creature he was joined with shifted in her sleep, and her gentle, eerily soothing breathing. The summoning circle even this long after the initial activation, cracked with residual energy. The nearby open window let in the cool air of the night, causing goosebumps to form over the demoness\u2019 flesh, over Blake. This was just too surreal for his liking. He was really an ass. A fat, massive ass. Two buttocks perfectly rounded. A smooth, deep cleft running between his halves which harbored a black-leather thong like garment that did little to protect the demon\u2019s modesty. Scarlet\u2019s arrowhead-tipped tail-a moderately lengthy, slender, whip of a thing-would occasionally flick in her sleep and either brush against Blake or nestle within the cleft of his new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake decide to test the extent of his current state of being. He began by attempting to manipulate some of the muscles in the thick mass of his new body, pulling and tugging at nerves that he used to only feel in one tiny part of his former self, but which now made up his whole existence. The most he could manage were subdued twitches and spasms, which sent slight ripples through his flesh. Or was it Scarlet's? At this point he was not sure where he ended and she began. The two were one and the same. He strained as hard as he could on the most prominent muscles that he could feel: those around what he now realized with a little thrill of disgust was Scarlet's anus. He cringed internally when he realized that if he concentrated hard enough he could cause the tight little muscular ring to twitch. Not wishing to explore any further he returned to the silence. All in all it was not so bad. Despite everything...it was oddly comfortable. Warm. Soft. Only he was what was warm and soft. Heat radiated off his bulbous form just like it did from the rest of the infernal woman\u2019s body. The quivers and quakes that would travel through now whenever his captress would move in just the right way made it feel as though Blake was laying on a water bed, though he was the water bed. He could just fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! What?\u201d He abruptly thought. \u201cWhat am I thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake did not know much about demons but the little knowledge he possessed on the subject revealed that many if not all breeds can feed of the souls of mortals, its where they attained their true nourishment. Scarlet didn't just assimilate his body, she was gradually gnawing away at his soul as well, and it was starting to affect his mind. Was this why he was feeling tired? Blake knew that if he did not act soon he risked having his very essence devoured by Scarlet\u2019s. He would be little more than inert booty meat! At the very least his mind could be warped into thinking that his current state was enjoyable and forget about ever being human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly fearful for his very existence Blake reached out, and recited the incantation, again and again, fueled by desperation. The summoning circle was on the verges of collapse, but with its final flicker it exploded into a brilliant, blinding flash of light. Jake recoiled back, praying that whatever he dragged through would help him, and not be a Scarlet 2.0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of The Ultimate Demon Witch, the demon lifted her head, the commotion jarring her awake. She squinted her dark eyes, still heavy with sleep, before realizing what was happening. \u201cSomeone's been a naughty butt.\u201d She chided the soul bound to her bottom, and gave her rump a sharp slap. \u201cUsing the summoning circle again?\u201d Scarlet spoke, \u201cDidn't you learn from the last time? What do you even hope to accomplish? Your mine now, nothing will--\u201d Scarlet\u2019s words died down as the light faded and the smoke cleared. And what she saw surprised her. The confident smirk forever on her lips disappeared in an instant as she sat up in bed to now rest her knees as well as Bake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was fair skinned, tall for a female, only somewhat taller than Scarlet. She had long golden hair, and a similar form and build to Scarlet\u2019s as well. The mysterious being was dressed in pure white, her ensemble comprised of a sleeveless top that exposed her midriff, a short skirt and gladiator like footwear. There was a dim aura of light around her. She looked around, obviously confused. \u201cI-is this the mortal realm,\u201d the being wondered aloud, \u201chow did I get here!?\u201d The angel turned around to face Scarlet and yourself. Her icy blue eyes snapping to attention when they met the black of Scarlet\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d The two otherworldly beings cried in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAliyah!\u201d Scarlet uttered under hear breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Ultimate Demon Witch: Scarlet.

She harshly drove a fist into the side of her thick buttocks. Causing the frightened boy within to cry out in pain. \u201cWhat did you do you wretched little fleshling?!\u201d Scarlet asked. She was livid. Who ever this Aliyah was, the demoness did not want to see her. \u201cOf all the things you could have called forth, you snag a Sentinel lieutenant? How can you even still use magic anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSentinel what's a Sentinel?\u201d Blake asked between blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're like knights only angels, and the one you summoned has been after me for a thousand years!\u201d Scarlet spat while still pummeling her mage infused ass. \u201cShe\u2019s just as powerful as myself, maybe more! This can get messy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome Ultimate Demon Witch you are.\u201d Blake laughed. \u201cMaybe she can get me out of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it!\u201d Scarlet barked before grinding her rump into the bed, crushing the hope out of her captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel observed the demon\u2019s bizarre display. She was was punching talking to herself. Talking to..her butt? A butt that was a lot bigger than the last time the crossed paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, demon? Who are you talking too?\u201d Aliyah asked before gasping in surprise. \u201cWait I sense another, a mortal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now You and Scarlet\u2019s turn to gasped, the latter focusing on the Sentinel before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s very close. He should be right here but...I don't\u2026\u201d Aliyah seemed very confounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet palmed her face, and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Seven Rings of Hell! You were always slow to connect the dots.\u201d She began. A cocky grin returning to her face as she spoke in a smug tone \u201cLet spare your dumb brain the trouble. There was a human here, yes. A mage in fact, He unwittingly summoned me here and as thanks I devoured him,\u201d Scarlet giggled, \u201cmind body and soul. And this...\u201d Scarlet moved on the bed until she was on all fours with her large back side mooning the lieutenant. She shook it mockingly at her adversary. \u201c...this thing of beauty is all that's left of him.\u201d She explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel took an offensive stance after hearing this. \u201cFoul creature! Release the human at once!\u201d Aliyah demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's too late for that even if I wanted to, which i don't, His body was used to fuel his transformation, what was left is now delectable Scarlet booty.\u201d Scarlet taunted. \u201cHis living soul is now bound to this right here!\u201d Scarlet capitalized this with a hard smack to her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf his soul is intact as you say, then he can be saved,\u201d Aliyah spoke, \u201cif you wont turn him over I\u2019ll just have to take him from you.\u201d She drew a short sword from a scabbard on her hip. The blade seemed to shine with a bright silvery light. \u201cYou got away every time we met before but not tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet stuck her tongue out at the angel, slapped her wide ass once more and leaped of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can try!\u201d Scarlet shouted to her enemy as a pair of bat wings sprouted from the middle of her back as she sailed out the nearby open window, Blake cried out in fear as they took flight. \u201cYou'll have to catch me first you skank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey! Get back here, you bitch!\u201d Aliyah cried out as a pair of white feathered, avian wings sprouted from her back before giving chase. \u201cScarlet!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of beating wings carried out over the cool night air. The people on the bustling city streets far below had no idea what was playing out over their heads as they went about their lives. Had one looked up, they may have seen what appeared to be a bat winged, red skinned woman desperately trying to lose a pale eagle winged woman wearing white tailing behind. None did however, as the demon and angel were lost so high up against the black, star dotted backdrop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah was having a hard time keeping up. She had no idea that the mortal world would have such an effect on her body. It felt as though she was moving through molasses, every wing beat demanding more effort than it normally would in the spirit world. She had few opportunities to visit the human world, she was not used to actually breathing, the chill of the air, or the pull of gravity. Her body was slowly acclimating to the sudden change of environment, but not fast enough to prevent her target from getting away, and with a captive soul no less. Still the angel urged herself on, determined as sweat began to form on her brow. She blinked the strange liquid from her eyes before reaching forth with her right hand, arm straight and palm upright before she closed her left eye and focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett cursed under her breath as she struggled to maintain the control of her flight. Normally flying came to one such as herself as naturally as swimming to a fish. She had grown accustomed to the world of the living and its physical effects on spiritual entities such as Aliyah and herself, having been summoned many times over the ages by ancient devil cults or would be magisters looking to dominate her and control her power only to be outwitted. Occasionally she was brought into the world by foolish youths with too much alcohol that thought it would be fun to dance around a bonfire and hold a satanic ritual in the woods. It did not matter as they all met the same fate: their souls consumed by the dark beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were such delectable morsels, human souls. Each one claimed increased her power. The stronger the soul the bigger the boost. Scarlett had developed quite the gluttonous appetite for them. It was narcotic. The more she fed, the more often she needed to do it. She once tore through a cult with the ravenous fury not unlike like that of a fat woman with an eating disorder turned loose at an all one could eat buffet. Each one has a distinct flavor. Sinners, those with wicked hearts, we\u2019re her bread and butter. Tasty, but standard fare. Equivalent to a cheap fast-food burger by human standards. Pure hearted souls were her favorite. The purer the better. It was such a delight to tempt them to fall to the dark just before their demise. Pure souls were like a savory sirloin steak one seldom dinned on. Virgins. They were the best a rare delicacy she rarely had the pleasure of feasting on. Such sweet, delicious things. The mage coalesced within her behind was such a rare commodity. Though her addiction may have figuratively bitten her in the ass. The energy she obtained by eating souls was stored in the form of extra weight on the fiend\u2019s body, and much to Scarlett\u2019s dismay she gained weight on her thighs and rump first, which were quite thick. Countless souls had gone into the making of her shapely, rotund behind. Her latest victim might have tipped the scales however as the mage riding in her caboose had caused her already prodigious backside to swell enough to seriously screw with her aerodynamic profile, throwing off her movement and balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething caught the demoness\u2019 attention. Scarlett saw it in the corner of her eye. A flash of white light somewhere behind her. She gasped and Instinctively rolled to her left as a bolt of bright energy whizzed by. The demoness looked back at the figure pursuing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa,\u201d she exclaimed while she clumsily attempted to level out of her barrel roll, \u201cyou missed, you self-righteous, big boobed sow!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah gritted her teeth before firing another bolt of shimmering light from her outstretched hand. Scarlett narrowly managed to veer out of its flight path. \u201cMissed me again!\u201d She teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for some time. Aliyah shooting potshots at her demonic counterpart, only for Scarlett to just manage barely to zig and zag out of the way before hurling insults which centered around Aliyah\u2019s oversized breasts which seemed to be a sensitive topic as the angel would sometimes crack and shout back obscenities insulting the demon\u2019s intelligence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese two are supposed to be powerful spirits?\u201d Blake thought as he was thrown this away and that with Scarlett\u2019s maneuvers. \u201cThey sound like two feuding high school girls.\u201d Blake could see that the angel was slowly catching up. But she seemed be struggling for some reason. He had been betting on Aliyah\u2019s help, but it occurred to him that if he did not do something Scarlett might get away and he would be stuck as her large butt for all of eternity, or at least until he broke and the demon\u2019s finishes metabolizing him. He had no idea how much time he had left. Maybe a week? A month? For all he knew he may somehow survive the ordeal only to truly become the living ass of the demon woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake needed to do something to prevent that outcome, but he was having such a hard time focusing his magical energies. Scarlett\u2019s body was still disrupting his own abilities, but he figured if he tried, he could manage...something. \u201cIt worked before!\u201d he thought. As the two women continued their aerial ballet, Blake focused on what little of himself remained. He did not know how his powers would manifest in his current form, but he had to try. Clearing his mind. Blake tried to perform a fireball spell. \u201cCome on. You can do this Blake.\u201d The sentient ass thought. Trying again Blake suddenly felt a brief surge of energy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d He exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase had moved to the skies over the cities industrial district. An area filled with many old factories and warehouses overlooking the harbor. Scarlett managed to evade yet another shot of energy from Aliyah. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Aliyah?\u201d Scarlett asked feigning concern, \u201cyou\u2019re usually so calm and focused. Getting tired? First time ever feeling tired? Yeah the mortal realm can do that to a girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever shut up, you idiot?\u201d Aliyah spat back. She fired another blast from her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoo!\u201d Scarlett squealed like a giddy school girl as she rolled out of the way. \"I think I'm getting used to the extra weight.\" She flipped over so that she was flying upside down and able to look directly at her foe. \u201cYour aim, it kind of sucks, hun? You really must not be used to this world, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah just growled in frustration as Scarlett stuck out her lounge and teased her. Scarlett laughed as she reoriented herself after diving under another shot from Aliyah. \"And I thought this would be difficult!\" Scarlett called out. She broke out into laughter and slapped her left but cheek as she prepared to lose the angel for good when without warning a large gout of flame erupted from between her plump buttocks. Scarlett eyes widened, and her mouth flew open in a silent scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Aliyah cried as she swerved out of the way of the large fire ball. \u201cD-did...she just...fart fire?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett looked back, face blushing as she noticed smoke and steam rising from between her but cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-the hell w-was that?!\u201d She said in disbelief. \u201cMage was that you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it!\u201d Her ass replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing? How can you even still use magic?\u201d Scarlett asked in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed ice crystals begin to grow over the surface of her wings and back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBringing you down! Don't know!\u201d The soul bonded to her rump answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett hissed as black flames emulated her entire body. Instantly removing the previously rapidly accumulating ice. \u201cTrying to freeze my wings, eh? Nice try Butt Boy!\u201d She mocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly enough energy for one more spell.\u201d Blake thought as he dug deep and put all he had into one last attempt to stall Scarlett. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness was suddenly enveloped in a shroud of electricity. She and Blake both shrieked in agony as the boy turned butt unintentionally electrocuted them both. \u201cDamn you, human!\u201d Scarlett said through clenched teeth as electricity racked her body. The field of electricity dispersed and Scarlett promptly fell towards the ground unconscious. \u201cThat did it...\u201d Blake thought as he began to black out, mana reservoirs depleted. He won\u2019t be able to help himself again. Not with his magic.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAliyah had caught up a bit, she saw the odd display play out in front of her. \u201cD-did the human...was he fighting back?\u201d She thought out loud. She paused in midair as she watched Scarlett's limp body nosedive until she smashed through the roof of one of the large rectangular structures, she believed the humans called a warehouse. Shaking her head, she snapped back to reality and descended towards the holed building. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few soft, milky feathers came loose from the angel\u2019s wings as she launched herself out the open window, in hot pursuit of the fleeing demon and her rear-end captive. They dance upon the gentle breeze as they dragged slowly downwards, and silently burst into fading particles of light when they landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, however, drifted a little farther than it\u2019s brethren. It danced a more energetic dance as it\u2019d descended, with tiny spins and flips and wide sways, till finally it came to a halt, making contact with the shoulder of a mysterious onlooker. They had paid no attention to the parting dance of the magical feather, nor to the feather\u2019s final parting itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes were locked upon the scene far above. Of an angel chasing after a demon, and, more interesting than that, of the boy trapped beneath red skin. The onlooker sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake Heart, what have you gotten yourself into?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet dove to the left as a blade of burning light cleaved through the air to her right. If she had reacted only a second later, there was little doubt she\u2019d have been cleaved in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Scarlet flipped herself over, turning to address her pursuer while flying upside down. \u201cThat\u2019s a new trick! Looks like someone\u2019s been training hard since our last encounter, hm?\u201d She taunted the angel with a smug smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah angrily bared her teeth at the demoness. Internally, she cursed herself. She couldn\u2019t catch up to Scarlet in her current state. Her body hadn\u2019t had the time needed to adjust to this mortal realm, and it wasn\u2019t helped in the slightest by the sudden strain of giving chase to her nemesis. Scarlet, on the other hand, obviously had been given the time to adjust, in addition to all the extra energy her prisoner was unwilling providing her with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new technique was the only option she had left. It cut through any evil, no matter how powerful, but it was simply too predicable and easy to avoid if your foe could see it coming. Had it hit her, Scarlet would surely have been dealt with and the human\u2019s soul freed. Now that she was aware of it, Aliyah knew she\u2019d need a miracle to actually land it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurrender yourself for cleansing this instant!\u201d Aliyah snarled, and swung her sword again, calling forth another blade of light towards the demon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet comically rolled out of the way of the attack. She put a finger to her lip in mock thought. \u201cI think\u2026 <i>not!</i>\u201d She sneered. She turning around and repeatedly slapped her ass at the angel. \u201cNah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah!\u201d A final shake of her rippling butt, Scarlet increased her speed, smirking as she put even more distance between herself and the angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin that jiggly rear, Blake was being mercilessly pumped from every direction by the demonic flesh surrounding him. Scarlet\u2019s body was clearly stepping up it\u2019s efforts to absorb him completely, demanding he hand over all that he had left to his new mistress. It flooded his mind with naughty images of a life as Scarlet\u2019s butt: spilling out as she sat herself down, bouncing gently with every step she took, fighting against her as she struggled to fit him into a pair of tight yoga pants\u2026 Those thoughts only grew nicer as more of him slipped away, broken down and becoming more of Scarlet. He could practically <i>feel</i> the demoness\u2019 smile widen as she felt him grow lesser and lesser inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, somewhere deep inside his soul, a part of him clung to being Blake Heart. To his family, to his friends, to his crush and to his future. That part refused to budge or break or give in to the hungry walls. It was Blake Heart. And to it that wouldn\u2019t change, no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet scowled. Seems the human\u2019s soul was stubborn. No matter. All she needed to do was lose Aliyah. Then she could find a good spot to relax and focus on breaking him down completely. Mage or nobody, every soul breaks eventually-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wrapped tightly around Scarlet\u2019s arms and stomach, stopping the demon dead in the air. She spluttered violently as the air was forced up from her lungs by the pressure, strong enough to make it feel like her bones could snap at any second. She glanced down to see tendrils of light ensnared securely around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy, oy! W-what kinda angel magic is this?!\u201d She yelled behind her at Aliyah. Her bat wings flapped and her legs kicked fruitlessly. \u201cLet go of me, you dumb skank!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s not me doing this, you disgusting harlot!\u201d Aliyah herself wheezed. The tendrils of light had also entangled the angel, twisting her arm until she was forced to drop her sword, which faded into particles of light long before it could hit the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis magic felt familiar to Aliyah, yet at the same time different. It was definitely angelic magic\u2026 yet at the same time it wasn\u2019t. What in name of the creator could it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 this is\u2026!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great force, the angel and the demon were slammed together, chest pressing into chest, and coated in an extra layer of light vines. To Aliyah\u2019s left and Scarlet\u2019s right, a new figure lifted herself up to loom slightly over the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah took one look at her and her body was overcome with fear and disbelief. \u201c<i>Watcher!</i>\u201d She mutter, hardly able to believe her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet was annoyed and confused. \u201cWatch-wha?\u201d She quizzically looked at the new figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked like a teenage, medium height human girl. Her skin was pale and silky, yet seeping with life. Her hair was mostly black except for a certain red bang that swept to the girl\u2019s left, and in length it stopped just a little above her shoulders. Her eyes were blue, but with weird, gear-like pupils. She wore a short, red sweater with a red scarf around her neck, a mostly exposed midriff, and a pair of red pants connected to her sweater by to black straps. From behind her, tendrils of pure light sprouted from her back like wings, the majority of which currently being used to ensnare the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the girl again, Scarlet couldn\u2019t understand Aliyah\u2019s fear. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look so-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girl\u2019s mouth grew wide above their heads, easily big enough to take in them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah closed her eyes and grit her teeth. Scarlet didn\u2019t get to finish her scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Watcher\u2019s lips hungrily fell over the duo\u2019s heads, coming to rest on their shoulders as her tongue lapped away at their hair and faces. Quickly, she continued, her mouth descending down to angel\u2019s and demon\u2019s forearms. Two bulges ballooned out in the Watcher\u2019s throat. One struggled and fought and screamed into the flesh around her; the other was still and silent, knowing any attempt at escape was pointless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tendrils wrapped around the pair broke off from the Watcher\u2019s back, making it easier for their master to continue her consumption as she claimed more of them. With her lips now around there midriffs, she lifted the pair up above her head using her arms, providing them with a clear slide into her stomach. Red legs flailed wildly as their owner sunk in deeper, but the fair skinned legs offered no futile resistance, even as it\u2019s owner\u2019s head dipped into the Watcher\u2019s chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when the Watcher reached the butts that, for some reason, she stopped herself. Her tendril wings held the floundering red legs still as she grabbed a handful of the demon\u2019s butt flesh. Blake felt something squeeze him a few, but he was too weak from the demon\u2019s attempted assimilation to investigate what it was. Still, they were soft, curious squeezes, not the cruel kind Scarlet would give, so he found himself somewhat hopeful as to what it could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a few more squeezes, the Watcher\u2026</span></div></div>",

It all had happened so fast - one moment Blake and Aria were on their way to see the new movie 'Love's Zenith', and the next they were knocked out cold by tiny pricks in their necks - tranquilizer darts, they now guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-before you ask...\" Blake spoke as the adults sat across from the teens. \"I did NOT take the last slice of pizza at lunch this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" the black-dressed male spoke, \"you're not in any trouble. We're simply looking for new recruits with...special talents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you people?\" Aria asked, feeling slightly uneasy about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man showed the teens a golden badge. \"Agent John, of the Buried Business Bureau.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, John's partner, displayed her own badge. \"Agent Casey.

And who was to say that the entire world didn't know at this point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking to half an inch tall will increase your ability to stay stealthy,\" John said, \"but I take it Aria lacks the power to shrink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never dabbled in the magical arts...\" Aria frowned, \"so no, I can't shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Casey smiled softly. \"It's best that you remain normal size, anyway. All the better to keep track of your partner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn pulled out a box of spy tools - small cameras, magnifying glasses, communication devices, and the like. \"You'll need these to do the job right, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake raised an eyebrow. \"Wait, where'd all of these gadgets come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's classified information,\" Casey stated.</span></div></div>",

My daughters always wanted a pet bat!\u201d she said, then her palm glowed and she waved it over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she pulled her hand back and the glowing faded than you fell on your butt as the surface under you raised a bit, causing a concentrated earthquake for you as several rods rose up around you with a creaking, groaning sound, all of them bending inwards and joining together at the top. Your eyes widened at what Raven had conjured. A CAGE?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything started shaking again as the woman grasped the conjoined bars at the top of it and she raised it so you were looking her dead in the eye.  \"Crystal and Gemma are gonna love you...in fact, I dare say they'd be absolutely...\" Raven  snickered, \"batty over you!\" With a laugh, Raven lowered the cage and resumed walking; blissfully unaware that the bat which she'd deemed the property of her daughters was actually her nemesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPET?! To Raven's...? NO! No! No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh, no, no, no! No, please, no! Not that! You knew Raven's girls. Since their mother hated you, you'd had to deal with them occasionally gunning for you too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at her home and opening the door, Raven called out to your \"wardens\", \"Crystal, Gemma...I'm home! And I have a present for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if the two she'd addressed hadn't wanted to greet their mother, they were still teenage girls, so at the word \"present\", it didn't surprise you much when, moments later, the two bound into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was fourteen years old with a preference to wear light blue, had blue eyes and black hair, and was a bit more mature than her sister, Gemma. Gemma, on the other hand, was thirteen, with hazel eyes and brown hair, liked wearing red, and had a bit more of a playful personality. Both girls were fairly petite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding out your cage, Raven smiled at them, \"Say hello to your new pet, girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of you, both preteens squealed with delight at the sight of their new pet, approaching their mother and letting out a rapid series of 'thank-yous' to Raven before hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemed strange these two little (well, not-so-little, from your perspective) would be so overjoyed and ecstatic over getting a bat (not that you were a bat!) as a pet when most girls would want a puppy, kitten, or rabbit or something like that. Then again, these were a magic-users' kids, and given what bats symbolized (again, not that you were one), both the positive and negative, they made good magical familiars. So you could see why they would be excited at having one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, who should get to play with the new bat first..?\u201d Raven spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, obviously!\u201d Crystal declared. \u201cI\u2019m older and much more capable of training a bat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Gemma objected. \u201cI should get him first, I\u2019m the cuter one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls!!\u201d Raven yelled, shutting her daughters up. \u201cI\u2019ll decide who gets to play with him first, and I know JUST how to do it.\u201d She pointed a finger at one girl, then the other, in a classic game of eenie-meenie-minie-mo to decide your first captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you cowered in the cage, the way the pairs's eyes were locked on you was downright unnerving, the gazes were so intense. Heck, you could practically see hearts in their eyes!</span></div></div>",

The bat-boy felt slightly sorry for Gemma as she sobbed in her bedroom, despite the fact that she was related to his cold-hearted rival. Maybe he could try tapping into his mage powers to help her through a tough moment? ...Blake's thoughts were interrupted as Crystal carried his cage to her own room, setting said cage on her nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, little bat!\" Crystal smiled at her pet. \"I WAS gonna give you a name right away, but that can wait. Besides, tomorrow's the annual pet talent contest, and I'm simply dying to teach you some new tricks! Let's start with an easy one...twenty push-ups! Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake found himself in a bind upon hearing his teenage warden's command - he could barely manage push-ups in human form, but as a bat they had to be sheer torture. Unfortunately, refusing to comply with someone bigger than you could have terrible consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, there was also the matter of Gemma sobbing alone in her room. Blake didn't like to see a girl so upset - even if that girl was one of Raven's daughters.

This domain, at which the center sat a gigantic castle, has stood unyielding and unbroken in the face of the Magic Realm\u2019s wild and uncontrollable essence, an eternal testament to Ablus\u2019 magical prowess, and a feat none had accomplished before or have since. Albus christened his creation \u201cThe Heart of Hearts\u201d, and made it his base of operations, from which he journeyed to and discovered countless other realms, ensuring his place in the wizardry history books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany years later, when age had inevitably caught up to the triple-digit old Albus, he cast one last spell with his dying breath: that all living members of the Heart family, no matter where they were or that realm they resided in, would be summoned to The Heart of Hearts for a period of one month, to brake bread with one another and keep the family strong and united forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, as his eyes closed for the final time, his many children and spouses gathered at his side, Albus wished for it to be a spectacular time for all who attended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a certain Blake Heart, it was always a contender for worst month of the year, if not always the victor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing near the bottom of the Heart family food chain, he was an easy and strangely popular plaything for his many magical relatives, both close and distance. Countless times he had been swallowed whole, digested, shrunken, crushed, turned into clothing and worn, turned into food and eaten, absorbed into someone\u2019s body and trapped as a part of them, and multiple others he tried his hardest to forget. Thankfully, no Heart could die within the estate, and at the end of the day they would always reform safely within their rooms. But still, finding himself tormented almost everyday of it made the month taste incredibly sour to the young mage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that dreaded month has come again. Will Blake somehow find a way to escape this gathering unscathed? Or will once again be a toy to some of the wicked members of his extended family? </span></div></div>",

Not from any sort of aftereffect of the transportation spell itself, but from the sight of the still-growing crowd that filled the courtyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was filled with many different races; some human, some human-like and some clearly not human at all. Blake picked out many familiar faces as he surveyed the yard. A few of them brought his heart relief, but more made it skip beats in fear and terror. He felt the gaze of many where he was currently standing and struggled to suppress a shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s as much fun as last time!\u201d Jade\u2019s joyful voice spoke from his left, utterly oblivious to Blake\u2019s miserable mood. Despite being even less magically adept than her brother, Jade was, for some reason, never the recipient of the same torment he received. Why was that? Blake didn\u2019t know. But he couldn\u2019t help being extremely jealous of her \u201cspecial\u201d treatment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister\u2019s eyes lit up as she spotted a friend over in the distance. \u201cMom, Blake, I\u2019ll catch ya later!\u201d She said, and, after a small wave, dashed away into the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his right, his mother hummed happily. Seems she had also seen someone of interest. She leaned towards her son and whispered softly in his ear, \u201cMom\u2019s gonna go meet with some friends too, okay?\u201d Her lips gently pressed against his cheek as she gifted him a motherly kiss. \u201cYou take care now. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d And with that, Claire herself was off, eventually disappearing from Blake\u2019s view behind rows of shuffling bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was just him. Alone in this vast sea of faces. Whatever small comfort his mother\u2019s peck gave him washed away instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, Blake made a beeline for the castle, his spellbook clutched tightly to his chest. He\u2019d be safe if he made it to his room. No Heart could enter another\u2019s without their explicit permission. That was a rule of the castle; enforced by the magic of the very structure itself, and by the many magical golems that resided within. So if he made it to his room, he\u2019d be safe. He could figure out the rest, such as getting food, when he was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, his trek took him from right through the gathering collectives of people, and gained him the attention of certain individual\u2026</span></div></div>",

He just wasn't expecting the first person to be his own sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, what's wrong, did you need something?\" He asked, watching his sister walk in while holding her gut. A look of small pain was painted on her face as she sat down on the chair next to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just going to come and wish you good luck on your first day, but I've got a bit of a stomachache now...think you could take a look, doctor?\" She said with a small laugh, holding her gut tighter as Blake walked closer to the edge of his examination ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll always have time and room to help my family. Let's see if we can figure out what's wrong.\" The mini doctor said as he motioned for Jade to move her gut closer. A slight gurgling could be heard as Blake pressed his head into the warm gut of his sister. The shorter shirt she was wearing left the stomach exposed to let Blake get right to the source of the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it does sound like something is upsetting it. Did you eat anything strange recently?\" Jade's face blushed red in embarrassment, seeming to be the answer to her illness. \"Could you maybe...take a look inside to see if you can get it out? I don't know if I can go all day with this pain, Blake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on her best pleading look, Jade held her brother up as he gave a worried sigh. \"Alright alright, I'll take a look inside...but once I find it you'll get me out, right?\" Blake asked, quickly getting a response from his sister by being squeezed into her cheek for a hug \"Of course Blake, thank you, thank you!! I'll get you right out as soon as you find what the problem is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Blake calmed his nerves while Jade slowly opened her mouth. Jade's eyes looked down at her mini brother with anticipation, happy to soon be cleared of her sickness. A final look of confirmation was shared between the two siblings before Blake took the dive into Jade's waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it took was a quick gulp for Jade to swallow her doctor and brother down like a mere pill. After a right trip down, Blake landed with a splash in the belly below. \"Alright Jade, I made it! Let's see what the problem is...\" Blake called up, starting to look around in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of time, it was clear to Blake what was going on here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake watched helplessly as the ring travelled through the air, towards a group of students sitting at a table, and into one of the student\u2019s can of Pepsi. Upon closer inspection he realized that the Pepsi belonged to his friend Ruby Sparks, and since Ruby was sitting there, that probably meant that the people sitting next to her were her squad mates. However Blake immediately noticed something seemed different about Ruby. Instead of wearing her one piece cheerleading outfit, she was wearing a red short sleeve crop top that left her midriff exposed, and a stylish black &amp; red skirt. She was still wearing her red high heels, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Huh. I guess Ruby doesn\u2019t have cheer practice today.\u2019</i> Blake thought to himself. Ruby having a day where she doesn\u2019t have cheer practice wasn\u2019t something that Blake had ever really thought about oddly enough, since most of the time when he sees her, Ruby is usually wearing her cheer uniform, even during class and outside of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201d... And then he said, \u2018It was a pineapple!\u2019\u201d Said one girl, eliciting an eruption of laughter from the other people sitting at the table. One of Ruby\u2019s friends was telling a story about a time her family went on vacation. \u201cYou and your family have quite the life.\u201d Ruby said while picking up her can of Pepsi to take a sip. When she took a sip of her Pepsi, Ruby noticed that it tasted off. Not bad, but different. It tasted heavenly. Ruby felt an intense urge to continue drinking. It was almost as if she got addicted to her drink\u2019s magical new flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I suppose a little more couldn\u2019t hurt.\u2019</i> Ruby thought to herself. Ruby raised the can back to her lips to continue drinking, but as she drank her Pepsi, Ruby felt something solid hit the back of her throat. This caused her to start coughing, all the while her throat had a noticeable bulge that gave off a slight glow. Ruby attempted to swallow the object a few more times, and after the third time the mysterious object finally went down her throat, disappearing past her collar bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! Ruby, are you okay?\u201d Asked a concerned friend of hers. \u201cYeah I\u2019m fine, I just swallowed a bug.\u201d Ruby responded, while rubbing her neck. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? Because it looked like you were choking.\u201d \u201cIt must\u2019ve been a pretty big bug if it made you enter a coughing fit.\u201d Everyone at the table began to smother Ruby with attention, with Ruby attempting to assure everyone that she\u2019s fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood there frozen. Days of work wasted, all because he forgot to tie his shoes. He tried to tell himself that he could just make another ring, but that failed after he remembered that by making the ring in the janitor\u2019s closet, and <b>only</b> the janitor\u2019s closet, he has probably caused some of the janitors trouble by disallowing them access to their supplies, thereby preventing them from doing their job, and by continuing to do so he could receive detention, a suspension, or in the absolute worst case scenario, expulsion. Not wanting to face detention, or possibly worse, Blake retreated from the cafeteria and into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hallway Blake started to brainstorm on how he could get the ring out of Ruby\u2019s stomach. He could try using a teleportation spell to warp the ring out, but if he wasn\u2019t careful he could create a mess by spilling whatever Ruby ate onto the floor, or even worse, accidentally remove some of Ruby\u2019s internal organs. He could try waiting for Ruby to pass the ring naturally, but that would require knowing both where and when the ring exited Ruby\u2019s body, and even if he did know, Blake wasn\u2019t sure if the ring\u2019s magical properties would be able to keep it from being digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what, everytime Blake came up with an idea, a counterpoint against it always seemed to pop up in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018This is hopeless\u2026\u2019</i> Blake thought. <i>\u2018How am I supposed to get the ring back?\u2019</i> Getting desperate, Blake whipped out his miniature spell book, deciding that he would summon a spirit to help him out. After making sure that there was nobody around who could see him, Blake held out his hand and recited an incantation, \u201cOn this day that I swallow my pride, may the World of Spirits be my guide!\u201d The area around Blake started to fill with technicolor smoke, in the midst of the smoke Blake could see a masculine looking silhouette, which he assumed was the spirit. When the smoke started to clear the spirit was revealed\u2026 to be wearing a shower cap and a towel? Blake and the spirit stared at each other in awkward silence. After a few moments, the silence was finally broken by Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I didn\u2019t know that spirits needed to bathe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook kid, I might be dead, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t care about proper hygiene. Anyways, what do you want?\u201d The spirit responded in an annoyed tone. \u201cI need your help with something.\u201d The spirit rolled it\u2019s eyes, having an idea where this was going. \u201cLet me guess, you want me to help you win over that girl you like?\u201d This statement made Blake\u2019s face turn redder than a beet. \u201cNO! I-I mean no\u2026 I don\u2019t need help with... with... A-aria\u2026\u201d Blake nervously denied, before regaining his composure and clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the ring.\u201d Blake said, still having a slight blush on his face. \u201cWhat, did you lose it or something?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly say that I <i>lost</i> it.\u201d \u201cWell if you didn\u2019t lose it, then what <i>did</i> happen?\u201d \u201cI tripped over and fell, causing the ring to fly out of my hands and into a drink belonging to a friend of mine, and now the ring is trapped inside their stomach.\u201c The spirit stared incredulously at Blake. \u201cOne of your friends swallowed the ring.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Blake bluntly confirmed. The spirit sighed and rubbed it\u2019s temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Which one?\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cWhich one of your friends has the ring inside of them?\u201d \u201dThe ring\u2019s inside of Ruby.\u201d That name sounded familiar to the spirit. \u201cRuby\u2026 What did she look like again?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s over there.\u201d Blake said while pointing at a table \u201cShe\u2019s the one with the blonde hair, skirt, and crop top.\u201d The spirit rubbed its chin, staring at Ruby before turning to Blake. \u201cHuh\u2026 She seems to be showing a lot of skin. Doesn\u2019t this school have a dress code in place?\u201d Blake shrugged, not really knowing how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, I have an idea on how you can get your ring back.\u201d Blake was ecstatic. \u201cReally!?\u201d \u201cYeah. Though I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not gonna like it.\u201d Blake gave the spirit a look that more or less said \u2018are you sure about that?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, whatever kid. But before I tell you, I\u2019ll need you to answer a question, you got that?\u201d Blake nodded with a serious expression on his face. \u201cHave you ever seen Fantastic Voyage?\u201d Blake's face of determination turned to one of confusion. \u201c...Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it a few years ago on TV, but I don\u2019t really see why that\u2019s impor-.\u201d Blake immediately cut himself off when he realized what the spirit was getting at. \u201cYou want me to go inside of Ruby\u2019s body to retrieve the ring?\u201d The spirit nodded. Blake thought about it for a few seconds, before giving his answer. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d The spirit smirked. \u201cGreat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit placed it\u2019s hands on Blake\u2019s shoulders and began to recite an incantation of its own \u201cMind, strength, and skin of steel, make this boy the height of one\u2019s heel... or something.\u201d Blake instantly shrank down to a millimeter in height. \u201cThis spell should be able to protect you from just about anything, but I\u2019m not sure how well it will work since I haven\u2019t done this whole magic thing in\u2026\u201d The spirit began to count with it\u2019s fingers. \u201c... A long time.\u201d Blake nodded and turned to the cafeteria doors. \u201cNow how am I going to get close to Ruby?\u201d Blake thought out loud. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have that figured out too.\u201d \u201cOh really? What do you have in mi-?\u201d Blake didn\u2019t know how to react as he saw that the spirit suddenly had a nine iron golf club, but when he saw the spirit winding up to swing it, he reacted with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no no no nononononononoNONONO!\u201d Blake protested, but it was too late. By the time he began protesting, the spirit had already made up its mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFORE!\u201d The spirit shouted before swinging the golf club at a lightning fast speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THWAP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d Blake screamed after being launched into the air by the golf club. While Blake was sent flying, the spirit began laughing it\u2019s spectral ass off. \u201cHAHAHA, Ha ha haaa\u2026 I never get to have this much fun in the spirit world.\u201d The spirit said, calming down from its laughing fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHHHHHHH-.\u201d *THUD* \u201cUgh\u2026\u201d After reorienting himself from colliding with a hard surface, Blake rubbed his head and wearily looked around. However as he was analyzing his surroundings a deep, loud rumble garnered Blake\u2019s attention, causing him to stare at its source: Ruby\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table stared at Ruby after hearing her stomach roar like a ferocious animal. \u201c\u2026 I guess I\u2019m pretty hungry.\u201d Ruby said before giving an embarrassed chuckle. <i>\u2018Or maybe it\u2019s because of the ring that you swallowed.\u2019</i> Blake thought to himself. Blake, reminded by Ruby\u2019s stomach growling that he has limited time before she digests the ring, quickly thought about how he could enter her body and came up with two options. He could either try sneaking his way into Ruby\u2019s can of Pepsi and wait until she takes a sip, or he could also try a more direct approach by flying up to Ruby\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do\u2026?</span></div></div>",

With a shrug, she raised the can up to her face and parted her lips, eagerly guzzling down the rest of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying submerged so as to avoid drawing attention to his shrunken self, Blake had to hold his breath to avoid drowning in soda. Feeling his world rise up to his friend\u2019s open mouth made it difficult to keep his mouth closed, but thankfully the tipping of the can allowed the young man to finally inhale some (relatively) fresh air into his lungs before he was finally brought down Ruby\u2019s throat with an eager gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight walls of the esophagus constricted Blake on his way to Ruby\u2019s stomach, where he\u2019d hopefully find the ring in one piece.

Despite stomachs usually having no light source, Blake was somehow able to see in here...maybe due to his magical powers. The walls slowly pulsated, and a sickly-green sea of acid bubbled nearby. Fortunately, he had landed on a fairly dry spot in Ruby\u2019s gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReciting a spell often used for dowsing, Blake created a glow in his pointer finger and used it like a metal detector to search for the lost ring...</span></div></div>",

As the seconds ticked by, rushed movement could be seen behind a one-way mirror looking into the room. The figures behind the protective wall seemed to be talking in hushed but excited voices. Soon enough,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decontamination process complete. Radiation levels have been reduced significantly. It is now safe for authorized personnel to enter the testing chamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing these words, a previously unseen door slid open in the door with a soft *whish.* An unusually tall figure entered the room, wearing a protective suit.

Angela gave a smirk as from the smoke appeared several soldiers and one Sapphire Heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so my favorite prey has come to join the party~.\" The agent grinned, only for a bullet to graze her cheek. Sapphire, holding the pistol responsible for the bullet fired, growled, \"I've been given permission to end your miserable existence. It's been a long time coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent howled with laughter as the soldiers apprehended some of the scientists. \"What makes you think you have the balls to do so!?\" She shouted. \"I assume you're also here to destroy...THIS.\" Sapphire looked at the artifact and nodded, \"After getting rid of you, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, try and take it from me.\" Angela said, rushing and tackling her prey to the floor, knocking the pistol out her hand.

Quickly, Sapphire grabbed her pistol, aiming at Angela as the agent grabbed the tongs and swung them in her direction.

Even though she went to hospital to patch up her injuries and get a check up, nothing was out of the ordinary. Both Sapphire and her mom ultimately assumed that she was just exhausted when she fought Angela and left it at that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Sapphire's stomach, however, rested the artifact as it started to partially embed itself into the military officer's stomach \"floor\". As Sapphire continued her life, the  artifact laid dormant. Sleeping, yet waiting. Regardless of what Sapphire was doing at the current moment, it remained asleep....as if it needed something other than Sapphire to trigger its power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all changed a couple days after her appointment....</span></div></div>",

She had the house to herself for several more hours, and her time in the military had taught her that spare time and idle hands were ideal for completing chores. That at least drew her attention to a project that she could busy herself with. She'd overheard her aunt complaining about a surge protector that had been on the fritz, but had also lamented that she was too busy to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading into the garage, Sapphire spied the offending piece of equipment almost immediately after walking in. She could see it resting on a closed toolbox, whoever had taken it into the garage had clearly not bothered to store it properly. Even though she was doing this of her own free will, Sapphire's years of training and discipline still caused her to grumble whenever she saw things like this out of place. Reaching out with a hand to remove the surge protector...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ZAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Sputtering and cursing, Sapphire removed her hand from the busted cord. Now that she was right in front of it, she could see that she'd foolishly grabbed a portion of the cord with exposed wiring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh, stupid, Stupid!\" Now quite angry (with both herself and whoever'd been stupid enough to plug in a clearly broken piece of equipment), Sapphire opened up a side closet and hastily put on a pair of rubber gloves. God, that had been dumb of her! Her superior's would've laughed if they'd seen her handling something like this without taking proper safety precautions, civilian environment or not. She was lucky she hadn't been electrocuted... Yeah, the shock had hurt, but it had been more of a surprise than anything else. Still muttering angrily, Sapphire yanked the cord out of the wall socket (yeah, there was too much exposed wiring here. Better to just toss the surge protector and buy a new one. Oh well) and bagged up the device for disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that took care of that. And now she only had what, another several hours before Blake and the rest were home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Sapphire left the garage. Maybe she'd get lucky and there was something worth watching on TV...<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, deep inside of her the shock she'd received was having unforeseen consequences. As the jolt traveled through her body, the electrical current had passed through the small sphere sitting in the base of her gut. Moments later, the object began to glow faintly... No longer dormant, the artifact would respond to any stimuli it received.</span></div></div>",

Laying on the bed, the military officer picked up her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell....\" The military officer sighed, annoyed with her current situation as she started pleasuring herself. As she did so, she felt her vagina get warm and moist, while her nipples hardened. Sapphire gave a soft hum as her breathing slowly began more labored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, hurry up...!\" She whispered to herself, watching the clock tick away as the time got closer and closer to her relatives arriving. She then let out a moan as she felt her entire body tense up and felt warm fluids rush out from her vagina. \"Holy...shit...\" She said, groaning as her body felt like it was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few minutes to relax, the military officer got off the bed, before grabbing tissues from the the tissue box on the bedside table. After cleaning herself and the comforters, she threw the tissue away and went to the shower with her clothes. After several minutes, she was clean, dry, in new clothes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd feeling a lot more refreshed. \"Why the hell have I not thought of that sooner?\" Sapphire asked herself. She pleasured herself before, but she never did so to relieve stress. She made a mental note to remember that for the next time she was anxious.<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\nInside the woman's stomach, the artifact was starting to glow a soft white light. It had noticed the changes in Sapphire's body temperature and hormones. The chemicals reacted to the artifact, awakening it from its slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then began releasing its side effects, but at a pace that would be difficult to notice...

The third day, however, she noticed something. The military officer had a nightmare where she was looking in the mirror after a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw herself covered in blood, before morphing into Angela, who then reached from the mirror to slit Sapphire's throat. Sapphire jumped awake, before quietly looking in everyone's rooms. After confirming that her family was safe, she went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had not been that frightened in a long time....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth day at night, she was almost too scared to go to sleep. And rightfully so, as she was worried that her cousins and aunt would get harmed and she wouldn't be able to save them. The fifth night at her mother's house was when she noticed something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner, she was having a perfectly normal conversation with Jessica, only to almost snap at her angrily. Needless to say, both women were startled by the military officer's actions. After taking a minute to herself and apologizing, Sapphire explained what had happened a couple nights ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica suggested that she'd go see a therapist. Sapphire reluctantly agreed and made an appointment for next week. The sixth day, she was still somewhat angry, but at herself for snapping at her mother the night prior. She thankfully managed to keep it in check most of the day and in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the seventh day; after a whole week had passed since her unique stress relief, the military officer and her aunt and mother noticed something VERY off. A couple of somethings, actually. The day started as normal, with Sapphire arriving to visit her cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family then went shopping, with Sapphire, Jessica, and Claire needing clothes, while Blake and Jade went to check out whatever peaked their interests. When Blake returned to ask his mom if he could get anything, his military officer of a cousin had unpredictably and uncharacteristically picked out an outfit that would have killed it at a strip club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also noticed a faint light from Sapphire's upper abdomen. After knocking some sense into herself after being quite flirtatious, Sapphire changed back to her normal clothes, apologizing as she hung her head, embarrassed. That night, she went to bed wishing the day never happened...<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\nThat night, she had another nightmare. She found herself in her bedroom, before spotting two more Sapphires. \"What are you...?\" She asked, gripping the comforter beneath her instinctively. The more aggressive of the two grinned, 'We're you...or rather...new forms of your personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire raised an eyebrow, before the one that looked like a stripper chuckled. \"We were formed from the emotions of you that you despise the most.\" She said, pointing at herself. \"I am the part of you who yearns for enjoyment, regardless of consequence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aggressive one said, \"I am the part of you who is a warrior, willing to torture, fight, and kill anyone who stands in my way.\" \"YOU are the one who is too afraid to admit these parts of yourself.\" She said. \"You're timid. Cowardice. PATHETIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire jumped as she backed up from her counterparts, who now seemed much larger in comparison. \"We suggest you start panicking.\" They said. \"Because soon, you will have no choice at all.\" The military officer's field of view got darker and darker, before rose from her bed, awake and feeling like she was going to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire looked around. There was nothing. Nothing but the sunlight of the early morning pouring through the window. She curled up into a ball, before cracking out a quiet whimper as tears rolled down her cheeks.

No appearances from either of her evil counterparts, no sightings of GTS... nothing. The day had been almost peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it had been a nice, normal day. Exactly the kind of relaxing break she'd needed after feeling so 'off' all week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it had been a normal day except for one thing. She'd practically had a heart attack at seeing it, but when she'd opened up her closet to pick out her clothes for the day, right in front of her face had been the impractical and entirely-to-revealing outfit from the previous day! How?! She could've sworn she'd returned it! Stepping back, Sapphire had thrown the closet door shut, making a much louder sound than she'd intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter apologizing profusely to the other occupants she'd just woken up with her thoughtless action (without leaving her room, she was still in her underwear, after all), Sapphire grabbed a spare set of emergency clothes from her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were rumpled but clean, and she'd rather just go with the ratty jeans and plain t-shirt she was now holding rather than have to look at that... thing she'd picked up from the mall. She should have the receipt somewhere... If she did, she needed to return the outfit later. She'd just have to be discrete, she really didn't want the rest of the family (especially Blake) to see her holding the ungodly outfit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no luck. Sapphire sighed and a ran her fingers through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I guess it was too much to be hopeful for... Now what am I gonna do with this?\" She muttered, staring at halter top and mini skirt combo laid out on her bed. She hadn't been able to find the receipt anywhere- maybe she'd tossed it out in a brief moment of insanity? The way this week was going, she definitely felt like she was going crazy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, no receipt meant that she was stuck with this god-awful barely-counts-as-clothes disaster in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could just bury the offending articles of clothing deep in her closet and forget about them? No, that wouldn't work- Her aunt liked to clean the house regularly. She couldn't risk the outfit being discovered. Maybe she could just burn it, or something. ...No, that was probably illegal. At the very least, it would draw a whole bunch of the wrong attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Jumping nearly a foot into the air, Sapphire's hand shot to her chest, desperately trying to calm her racing heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry! Did I startle you? I just wanted to spend some time with you, cause, you know, you've seemed upset or something this week. I just wanted you to- Sapphire? Are you trying to hide something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the worst! Her younger cousin, bless his heart, wanted to spend time with her in the hopes of making her feel better. Unfortunately, he was very much a teenage boy, and teenage boys were prone to making terrible mistakes even with the best intentions in heart. In Blake's case, he'd entered her room without waiting for her to give him the okay to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, she was fully dressed (Thank God!) but on the other hand Sapphire was very conspicuously clutching the mini skirt (which stopped mid-thigh...!) and halter top (which only just covered her larger than normal chest) behind her back. All in all, Sapphire's posture combined with the bead of sweat trickling down her forehead painted a very suspicious picture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Blake... Couldn't you have please waited for me to respond?' Sapphire groaned internally, before going into an unnoticed trance as her curious cousin peeked around her much larger frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...! Sapph, I thought you put that back on the shelf! Don't tell me you actually bought those clothes?! I thought you were joking when you were trying them on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, what's the matter, Blake? Didn't like what you saw?\" The military officer suddenly giggled. Blake recoiled, cheeks burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! You looked great- I mean, I mean... Argh, don't mess with me like that, Sapph!\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman giggled once more, \"You look adorable with that big blush on your face, Blake~. Admit it, you had the hots for me when you saw me flashing my nice long legs and rock hard abs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Blake would've been able to pick up that something was clearly up with Sapphire, but right now his teenage hormones were directing his attention elsewhere... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, seeing Sapphire showing off nearly all of her gorgeous long legs, super-toned midriff, and of course her big breasts nearly bursting out of that top's seams had illicited an embarrassing reaction from him the other day. The kind of reaction that 15-year old boys did not want their mothers to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire, on the other hand, was panicking... Now trapped in a mindscape that resembled that of a prison cell, she banged on the bars, shouting, \"Damn you! Leave my cousin alone!\" Her flirtatious personality chuckled, siting in something that resembled a throne. \"Now why would I do that?\" She asked. \"You have to admit, your cousin is damn cute.\" \"That doesn't mean you have the right to SEDUCE HIM!\" Sapphire snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flirtatious personality just shrugged, turning to Blake and walking Sapphire's body right up in front of him, her breasts right in Blake's face. \"Come on, Blake.\" The personality said in Sapphire's voice. \"Tell me the truth on how much you like my legs. My hips. My ass. My abs. And even my boobs~.\" The blush on Blake's face grew until his whole face was red. Was this actually Sapphire? He had no clue, but as much as he thought his cousin wouldn't act like this...unless forced to, he couldn't really deny that his cousin was very beautiful...and sexy...</span></div></div>",

After noticing that Blake was trying to get her off so he could breathe, the military officer immediately got off, before backing up to the very edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms around her as she curled up into a balls, averting her eyes from her cousin in embarrassment. \"Sapph...? Blake called out, looking both confused and surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire just curled up tighter, not wanting to interact. Not after what her counterpart might've done... \"Sapphire. Something's going on and you know it.\" The teenager said. \"Please. Just tell me. Maybe I can help...\"</span></div></div>",

I felt whatever that thing was go down my throat! I don't know about you, but I'm not taking any chances with the experiments of GTS. I'm getting myself checked out STAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------Sometime later, in the infirmary-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's definitely... something... in there. To be honest, ma'am, I'm not sure what it is,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire frowned, looking at the same set of x-rays the medical officer was examining. She could clearly make the small, round object located in her abdomen... God, who knew what it did? She really didn't like having the idea of an unidentified magical artifact <i>inside</i> her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're telling me that because it's inside of me you CAN'T remove it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, ma'am. GTS was using tools specifically designed to work with magical artifacts without triggering their effects. As much as I hate them and their \"leave no witnesses\" philosophy, I have to admit that the tools they possess are excellently crafted. Our surgical equipment doesn't possess the same magic-dampening effects that whatever tools GTS was using to interact with the object. Any attempt to remove the object from your stomach might, well... trigger the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire gulped audibly, that was a thought she could've done without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is that I'm stuck with a... with a dangerous unknown object, potentially a weapon, and there's NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor scientist cowered before the irate officer now towering over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my superiors have ordered me not carry out any surgeries! Look, I want to help you but I can't! It's as simple as that! I already told you, we just don't have the right equipment, and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the hapless medical staff's words were cut off as Sapphire half fell, half sat back down on the infirmary bed with a *thump*. Growling, the tall young woman seemed to seethe internally before standing up again, this time brushing past the shorter sickbay personnel as she made her way out of the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, ma'am? Ma'am? We're supposed to keep you overnight for observation...\" He trailed off, looking at Sapphire's retreating form. Oh well, he was definitely going to get chewed out  by his superiors for this, but honestly? Even if he'd wanted to he wouldn't have been able to keep the officer in the infirmary.  She'd looked more likely to kick his teeth in than listen to the rest of what he had to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------Outside the Infirmary---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's something, at least.\" Sapphire admitted in her mind that she may have left the infirmary too hastily. To his credit, the medical officer in charge of the infirmary had requisitioned a share of the equipment recovered from GTS's labs, equipment that would be vital for examining (and potentially performing any surgeries) on her. Doing her best to cool down and lose the temper she'd worked up, Sapphire pondered her options for the future.</span></div></div>",

If GTS captured her and went to the trouble of locking her away, why would they just have Angela poison her now?<br>\r\nPlus, she could see the sidearm holstered at Angela's hip. Why go to the trouble of poisoning her when GTS could just have their attack dog  whip her gun out and put a bullet in her brain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering at the captive woman's question, Angela leered down at the bound woman. Sapphire was still chained to the featureless metal chair bolted to the floor, her arms kept behind her back (Angela would've freed one of them had Sapphire accepted her proposal... but that ship had sailed with Sapphire's refusal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, It think you misunderstood the phrasing of my statement. It wasn't a request. My superiors <i>want</i> you to take that pill, so you <i>will</i> take that pill! Bottoms up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as a flash, Angela lashed out, having scooped up both the pill and the glass of water. With expert precision, the hand containing the pill darted forwards, plunging into Sapphire's unsuspecting mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmrgh!\" Sapphire grunted at the sudden intrusion of her personal space, and a twinge of panic surged through her when she realized that she could feel the cool metal of the small spherical object on her tongue. Lurching back in the uncomfortable metal chair, she attempted to spit it out but was impeded by Angela roughly grabbing her cheeks with one gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, got something in your mouth, bitch? Here, this'll wash it down!\" Grinning, Angela forced Sapphire's lips apart and poured the glass of water in, making sure the entire contents of the glass passed into her captive's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Sapphire wasn't able to actually swallow the entire amount. Angela released Sapphire's jaw and let the captive officer choke and hack, desperately trying to clear her airway. Some of the water was coughed up, creating a small puddle at the base of the chair while still more splattered on and was absorbed by Sapphire's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both women knew Sapphire had swallowed the \"pill.\" There was no shiny gray marble-sized artifact rolling on the floor, and there was no damp artifact currently caught in the captive's damp clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, it hadn't passed down easily at all, but Sapphire had felt the unmistakable lump of cool metal pass down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSputtering out the last bit of water, Sapphire managed a heated glare up at Angela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's that angry look for? I thought we were friends?\" Angela cooed in a tone of voice that was nothing short of supremely smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, missy- be happy! You're free to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? What do you mean?\" Sapphire could hardly believe her ears, not having believed the words that had just come out of Angela's mouth. But before she could question her captor any further, the agent of GTS had already moved behind her and undone her bindings. Not wasting a moment, Angela hauled the statuesque young woman to her feet and roughly shoved her out the door of the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear? I said 'you're free to go.' Ta-ta~ it was lovely having you over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, just that tone of voice alone made Sapphire want to smack the agent right in her smug face... but she new better. She may've been a skilled fighter, but she was tired, hungry, and unarmed... Plus Angela already had one hand at her holstered sidearm, daring her to make a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela waved at a security camera pointing down at the two women, and moments later two armed guards appeared, as if on cue. Each one seized Sapphire by her upper arms, practically dragging her away from the smug agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care now, Sapphire! My friends here will help you find the exit of our little facility here!  And don't you worry about the medicine you just took, it was a failed supplement, nothing more! Something that was supposed to keep our boys and girls in the field always peppy and ready to go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah right, that was about as far from the truth as it could be. But the shots that Sapphire had been injected with before she'd woken up in her cell should be taking affect right about now, filling the military officer with renewed stamina and energy... and conveniently misleading her from the actual purpose of the artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn artifact that, unlike a pill, had most certainly not been digested by Sapphire's powerful gastric acids. Yeah, Angela honestly thought that this was a pretty roundabout way of carrying out an experiment, but oh well, orders were orders. The artifacts powerful magic dampening effect needed to be in close proximity of a known magic-user to work, and who else would Sapphire Heart turn to for support and comfort after such an ordeal than one Blake Heart? Though she would admit that she liked the idea of using Blake's caring and protective cousin as a living Trojan Horse to deliver the instrument of his doom to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming all went according to her superiors' plans, this little endeavor could  permanently damage the young spell-casters supernatural abilities... or render him weak enough that GTS would be able to swoop in and capture him before he had a chance to find out what was wrong with his abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't even going into the fact that GTS's shrinking technology was vastly inferior to the spells that those vile magic-users wielded. Now, just how long did their Shrink Ray's effect last before wearing off completely? What was it... 7 days? Well, if those damn Heart's hadn't wised up before time ran out... well, even if Sapphire Heart survived, she'd be in for a world of hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what direction should the story take after Sapphire leaves/is kicked out of GTS's research facility?</span></div></div>",

He carried a box down into the dark depths and set them on the floor. He arranged them in the way the book had taught him. \"Rosemary ash, silken sash. Tooth of man with a devious plan. Silver sage and a torn page! With these items that are here, bring me spirits and bring them here!\" The candles went out ... and a dark fog filled the room. Then from the center of the arrangement, an aqua type glow shined. The light grew faintly as three disembodied spirits rose; one short and round, another tall and slim, and the final one, seeming like a normal human being. The short one spoke first <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You again?! Come on kid whadda want?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush Esmerelda! We were summoned so we must provide counsel \" Spoke the tall one \"But I do wonder why this one has summoned us... again... I mean.. seriously where do you get the stuff to summon us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old baby teeth from my sister and I. Nothing special.\" Blake explained. The slender one simply huffed and rolled her eyes. The modest one looked on at Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume this is about Aria, is it not.\" Blake always like this one, mainly because she was nice and helpful while the other two bickered. He nodded and she sighed. \"Blake.. you must really learn to speak to her on your own. You cannot rely on the spirits for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want kid? I was in the middle of watching my favorite show\" Blake taken aback by that responded with <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... watch tv?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course honey, all the time. At my old house, this couple moved in and they fixed up the place. They got this box and play interactive movies or just let them play out. I think its called a 'piss four' \" Blake acknowledged what the spirit was saying and chuckled softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its um... actually call P.S. Four. It stands for Play Station.\" The short one rolled her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chil' I think I know what I am talking about. Hush. So do you need our service or what\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah.. I wanted to impress Aria.\" The modest one spoke once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was telling you Blake you don't have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to be better.\" The tall one spoke. \"More tougher, more resistant to pain and strong to lift your two times!\" The tall one snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what she wants then yes\" The modest one growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, are you even listening to me? You have to speak to Aria yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.... I just need to be stronger before I can\" The modest one sighed then growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if you refuse to listen to reason have it your way. I will grant you the strength you seek, but it will come at a cost.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything! So long as it gets me close to Aria, I'll take it.\" The modest one raised her spiritual brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that truly what you want?\" Blake nodded. The two spirits laughed silently. The modest one's glow no longer was blue.. instead, it had turned a pinkish red... deepening to become more maroon. She chanted what Blake could only assume was the language of the mages... He felt himself rising up. Thoughts finally filled his mind of being close to Aria, her falling in love with him at first sight. He smiled and closed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- with these words said and the path sworn. An ant he becomes, a man no more.\" Blake's eyes shoot open as he hears this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I said make me stronger not smaller!\" The modest one sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You agreed to the deal my friend. Now... where was I? Oh yes. Let him have the strength of 100 men, the speed of a horse and bones of steel. For it is love that will make this curse unveil. Let him find his lover true for if he doesn't, it'll be his doom....\" Blake wanted to protest against that last part, ask them questions, but it was too late. their glow was becoming brighter and brighter until he had to close his eyes. He felt a surge jolt through his body and he felt himself collapse onto the cold hard floor. The surge... had knocked Blake unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some time before Blake woke up. Steadily he rubbed his head. Blake was sure he was seeing things. Everything was at least 20x bigger. Side effect of the spell... or .. curse? He rubbed his head some more before he heard a bell ringing far above him. He winced at the sound. Always loud... just.. like the one at school. Blake blinked to try and clear his eyes. His vision returned to him... and it confirmed what he had feared. The spirits had indeed shrunk him. He was no more than an inch or two in height! Blake started to panic, nervous. What would happen to him? Would he be crushed? Would he find Aria? How would he eat? Where would he sleep?! All these questions raced through his head until.. he saw her...</span></div></div>",

Later into the film, the hero accidentally shrunk himself at a restaurant and ran from plate to plate to avoid being eaten.

It wasn't like his friend - no, girlfriend - to make jokes like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria looked down at her chest, putting a hand to it. \"My chest worked out in a dark theater, but here, you'd be a little obvious... I'd really have to push you deeper for my parents to avoid you, and...\" She shook her head. \"Y-you could just... Just fall right... right... I mean, I might've gotten a bit sweaty there, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy in her hands tried to laugh it off. \"Yeah, I understand! I don't have to go back in.\" Realizing he might've been rude, he corrected himself: \"I didn't mind it, of course, but - b-but, I mean...\" His eyes bugged a little when he heard that slipping out of his tiny throat so easily. Now, they were both blushing, stumbling over their words. The movie's goofy atmosphere had pulled them together closer than they thought possible - in more ways than one. But with the credits done, they were back in the real world, trying to maneuver around their own bodies and avoid trouble from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette's soft palm trembled a little bit as Blake lay his diminutive back into it. She brought her lips jarringly close to him. Last time he went in, she had no time to think, and just popped him into the honey-scented cave. But now, he got a close-up view. Soft ridges crossed each peachy cushion, looking glossy and velvety. If he stared long enough at their minuscule movements with her concerned breaths, he could picture himself just falling into them, lost forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced away, still not totally comfortable with his own thoughts. \"How about your purse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so close, he could feel the exhales and inhales as she spoke. \"I... I don't want you to be cold again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little hesitation... Did she just want to feel her boyfriend in an embrace again? His mind rushed. He tried to still his beating heart, sure that Aria could feel it against the supple skin of her hand. Turning his head back to the wonderful face before him, he stumbled back - then forward, gulping. \"Sure. Yes. I can go in again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant face before him smiled. That's all he really needed to regain himself. Those beautiful lips parted, revealing a cave before him. Her tongue, mighty yet supple to the touch, inched out like a carpet onto the folds of her fingers. Obediently, almost in a trance-like state, Blake stepped forward onto it, letting the pink muscle sink around him. It felt like an embrace itself, only... wetter. And it went up to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled it in. His arms instinctively wrapped around it for support. He stayed clutched to it when he finally entered, and watched all traces of sunlight disappear into a progressively thinner bar of light formed by the even rows of her teeth. They closed with a sharp SNAP! He simply rested into the cushion formed by his lover's tongue, surprised at his own eagerness. The footsteps sounded out below, walking down a path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried tossing and turning a few times, looking for the best way to remain comfortable. It wasn't hard; just resting back in, his body felt like it was soaking inside a sweet, warm sauna. His fidgets tickled the young woman a few times at first, making her jaw shake; she had to hold herself to avoid revealing anything to passerby. But she got used to it quickly, after feeling him move over the flexible muscle a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they stopped. He heard a door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home!\" A man's voice came out first. \"How was the movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, humming a little. Her tongue pushed Blake aside for a second, moving him as carefully as possible to her cheek. It still felt rough, though, as the boy was pushed into the rosy surface within her. \"Hi dad! It was pretty funny. A little on-the-head when it came to some parts, but I like that sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer passenger quietly nodded in agreement. They shared such similar tastes, it was magical... Feeling brave, he hugged her cheek from the inside, which made her chuckle gently. He felt her pressing a hand to his spot. Now, a woman's voice rang out, no doubt the household's maternal figure: \"I'm glad you went, even when you couldn't find anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment, judging the safety of her comment before speaking up. \"Blake joined me for it. He had fun with it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother answered: \"Oh, that's even better! He's so quiet, I'm glad you brought him out of his shell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a little pause. Blake felt saliva pooling around his body, and had to move to prevent from getting drenched - but not so much that it would irritate his friend, or cause an involuntary swallowing movement. A deep chasm rested nearby, and who knows if he could escape it? He stilled his trembling, using the mouth's muscles for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man finally spoke up again. \"Yes.\" His tone wasn't angry, but... a touch dry. Forced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake moved a bit when Aria answered: \"I'm sorry for not telling you, but... He's so nice, I wanted to do something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice, dripping with sugar, calmed the tiny boy. It relaxed him, even as he felt harsh wind blowing through his hair; liquid all over his legs; pulsations through his chest; and intense pressure from the silence outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fernando, you can't be angry about that.\" Her mother had a slightly louder tone now. Or was Aria just getting closer. He still felt movement below, and noises like shoes hitting wood - drowned out slightly by the noise of her heartbeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man outside sighed. \"Carol, I didn't want to say anything, but... I've been a teenager before.\" The high school girl gulped, but her tongue carefully prevented her boyfriend from falling back. He continued: \"A nice, quiet teenager. Easy to influence. And I hid a lot from my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahah, I hid a lot too - I was just worse at it!\" The mother chimed in. Aria's soft giggled felt like a vibrating chair massage against Blake's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake just reminds me too much of myself back in the day. I always shrunk away from responsibilities.\" Hearing this, the boy slid down a little - and felt himself jump up. Was that just Aria taking a seat? It felt like a massive quake. He hit the roof of her mouth, and felt back comfortably onto her tongue. What were they discussing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, don't say things like that! You're both great, but you're different people.\" She pressed the boy in question under her tongue now. He felt a couple of bumps, and the sense of gravity shifted - she'd leaned towards her father to give a large hug. The echoing words still seemed to bounce around her white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother added: \"After all, it's not just about him, it's about the movie! Did they end up together? No, don't tell me, I want to find out for myself... But, was the other person a nice guy, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chattered on for a moment, sharing details. Blake felt odd during the whole scenario, just getting peeks of the house of his girlfriend. It was like he was a burglar, having to hide from the view of the other people - but also, listening to their interactions from a distance. He wanted to add in his own comments at some points, but... Maybe that would be for another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was more surprising was Aria's reactions. She was blushing like crazy earlier, but didn't show any awkwardness here. Every one of her movements perfectly hid the uninvited guest. Her tongue patted him a little in between sentences, to move him to safety, or just as a soft caress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the brief conversation over, one of them spoke up.</span></div></div>",

Once she was out of sight of her parents, Aria carefully opened her mouth, and searched for her tiny boyfriend with two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, I should have found a chance to get you out earlier...\" Aria apologized quickly, blushing at how thick her saliva covered Blake, \"I won't have a chance to wash you up just yet either, so I hope you're not feeling too icky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, your mouth was surprisingly comfortable!\" Blake said, which got a cute chuckle from Aria. \"I take it I'm not invited to dinner?

Books neatly lined shelves that dotted the walls, which where covered in muted dark green and brown wallpaper, which gave the impression of being inside a dimly lit forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was placed gently on Aria's desk, and she pulled open a drawer before quickly stuffing it with a few tissues.<br>\r\n\"Jump in, please?\" Aria asked, indicating to the drawer. Blake shrugged, and did as she asked. The tissue clung to his sticky form, but it did help clean him off a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to stay here till you come back?\" Blake asked, a little disheartened, \"I was hoping to spend more time with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, yeah you do. I can't have you wandering off, especially if someone else finds you before me. I'll try to be quick, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Aria carefully closed the drawer, sealing Blake in almost complete darkness. She left it open a crack, so that he'd be able to breathe, but not much else. Satisfied, Aria turned around, and quickly made her way back downstairs for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour, Blake was getting restless. He knew Aria would take a little while, but it was rather hard to wait someone he was madly in love with, especially when he had nothing to distract him with in the meantime. Frustrated, Blake stuck his hands into the crack above him, and wiggled them around. The drawer budged, ever so slightly, and Blake realized he'd be able to climb out with a few more tries.<br>\r\nBut...Aria told him not to. He was impatient, sure, but he didn't want to go against her wishes. Especially if it ended up putting him in big trouble.</span></div></div>",

She carefully opened her tissue-stuffed drawer, much to the delight of her tiny boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, little man!\u201d Aria cooed, lowering the bread down enough for Blake to climb onto it. \u201cI know it\u2019s not much, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s alright...\u201d Blake replied. \u201cThank you, Aria!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nibbled on the bread, smiling as he began to take bigger bites (which were still rather small compared to those of a normal-sized person).

Then... right in front of him... the modest spirit appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some mess you've gotten yourself into huh?\" Blake wanted to yell at her. Curse her for making him so puny.. but he couldn't muster the strength. All he could muster was a deep sigh and one word<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yupp.\" The modest spirit looked on with sympathy. She walked over to him and sat next to him on the rubbery soft surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to tell you... girls are a lot simpler than you guys think... Not all of us want someone strong... we want someone who will love us. Who will take care of us. Who will love us even we have nothing left to give. True strength isn't measured in body strength or buffness.. its measured in how strong your will is to go on for the ones you love.\" Blake looks up from his slump and looks at the spirit with a soft smile. He realized now that he HAD been too hasty. That while rushing to get here... he had missed sight of what is truly important in a relationship. The actual relationship. Blake tiredly leaned over and hugged the spirit. At first he phased through her but when she realized what he was doing she materialized a somewhat material form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for.. telling me... though it seems that I'm trapped in here.. and I'll never tell her how I really feel.\" The spirit released Blake and pondered for a moment.

She had forgotten about Blake as she went into class, having to work with fellow students. She absentmindedly rubbed her belly and tried to soothe it.

Literally inside of her. Not exactly like sex but, something about this experience was comforting to him. In a way Aria was protecting him. No one could possibly know he was here and, later if he so desired, Aria could possibly bring him back up. He was now completely immune to her acids and would no longer be able to be crushed or die at this this. Blake figured by now that he was now the size of 1 cm. he sighed and looked around, still stunned of what was happening. He did start this but it still blew his mind that this was possible.

It was spacious before but now it all looked like a giant cavern! The maroon walls, tendrils of saliva rolling down the sides of her stomach, and the gentle motions of passive digestion rocking the belly gently with every movement the giantess made. Blake blushed slightly at how intimate this was. He was actually inside of his love... deep inside her. Surrounded by her. Her warmth. A pool of liquid at the bottom, what Blake assumed to be her breakfast was all that remained inside of her belly. Aside from him. He was so small and inside of her, he wondered for a moment if he would ever get out, and if he did would he ever be found? ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he even want to be found? Blake thought for a moment, was living inside of his crush so bad? Being surrounded and protected by her massive form? Sure it would be nice to go outside and... actually to talk to her but.. as far as living arrangements go, there are much worse. He would have food and water. His deal made it so he wouldn't suffocate and if digestion happened he'd be fine. He walked to the side of Aria's stomach. Blake could faintly hear the class in the distance, the chatter of classmates outside and the angelical voice of Aria all around him, echoing and reverberating off the fleshy chamber walls. Blake could hear Aria speaking to her fellow classmates and noted how everything she said or did was... god like. Aria was his world now, was this so bad? He kept asking himself. He sat down against her soft belly. He'd think of a way out... if that was still what he wanted... but the gurgles of the intestines below him, the gentle breathing above him and the beautiful sound of Aria heart beating softly comforted him in a way he never knew possible. The way he thought he could compare it was if he was in the womb. As an infant, protected by this .. goddess Truly now, he was at her mercy, such a small speck. He rests his eyes. Blake needed time to think, clear his head. Soon he drifted off into a short nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour passed by and the bell rung loudly. Blake gasped in surprise seeing his surroundings but then remembered the events that took place prior, how he had made a deal, found Aria, talked to her and was accidentally swallowed like a piece of leftover breakfast. Speaking of, it was nowhere to be found, or at least what was left of breakfast. It would appear that the contents of Aria's belly have vacated and are likely deeper within her. Blake felt Aria get up and grab her bag. Blake held onto the floor of the belly as Aria moved standing up and made her way out of the classroom.Blake was not aware of how much time had passed since he took his nap<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria had just finished yet another class. She felt as if she was forgetting something. Maybe a pencil or something? She sighed, it'd come back to her eventually. Aria groaned with her tummy and rubbed it as she stood up.

Blake could see the pyloric sphincter yawn open slightly and close, letting the rest of Aria's digested breakfast move on. Then he heard through the muffled fleshy walls, the bell ringing.

She had a slender belly, a well-developing pair of breasts for her age and a nice, curvaceous ass. Aria was like a goddess to Blake.

I'm all yours, Blakey-boy!\" Aria made her point clear by moving towards the back of the tub at the wall of the bathroom on her tip-toes and leaned her body all the way backwards, resting her head against the wall gently. The front of her entire nude body now was surfaced in all it's glory for Blake to check out. \"Well, then, let's do it! Start me at the top!\" Blake accepted. He swam over to Aria's face and she moved him up to her forehead. Blake then began to make his way down, starting by traversing Aria's nose. The gigantic nostrils threatened to snort him into Aria's nasal cavities if she so chose to. Upon approaching the lips, Aria decided to tease Blake. \"Be careful, Blake! You don't wanna end up in my mouth. I might just eat you again\" she laughed. Seeing this as a challenge, Blake successfully leapt over the wide gap of Aria's open mouth as she laughed, just barely landing on her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Blake made his way down to Aria's boobs, stopping to play with her right nipple. This aroused Aria a bit, almost knocking Blake back into the bath water below. After a few minutes of stimulation, Blake arrived at Aria's massive belly, the cavernous belly button right before him. This gave Blake an idea for a prank of his own. \"Hey Aria! Remember how I was trapped in your belly earlier? Well, here's some payback!\" He then proceeded to tickle Aria's belly vigorously. She was very ticklish in that area, and she laughed profusely, her stomach moving violently under Blake. \"Ok, ok, easy, lover boy! Move it along!\" Aria said, gasping for air after laughing so hard. However, Blake had just arrived at what seemed like the end of the road. He was face to face with Aria's pubic hair and he had no way of reaching her nether regions currently, with no interest in Aria's legs or feet.

Aria moaned even harder at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then climbed up to the top of Aria's butt cheeks and stared down into the abyss of flesh below that was her buttcrack. This was the very area he escaped her body earlier and gotten her so peeved about. Now, Aria was just offering herself to him for anal sex while he was this small! He couldn't have ever dreamed of anything this exciting!. Blake wasted no time, swan-diving into Aria's buttcrack, eliciting a squeal from Aria herself, and stopping right in front of her butthole. He then took his rock solid dick and thrusted it straight into the wrinkled orifice right before him before thrusting in and out rapidly. This caused Aria's arousal to kick into overdrive as she moaned loudly and started masturbating her now gushing vagina in response. Blake's fucking continued for nearly 5 minutes before he felt like he was nearing his limit. \"Aria, I'm gonna cum!\" he declared \"YES, BLAKE! DO IT! CUM INSDIE MY ASS! SHOOT YOUR LOAD DEEP INSIDE ME, YOU MAGNIFICENT STUD!\" Aria shouted. Blake groaned loudly as he came hard into Aria's butthole, firing his seed deep into her colon below. At the same time, Aria screamed out her orgasm below him. Fortunately, no one else was home and the bathroom was in a part of the house where no neighbors could hear her, so they were safe.

Blake slid down the belly wall and rested on it as the food around him sunk into the digestive mess below. The contents of the stomach already digesting and breaking down food further. Luckily Blake was on a dry spot and avoided being dropped into a pool of said acids. He looked around. It was dark, humid and smelt of food. Things he expected to be in a stomach but still strange all the same. Even stranger when he thought about being \"Safe\" in here. Blake shook his head to try and rid himself of that thought. No way was this safe! He had to get out of here! The dark walls of her belly made things harder to see as Blake tried to walk around. The floor beneath him was just like Aria's throat, Soft yet firm.

Although a bit bullish towards him, she's far from being a jerk to him and does show some support for him from time to time. \"It says that she's at a friend's house and won't be back until tomorrow mourning.\" said Arla. \"Oh...some um...I guess us now..\" said Blake.

Blake certainly had no intention of looking this gift horse in the mouth. He leaned in once more to kiss her, but to his surprise, Aria quickly turned her face and pressed her lopsided over his shrunken form. This was unlike anything either of the two had ever experienced as they somehow managed to maintain this shared kiss. Blake was even more thankful that he ended up shrunken for this. Though he does hope to eventually find a way to grow back at some point, this experience of sharing a kiss with a goddess like being, like Aria was to him, was beyond anything that the mage could even begin to imagine. He could definitely put off finding a way to reverse his condition for a bit to see what else his size could allow the two to do.</span></div></div>",

Here Blake is face to face with his love. He cannot help but let his face burn crimson as he stares at her massive, beautiful features. Aria sees this and lifts Blake up to her lips. A little bit of fear goes through Blake but it melts as she gently presses him to her massive, soft, plush lips. Kissing the tiny mage twice. In his stupor Blake cannot help but kiss back as well, nuzzling into his massive girlfriend's lips. Soon though, her lips part, strings of saliva connecting the roof of her mouth to her long plush tongue. Blake blushing still, places a tentative hand on it to test its firmness. Soon Aria smiles some more and lets Blake take his time, gently lifting him up to her maw so he can climb on in. Once he gauges where to crawl he does so and soon enters the mouth of his crush... willingly.. to be eaten by her... what had he gotten himself into. Blake sighs at that thought and Aria starts to close her mouth, slowly and carefully. Blake lets her and is soon sealed in the humid darkness. He can feel her warm breath, still scented of her dinner.. the scent making Blake's own stomach rumble. Blake yelps softly as Aria's tongue springs to life as it moves and wiggles under him, tasting him, eliciting moans from his crush. Aria rolls him around her mouth a little even softly pressing him against the roof of her mouth. After a few minutes Aria appears to be done tasting Blake and moves him to the back of her mouth- \"Ready?\" she asks softly. Blake is blown away that he experienced Aria's voice from within her own mouth and blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yup ready.\" Aria smiles and lifts her head up, sliding Blake down and into her throat where she swallows him whole. Aria's tight throat squeezes Blake and pulls him down towards the gurgling and groaning belly that is Aria's stomach. Soon he slips past her thumping heart and slides into Aria's full belly. There is still enough chewed up food to make a meal for him just as Aria said. \"Alright. I'm in your stomach now!\" Blake calls out to Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow.. I can actually feel you in there~ Heh even feel your tiny voice~ Tickles\" Aria giggles which causes her belly to jiggle a little and makes Blake lose his footing. He manages to recover and hangs on to bits of chewed up steak. he sighs once more and starts to take in some bites, digging his hands into the chewed up mess. As gross and as covered in as much as Aria's juices as it can be Blake takes a small bite. He chews the food even more and swallows it... not that bad. A little slimy but overall it was still food... Already been chewed food but still food. He blushes and keeps eating until he himself if full. It wasn't much to help Aria's bloated belly but at least the two were happy. Speaking of, some time had passed while he was eating. And while he didn't feel the acids working on him just yet, he didn't want to stay to find out. He calls out to Aria, \"Aria, I'm full.. I can come out now.\" Blake sits and waits for a response...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now, \" the teacher flipped skillfully through the book, \"we're going to read out a few lines from Act 1, Scene 5. Do I have a volunteer for the Nurse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake glanced around from his warm, cozy hiding spot. To be between his love's breasts, unseen by the world... It felt wonderful, but a bit taboo. Around the vast expanse of the classroom, not a single figure moved. He could hear, behind the soft blankets of fabric, Aria's breathing pattern change slightly. Her shoulder, petite but larger than his whole tiny body, shook a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recognized that twitch. She wanted to go up. The mage nudged her slightly, trying not to touch her chest too much. When she didn't take notice, he prodded the mound with his shoulder. It quivered like an animal shaking a fly off. The vibrations resonated through his hand, and down his spine, followed by a flustered mew. She glanced down, blushing. His stomach turned at that expression; how could someone able to hold him in her hand look so helpless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come,\" the instructor scanned the class. \"We can't all play Juliet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered his courage and spoke to the immense beauty surrounding him: \"Do you want to play as her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged back, a sigh escaping her windpipe - like a cool breeze through chimes. He couldn't help but sink deeper into that mass of cleavage. \"Yes, but... I wouldn't want to draw attention to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aria!\" Ms. Solar picked her out. The schoolgirl's soft eyes moved gently from Blake's breast-bound body to the teacher's index finger. The beautiful girl kept her head bowed. \"You don't have to be shy. Come to the front! Now tell me, what is yond gentleman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded quickly, and trotted to the chalkboard, book clutched between her delicate fingers. The whole time, she tried to balance the speed of her footsteps so as not to jostle the shrunken boy. Her right hand hovered in front of her shapely bosom. Blake could only see the world beyond her torso from thin stands of light letting their way through her digits. The class remained indifferent, only a few faces not staring at the clock or out in space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette glanced over her booklet, making mental note of the lines as she breathed in. \"The son and heir of old Tiberio.\"<br>\r\nThe magician had no clear view of his holder's face; still, he could feel something change. The music in her tones gained a quieter, subtle nuance that shivered down his torso. It quivered with pity and concern at the end. She didn't get the name correct, but the emotion that she put in it more than made up for it. For a minute, he was no longer in his class, or in his dream girl's chest; but in medieval Italy through Renaissance eyes, in a feud between families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Let's keep that up. For the part of Juliet, any volunteers?\" The teacher scanned the room, half-lulled to sleep. Rude. Blake felt like casting a curse on them for not listening. At the very least, he thought, they wouldn't be paying much attention if he revealed himself. A low-pitched mumble slid across the stagnant air from the seats in the back. The voice's ring was familiar, even as a distant wind. Almost as if by reflex, Ms. Solar pointed in its direction and declared: \"Nora! Thank you for volunteering!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage's face went pale. The bully he'd feared even at normal size... Now stomping to his spot, murmuring bitterly, gripping her copy of Romeo and Juliet with enough strength to crush a building. What's worse, he knew Ms. Solar would react when this horror of a teen girl gave too much sass. This display of strength that shook him to the core was Nora <i>holding back</i>. He sunk deeper into the chest that held him, his squirms making her giggle a little - though she tried to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs' unprovoked assault on the floor tiles ended when she was next to the brown-haired girl keeping hold of Blake. The two shared a quick gaze - he still couldn't see his love's face, but even Nora's features seemed a touch calmer when looking at her. He could practically feel her breath against him as she went blurted the lines in one mouthful: \"What's he that now is going out of door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, her pronunciation was perfect. And she didn't need to look at the book, unlike Aria. Almost as if she'd read this before. But at the same time, it came out in a dry, single tone; as if the bully didn't know what inflection the characters would use, or what they were feeling. Or, more likely, just didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the eyes in the distance twitched down. The shrunken boy froze. Nora blinked; then squinted; then, her eyes widened; finally, they burned, piercing into him. Like a full solar eclipse, smoldering flames light-years away with a featureless black pit in the center. And they both pointed right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria let out a quick gulp. More than a few eyes pointed at the two. Her hand rose higher; only barely clouding Blake's view of the towering actress opposite her. With an exaggerated turn on her heel, the amber-clad titan continued the recitation: \"Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, what music! What grace! That sweet echo from her lips combined with her natural empathy and quick understanding. It gave this character, whose name he did not know thirty minutes ago, a distinct voice and personality. And to be so close to her... The tiny teen felt ashamed to have forced her up in this situation. He was falling in love with her all over again; and could see himself falling deeper into her grasp with each new tune that slid from her tongue. All this, from just these quick passages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage's vision was now parallel with the classroom door. Still, he could hear his old tormentor's voice growing louder behind him - then, to his side. \"What's he that follows there, that would not dance?\". By the end of the recitation - its monotony only broken by higher-pitched, aggressive emphasis on the last question - she stood before him in all her glory, or lack thereof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a muted gasp, Aria drew back. The hand before Blake's body quivered slightly, but held firm. \"I-I-I know not.\" He nudged it, trying to hide behind the smooth flesh, or deeper into the pillow-like expanse behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora only came closer, like a beast about to leap on its prey. Her voice became slower, placing unnatural power in each syllable. \"Go ask his name: if he be married. My grave is like to be my wedding bed.\" She let out a sly chuckle, like she understood what she was saying. Her own fingers slid out, rubbing the bottom of her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like watching an old-fashioned joust - with his knight rapidly losing ground. But what was the opponent trying for, anyway? With any class members not bored out of their minds gazing up, this bully couldn't just reach into a classmate's shirt... Could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria countered: \"His name is Romeo, and a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.\" She coughed slightly, sending another quake down the little boy's body. She was so cold, and the yellow shirt's surface so smooth, it felt like he could just slide down and disappear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire-eyed girl turned so her back was opposite the class. She spoke again, barely looking at the book: \"My only love sprung from my only hate! Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me, that I must love a loathed enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her palm came flying at Aria's makeshift shield of a hand, slapping it aside - and with it, sending Blake tumbling to the ground. Both girls' clothes whirred by in a blinding mix of warm colours. He reached up helplessly to their silent faces, growing more and more distant. Though the floor approached, he didn't dare to look down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blunt thud, he reached his destination. He heard a few voices murmuring in shock, or sympathy; but none of them seemed anything more than a distant dream to the miles of tiles around him, and the twitching ankles on either end of his diminished body.<br>\r\nAria took notice instantly. Her eyes sparkled, and her soft lips dropped in compassion. She fidgeted for a second, pretending to hesitate on a line. Then, with one quick burst, her legs fell out of her dress, and she dropped to the ground melodramatically. Even having just been between her breasts, the floor-bound boy couldn't help but blush. This was closer to her creamy thighs than he'd ever dreamed of being. She looked up with that same little pout, and cried: \"What's this? what's this?\" Not exactly fitting for the scene, but it served to hide her real actions. The whole time, her left hand grabbed around on the floor to scoop him up. With a second to regain his breath, he ran back for it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And met with Nora's shoe slamming on him. \"A rhyme I learn'd even now, of one I danced withal.\" Everywhere, it stung - the dirt accumulated at the base of her sole hurt his eyes, the grinding pressure she exerted from above tortured his limbs, the terrible performance of Shakespeare above tormented his ears. He reached his hand out for Aria, holding his breath, hoping she could save him from the same gruesome fate of the lovers who defied the stars...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough. Very well done, both of you!\" He could barely hear Ms. Solar's declaration from that distance. Of course, she was just being polite - but it lifted his spirits slightly. Surely, this would save his skin, if not his romance's dainty fingers...</span></div></div>",

Her tongue is small and somehow cute. Aria's teeth are perfect. no cavities or fillings. Blake looks deeper into her widening maw and sees her throat, her small uvula dangling above it. Then splat. Blake is put on Aria's awaiting tongue. Her saliva already soaks his clothes and makes his stick to the tongue. Blake looks up and is pulled into the mouth with the tongue. Aria moans slightly at the taste of Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I taste nice\" Blake mused.Aria seals Blake inside her maw and starts the process of eating him. She rolls his around her tongue, trying to find and even suck the flavor right off of him as if he were some sort of hard candy. He submits and lets his crush toy with him any way she wants. Once she finishes playing with him she moves him over to the back of her throat. Her lips part briefly and he gazes out one last time then is promtly swallowed. The warm wet walls grip Blake and drag him down her soft yet firm throat. He sinks deeper and deeper into his crush. He can hear her lungs fill and exhale and her heart beat as he is soon sent to her stomach. Soon he slips out of her throat and slides into her warm cavernous belly. Some bits of her breakfast linger and curls against one of her stomach walls. Soon her voice booms around him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Blake. I promise to get you out soon. Thank you for this!

She sighs softly as she pulls out her favorite book, the tale of \"Isshunboshi.\" She flips to her bookmarker and picks up her fork digging in a bit into her chicken salad. Her eyes pry at the novel and she begins to eat her lunch, digging into the salad while reading, visualizing the scenes playing out before her. She had read the novel many times prior and was currently on the scene while the shrunken warrior Isshunboshi attempts to get the attention of the princess, however, he is unable to and she accidentally hurts in the process. 'How could someone be so careless,' Indigo thought to herself. She sighed and carried on reading, carrying another piece of food into her mouth. Just then however she hears someone call her name. It was faint but she could definitely hear it. She looks away from her book, looking left and right. but not seeing anyone. Indigo shrugs it off as her imagination and goes back to reading continuing on with her lunch. As lunch continues and Indigo finishes her meal she feels a bit of chicken still left on her tongue. Bored she toys and rolls it around her mouth, sucking off all the flavor it had while she read. She'd swallow it down soon enough. Once she deemed that morsel had lost its flavor she moved it to the back of her mouth and swallowed... She pauses for a moment and looks to her belly. How odd... she almost thought she felt it move... oh well... must have been her tongue or a stray piece or something. Indigo goes back to reading and smiles enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indigo! Indigo!\" Blake shouts. He jumps and waves his arms around to get his classmate's attention. Indigo sits down and sighs and pulls out her book from her pack. <i>I have to get her attention and get back to Aria...</i> Blake muses to himself. Blake then sees Indigo lift her hand above him and reach to the side of the container the salad is in. She lifts her hand up and digs it into the leafy floor. The jab causing Blake to yelps and falls over into the food. He looks up and sees that she is holding a fork that had just pierced the salad he was on. He looks around and realizes the situation he's in. <i>Crap.. if I don't hurry and get her attention I'm going to be...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chomp!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>her lunch...</i> Blake watches as Indigo chews into the food and readies her fork to strike again, all while she reads her book. Blake fruitlessly tries to shout out to her, calling her name, but to no avail. She keeps eating unaware of the shrunken boy afraid for his life. He realizes he cannot get her attention however and starts to make his way over to her. She sighs above him, drawing his attention. Blake looks up and sees her fork coming right for him! He yelps and covers himself to avoid the sharp fork and is thrown to the leafy floor again. He feels the ground under him lift and move. Blake pries his head up from the ground and sees he has been scooped up with Indigo's next bite! Blake's eyes widen and he tries one last time to shout and call out her name, desperately wanting- no, needing to be noticed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INDIGO!\" Blake calls out a final time and everything stops. Blake shuts his eyes and prepares for the worst.. but it never comes. He feels Indigo's warm breath coat him from her nose and looks up see her looking... for something... She must have heard him! Blake smiles and goes to call out again but Indigo shrugs, causing the mage to lose his focus and brace himself on the fork again. He's lost his chance. Indigo opens up her mouth and Blake is quickly shown the warm, wet and slimy interior that is his classmate's mouth. He blushes as her warm humid breath quickly washes against his face. He wipes off the condensed saliva off of his face just in time to be fully inserted inside her maw. Blake scrambles backward but her lips close, sealing him in darkness. Next, her fork pulls out from under him, causing him to fall yet again onto the floor this time it is a mix of chicken, leaves and Indigo's fleshy pink tongue. The muscle under him springs to life as she moves the food towards her teeth  Blake yelps and avoids being pushed as Indigo begins to chew, her ivory teeth gnawing and tearing away the meat and fibers. Spit soaks Blake and forces him to stick more to her tongue, he hugs the muscle, doing his best to avoid getting chewed up. Luckily he manages to avoid being chewed only to have the mush rest on top of him. Indigo slides the mush towards her throat and Blake calls out again, hoping Indigo would hear him. His only response is a simple tongue movement and a resounding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GULP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube of muscle squeezes Blake down towards his classmate's unassuming belly. He is pulled down for seven long seconds before being deposited in Indigo's massive gut. Blake, along with the rest of the meal rest in the fleshy chamber awaiting digestion. Blake throws the food off of him and goes to the nearest wall and begins wailing on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INDIGO! HELP! You swallowed me whole! Get me out!\" His cries go unanswered until a sound echos above him. He looks up and sees more food deposited into the chamber that was his friend's stomach. He looked around and saw mashed up greens and chewed bits of tan chicken all completely unrecognizable had he not known before. Indigo's stomach juices pool near the bottom and start to break down what is present. In this dire situation, Blake thinks on what to do.</span></div></div>",

Indigo was taking off her shoes! Blake blushed a little though he was unsure why. Indigo had now slipped off both of her shoes and rested her black knee high socks onto the cold tile floor. He feet planted firmly on the floor and he could swear he saw a slight mist coming from underneath her feet. The floor was pretty cold... could her feet be that warm? Curious, Blake walked over and the smell of the tropical fruit grew. It must have either been a lotion or body wash. It was mixing with the faint aroma of her sweat and dirt from inside her shoes. The dirt most likely got in there from gym, or in the locker room or the track. Blake was now right next to Indigo's giant foot. Blake, like almost every other guy, didn't know how big her feet were normal sized but from here he would had to have guess maybe a size 7 or 8 in Women's. Right? He shook his head. He noticed that he was not pressing his body against the warm foot. He blushed brightly and backed away, flustered. \"Come on. I've got to get to Aria. But I have to get Indigo's attention first... Blake walked back to her foot and grabbed onto her sock. It was slightly damp. Most likely because she had gym the class before. Or was it that she walked around a bit? Blake tried to figure out which one it was but realized that wasn't helping. He looked up and saw her sock just reached her skirt. All he had to do was climb her and get onto her desk. She'd see him there, answer questions and she'd, hopefully, take him to see Aria. So, Blake started his daunting climb. Grabbing the threads of her sock, he made his way up higher and higher about halfway up her shin when there was a shift under him. He gripped the sock tight and felt himself rise and swing. He closed his eyes until all was still. When everything stopped he opened his eyes to see that Indigo had only crossed her legs. \"Jeez... her just crossing her legs caused earthquake to tilt everything. I need to be way more careful.\" Blake sighed and continued his long climb. The smell wasn't as strong up here, but was still distinguishable. Part of him really wanted to be down there... bask in it some more... was that.. weird? yes.. maybe? But it smelt so good... Blake blushed and shook his head. He continued up her leg and was just at the area where her sock ended and where her skirt hung. Blake smiled to himself \"Halfway there.\" When he got to this point however he paused as two things went through his head... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For some strange reason, Blake just can\u2019t shake away the idea to climb down into Indigo\u2019s right sock. He wonders if the smell was starting to affecting his thinking, but he\u2019s practically entranced. And to be fair, Blake was given the gift of extreme strength and durability, and while he was still in love with Aria, he wouldn\u2019t mind a short diversion into Indigo\u2019s sock. And no one had to know, right? After all, Blake was only an inch tall, so how would Indigo even consciously notice that he was in there? And would she even care enough to check what she felt, if she even felt anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Blake squeezed under the end of Indigo\u2019s knee high sock, and made his way down her leg again, so he could reach her feet and experience them without a sock in the way. It was a bit tight along the sock, which made the climb down slower than Blake would have liked, but it seemed that his presence slightly bothered Indigo. She pulled apart her sock, thinking that she needed to adjust it, which made him tumble quickly down to her foot. Blake landed right next to her instep, and the sock pressed his body into that part of her foot, covering his body with her sweat. But Blake was less interested in this part of Indigo\u2019s foot, so he crawled slowly along her instep towards her toes, which were fairly still and calm. As he was crawling along her foot, it seemed to bug Indigo, as she mumbled to herself \u201cDid my sock get loose or something? Is a pebble in there? It feels really annoying. Stupid thing!\u201d Indigo was annoyed enough by whatever was inside her sock that she started rubbing her feet together, as a way to grind away whatever was itching her. Blake continued to crawl blissfully unaware of how Indigo was reacting to his presence, and was caught off guard once her feet slammed together, carelessly rubbing back and forth into each other. Blake was dragged back and forth across the side of her foot, as Indigo used her left foot to rub into the side of her right foot while slowly positioning it to rub into the sole of her right foot, and that gradual motion eventually sent Blake right under her sole as well. And as she continued to rub her sole, which she thought felt very enjoyable while focusing on class, Blake was haphazardly dragged around against her sole, and since all of her foot sweat seemed to gather around the bottom of her sock, there was plenty around him to act as an effective lubricant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once things settled down, he was closer to her toes, so Blake used that opportunity to squeeze under the ball of her foot to finally get to be right next to her massive toes. Because of his current positioning, when he reached the toe section, he found himself next to her 3rd and 4th toes, and his face head just barely fit in the space in-between them. She instinctively scrunched her toes, covering his face with her built up toe sweat and junk. And in the back of her mind, she thought that she felt a small pebble in her sock, but she was quickly distracted by her school work, so Blake remained undiscovered for the time being. And Indigo just reached a really interesting part of her book, so she was almost completely focused on reading, so whatever she did with her feet and toes, and by extension Blake, would be totally unconscious and unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the bell rang, which proved to be very painful for Blake\u2019s currently much smaller ears. Indigo lazily shoved her shoes back on, which caused her toes to be pressed a bit more close together, which proved to lock Blake\u2019s head in a vice grip of sweaty flesh. And the smell and heat intensified, causing the environment to become a lot more unpleasant. And Blake wondered if this was such a great idea after all. And as she stood up, pressing her full weight into tiny Blake, he wondered how far the spirits\u2019 blessings would take him. And as she stood, she moved and shifted her toes around until she felt like they were completely inside of her shoes, which gave Blake a harsh massage. Blake wondered what class Indigo had next, because he only had afternoon classes with her this year. Where was Indigo\u2019s next class?</span></div></div>",

Now to get home and enjoy the weekend.\" Indigo bent down adding pressure onto her right foot to pick up her bag, then stood up right throwing her backpack on for her walk home. Indigo made her way out of the class, through the crowds, then out onto the main quad area. Indigo waved to passing friends, unaware of the one underneath her foot. She walked down some steps then began her short 25-30 minute walk home. As she was just leaving campus however she noticed how that pebble from under her toes was still there. She wanted to take it out for the walk home, but she didn't want to take off her long socks at school, she had forgot her short socks for gym today and didn't really want anyone to notice. She'd just have to wait until she got home to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ****************************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of her shoe the loud ringing had stopped. After Blake was done wincing in pain he heard Indigo speak, \"Finally.\" Curious he went silent to see if he could notice anything. As he went silent though he noticed a shift as Indigo's foot moved. She had to be standing, getting ready to go to her next class. Blake sighed and tried to calm himself, breathing in the sweaty musk of Indigo's feet in the process. It wasn't too terrible but it wasn't fresh air. Then indigo's giant foot pressed down on him, causing the mage to groan slightly in discomfort. He blushed as Indigo's toes wiggled slightly as she bent down on him. Soon the pressure relented and he could breath somewhat easily now. Indigo was now lifting her foot and was walking, lifting Blake then bringing him back down. Constant slamming down against the hard sole of her shoe and the soft sole and toes of Indigo's foot. It was an odd feeling to say the least, but... not bad. Her feet were so soft that it almost WAS worth it.Blake could hear faintly the sound of his fellow peers outside of this very shoe! It was so strange, no one knew he was trapped underneath Indigo. No one, not even the giant introvert herself did not know. All of it was sparking feelings Blake had never felt before. He blushed but kept quiet. Indigo would go to her next class and he would work an escape plan then, but she kept on walking. The voices of fellow students grew farther and farther away. Where was she going? As Blake was being trampled on he wondered if Indigo was ditching school before he remembered that today was a minimum day, the last day before spring break! Blake struggled slightly, causing a slight irritation to the giantess above. She scrunched her toes \"ugh that pebble is still in there... oh well...\" With that Indigo continued walking. Blake gasped, he had gotten Indigo's attention, but not exactly the way he wanted. It would appear he would have to wait until Indigo got home before he could make his move... but would he even have a chance to? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ****************************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny mage had submitted to being trampled over and over for what seemed like an eternity. A long and grueling journey to Indigo's home. Meanwhile Indigo was simply listening to music and was happy to be almost home. A few minutes later, after almost drowning her passenger in foot sweat, Indigo had made it home. She reached into her book bag and took out her keys. She unlocked the front door and stepped inside <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?! Dad?! I'm home...\" Indigo called out. She waited. No response. \"Mom? Dad? Helloooo?\" She slipped her bag off her shoulder and looked around. It appeared they weren't home. She went into the kitchen and saw a small note that her mother often used. She picked it up and read it. \"Indigo, your father and I were called in for a company meeting. Its upstate and we'll be gone for most of the week. I know you wanted to go to the bookstore so we transferred $200 to your account. We'll be back before you know it. We stocked the pantry and fridge so you won't go hungry. Have fun. Love, Mom and Dad\" \"Huh... I guess i've got the house to myself.\" Indigo smiled slightly. She walked to her room and dropped her bag by the door and slipping off her shoes.

Indigo uses her foot to rub into her arch, pressing the tiny mage into it. The soft foot flesh yields under Blake and Indigo's other mighty foot. Blake now the unfortunate ingredient to an Indigo foot sandwich. Blake blushes and sighs as he contemplates on what to do. He could Wiggle and try to alert Indigo to his presence, but Indigo may just think he's just an itch and snuff him out just like before. Or worst case she feels him and thinks he's some sort of bug and squishes him. He know the spirits were protecting him, but he doubts the spirits could prevent hundreds of pounds of teenager being forced upon him.He could wait for her to take off her socks, but that could take all day... if not all night! Either way weren't too pleasing ways to go about this, but from his point of view it was the only two options he could think of on the spot.</span></div></div>",

Indigo eventually gets to the bed and is lifted up with her foot while she rests it on her knee. She starts to take off her long sock but Blake remains stuck fast to her sole.

Step, rise, step, rise, step, rise. Lift, splat, lift, splat, lift, splat. The sweat had now dried partially, almost gluing Blake to the enormous foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... well at least school is done\" Indigo smiles as she lays onto her bed. She drags her feet onto the bed and starts to slip off her socks. She slips them off and wiggles her purple painted toes, smiling. She flips to her bookmark and sighs dreamily. She was at the part where the shrunken hero had finally made it to the capital. The hero, Issunboshi, was born at only an inch in height and he had stayed that way into his adulthood. He finally ventured out into the world to explore and adventure, running into perilous journeys on his way to the nation's capitol. He had just arrived and accidentally ended up in the Emporer's daughter's slipper. She was reading the part when she arrives in her room and they are about to meet.

There were plenty of other students in the class, who'd be just as horrifying. Blake tried not to let the thought get to him. He focused simply on the quick arm motions. Up, down. His climb went in sync with Indigo's writing pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen - she stopped. Her expression showed a hint of confusion. His shoulders relaxed for a second - tensing up again when he felt himself slipping on the smooth slope. Had she noticed him? Taking a hopeful gasp, he released the air in his lungs with a large \"Indy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stood up. With a lead-darkened paper in hand, she began a short walk to to the front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kept shouting as the skirt's gentle wafts tugged him back and forth once more. Her skyscraper-like legs kept pushing against his platform, restructuring it around their shape with every step. After a few booming impacts below, far louder than he expected, the mage glanced down instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad idea. Baaaaaad idea. He was dizzied by the distant floor tiles: the incredible pace with which the simple pattern flew by; the sheer drop below; and the constant shaking around. Despite that, he kept climbing - it was the only route to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when Indigo stopped at the teacher's desk, her skirt kept moving. She pointed to one part of the page. \"Excuse me - does this question refer to Everest, or Kilimanjaro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could only barely see the teacher peering over the page. \"Oops, that was supposed to be on the other side. It's asking about Fuji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, that's much clearer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the terse discussion reaching its end, Indigo turned back to her seat. The rotation did nothing for Blake's growing dizziness. His green face clashed with the purple clothing he kept a firm grip on. The thumping below kept repeating, either massive leg stretching up and swinging forward into the horizon. And yet, her desk looked as if it were kilometers in the distance. The rest of the world was blurred by speed, fear, and the unbelievable perspective. Head spinning, he called out: \"Spirits... spirits, please help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold wind rushed by his neck - and not just from the pace of the girl's immense stride. The wisps from before whistled by... Leaving a tiny capsule of motion-sickness medicine in his robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, the blue shoes finally stopped moving, having returned their owner - and her unknown passenger - to her desk. The mage sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sigh quickly returned as a desperate gasp when his bespectacled eyes refocused. His little fold of the skirt was right under Indigo's firm backside! He felt the world rocking as she moved to take a seat. The mage's arms rushed to pull himself to the side - but the skirt's gentle swaying brought him back. The chair below grew closer and closer. Blake scurried up his friend's clothing, forcing his arms up - but the curve of her butt, which presently devoured the light of the ceiling, made for too steep a surface. Shutting his eyes, he let go, enhanced durability reducing the pain from his collision with the seat. But no matter how swift he was, it was too late to outrun the looming butt as it descended towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, everything went black. Then, purple. The body heat that Blake felt earlier now permeated through him, an uncomfortable warmth that engulfed his tiny form. He felt the fabric pressing against his face, pinning it down mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegathering his strength, the shrunken boy pushed back against the young woman's clueless compression. He pressed hard, face first turning red from embarrassment at his position, then blue from lack of air. Pausing for a breath, he could barely grab anything from under the rump. What little air circulated around had that same faint, fruity hint of lotion. Under these conditions, Blake's next few attempts were even less fruitful: every time he tried for her attention, or just to get her to move her backside a smidgen, he found himself collapsing sooner, and he found the squeezing from Indigo's butt harder to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an aching in his arms, he opted to simply try squirming out, slowly wiggling his body side to side like a worm in mud. Blake made gradual progress, thanks to the smooth texture of his robes and the skirt surrounding him. However, that was quickly undone. Indigo - feeling something vaguely uncomfortable underneath her, like a princess with a pea - began squirming herself, readjusting her backside's position on the seat. The simple fidget rolled her friend left and right across her cheek. He was unprepared for the weight pressing against his torso - then his side, then his back. His exposed face and hands brushed against the purple-coated mountain at least four times before she finally stopped, her whole weight falling onto Blake's tired shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis black hair and clothing were in a mess from being jostled so much - to say nothing of the pain shooting through his slender limbs, or the nausea churning and boiling in his chest. But he had a mission at hand, and his mind was not going to give in, despite his total helplessness under the backside of a teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forced himself to focus, trying to shield his mind from the reality pressing down on him. There had to be some way out - some path that let him keep scaling upwards, and into Indigo's range of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice, though a quiet murmur to the rest of the class, shook the mage's body: \"So, height relative to Fuji would be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother slight wiggle from above squeezed him harder into the seat, nearly flattening the boy. He held his breath, curling in a little ball to endure it. Think... He needed to get out of the chair. But how?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Blake continued to climb up Indigo,  the 14-year-old, Asian high school girl and classmate of his that was wearing a blue shirt, a dark purple skirt, and blue shoes looked down to see what was bothering her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw it, she was surprised. A little bug? That's what was bothering her leg? Shaking it a bit, Indigo saw the bug freeze as if it knew it was caught. Amused at the bug seemingly understanding that, she brushed it from her let to the floor with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just how to take care of you...Don't worry, little bug,\" Indigo said with a smirk, \"This won't hurt a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, Blake felt a immense amount of pressure on top of his body. He felt the moist, sweaty fibers of Indigo's sock. Blake also noticed the cheesy smell that the sock was emitting as it crushed him. It was far too heavy to resist against. As much as he tried, the sock had completely conquered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta grind it, or it may still be there.\" Indigo said and started twisting her foot on the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake screamed for mercy as his entire body was now squished from ALL SIDES by Indigo's disgusting, sweaty, raunchy socks as he felt he was going to be torn apart. He couldn't move a single muscle, as he helplessly sank deeper and deeper into the tree trunk-sized sweaty socked fibers covering Indigo's sole. An embarrassing fate indeed, smothered and swallowed by Indigo's feet. In his mind, Blake felt as though he'd truly become one with her foot. Her smell completely overtook the little mage. The very air he breathed was now 100% tainted by Indigo's horrible foot. Foot stench filled Blake's nostrils and lungs, and slowly goes through his blood stream like some type of drug, making Blake loose his mind. Though it was pure black on the underside of the monolithic foot, Blake could swear he could see Indigo's socked foot, playfully squeezing and squishing him over and over again, as if it were chewing, trying to make him a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo didn't step on the bug with her full weight, but she applied enough pressure to keep it firmly pressed against the ground. Enjoying the feel underneath her foot as the bug begin to struggle with all it's might, trying it's best to escape from under her black knee high socks. Indigo moaned as she felt the bug squirm under her sole. \u201cThat feels rather nice.\u201d She informed it. \u201cIn fact I want you to keep struggling just like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake yelped as Indigo began rubbing her humongous foot against him, using his tiny, struggling body as a foot massager for the next 30 minutes. By the time she had used him massaging every crevice of her socked left foot, Blake was panting with exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of Indigo grinding him under her sole, Blake was raised along with the foot he was now throughly stuck to and she saw Indigo's other foot getting closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooooooooooooooo\", he yelled at the top of her lungs, as the colossal foot came in contact. Indigo sandwiching Blake in between them. Blake was completely surrounded by smelly sock fibers. The thick, cheesy smell of Indigo's socks were extremely powerful, and they were rubbing the smell all over his miniscule body. She stopped rubbing her feet together, but, seeing how comfortable she was now, she kept them together in an attempt to suffocate the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good hour, the socked  foot was removed and replaced with Indigo's face. \"Still around, bug?\" she asked, seeing it still intact somehow after all that, Indigo bent down and picked up one of her shoes and peeled the bug off her foot before she held it over the opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your new home.\" she said. Peering down into the foul smelling cavern, Blake bit his lip nervously \"Please don't tell me she's gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Indigo released him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was sent plummeting downwards, Upon making contact with the insole of Indigo's shoe, he simple bounced on it like a jellotine-like surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsweat the insole had absorbed had made it near spongy and had cushioned Blake's landing. \"Gross\" Blake complained as he stood up and wiped some of the moistness from his body. Walls surrounded him on every side. The floor underneath him was soft and spongy and felt wet to the touch. The atmosphere of this place was incredibly hot and humid, making being in the area a truly unpleasant place for the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Blake saw Indigo looking down at him within her shoe. He face eclipsing everything, demanding his attention as she loomed over him like a goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww ...you look so cold and lonely in there, little bug, don't worry...let me fix that for you by giving you some company. Here comes the FOOO~OOOT!\" she said, then her face pulled away. Then the footwear tilted and Blake's eyes widened. A sock-covered foot that he'd gotten very familiar with entered the boot and drew near him. Blake, filled with panic, ran until he was in the toe section of the shoe. and had to turn around to face the beast that pursued him as Indigo's foot caught up with him and forced him onto his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpless, as it poured over him. Trapping him beneath it. Smothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo smirked as she trapped the bug inside her footwear, then went about her day. Upon arriving home, Indigo removed her shoes and turned them upside down and shook her shoe, surprised when the bug fell out, completely whole, it seemed to look up at her, then bolted away in the opposite direction...at least until Indigo pinned it between her black knee high sock-covered feet and lifted them into the air, raising the bug along with them as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now...trapped inside my shoes all day and you're completely intact...credit where it's due, little bug. You're pretty durable.\" Indigo said, impressed. Then she thought about what to do with her bug next and came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

Below, her socked soles shifted gently against the room's floor, sending painful thoughts shooting down in her shrunken friend's brain. Was she about to put him back in that prison? Was there something he said that would make her mad? He flinched visibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo's mouth curled downwards in response. Her fingers began to curl up, as if she wanted to pet him. \"It's... It's getting sorta late, huh. I think it'd be best just to tell Jade you're sleeping over with me, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated, thinking of how badly his little sister could take the situation, before nodding slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo's giant lip curled, showing the handheld boy the soft ridges making it up. \"Don't feel I'm forcing you.\" She tapped the side of his leg slowly, before brushing the side of her index across it. He shuddered at the digit's size compared to him. \"I'm not kidnapping you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure how to respond, the black-clad boy held his hand to her finger, feeling the smooth print sink into his palm. \"If you don't want me here, I can get her to pick me up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. You really know how to make me feel guilty.\" She pushed her face in closer. It was all Blake could see as her eyes pointed right at his minuscule form. Her cheeks, spread out like mountains at either end of his line of vision, were still bright red, contrasting with the clothes he'd just been uncomfortably close to. It reminded him of looking up at her uncaring visage from the base of her dampened insole, helpless to react as the monolith of a sock entered, filling all space with its wriggling wrinkles and all breathable air with its fruity, cheesy musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his thoughts, he yelped a little, shivering and trembling. He only realized what he was doing after it came out; Indigo was still looking down, her eyes now a bit wider - her hold not as sturdy. In her other hand, she took out her cellphone to text Jade about the arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't ignore that elephant in the room.\" When the enormous girl finished texting, she slowly knelt on her couch, ensuring the movement wasn't too brisk or intense for the mage. \"You've just come out from my shoe after hours of me stepping on you and taunting you. That's...\" she bit her lip. \"That's bound to leave a mark on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't what he was expecting. She was always friendly, but a little suspicious, giving him quick looks as if he were up to something - as if he were some scientific oddity she'd been assigned to analyze. But now, her shoulders were shivering gently; her gigantic feet below folded over one another shyly, toes tugging at the material. For some time, he'd been in fear of his life, nearly becoming one with his friend's toejam, begging quietly for mercy from a cruel goliath above as she smothered him effortlessly. Now, even from his perspective, she seemed very... small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake answered gently, but clearly as possible: \"It's fine, r-really.\" He dusted the side of his black shirt, which still had the aroma of Indigo's foot lotion, and was still moist from the misty sweat built up below her socks. \"My powers stopped me from getting hurt. And besides, y-you didn't know who I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she'd positioned her hand, Indigo had to look up to see him. He could see the details of her body grow fainter, harder to make out, as they stretched down further. \"Does it matter? Even if you weren't shrunken, even if that was a bug - what would you think of me, pushing something helpless around like that? Stomping it again, and again... brushing its face into my sole... squeezing the life out of it until it refuses to fight back...\" She gasped for breath, her palm feeling far warmer and sweatier. \"...And... And getting such a RUSH from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe deposited him on the bed, as if she didn't trust her trembling hand to keep him safe. With that done, she curled up, her knees towering high over Blake. Instantly, her arms slumped over them, and her face fell into it, hiding her eyes. Nothing she said was wrong. Indigo's unstoppable stomping had shocked Blake, and scared him - but also, made him feel pathetic and worthless. Back there, in the sweaty confines of her footwear, he'd nearly accepted that was the end. That he was crazy to think he could impress Aria, an ant like him. That Indigo even acknowledging him was a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, those thoughts had left. The classmate whose head he had to crane up to see... She'd never looked so insecure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" he finally said, taking cautious steps closer, \"you lost control. I don't blame you. We've both been pushed around by bullies. We're both just trying to grab a good hold on things.\" He kept gazing up as he walked, pausing occasionally. \"We both want to feel like we're stronger - like we matter to the world. That's... That's why I wanted to impress Aria - she makes me feel special. And that's why...\" He gulped. \"I guess that's why you said all that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes twitched slightly, revealing the hints of moisture clinging to her sole, like morning dew touching grassy fields. \"I'm just... I didn't know that was in me.\" She was murmuring into herself now, at a volume so low that Blake wouldn't have heard it had he been any bigger. \"I thought I was above that. I don't want to - to lose control again. Especially when it could hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a straight minute, they were both quiet. They barely moved, the only sound their bated breath. Blake could see her thin stomach moving slowly with each breath - noticing they were slower than his own. She twisted her head to him, moving her lip as if to say something else - before looking away quickly, her hair slumping downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took a hesitant step forward. He went to the only part of her body he could reach without trying to climb her again - the side of her foot - and, after momentary uncertainty, stroked it with the back of his palm. He repeated the motion; the now-familiar fibres receding easily to his gentle touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell hadn't grown any less strong, a mix of pungent sweat and lotion. And the ball of her foot had an uncomfortable texture - spongey, drenched with liquids, full of loose threads and bits of lint that rubbed off onto him. But that didn't matter. In an instant, he fell right into it. His arms stretched as far as they could, and he pressed his torso against the dirty surface in a long hug.<br>\r\nThe girl only now took notice of his actions. He could feel one of her toes twitch in surprise, before stiffening, too scared of his safety to move. Blake wrapped his arms around that digit, moving both limbs gently as if petting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm not mad, Indigo.\" He gasped for air, letting the odor fill his lungs; and looked to the ground as he spoke, too shy to look up. \"It was scary. I still can't believe I'm here. But - but it's over now. Please, don't - don't be hard on yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched wordlessly as he kept embracing her sole. Soon, his petting turned into a full-out massage. He nearly buried his face into the cotton to hide it, letting the wetness cover his entire body. And... Despite having been subjected to that torture, he didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo managed a smile, supporting her chin with her hands. \"You're too forgiving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it.\" He moved slowly across the tips of her toes, still rubbing - sending gentle sensations through Indigo's sole. \"You're always there for Aria and I. No matter what the two of us do, even if it... it doesn't work out between us...\" He sniffed gently, nervous about even addressing that possibility - and inhaling a bit of the warm, odorous air. \"...You'll still be our friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still trust me?\" She leaned in closer, face nearly overtaking his body. It had the same puzzled look as if she were trying to solve a tough problem at school - not nearly as intimidating as it was seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked up. \"Yeah.\" As soon as that happened, he noticed how long he'd been rubbing her foot - and how much he'd thrown himself into it. His shirt almost consisted more of sweaty lint than its original fabric. He nearly jumped back from his friend in surprise. Had he really gotten THAT used to the smell and texture so quickly? The tiny mage started wiping the dirty substance off., giving a squeaky, high-pitched apology: \"Sorry! Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft lips remained in a tiny, subtle smile, almost impossible to make out. She blinked. \"If it makes you feel better, I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little boy knew what that meant: his massage was making <i>Indigo</i> feel better. Nodding quietly, he tossed himself back in, squeezing the skin beneath the sock within his arms. She slowly stretched herself out on the cushions, revealing the rest of her sole to the air; the worn material of her sock was darker and thinner near her heel. Blake kept holding on, now squeezing into the arc of her foot. His increased strength didn't just let him survive her footsteps; it let his friend feel his touch more intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something nudge the back of his neck. Looking backwards, his face with the overpowering big toe of her other foot - but now, just tapping him affectionately. Almost snuggling him. He heard his friend whispering above: \"Here comes the fooo~ooot!\" What was once a fear-inducing echo was now affectionate and... almost soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the background of Blake's continued motion, Indigo slowly fell asleep. The miniature mage didn't notice until he looked up, and saw her eyes shut - shoulders slouched back on the cushion. It was still unreal. She was still unbelievably huge, overwhelmingly powerful... But he wasn't scared. Her body stretched out like a slumbering mountain range, but - it was still Indigo, despite everything. In this gigantic room, he felt safe.</span></div></div>",

He sighed and looked past Indigo's sock as Indigo slept peacefully. Perhaps it was time for him to rest as well. He noticed how he was not too disgusted with Indigo's foot smell as much but he was unsure whether or not he wanted to be near his tormentors.. even if they were soft to the touch. Blake finally takes a step back and looks at Indigo's sleeping form. Stretched out it really is like a mountain range. Literal Foot hills, valleys plains, hills and her mountainous face. She literally was a whole world to him. The whole concept was mind blowing. As much as he cursed the spirits.. something thanked them for giving him this new perspective. Blake sighs once more and looks around him for a place to sleep. He could potentially sleep here, next to her feet. But the looming thought of them wakening and toying with him stays, but Indigo knows its him... she'd remember.. right? Just in case he could also sleep next to or even ON Indigo, but choosing where might be a tricky thing to do as well as getting there... and explaining why he's there in the first place. Or he could take the long and definately safe route and make it to her nightstand. He'd be safe and out of harms way... but away from the warmth of Indigo... Blake paused as he realized what he just thought. \"The warmth of Indigo?\" He looked once more over the sleeping giantess and noticed that it was indeed warm around her. It may just be her feet, but it was still apparent. Shaking away these thoughts he knew he had to get some rest. And if he was going to do it, he was going to do it...</span></div></div>",

He climbs onto her foot and started making his trek up her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo slowly breathing in her sleep makes it so Blake can feel every part. He were also amazed at how smooth indigo's tan legs were. He knew indigo shaved her legs but there wasn't a single hair. Blake kept climbing and steps onto her clothes trying to avoid stepping on any sensitive places. After some time Blake finally arrived at her breasts. He consider going for them but quickly think against it as he knew it would be wrong to take advantage of his friend. Especially now. He look left and see her hand.

Oh thank you Blake, this is honestly one of my favorite fantasies... \" She smiles and lifts the tiny mage to her face. She opens her mouth and exhales on the tiny boy. The warm breath nearly blowing him over.. the scent within the maw smelling faintly of sweets and flesh. Indigo extends her tongue onto her palm and waits patiently for Blake to climb inside. Blake, blushing, steps onto the tongue. It feels soft and yields under his steps. The squishy surface strange and uneven. Soon he resigns himself to crawling, his hands on her soft taste buds. It feels odd but he keeps going until he is halfway where Indigo retracts her tongue along her her passenger and closes her lips, sealing Blake in warm, humid, darkness. Blake can then feel movements under him as Indigo's tongue rises and gently pins him to the roof of her mouth. He can hear Indigo moan softly as she tastes him. Apparently by the sound of it he tastes really good. A few minutes of taste testing later and Blake feels movement again. Apparently she is getting ready to swallow. Blake braced himself for what was to come. Then it happens. Indigo lifts her head and swallows, pulling Blake into her throat. The tight flesh smells sweet like candies but also is very humid and very hot. Blake also can feel Indigo's fingers trace him down her throat.. past her collar.. into her chest, past her beating heart. <b>Th-thump Th-thump Th-thump</b> then he stops.... before slipping into a open chamber of pulsating, wiggling flesh. She did it.... She really ate him. He is currently inside her stomach. Blake looks around and sees that Indigo hasn't eaten for a while. he gets up and walks around a bit before he feels the cavern move and shake, followed by giggles from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can... I can feel you in there... moving around... it... tickles\" Though Blake couldn't see, he could tell that she was smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you uh... enjoying this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! This is so cool! What's it like in there?\"Blake took a second to observe his surroundings more clearly. It was very dark, warm and squishy. It smelled of sweets and he could see a mushed and half digested mass of what could have been a candy or mint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its all... moving... very squishy...very dark too..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on... does this help?\" After she said that it became a bit brighter behind Blake. \"I lifted my shirt and pointing it towards my window. Can you see better now?\" Blake took a second look around and saw the vast cavern in near full color. It was red and pulsating, the muscles along the walls looked tough but through Blake's experience they yielded easily. It was like being on another planet.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can actually see a lot ... e-even what you had for breakfast...\"Indigo chuckled a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I ate before waking you up... it was then I actually remembered I fantasized about this.\" Blake could hear muffled tapping outside. Indigo was patting her belly. \"It... feels nice having you inside me Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its... certainly interesting... do you.. think I can come out soon?\"</span></div></div>",

No, not just anyone: Blake. She blushed even more when she thought about how honest and caring and forgiving he was. One thing put a bit a damper on her mood, though. He <i>did</i> say the whole 'squishing him like a bug' thing was water under the bridge, but like a lot of things he talked about, he couldn't help but mention...<i>her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, trying to dismiss her stupid, irrational anger towards Aria, but it still hung at the back of her mind.

God, this was the luckiest day of her life! Blake, shrunk down in her hands, not just tolerating her feet, but <i>telling her how much he wants to be with them</i>.

He hadn't moved or reacted at all when she planted that big, wet one on him. Worry swept over her thoughts as she asked, \"Hey, Blake...are you okay?\" The shrunken mage could only manage a squeak, his face as red as a tomato. Indigo soon matched him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm s-sorry, Blake,\" she muttered, \"That was out of line\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer apology was cut short as she saw him fall to his knees in her hand. At first she panicked, thinking that he fainted, but soon enough she felt the same soothing sensation she felt when Blake massaged her feet. He had started to hug her fingers, nuzzling up to them. She smiled blissfully at his loving touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Indigo, I...enjoyed that,\" he paused,\"a <i>lot.</i>\" He kissed the tip of her pointer finger as he reassured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her worries and insecurities tended to, Indigo happily plopped back down onto her bed, Blake in tow.</span></div></div>",

Blake's own body smelled of Indigo's feet and maybe it was the scent that was causing him to want to go back? To familiarity? He shakes his head and gazes at the giant pair of soles before him and finds himself blushing, not because of what happened... but .. because of something else. Some part of him was telling him... he liked what he saw. Was telling him he liked.. Indigo! But.. that's crazy.. he did this for Aria not for her! Was he really starting to have feelings for Indigo... or more specifically.. her feet? Blake shakes his head to try and push away the thought. As he looks forward he finds he is still in front of Indigo's feet. With his face beet red he sighs and thinks of what to do, his mind trying to wrap his head around why he is suddenly interested in Indigo's feet. His mind comes up with a few ideas of what to do some making them embarrassed.</span></div></div>",

Again in his contemplation, he notices his legs moving on their own, moving him towards her sole. HIs hands lift again and he presses into the soft sock fabric. The sock is no longer damp, now simply dry and warm. The fibers of the wall in front of him gave way easily under his presses. It was now he realized just how much details he could take in at this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo must have had a sort of lavender lotion on her feet that gave them a flowery scent, however, it did nothing to hide the sweaty scent of hours of being at school. While the fibers of the sock were soft, they were, at his size, slightly fuzzy. Whether that was by design or something that happened over time, the sock was now fuzzy with bits of the sock frayed and threatening to come loose at the threads. Hidden underneath, he could feel a vast warmth that he could rationally deduct was Indigo's heel. The thickest part of her foot was surprisingly soft. Given his experience, with the rest of his classmate's foot, he knew just how soft her foot was. Despite her monstrous stomps and crushes, his body melded perfectly into indigo's soft socked soles. Blake was unsure if he had Indigo's foot care habits or her socks to thank for his assisted survival. He sighed and breathed in the stale scent of cheesy sweaty feet around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was comforting surprisingly. Despite what he had just gone through, he felt as if he was somehow attracted to these mighty soles of his classmate. They have an inexplicable warmth and exude sheer power.<i>Maybe this is some type of Stockholm Syndrom.</i> Blake thought to himself. It had to be. Blake continued to rub the giant soles. They towered over him and he felt some strange desire to be with them. Thet he needed to be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is getting weird.</i> Blake thinks to himself.<i>Besides I... I still have to get to... Aria.</i> Blake looks at his friend's feet once more and saw their giant fuzzy selves. Blake sighed and rubbed his eyes, his rubbing and service making himself tired.</span></div></div>",

At least with the life savers they would at least melt without being chewed. At least.. he hoped Indigo was that kind of person. He stands among the top of the small candy spire and shouts to Indigo. He shouts and he shouts but it appears to fall on deaf ears as Indigo listens to the lesson and focus on writing than to the tiny mage by her sweets. Blake sighs and sits to ponder of a new plan, not bothering to move. He could keep climbing her shirt to her desk.. but that might be more risky... he could go behind her bu- hey! Blake suddenly snapped back to reality when he felt the warm, soft, but firm embrace of Indigo's hand. He tried to struggle but he could not move at all. He looked up to see Indigo listen to the lesson, not even bothering to look down at her sweets... her meal. Blake tried to call out but was too shocked to do anything. By the time he had worked up the nerve to call out. Indigo had dropped him and the saver onto her tongue.. and sealed her lips. Blake saw the light disappear from the fleshy maw. He could faintly see the outline of teeth and could feel the softness of the tongue underneath him.It felt.. nice for some reason. Like a waterbed except alive. In an instant Blake felt what felt like thick water surround his feet. He looked down and saw it was actually Indigo's saliva! \"Ewww...\" he said disgusted. He barely had time to react to what happened next Indigo started to swish Blake and the candy around her maw, licking and sucking on the sweet treat. At first Blake was terrified but something... made it feel... better? He snapped out of it as he literally swallowed some of Indigo's spit \"Ugh I've heard of swapping spit but this is ridiculous\" He then realized how sweet her spit was due to the candy and as much as he hated to admit it to himself, it tasted ... nice. Then there was another shift. Blake was spun around and landed on his back looking up at the palette of her mouth. He rolled over and saw the entrance to her throat, he blushed brightly seeing how close he was to being a tiny morsel for his friend. He felt Indigo's tongue move underneath him. A pool of saliva was pooling towards the back of her mouth. She was getting ready to swallow! Thinking quickly, Blake ...</span></div></div>",

He realized that just as Indigo's great tongue lifted and then -*Gluck*- He was swallowed. Or in the process of it. Indigo's throat muscles seized the shrunken boy and pulled him down Indigo's throat. He slid right past Indigo's beating heart and heavy lungs, the sounds of Indigo all around him. He even heard, and felt, the grumbling below him. His destination, Indigo's stomach. The tiny mage, slipped head first into the valve, then into the cavernous belly. Blake slid down one of the walls and got up, wiping off the spit and mucus on him. He stood still, blushing. He was inside Indigo. This sort of things only happened in cartoons, but this... this was all so real. It is real! Blake continued to gaze at the ceiling and walked towards the belly's walls. The entire room or cave was alive, literally. Everything was moving and making sounds. The sound of Indigo's heart beating softly in the distance and the gurgles of the space he was in, attempting to break down this small snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo was trying to save this candy for a bit longer, but her mouth was full of saliva. She positioned it away from her throat to only swallow the spit and eventually see what kind of candy it was. As she was about to swallow, the candy slipped down her tongue and was swallowed with her spit. \"Oop... whoops.. oh well,\" Indigo said, not too concerned. She'd hopefully find another piece like that. As she tried to go back to work... she couldn't help but trace where that candy was going. She felt it. It slid down her throat, smoothly, creating a tiny lump in her throat as it sank. She felt it pass into her chest then slide into her stomach. She rested a hand on her covered belly. \"Hmm.... odd\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside of Indigo, Blake was starting to get concerned. Things had already started to digest and melt already. He was starting to wonder if this was a good idea.</span></div></div>",

Bubbles of all sizes floated out of the boiling green lake, some smaller than Blake, others much bigger. This could be his ticket out of here! With little else to cling onto, the tiny mage took a leap of faith and was taken in by one of the larger bubbles, rising up Indigo's throat with it. He dared not move too much as he was carried toward his giantess friend's mouth, fearing that one mistake could pop his vessel and spell certain doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fist to her mouth, Indigo managed to stifle a belch before feeling something land on her tongue. It didn't feel at all like the candy she'd swallowed...in fact, it didn't taste like candy at all! The Asian introvert spat the unfamiliar object covertly into her palm, then took a closer look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake..?!\" Indigo reacted. Despite her shock, she kept her voice down so as to avoid disrupting class. \"How...what in the world happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can explain...\" Blake stammered, shaking as much saliva off of his puny body as possible. \"I'm a mage...I made a deal with spirits to become tough so I could impress Aria...but I ended up shrunk as payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo stared at the shrunken boy in her hand. He always was a little unusual to her, seeming like he was up to something. But all he wanted was to win Aria's heart. Despite how surreal the circumstances were, she couldn't argue with the fact that Blake was now half an inch in size and standing atop her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Indigo finally said. \"I...I knew you were different, Blake, but...this is a real eye-opener.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh...uh...\" Blake blushed. \"Th-thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could help you get to Aria, but right now I need to get back to work.

She grabs Blake and lowers him towards the candy bag. Just before Blake can ask what she's doing she pulls him back up and promptly places him in her mouth. Blake then realizes she was pretending to go back into her snack bag to make it less conspicuous. Inside Indigo's maw is her long wiggly tongue. Blake's hands again sink into the familiar slimy muscle causing him to groan and blush softly. Indigo lets out a small satisfied moan and smiles gently rubbing her tongue back on Blake. Blake sighs as he is subsequently tossed around, albeit more gently as before, blushing as he realized Indigo was enjoying his flavor. He simply grumbles and lets her toy with him, figuring there wasn't much point struggling.</span></div></div>",

Her ditzy mind quickly thought about where to hide Blake, but remembering her cheer uniform had no pockets, she could only think of one place to hide you... \"I'd better hide you... in my mouth! No one will ever think to look for you there, and you'll be safe all day! It's perfect!\" Blake brought his palm to his face. No one was looking for him in the first place, which was part of the problem... And where did she get the idea that-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further ado, Ruby quickly brought Blake face-to-mouth, the rushing G forces bringing Blake to his bottom before its glory. He watched as her recently cherry chap sticked lips pulled apart to reveal a dark pink tongue, salivating for his arrival. Apparently Ruby was subconciously looking forward to this, as a large thread of saliva connected the roof of her mouth, before collapsing down with a splash as her tongue slithered out of her mouth. Blake was unceremoniously dumped onto the tip of her ruby red tongue, which quickly retreated into its dank cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Blake was assaulted by a steamy and smelly atmosphere, surrounded by saliva. The minty smell of toothpaste had begun to wear off after Ruby's breakfast, leaving behind the smell of milk and cereal as aftertones to the spearmint. The saliva quickly covered the boy, coming from below and above, soaking him in their smell and taste. A bit quickly got in his mouth - tasting quite like it smelled - and while the taste wasn't as terrible as he was expecting, this wasn't how he wanted to get his first kiss. He was then thrown about the mouth as Ruby took off running - she realized she was late, and had to hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Blake, this thought quickly took hold of the ditzy cheerleader's mind, and soon she forgot about his situation in her mouth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake's body bounced from cheek to cheek. Every second he felt he could have a break, Ruby pushed him somewhere else within the cereal-scented caverns. Part of it was from her pumps pounding against the floor; each of the continuous steps sent him flying up. Her duties as a cheerleader gave her excellent agility, and that translated to her tiny prisoner as a sensation of nearly flying in her mouth, feet lifting off the ground, scarcely a thing to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even if she weren't so fast, her tongue's subconscious motions were enough to subdue him on their own. The pink behemoth grasped him, pushed him, poked him, prodded him, brushed its buds roughly against his torso, pinned him to different spots of muscle, and coated him with the girl's sweet fluids. The most flexible muscle on the body - Blake had heard it before, but this was undeniable proof. He screamed for help. Nothing. Nobody could tell he was in there. Caught in the jaw of a cute classmate. Hidden helplessly behind her molars and makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to science class swung open with a conspicuous THUD. The students' heads turned in perfect synchronization to the entrance; a panting silhouette took the frame, leaning against the side. Sweat formed around Ruby's blonde bangs. Part of it was a result of her dash to get back into class; but more formed from embarrassment at the classroom's gaze. There were times she loved being the center of attention, encouraging emotions in others - cheer practice, sports events. The middle of a lesson was not one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella Weiss, the teacher, broke the silence: \"Ruby! What an unexpected surprise. Whatever brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman's stare was hard for anyone to read. And if the cheer captain opened her mouth, she'd reveal Blake to the world... Ruby could only respond with a simple shrug, before scurrying to her desk. The staring eyes didn't stop. She hastily pulled out her workbook, placing it upright on the table - hoping to hide her face. It'd provide her internal passenger an extra layer of disguise - not to mention hide her rosy blush. Her anxiety made her teeth chatter gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>CHOMPCHOMPCHOMP</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog forming around Blake's glasses from her shallow breathing was the least of his concerns. In fact, he was almost relieved to have blurry vision; the vistas inside Ruby's mouth were too much for him to handle all at once. The folds across her mouth's roof, in an even pattern, coated with liquid stalactites of saliva that could nearly drown him... The glisten of her perfectly-straight teeth, and the soft gums holding them in place... And worst of all, the gaping, pitch-black path of her throat, leading down to the gurgling depths of her stomach! None of those sights would do anything for his quaking shoulders or intense heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, he couldn't ignore the situation. After her run ended, there was a brief moment of stillness within his cavernous prison. In that fleeting moment, he felt hope. The dizziness ended. He could start to feel where his body ended and Ruby's began again. A bit of light formed beneath his black shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her teeth started moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage barely had time to realize he was resting on Ruby's left molar before the top one closed on him. The maxilla squeezed him down with a quick, brisk push, flattening him against the smooth, hard texture. Why? Why had the towering blonde's mind jumped to THIS as a hiding space?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure left his body as suddenly as it came down. He quickly rubbed over his shrunken chest and toothpick-like legs, Her chomp had torn into his clothing, but there was no damage to his skin. In fact, there wasn't even a dent! The spirits, for all their trickery, had done wonders for his minuscule body's strength and endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he felt the wall of gigantic teeth falling on him again. It crushed his arm against his torso, before lifting again. And falling, this time pressing hard into his leg. And raising, lifting him slightly from the enamel platform, effortlessly flipping his body over. And squeezing down, this time into his back. Rapidly, the teeth descended and ascended, chattering, chewing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his arms out, hoping to push back against the constant pressure. If he could just remind Ruby he was in there, maybe she'd stop subjecting him to this careless cruelty. He felt his hands touch her tooth, some saliva slipping into the folds of his palm. Tensing his muscles, he endured her jaw's crushing weight, clenching his own teeth. He was doing it. He was making this happen. The enormous cheer captain could feel his movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Ruby's mind was now caught up in the science lesson. Well, that, and doodling idly in her workbook. She heard it helped concentration. Much like chewing gum. Speaking of which, there was a gentle pressure at the side of her mouth. Without even thinking, she chewed down hard on it, mouth being very used to handling little snacks like that. The little squelch it made brought her spirits up ever-so-slightly. She chomped again, only half conscious of her actions. Ms. Weiss finished off her lecture; the students' hands grasped their pencils and pens, ready to start an exercise. All the while, the instructor walked between the seats, ready to answer questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer curious tongue poked at the side of her mouth, interested in the texture and shape of this snack. Odd - it was softer than she was used to, but her chewing didn't seem to change its shape like gum wads, or tear it apart like candy bears. It brushed over the morsel once again, feeling distinct limbs. But compared to most candies she had shaped like that, these ones were longer, thinner, and tasted vaguely salty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt crashed down onto her blonde head all at once. Blake! He was still in there! Her head shook suddenly, and she desperately moved her tongue around, trying to get her shrunken friend out. Before she had time to react, her bright eyes were facing her teacher's face. The woman was standing before her, hand on her lab-coated hips, eyes pinned to the movement in Ruby's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a piece of gum?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby shook her head, flinging Blake left and right. She could feel the impact of his teensy, soft body against her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Weiss sighed. \"I don't wish to project the image of a disciplinarian. Your well-being and future are my priorities. I just wish you would treat it as seriously as I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student fidgeted, feeling her head burning up, Humming nervously, she went back to her workbook, answering a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing her arms, the teacher grumbled: \"I'm not blind. Spit it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an impasse. Reveal Blake to the world? Or face the wrath of her teacher? Ruby wished quick thinking was her strong suit. Shutting her eyes, she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ms. Weiss tapped a high-heeled foot impatiently. Wanting to get rid of the visible bulge in her cheek, Ruby attempted to surreptitiously move her tiny passenger from her molar to a safe spot under her tongue. Blake watched in horror as the pink leviathan reared up, moving to the rear of the blonde\u2019s mouth and settling there like a frozen pink tidal wave. The tiny mage wondered what she was up to, as he attempted to adjust his saliva-soaked glasses. Before he could roll  into the safe space between Ruby\u2019s cheek and gums, the cheerleader\u2019s tongue rushed forward like a striking snake. The tough muscle smashed into him like a linebacker, sweeping him off his feet. Blake landed with a splash into the small space under the cheerleader\u2019s tongue. His pink tormentor came to rest on top of him, smothering him under its mass. It felt like a whale had just belly-flopped on top of him. There was even less air under the confines of her tongue than in the rest of her mouth. Blake tried to take shallow breaths, but the oxygen was quickly running out, and the little that was left to breathe was as hot as a furnace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident that she had successfully hidden her tiny stowaway, Ruby gave Ms. Weiss her most brilliant megawatt smile. She didn\u2019t want to actually say anything, lest she reveal the miniscule mage to the class. However, the nonplussed teacher wasn\u2019t buying the cheerleader\u2019s attempts at innocence. Ruby wasn\u2019t the first student to try to get away with a contraband action, and she certainly wouldn\u2019t be the last. Ms. Weiss knew that once you let one student get away with wrongdoing, then the rest of the class will be sure to follow suit. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of allowing one of her students to be corrupted by the dark forces of misbehavior; she simply loved her students too much to let that happen. Plus, her mouth still tasted like coffee and she really wanted a piece of gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping over to the side of Ruby\u2019s desk, Ms. Weiss leaned over and brought her face close enough to her student that their noses were almost touching. Captivated by her teacher\u2019s entrancing eyes, Ruby involuntarily pursed her lips and swallowed as Ms. Weiss slid her hand onto the cheerleader\u2019s ruby-red cheek. Mariella\u2019s smooth skin felt cool and soothing against Ruby\u2019s burning hot flesh. Up close, Ruby realized why all the male students were in love with the science teacher. The woman\u2019s elegant features were enough to take anyone\u2019s breath away. Poor Blake, however,felt his breath being taken away from the change in air pressure as his giant hostess drained all the saliva in her mouth down the pit of her throat. Thankfully, due to his position at the root of Ruby\u2019s tongue, Blake was saved from joining the saliva rushing down the cheerleader\u2019s throat like a sticky waterfall. His brief respite was short-lived, however, as the salivary glands at his feet began to work overdrive to refill the mouth with their thick excretions. The sweet saliva began to pool around him, like a pit of hungry quicksand. With the heavy tongue hanging over his head, Blake could only just keep his head above the rising tide. While he know knew that he could survive being chewed, he wasn\u2019t sure how long he could go without oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what they say about chewing gum in class,\u201d Ms. Weiss said, in her most seductive voice. \u201cYou better bring enough for the whole class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s lips parted at hearing those words. She had some gum in her bag, if she could just reach down and grab it--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted as Ms. Weiss quickly closed the final inch in distance between their faces and brought her lips into contact with Ruby\u2019s mouth. Blake could sense the change in air pressure as Mariella\u2019s lips sealed against her student\u2019s oral cavity. He looked up, only to see a probing tentacle enter his temporary abode. This pink intruder swept along Ruby\u2019s teeth, sweeping back and forth as if searching for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby felt an intense rush of pleasure as her teacher\u2019s tongue plunged into her mouth. It was her first kiss\u2026 but it felt so good. So good, in fact, that her own tongue rose to meet Ms. Weiss\u2019s. From Blake\u2019s perspective, it looked like his guardian dragon had taken flight to do battle with the invading tongue. They twisted and twirled in the humid air, rubbing against each other the way a vine climbs a tree. It would seem that Ruby\u2019s tongue had triumphed over its rival, because its pink nemesis dove to the floor of the cheerleader\u2019s mouth like a crashing zeppelin. However, its tip was pointing right at the tiny mage\u2019s chest. But instead of smashing into him like Ruby\u2019s tongue did, this mystery person\u2019s tongue gently pushed itself under Blake\u2019s legs and lifted him onto its bumpy surface as smoothly as a child being carried into bed. The tip curled behind him, rubbing his back and securing him on the ride. Fear gripped the tiny mage as he realized he was headed into an unknown person\u2019s mouth. He took one last look back at Ruby\u2019s quickly receding mouth as he was soon squeezed between two sets of wet lips. Blake now knew how toothpaste feels when it gets squeezed out of the tube. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a magical carpet ride, the tongue gently settled into its owner\u2019s mouth. The change in atmosphere was apparent immediately. This person\u2019s mouth was slightly bigger, and something glinted in the back of the mouth, atop the molars. It was close to the dark throat, with its dangling uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What kind of metal could be in a person\u2019s mouth? I didn\u2019t see any braces on the way in</i>, Blake though to himself. <i>Oh yeah! Fillings used to be made with mercury and have a metallic appearance! </i>Thus, he must be in the mouth of someone older than a student, probably a teacher. But what class could she be in now? Before the mage could try and recall Ruby\u2019s schedule, the tongue reared up and deposited him on the very molars he was just admiring. Like a guillotine blade, the upper row of gnashing teeth crashed down on top of him. Once again, Blake was being chewed. He could see his own reflection in the filling. His nostrils were filled with an overwhelming scent of coffee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll let you go with just this piece,\u201d Ms. Weiss said as she broke off the kiss with a wink. She walked away from her flustered student and began to pace the room once again. The students quickly dove into their notebooks, trying not to make eye contact with Ruby. However, their bright-red faces betrayed their true emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic rose in Ruby\u2019s throat as she could no longer feel the tiny mage within her mouth. Did she accidentally swallow him, or did he now belong to Ms. Weiss? Watching her teacher\u2019s chomping jaws told her the answer. The poor boy, he had entrusted his life to her hands and she had already delivered him into danger. But lunch was next period, and she was soooooooo hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a strange taste</i>, Ms. Weiss thought.<i> It\u2019s like an old gym sock. Is this what the kids are into nowadays? What\u2019s wrong with peppermint?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nStill, at least it would get rid of the coffee taste in her mouth. She had forgotten her own pack of gum in her car, so this would have to suffice for now. But she really wasn\u2019t a fan of the taste. </span></div></div>",

A gentle flick of the tongue flipped Blake's minuscule frame over effortlessly. As easily as it had scooped him up, it twisted his body It lathered his teensy torso with saliva, right before the white ceiling crunched down on his back. Pain shot down his spine, feeling the enamel squeeze against his skin again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to Ruby's absent-minded chewing, this sent totally different sensations through the bespectacled mage. Though he couldn't identify the mouth's owner, her assault was quick, rhythmic, and harsh. The inside of his blonde friend's jaw was hell, to be sure. But she had some restraint to her squeezing. Ruby's brain wasn't fully aware of her actions, and what she was doing to the little thing - her chewing was slow. On the other hand, this teacher chomped like she was on a mission, as if there were something Blake had she needed to squeeze out of him. Every time he felt the crushing pain had numbed his senses, the unbreakable rows of teeth crushed a new joint between their combined force. And whenever he re-adjusted his glasses, staring back at his own reflection in the steel filling or white walls, the pink terror of a tongue pushed him somewhere new, leaving him unprepared for the next deafening descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd everywhere - no matter which new and uncomfortable angle his head had been forced into - it smelt. Her saliva, her teeth, her tongue, and the path to her esophagus - it all smelt like coffee. While not unpleasant, the odor permeated his nostrils, overriding his other senses. Every time he tried to regain the breath that this gigantic instructor stole from his lungs... Every time he tried to calm his racing heart rate with heavy breathing... Even when he tried to get enough air in his mouth to recite a spell... He just ended up choking on the morning drink. The familiar classroom chatter was drowned out by waves of wet sloshing and squelching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low groan emerged from the woman's vocal cords. The bitter taste of coffee still coated the roof of her mouth. This tiny gum wad wasn't doing much to help. She rested her still-moving lower jaw on one hand, looking over the class again. Some of the boys, still staring at her, tossed their heads back into the workbook quickly. Ruby didn't. Even as her hand was occupied with writing, her still-reddened face kept peeking back up to the front of the class, shooting a troubled gaze. The student's lashes twitched up and back down every few moments. It sometimes looked as if she'd raise her hand, before dejectedly resting her arm back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella Weiss presently let her cheek sink down, looking at papers to mark. She could feel her jaw's motion against the side of her palm. Of course, the cheer captain was looking for sympathy. Subtly trying to make the teacher feel sorry. When said teacher was still in high school, and was caught doing something bad, she'd put on the same face. And after that long wrestle with her tongue, the girl was bound to be a little perturbed. Though the instructor felt a twinge of empathy, she also knew how dangerous it was to encourage that kind of manipulation. It would set a precedent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, out of love for her students, the woman at the front of the class made a point of chewing slightly harder. Her jaw made longer movements. Up, down. Up, down. No matter how odd this gum's flavor was, she wasn't going to let go of it. The chewing sound was almost audible from Ruby's seat - she visibly cringed with the hard chomps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's screams, tough, went unheard. The hysteric cries of pain were interrupted as a drop of the thick saliva traveled down into his throat. He sputtered it out clumsily before the next overwhelming compression against him. Now the taste of coffee was in more than just his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if the teacher's mouth had suddenly doubled in strength! He dropped many feet down, crashing into a slobbery surface. He found himself glued by the sticky spit to her lower row of teeth. Before a split-second passed, before he could even register the pain, it flew back up with speed that made it feel like his skin would tear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SCRUNCH</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole body ached from the chewing. With teeth on either end of him, he barely had enough room to twitch an arm. When the lower wall of pearly whites fell, he'd been so tightly crunched that his body actually remained stuck on the steel-plated upper molar. The minute mage's eyes were granted a nearly landscape-like view of this foul ocean of a mouth. He had only a split second to see the active tongue, the glistening wetness that coated her lips, the crashing waves of liquid underneath, and a faint ray of light from the familiar, not-so-distant world of a classroom outside. It ended with another chew, applying thoughtless pressure to Blake's torso and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, again, lasted only about a second before the cycle recommenced. He was caught in a continual cycle of chewing, pushed between moments of grueling compression and quick breaks to let the pain soak in. The sound of a tapping heel and etching pencil resonated outside, the only distractions he had from the fierce assault. His arms flailed out as if grabbing for a heavenly light - but whenever he made motion one way of the other, the mighty pink beast that a normal person would call a \"tongue\" tapped him, wrangled him, or scooped him up, dismissing him back into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never thought he'd say this - but he wished deeply that he could be doing schoolwork like the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella kept sloshing this odd-flavored piece of candy around, like a circular spin cycle. It was taking some time for the distinct taste to fade, no matter how unique it was. And still, the coffee taste wouldn't leave! She squeezed it against her left cheek, trying to get a sense of the texture. Light, stringy, but almost stiff. Taking that as a challenge, she inhaled and pressed down hard once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage nearly felt his heart stop. He felt the cutting force of her jaw all around him, grinding down as if wanting to split him in half. He pounded against the enamel to no avail. The force of her inward breath shifted the pressure so much, it made his cheeks turn green. He felt his glasses fog more, before his vision itself began to fade. Lost. He was losing himself against the terrific jaw. Even before meeting with the garbage, he was sure his lungs would collapse from the shifting wind currents that escaped down her gullet. That, or the fluids that dripped like stalactites from the roof above would drown him. He felt the wetness drip down his ears, and his neck, soaking his robes. Panting for air, he searched his mind for spells - failing that, for his captor's identity. Ms. Solar? What a tragedy - his chewer would never know what was in her mouth, and he would never know the owner of the axe-like teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden pause in the continual motion. Pressure lifted gently. He suddenly realized how wet his whole body was - dripping with dampness. For a while, he had trouble telling if his ears were ringing - but no, that noise came from OUTSIDE the gorge of her mouth. The lunch bell! Wasting no time to take advantage of her pause, he pounded both arms against the molar sitting atop him. His fists flew into the hard enamel, before he started pushing. With his greatly-increased strength, he was able to pry the teacher's grasp on him a little looser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! He gritted his own teeth, strength regained. Making it back to Ruby - or another person he trusted - might be hard, but that could wait. First, he just needed to get out of here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of heels clacking on the ground sounded out. Compared to his old captor, these were slow - almost tired. Oh, no. Nonono. This woman couldn't be leaving the class now! He struggled more desperately, using the slight rattling against him from each footstep to pry himself out further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of gravity changed with every motion, but he kept forcing on the tooth ceiling with all his might. He was able to wiggle slightly. The odorous saliva he'd been coated in served as a lubricant of sorts, reducing his friction. Realizing this, he rubbed some more of the instructor's fluids across his body. It made his face green, sure - but also seemed to loosen him. Squirming more and more, and pressing back against an attempted chomp, he finally squeezed himself free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the reduced friction, and the force of the teacher's hard teeth, he basically launched himself out. With a quick incantation, the miniature mage tried to take control of his flight path. His words were slurred by the gross, sticky spittle entering his mouth. He sputtered it out, and watched in horror as he flew...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, it was not to be -- sickly green liquids seeped into his prison, eating away at his black shirt and irritating his skin. After mere moments of suffering from the acids, Blake blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake eventually awoke to a shocking sight: the outside world! Was he restored to normal?

For some reason, Ruby felt more energized than usual after her pizza meal.

Then it dawned on him: he had been digested and absorbed into Ruby's abdominal muscles!

With no mouth, Blake felt that his main option would be telepathy. His skills were rusty, but he had to try...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for the mage to concentrate. Every little gurgle and slosh from Ruby's stomach sent him shaking - thinking about the active, slimy tomb that encased his physical form. How long had he been churning in the waves, clutching to the mortal coil with sweaty, shivering palms? Had his family noticed he was missing - or sweet Aria...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasing away the disturbing images, the mage pushed away an oppressive blob of muscular tissue. To think, this thing touching his formless shoulder was just a small part of Ruby's body, pulled by the strings of her subconscious thoughts. His vision was dark and fuzzy, but he could sense more. There were so much of the pinkish, wet mass around him. It was hard and exercised enough to push him idly as she wandered the halls - at the same time, soft enough that he felt his limbs and face sinking into the abdomens with each careless squeeze and twist. Or were his arms and legs just ghost sensations of body parts he once had, and had lost forever in the cheer captain's gut? Would he ever be able to hold a friend's hand again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. He needed to focus his magic - and connect his mind to Ruby, his current prison. Feel the slow drumming of her heart, pulsating across her. Sync his breathing pattern with hers. Let his mind fall away from the discomforting compression, bask into her fingers' twitching, heels touching the floor, eyelids blinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed in deeply - unable to pick up much oxygen in the depths of his friend - and sent her a telepathic message: \"Ruby, it's Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neck twisted to look back, hair flopping over her slender shoulders. Blake? Here? On instinct, the blonde's arms snapped around her half-naked body and red undergarments. \"Don't look! I'm not decent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden movement made her whole body shake. Ruby's muscles squeezed him tighter, pushing his formless, minuscule body between the folds of her toned abs. The mage didn't need to hear her voice to know how surprised she was - the rapid, intense shivering through her stomach churned him further, and the throbbing through her veins and arteries cut into his brain. The most shocking thing, though, was her voice: how clear and powerful it was, against a background of bodily noises. He remembered these drips, breaths, and beats barely qualified as whispers to a normal person - when faced with these pipes, used to loud chants across fields, exerting power and energy even in its uncertain trembles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo imagine Aria's sweet tones at this size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby spoke again, looking around: \"Where are you? You can't just walk into my chambers without asking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... Your abs, Ruby.\" He cringed, wishing he had something to cover his ears. \"This is telepathy. You digested me, and - uh - I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader stood still for a moment, scratching her scalp. \"Waaait. You mean... Here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked at her torso. The cells struggled to fit themselves against the prodding finger, stretching and jiggling - and pulling their newest little speck of light into the transformation. He felt as if the whole world was being pulled into a black hole of all-consuming tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a second, her digit released. No answer. Curious, she then poked another segment of her abdomen. \"Or here? This is freaky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the horrible jiggling started - compressing the boy into a metaphysical pancake. Just from a press, she had such easy control over him... He still felt the force against him after she let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know! Riiight here!\" As predicted, this prod was on target! She could tell by his little mew as she pushed into her gut. Teasingly, the young woman spun her finger around, stirring it across the little field of flesh. \"Hello there, Blake! I found you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her, the little action was painful beyond comprehension! The mage's inaudible whimpers graduated to voiceless screams as he felt layers and layers of skin, fat, and muscle cells catch him in a red whirlpool. When he tried to push - a hard task, with no arms - he only felt the finger pushing back harder, squeezing him in place. He clutched and blindly groped, mind set on escape. \"C-come on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby giggled - despite her confusion, feeling a little bit of her passenger's movement was too much. \"Ahaha, stop it! It tickles!\" She switched from grinding to pinching - pressing hard on that warm spot in her abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis encased Blake in a cage of wobbling pink tissue that was tighter still. Despite not needing to breathe, he still felt as if he'd been deprived of oxygen by the strong walls, constricting everything and pushing it deep into him. When he stopped moving, it wasn't on command; he just had no space left to even tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go - though not nearly soon enough for her digested snack. He didn't dare budge again, for fear of her index and thumb transforming the already-horrifying landscape into a tight cage of red once more. \"Thank you kindly, sir. Now the question is, what are you doing down there in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a good few seconds of silence for the day's events to come back. Finding her friend, putting him in her mouth, swallowing on reflex, spending lunch with her girlfriends without a clue about that odd tickle in her belly. Torturing that black-clad boy the whole time!... Disgusted with herself, she slammed a hand into her boiling forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, this is sorta all my fault, isn't it? I wish you telekinected to me earlier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke back through thought: \"It's kinda hard with acid eating at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got even redder, gently tapping her stomach in surprise. \"Aw, what the heck was my body thinking? Digesting you like that... Bad stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punched herself in the gut. The minuscule bit of muscle was pressed deep in by the sudden impact. It had enough strength to send Blake flying back. Another bit of the internal organs caught him, and catapulted him forward harshly. It created a tiny reverberation on the encasing layers of dermis, which Ruby spotted in her mirror. His whole body ached, but he had to keep concentrated to maintain the link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sent the titan a message: \"D-don't beat yourself up over it. Seriously, please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the area she'd just struck, the blonde gulped. \"You're right! I can't go on being such an idiot when you're in trouble!\" She stepped a foot on the ground. Blake could sense a little of its impact wobbling across her, as if he was partly connected to the nerves across her legs. \"We gotta stay positive! There's gotta be a way to push through this, if we keep smiling! Uh...\" Now, he felt her heel rocking back nervously. \"...Can you still smile in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt for his mouth, only for his hands to slide through the incorporeal mass where it should have been. Like phantom limbs... He still felt dark bangs across his forehead, the frame of glasses on his ears, but nothing was there. \"No. I don't have a face...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was easier to sense Ruby trotting along the floor, and picking something in her hand. A small cylinder. She brushed it across his spot on her abs, giving him another squeeze... It slid across the area in one long stroke, twisting his body, before finishing with two pokes. Even after it relaxed, he felt as if his remaining vision had become darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on her hips, she grinned. \"Alright, there you go! If you have X-Ray vision or something along with those brainy powers, try peeking out now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she done? How much did she know about his secret? He concentrated hard on the space before him, letting his mind traverse the mighty mass of muscular tissue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflected in the mirror, Ruby stood huge and proud, an immovable statue of mirth and celebration. She had used a marker to scribble a tiny smiley face on herself, across the spot where he was trapped. With her quick breaths, it moved gently in and out. \"Now you can smile, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. Part of him felt like the girl wasn't taking this situation seriously enough. Like he should've just sprinted away when he saw her coming down the hall. He knew he'd be caught as the victim of her carelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite that, she wasn't callous. To gain the position of cheer captain, she had to know how to - well - cheer people. Whether just below Blake's eye level, or high on the podium, he couldn't remember a moment when her smile was off. Even now - away from her thundering pulse and breaths - he could feel her mouth's corners curling up, stretching her rosy cheeks. He'd entered through that smile hours ago now, and it stayed up. Even with the worrying situation, he felt like - for better or worse - he wouldn't leave her grin soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said. The boy realized he didn't say that telepathically - and the enormity of the situation fell over him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Ruby said, \"I know there's some way to get you out of me...\"</span></div></div>",

I gotta burn you out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Ruby\u2026\u201d Blake said, scared at what the smiling girl had just said. He had already been beaten severely by the simplest movements of her athletic body. Now she wanted to kick things up a notch or two \u2013 or a couple hundred, knowing Ruby \u2013 by exercising? He shuddered as he imagined the immeasurable pain that would befall him. \u201cI don\u2019t thing that\u2019ll-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, the walls of his prison closed in and squeezed his soul tightly on all sides. Ruby, her mind made up, had sucked in her gut, unwilling to listen to what her passenger had to say. \u201cDo you have any other ideas?\u201d She asked her abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby\u2026 it\u2019s <i>tight</i>\u2026\u201d The squished boy begged. If he could control it, he would turn the drawn-on smiley face into a sad face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles did not let up on him. \u201cWell?\u201d Ruby asked again as she crossed her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Blake <i>did</i> have a few ideas in the back of his brain. A few ancient spells that he had picked up from his spellbook. But those spells were dark magic, and dark magic always came with a cost; a high price that Ruby would have pay if he were to use any of them in his current predicament. And as much as the cheerleader annoyed him sometimes \u2013 like right now with all her teasing \u2013 he didn\u2019t have it in his heart to hurt her. So he sighed, and muttered. \u201c\u2026 No.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his answer, Ruby\u2019s smile grow and she relented, freeing Blake from the pressure. \u201cSee? Let\u2019s try things my way.\u201d Ruby happily proclaimed, and poked the little drawn-on face where it\u2019s nose would be, though thankfully with much less strength than her earlier pokes. \u201cI\u2019ve got the <i>perfect</i> idea!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving recovered from the squeezing, Blake raised a ghostly eyebrow. \u201cAnd what would that- <i>ah!</i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flesh around him shifted once again. Yet this time there was no pain or discomfort, nor compressing or tugging. Instead, there was swaying, oh-so gentle swaying that reminded him of the waves of a tranquil ocean. And with that swaying came unimaginable pleasure that coursed through every fiber of his soul and sent him into rapturous shivers. The sensation overwhelmed his mind and broke his concentration, causing his magic to instantly dispel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Ruby! W-w-what are y-you <i>doing?!</i>\u201d Blake shrieked, staggering under the new assault, before he realized his contention to Ruby had broken under the strain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe focused. It was insanely hard in his current situation, with every once of his being being decimated in his tantalizing environment, but he steered himself through it, and soon he once again saw Ruby\u2019s stomach reflected in the mirror. The midriff of the athletic girl was pulsing; moving with an alluring rhythm that locked his gaze firmly upon it. Just below her hips enchantingly bucked and bounced, complementing the tummy with their activity, and just above her breasts captivating hopped as her torso as they shifted back and forth. She was\u2026 belly dancing?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she knew his sight had returned to him, Ruby spoke up. \u201cYou like?\u201d She asked, her voice little more than a sultry whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake barely managed to reactivate his telepathy. \u201cN-no, I mean-<i>ah</i>!\u201d A sudden flex interrupted him, pumping the largest dose of pleasure into him yet. Through the limited range of his X-ray vision, he just barely caught the flirtatious smile on Ruby\u2019s lips. \u201cY-you\u2019re \u2013 <i>ah</i> \u2013 doing t-this on purpose! Oh!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Ruby said as she stuck her tongue out at mirror. Her playfulness rising, she softly sucked in her belly to tease him. Skin caved in on the drawn-on face at the same time flesh and muscle caved in on the mage, smothering them both in warmth, unbearable delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her friend squeal again at the action sent a bolt of elation surging down Ruby\u2019s spine. She softly bit her lip as she carried on with her dancing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tried to speak again, to beg her to stop, but his mind refused to provide him with any words. It had become addicted to the mind-boggling power of Ruby\u2019s skillful dancing. <i>He</i> had become addicted; entranced by the red sea that sought to drown him in a pleasure he\u2019d never experienced before. It was too much! He didn\u2019t want it to end! The mage gave in and let the cheerleader\u2019s body utterly engulf him in wavy bliss. His magic crumbled away as he let out the loudest moan yet, which echoed loudly all around him in his prison of flesh. The last image he received of the outside world was his captor\u2019s smile widening in peaking satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby happily continued her swaying and shaking, not at all bothered by the silence from her friend. He obviously was enjoying the experience when she could hear him, so obviously he must still be enjoying it now. She continued for a few more minutes before finishing up with a final, triumphant flex of her abdomen and a short, ecstatic giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stood quietly in the afterglow as her body tried, and failed, to quell a peculiar heat burning inside of her. She could run a dozen laps around the school and never feel this kind of burning. This unquenchable feeling had instead blossomed from Blake\u2019s moaning inside her head. It came from the thrill of dominating him in such a pleasing way. From imaging him human once again and the expressions his face would make to accompany those moans. From the idea of <i>him</i> belonging to <i>her</i>. Blake being hers\u2026  That made her heart overheat with joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she\u2019d definitely need to talk to him after all this was sorted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gentle sigh, Ruby patted her tummy. \u201cYou enjoy that, Blake?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He assumed he was still part of the cheerleader's body, but which part? He couldn't hear soft gurgling from behind him, so he couldn't be her abs. Fully regaining his senses, Blake realized his vertical position was higher than his last...which could only mean..!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite lacking cheeks to blush with, Blake reactivated his telepathic powers. \"Ruby...Ruby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheer captain heard her prisoner's voice again, much to her relief. \"Blake...you're still there!\" She rubbed her stomach with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...sort of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of..?

On the nightstand was a large leather bound tome, Ruby was willing to bet just about anything that she'd found the spell book. \"Hey Blake, I got it.\" Ruby said cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you, now it might be a bit of a lengthy spell to fix me, I'm not sure since I've never had to do something like this before and escape from a girl's breasts isn't a super standard spell.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Ruby reached out and took the book, she quickly flipped through it but it was all written in some weird script that she couldn't recognize, there were some pictures but they made just as little sense to the athletic blonde. \"Well it's a good thing you can tell me how this works because I have no idea what this means\" Ruby remarked to her little passenger as she...</span></div></div>",

The dancing, the twirling, the high kicks and the sharp movements bash at him annoyingly from every side, her stomach muscles gleefully reminding him of his place as their punching bag.

She continues prancing in earnest, ricocheting her passenger all around within her tummy, seemingly having completely forgotten about him in all her excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooner or later \u2013 Blake could barely keep track of time with being flung around \u2013 the main event arrives. The girls huddle together and begin stacking on top of each other to form a human pyramid.

Searing pain of an immeasurable level shoots through Blake\u2019s essence, through his very soul, as he\u2019s violently tugged outwards in every direction by the same flesh that moments ago had compressed him inwards. The strain overloads him and spills out, flooding full force into Ruby\u2019s mind and catching the cheerleader completely off guard in midair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hits the ground at a <i>very</i> bad angle. The last thing she remembers is the auditorium exploding into screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the nurse finally left the office, after ensuring the cheerleader\u2019s cast was firmly in place around the damaged foot, Ruby closes her eyes and whispers. \u201cBlake\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. It\u2019s completely silent in the nurse\u2019s office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks again, this time with a gentle poke to her abdomen. \u201cBlake, are you there?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m still here.

Inside Ruby Blake suddenly felt his fleshy prison shake as it he'd never felt it before, he was tossed around Ruby's stomach as she dashed to the bathroom.

Blake was shoved upwards and dropped back into the stomach several times before Ruby managed to make herself vomit. Blake found himself in a pile of Ruby's vomit in one of the bathroom sinks with the titanic cheerleader leaning over him. \"Please be okay\" she was saying as she grabbed Blake out of the mess, Blake was about to answer when he was suddenly pounded by water, like the most intense shower he'd ever had. Ruby finished rinsing her vomit off of Blake in the sink and held him against her cheek \"hopefully that helps, I'm so sorry\" she was almost in tears as she cradled him.<br>\r\nBlake took a second to find his voice \"I'm alright, it hurt but I think I'll be okay\" he said.

Ruby froze as Amber came in, because Amber was directly behind her she hadn't seen that Ruby was holding Blake. Ruby's mind was racing, she didn't have any pockets but she needed to hide Blake! Just before Amber came up to her Ruby...</span></div></div>",

Just as passed through the door Ruby realized that while the cheer squad had been driven to the pizza shop by one of the older members, she did not have her own driver's license yet, it was going to be a long walk home while trying not to swallow Blake. She wished she could tell him to stop struggling, it was making it so much harder not to just gulp him down, but she was in public so someone could see if she tried to take Blake out of her mouth.

Blake took a moment to register the immense things' movement, seeing himself reflected in the dark ponds that consisted her pupils. He knew he was small, but actually SEEING himself staring back nervously, standing on a petite palm like it was a platform really put it into perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a quick jolt below, something totally different replaced his view of her eyes: moist, white teeth arranged into a flawless wall. The sweet, rosy surface of her lips parted back, revealing more of the maw they once hid. The minuscule high-schooler yelped. The only reply was an echo from the chasm of her mouth as it shifted open. It was like watching a deep, dark cave suddenly rise from the Earth, swallowing the light. Speaking of swallowing, her hand began to tilt, and Blake's tiny feet started slipping. \"No, no - Ruby, PLEASE, DON'T -!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Aria lifted a dainty finger to her own lips, curious. \"What was that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, Ruby's head turned back, blonde hair flopping with the sudden movement. \"Mmfng!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette looked carefully at her friend's nervous smile. If she didn't know better, she could swear she saw something moving there; an unfamiliar pushing and wiggling motion on the sides of the cheerleader's cheeks. \"Are you sure everything's okay? I don't mean to pry, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nmmp! Nh-hm!\" Ruby shook her head quickly, closing her eyes in repressed embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her shut mouth, Blake couldn't predict the sudden movement. It tossed him back and forth between either side of her mouth. He crashed arm-first into her left molar; then hurdled towards her tongue, entangling him in a web of sticky saliva. He felt individual taste buds rubbing against his face and neck. He felt a gust of humid air rushing in from her gut waaay below - and quickly encompassing the entire wet, pinkish room. As she tried to speak, the mighty muscle under Blake's body twisted and squirmed; he tried to push back against it, but only found his shrunken frame pressed to the roof of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pounded on her teeth, tried pressing against the uneven ceiling or the rapidly-moving floor, shouting out to Aria; but it was no use. Without even putting any effort in, this girl had pinned him helplessly inside her. To think, this was the same tongue that she'd used to chat with him the other day - the same one that held the bit of chewed-up gum on it that the teacher asked her to spit out. Now, he was in the same position as the gum. Her nervous breaths made him rock back and forth, giving the situation a deeply uncomfortable sense of intimacy. Wherever he looked, there was only an unyielding barrier of mighty teeth or a moving valley of reddish skin and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly pearls and ruby. Everywhere he looked, Ruby. And behind, a slowly-moving, endless chasm of Ruby below...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you say so.\" Aria's head tilted to the side, forming a sympathetic smile. She blinked, and leaned in, her soft voice ringing out again: \"You're so modest, I feel like you're keeping something trapped inside of you sometimes.\" The yellow-clad girl softly touched her friend's cheek, trying to calm her jittery motions. \"If you ever need to, it's safe to let anything out to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby nodded enthusiastically, trying her best to chase Aria away without being rude - or looking like she DID have anything to hide. The latter effort was hard, as she faced the continual squirms within...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake heard it. He heard the golden voice ringing outside, reminding him of a world beyond the pinkish cavern - which bobbed up and down as she nodded. His body crashed from surface to saliva-coated surface, his clothes starting to feel more liquid than solid. After hitting her immense tongue at an odd angle, he was at the side of her mouth. There, for just one second, he could feel it: Aria's hand. Even at its unspeakably immense size, and even with him still blocked from the outside world, he KNEW it was her. The touch was gentle, controlled; more careful than any fingers that size had any right to be. He reached his own shrunken arms out and pressed both hands to it. \"Aria... Aria...! Aria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, are you eating something?\" The brown-haired girl stepped back, her eyebrows lifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's pupils shrunk to the size Blake's were. Her face turned uniform white, sweat drops leaking down from it. With only an instant to think, and the wiggling in her mouth preventing her from letting a word out, she hastily, almost subconsciously, tilted her tongue back. Her hands fluttered below as she gulped long and hard, eyes shut. Finally, she opened up: \"Nope! Nothing in my mouth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria sighed quietly, stepping away. \"Forgive me for interrupting your snack. Have a good day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, too!\" She said, waving happily. When the other girl was out of sight, she started whispering: \"That was close, wasn't it, Blake?\" She chuckled quietly. \"Well, don't worry - I'll protect you as long as you need! Now can you tell me why you're tiny?\" She waited a few seconds for a response, before her actions' full weight fell directly on her cranium. \"Urgh, stupid, stupid - Blake? Can you hear me? Do you copy? Blake? Blake? Blaaaake!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single word shook the shrunken young man - her last one the worst, by far. He groaned, scared to shout back - and risk her answering. The cheerleader's tongue had pushed him back, along with the all-powerful swallow; but with the strength gifted by the spirits, he managed to grab a hold of her uvula and stay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drop of her maw's sticky fluids slid on his arm, and down to his neck. He winced, keeping his sights on the rows of powerful teeth in the distance. It slowly, almost painfully, slid down his back, falling off his feet - and it took a few horrifying seconds before he could hear it drip below. That sound was soon joined by growling from her stomach, the droplet's final destination - and Blake's, too, if he had to keep this up much longer. Raw power was one thing; but holding a wet, rapidly-moving internal organ while trying not to slip off was another thing entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he screamed: \"RUBY! Don't talk, I'm right above your throat!\" He felt the winds of an excited gasp rush around him, blowing his shirt; followed by the breeze of a relieved sigh. Using the momentum from that, he began swinging back and forth on the uvula, like it was a vine. The motion around told him the young woman was trying to suppress her reflex to swallow - attempting to cough him out, instead. With that extra boost, he let go of her uvula...</span></div></div>",

Ruby gasped in surprise as she looked at, and felt, Blake fall headfirst and become wedged between her breasts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's now or never, Blake decided in his head. He did NOT want to die a slow, painful death in Ruby's stomach acids. Swinging on her uvula to build momentum, he eventually reached a speed that seemed like enough to save his tiny hide. With that, Blake released his grip as the uvula swung towards Ruby's pinkish tongue and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...came WAAAAAAY short of the distance he had planned to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake reached his arms out in a pathetic attempt to grab onto the tongue of the cheerleader, but his gambit failed, and the tiny mage found himself falling into the tight vertical tunnel of Ruby's gullet. On the outside, Ruby felt her shrunken friend's form going down her throat, and was unable to suppress a reflexive swallow. Wide-eyed with panic, the cheer captain felt a squirming lump slide down her throat, past her chest area, and into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh no...\" Ruby worried, placing a hand on her soft, flat tummy. Though she typically displayed a playful demeanor that bordered on carelessness, Ruby did in fact harbor a secret liking for Blake and couldn't bring herself to willfully deal him any harm. Unfortunately, she had now accidentally sent the tiny boy on a trip to what could be his final resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like minutes of being squeezed down Ruby's esophagus by peristalsis, Blake was forced through a small sphincter before landing with a wet plop on the squishy floor of the cheerleader's stomach. The organ plagued him with heat similar to a sauna, and still maintained the odor of cereal Ruby had eaten for breakfast earlier. The walls slowly pulsated, and a nearby greenish lake bubbled with gastric juices -- a bath that Blake would NOT want to take. Taking extra care to remain in the (relatively) dry areas of his prison, Blake rushed over to the nearest fleshy wall and pounded on it repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby! HELP! Get me out of here!!\" Blake yelled as he desperately awaited salvation from this gurgling pit of death...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake kept slamming his fists again and again into his tiny sanctuary, watching them sink in. Slowly, he made an attempt at calming his tense breaths. He'd hidden that crystal ball in the janitor's closet - and it wouldn't be hard to teleport a few feet using it. He hoped. If Ruby could get him close enough. He pounded again, yelling for her attention; in response, a horrid tremor shook the ground. Blake found himself flying off his dry spot, right into the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he was: the final destination of all Ruby's food and drink. Blake felt the waves of digestive juices sloshing over him, like a raging sea of enzymes and half-digested meals. The stomach walls slowly, disgustingly flexed in and out, controlling the oceans below. Stray drops of the murky substance sloshed against the fleshy barricades; and now, this tiny boy was going to join that mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sickly green liquid ebbed and tided around his legs. Ruby's latest snack could feel it seeping in through his clothes; it left an itching sensation where it went. He shuddered, black hair nearly going white instantly. His science teacher told the class, near the beginning of the year, to always wash quickly if you felt an itch; it meant bacteria might be eating away at your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it. His arms quivered, followed by his lip. Ruby. This was all going on inside Ruby, in the corner of the cheer captain's well-maintained gut! She had this sea churning inside her in the middle of their last class. During the basketball team's last game, this whole microcosm of green *ick* was hiding behind her bright red uniform and rosy cheeks. And now, whether she liked it or not, Ruby had caught him within this secret world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirits' power couldn't save him from this fate forever - but they could stall it long enough for him to find some form of escape. He ran for one of the walls, wading through the juices. Suddenly, a rumble. A long, continuous shaking knocked him off his feet, plunging him face-first into the unclean waters. The motion shook him to his bones. In every direction, he could feel her, hear her. The overpowering lub-dub of her heart. The quick, shallow breaths, like typhoons through her body. The bubbling flow of liquids. Her muffled, booming-yet-feminine voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, don't worry! We-we can handle this! We can get you out of there!\" The red-clad girl jogged in place, thinking that exercise might slow down her digestion. It was a little hard with pumps, but she knew Blake had to be having it far worse. She put a hand to her stomach, patting it slowly, as if he could feel it - and as if it would relax him. Mostly, it was to try calming herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did nothing. If anything, the exercise just added to her hunger and thirst. The last thing that slid down her gullet left a bad taste, but her stomach took it like an appetizer and asked for more. Clutching her belly, Ruby began fiddling with her bag. She pulled out a stick of gum - and remembered hearing something about chewing gum being indigestible. The girl tore off the wrapping, instantly popping it into her mouth. Cringing tightly, she forced it down her esophagus. Could that possibly help him? She doubted it; but the cheerleader had little left to cling onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her bowels, the pause in her rapid motion gave Blake a chance to get himself back on his feet. He wiped his glasses of Ruby's juiced. Soon, the sloshing began again; but he pressed forward. He did his best to ignore the wet squishing underneath his sneakers as it sunk into the impenetrable stomach lining. He kept his gaze on that dry spot of coral-coloured muscle, like the shoreline of an island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aperture at the top opened up slowly, making a loud squelch. It deposited a giant blob from the ceiling. He sighed; was Ruby REALLY eating now? But as the food splashed down to the emerald seas, he recognized it. That sweet aroma. That pale colour. A piece of gum! He swam to it, clawing into the massive marks Ruby's teeth left - using them to scale it. At this size, it worked like a raft. Pushing his unremarkable weight to the front, the candy bobbed gently, then carried him forth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last bound, he made it. The juices spread an itching and stinging sensation across every millimeter of him. When he looked down, his shirt had a few holes he didn't remember being there before. Ruby's body might accept him as energy any minute. The pattern of her breathing grew irregular. It had long, hard exhales, followed by quick intakes of air. He couldn't just hear it; he felt it. Was she... Was she sobbing? Jostled by this, the black-haired boy ran to the wall, and began striking it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Please, don't die...\" Her fingers trembled around her stomach, slowly twitching and fidgeting. She felt a shiver cross her wrist. The depths of her stomach let out a quiet groan. No matter how hard Ruby tried breathing slowly, she felt her flat belly fill up with every movement, and that reminded her of Blake, suffering inside. \"I don't... I don't want to eat you, Blake! I don't want this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking of his tiny body in there, helplessly passing through her digestive system... Churned this way and that by her stomach acids as his body slowly burned with acid... Or fell apart, bit by bit... Or sunk in, losing himself as he broke into nutrients and fat cells... And she was the one doing it. Her short-sightedness was what got him into her mouth, and down the tunnel of her throat; and now, no matter how she protested, her stomach was finishing the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few people tried getting her attention, or asking what was wrong - she started running. She ran, and didn't look back - dashing right into the janitor's closet for privacy. The whole situation made her want to hurl. The sense of exhaustion and hunger, mixing with the visceral mental images of her friend's slow murder, and the pounding in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait a minute - that pounding. She froze. He was still alive! She tiptoed to a tree, trying to be quiet and not stir her passenger too much; but also knowing she had to act quickly. Once there, she whispered: \"C-can you hear me, Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother strong pound. It did nothing for her sickness - but brought a smile back \"Okay, uh... I read this in a book once. Bang on my stomach twice for yes, once for no.\" She paused, feeling her gut. \"Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo little pounds inside of her. \"Okay! Do you have any idea how to get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long pause. She felt him hit the side of her stomach twice. \"Right! Should I head outside of the school?\" One quick, hard impact inside her told her the answer clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then - to class?\" A single pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought. \"I'm in the janitor's closet. Should I... just stay here?\" She felt two pounds. And then another two pounds, as if the first ones didn't register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Hang on, I'll try to find something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Blake felt a low, slow rumble. He sat back, smiling despite himself. With Ruby so relieved, and no more giant waves or heavy breaths tormenting him, the environment was almost... Not quite comfortable. But if he squinted a bit, it was like he was at a coral-coloured beach, with a cushion-like seat that caressed him, squeezed around him him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA prodding feeling from the side snapped him back to reality. He heard the cheerleader whisper gently: \"I hope you can forgive me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nudged the side of her gut slowly; he had to take a pause to regain his energy for the second one. No matter how she'd done it, Ruby was only trying to help. From the sounds outside, he knew she'd already understood what she did wrong; what's more, she was trying to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice rang out around him: \"This string - will it help me?\" He struck once, careful not to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only wait - wait and experience this little world inside a girl's gut. If he knelt back just so, he could feel the floor vibrating in sync with her heartbeat - along with the steady pound of her footsteps. Like a soothing lullaby - he slapped himself back awake. The air was thick, humid, and stagnant, slowly permeating his nose and mouth. His little legs grew tired; he sat down, then lay, then began to close his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how about this mop?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice inside of him was screaming in terror, trying to shake him awake. But it didn't seem to matter much, now. As breathing became harder, he focussed himself on that. His sense of smell, sight, and sound shut off slowly one by one. Everything he'd lived through before became like a dream; no, when he thought about it, it was like someone else describing their dream to him. Something was melting, but he didn't find himself caring much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed out. \"Aria...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby noticed something; some sort of trapdoor. Pulling on it, there was a crystal ball lying in the hole inside. \"This ball... Is this what you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Now she bounced up and down a little, trying to gain his attention. \"Come on, Blake, wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no response. She froze for a second, feeling like ice was spreading across her body. A few tears started to well up in her eyes. Her fingers twitched again, fidgeting, clenching... Then flying into her gut as she punched herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a tiny mumble inside of her - nearly drowned out by the stomach's protest. She held her breath. The orbuculum in front of her filled with a brilliant, glowing onyx, then a Vantablack<sup>TM</sup> that swallowed all luminescence. Finally, a tiny body appeared in midair. He was lying back peacefully, slowly coughing and murmuring, his body dripping with what was left of her last meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake!\" Ruby caught him in both hands, her smile wider than it'd been at any cheer session or pep rally. She felt his tiny fingers pawing at her flesh - as if he couldn't believe he'd really escaped. Slowly, he took one long, deep breath. Even across his tiny face, the blonde could easily see his pure joy at just being able to inhale fresh air once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad...\" She cooed. Suddenly, her face broke into a smirk. \"But, y'know - you should probably...\"</span></div></div>",

I had really wanted to win Aria's love...but...now that I've seen this gentle, compassionate side of you, I...I kinda...like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was silent for a moment.

As the red lips backed away after pressing onto him, the tiny mage felt pretty much his whole body covered in Ruby's lipstick, and a bit of saliva. Still, it was a pleasant feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ringing of the school bell killed the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes!\" Ruby yelped. \"I'd better get home...oh, right!

Whenever you want out just ask okay?~ Till then have as much fun in my mouth as you want~\" She teases as she slowly opens her maw. She forms her mouth into an O shape and extends her tongue as a makeshift platform for the boy to crawl his way inside. Blake hesitates slightly upon viewing the Ruby cave that is Ruby's maw. He blushes and admires her pink plush tongue and sets a hand on it. His hand sinks into the soft muscle and can feel Ruby lightly push back, a giggle erupting from her throat. Saliva seeps from under her tongue and coats the tongue along with Blake's hand, causing the mage to blush even darker. He eventually leans in and places his other hand and knee on it to test its stability. It was almost like what a waterbed would feel like, except less fleshy and less sticky. A satisfied moan comes from deeper inside Ruby and Blake looks up to see she is trying her best to look at him and can see she is just as excited as he is. Blake realizes he's been on her tongue for a while and doesn't want her to get dry mouth so he carefully makes his way deeper into his new girlfriend's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce past her teeth Ruby retracts her tongue along with Blake and seals her mouth, clamping Blake against the roof of her mouth gently as she can. Ruby smiles as she softly sucks Blake, tasting his unique flavor and moans, having never fully tasted anything like him. Her earlier experience completely rushed as opposed to now... Now... She had all the time she wanted. Ruby smiles and gently sucks him and rolls him around gently, teasing her new boyfriend, rubbing her tongue over his chest and legs even brushing her tongue tip against his face as a joking kiss. She giggles as she feels Blake move around or at least attempt to. She stops toying with him and lets him explore her mouth as HE pleases and sits back, strangely enjoying the feeling of the tiny mage on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushes as he is pulled into Ruby's mouth and grunts softly as she pins him to the roof of her mouth. Once she seals her lips saliva coats his chest as Ruby moans in delight. Blake in the back of his mind acknowledges that he can make his new girlfriend happy this strange new way. Maybe he'd even learn to like it even more. Blake yelps softly, as his girlfriend starts to move him around and suck on him like a candy, his clothes getting soaked again. Blake feels the massive muscle under him move him and play with him by pressing him to her solid teeth and the roof of her mouth as she feels him up. He feels the tongue rub his chest and teasingly rub his legs, eliciting a surprised yelp from him. Blake wiggles around to prevent it from happening again, embarrassed she teased him like that and is met with a face full of tongue, surprised Blake blushes and whines softly but doesn't fight it, enjoying it secretly as well. Blake feels the muscle under him relax and realizes Ruby is done toying with him for now and decides to look around, his eyes finally adjusted as well. He sees the light of her teeth from the inside and the red texture of her tongue. He feels up Ruby's tongue, feeling her taste buds as saliva coats his hands again. He blushes as he feels the sticky spit in his hands and wipes it on the tongue again. He looks behind him and gazes upon her ruby colored throat that almost beckons him back into her warm embrace. He sighs softly and smiles, enjoying this experience genuinely as he lays back on her tongue hugging it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiles as she feels him hug her tongue and giggles softly. She contemplates what to do for her cute little boyfriend. She considers sending him back to her belly or just toying with him some more or she could think of something else if she wanted to. She just smiles and lets him enjoy his moment for now as she carefully cares for him.</span></div></div>",

She moans softly as she traces him down her neck, past her breasts, and into her belly. A grin blooms from her face as she lets out a cool sigh. She feels around her mouth for remains of the mage, searching between her teeth and feeling under her tongue, but can find anything.

He lays on the center of her tongue and nuzzles into the giant sticky muscle. Suddenly, he feels the tongue under him move and press him tightly into the roof of her mouth. She rubs her tongue over his chest and body before shoving him towards the back of her throat! Blake yelps and tries to scramble away a bit, but is helpless as he sinks back towards his girlfriend's throat. Her warm tight throat grips him and drags him down the familiar tube again. Blake feels like panicking, but knows Ruby wouldn't intentionally hurt him, at least he hoped she wouldn't. Blake calmly slides down the warm familiar throat and moans quietly. Once he slides into his girlfriend's warm belly he gets up and walks over towards one of her walls. Blake rubs Ruby's massive stomach from the inside, laying on her stomach walls, closing his eyes as he rubbed into her. He opens his eyes in surprise when he hears dragging from the outside. <i>Ruby must be rubbing her stomach</i>Blake thought to himself. His surprise rises when a few indentations poke the massive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"You okay in there, little guy?~\" Blake blushes as he hears the voice of his new girlfriend all around him.

A little warning would be nice next time though.\" Blake walked around the belly a little, noticing how his voice echoed around him. Ruby giggled far above him as he walked around the empty belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Sorry, I couldn't help myself. Next time I promise to though.\" Blake blushed brightly. He was at a loss of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Next time,\" the boy asked nervously. Sure this was nice, but ... it could be dangerous and as nice as being inside his lovely girlfriend was, he didn't want to die in here. However, he did admit the experience was growing on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Of course! It would be a waste to not do this more often. Especially since we both seem to love it so much!\" Blake yelps softly as he feels Ruby sit down then lean back, tossing him to the other side of her stomach. Picking himself back up and wiping some stomach juices off himself he chuckles. He hears Ruby return to rubbing her belly and decides to rub her as well. Blake presses himself against the stomach wall and rubs gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course,\" Blake replies. He did love this. He loved being with her. He was so glad she had found him. As nice as this would have been with Aria, there was no doubt this was what life had intended for him. \"Thanks, Ruby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, Blake.

Is it because they're perfectly round, and soooo big!\" she stressed, taking her index finger and poking the soft squishiness of her right boob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let him gawk for a little while longer, then used said fingers to pluck her tiny Blake from his perch and drop his squarely on the top, exposed part of her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's feet sunk into the flesh as Ruby smirked.

Y-You're lower half...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby pouted and tilted her head. Her tiny friend had said something too quiet for her giant ears to hear. She brushed her hair away her right ear and brought it down to him, so that the giant organ was only a few paces away from the mage. \"Sorry, I didn't hear that. Can you say it again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's face felt like it was burning hotter than a pool of volcanic magma. Wanting his embarrassment to end, he confessed again, this time just loud enough for the giant's ear to pick up, \"You're lower half.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's eyes widened for a split second as she absorbed his confession, but quickly they morphed into a much naughtier look. \"Oh. I see.\" She happily giggled as she shuffled over to a nearby chair. Gently she set him down upon it and stood straight up, leaving Blake just below her waist. The tiny mage glanced forward to see the hem of her skirt dangled just a few tantalizing spaces in front of him, and his face found a way to flush redder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay to like my lower half.\" The giant cheerleader cooed from above. Slowly she lifted the curtain that was her skirt, revealing to her shrunken friend the soft, white fabric of her giant panties. Blake found himself unable to look away, his eyes greedily taking in every detail of the underwear-covered neithers right before him. \"Lots of boys at school do. You're just the one that actually gets to be close to it.\" Ruby cooed again as she softly swayed her hips from side to side. Watching the tiny boy stand there, utterly entranced by her body, was making the giantess heart beat faster and faster with pure joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what part of my lower half do you like the most?\" The question broke Blake free from his little trance, and he blinked rapidly as his mind struggled with an answer. What part did he like most? Her crotch, her rump, her legs, her feet? It was so hard to chose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby wasn't about to let him think in peace. A seductive smirk on her face, she swung herself around and brought her ass to jiggling stop right before the boy. \"Is it this fat ass of mine?\" She teasingly asked, dragging Blake back from his thoughts and into the now bootylicious real world. The mage watched as she bounced and swayed her famous cheeks so close to his face, almost as if daring him to reach out and grab it, yet his thunderous heart would not let him do anything else but watch. So he stood there and enjoyed the show, until Ruby finished up with a loud, playful slap to her right cheek that sent the flesh into soft ripples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...?\" She asked her tiny onlooker as she glanced at him over her shoulder with a teasing smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fumbled with the words to say for a few moments, before finally his parched throat allowed him to respond. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake desperately lept up and down, praying to the spirits that this oncoming behemoth would take notice of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom.</b> Her step forward resounded against the school's uniform tile floor. To any other person, it would be a simple clack from her heel. Blake was not any other person. He shouted for her, cupping his hands to his tiny mouth. \"Ruby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUMP.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but gaze in astonishment at the immense width her step traversed. It'd take him a long dash to get across a few tiles; her long, smooth legs, in shape for cheer-leading sessions, could cross it in seconds. At this angle, they were even more impressive. So many powerful joints and muscles flexing and relaxing on her command, all within either limb; each as polished, firm, clean, and overbearing as the great marble statues on pillars he saw in history class. Yet, more colourful - indeed, full of colour and energy, constantly on the move, as if she were still in the middle of a cheer routine and couldn't stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Blake's height, glimpsing her footsteps was like watching the entire ceiling shift. No; like watching a whole landscape of skin and soft cotton coming to life around him, not forgetting the hard, red material of her pumps. All of it springing up from feet away, shooting high into the skies... And coming down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THWOOOOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minuscule mage shouted again, feeling a horrendous tremble from his toes to his dark-haired scalp. Was the floor shaking with THAT much vitriol from a mere footfall? Or was that just his nerves? Goosebumps formed on him in places he didn't know they could. The sky was a scarlet barrier. Ruby's foot just barely missed him, leaving him safely under the elevated sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see the heel in front of him, and the ball of her foot behind. In fact, he didn't just *see* it: he could feel the weight either part exerted on the ground as it slid forward. Without even daring to gaze upwards (both out of respect for her modesty and fear for his life) he knew exactly how she'd positioned her foot, and how she was moving it. He experienced it all: the heel slowly lifting; the pressure she applied to the front; the slight wiggle of her ankle; every soul-crushingly immense, immaculate detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake regained his breath, the cheer captain moved again - taking a nonchalant step right past him, uncaring of his pounding heart. The shoe went up in an arc once again, and - <b>BOOM</b>. That next footfall snapped him out of his trance. He screamed out her name again; this time, running after her. The backside in the skies above jiggled slightly with her movement - but this was barely the time to stare up. He couldn't hope to keep up with the active pillars for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one more scream - \"RUBY!\" - she suddenly stopped. Her body turned on her right heel; the sky transformed from a monolithic back to a towering torso. \"Huh? Oh, wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did it! She was walking towards him! He started waving again, this time more out of joy than desperation. Her face showed no sign of confusion or skepticism; not as welcoming and sweet as Aria's, but he could still trust it. The blonde kept moving... And didn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't slowing down. She wasn't even looking at him. When he followed her line of vision, it led to the school's bulletin board - which Blake was right under. A paper attached up there grabbed Ruby's attention, not him! He tried running, but the floor's shaking grew stronger with each of her movements. It put him off-balance, leaving him to fall to the ground. The shrunken boy could only hope his screams reached her before her gigantic shoes reached him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ThumpthumpTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP- STOMP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prayers were in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left heel descended upon his torso, forcing all his wind out. Unlike the close call seconds ago, this one left him totally disoriented. It was hard to think what he'd been thinking, do what he'd do next; harder still to imagine the immense scale of a whole school beyond this hall, full of students able to crush him just like this; impossible to picture any sensation more intense and real than the panic shooting through his body. Her ankle twisted slightly, carelessly grinding the footwear into Blake's diminutive solar plexus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... he was alive. By some miracle, he could still feel his arms, and gasp for air. It slowly came back to him: the spirits! They'd made his body hyper-strong! Once his head finally stopped spinning, he looked up to the skies to thank them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike distant clouds, Ruby's blonde hair bobbed slightly above. Her face kept pointed to some announcement on the board. With that cheerful visage, and the excited eye movement, she didn't seem nearly as intimidating. His little body bursting with renewed confidence (or was that blood rushing to his head?), he grabbed a firm hold of the red pillar near him and pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the crushing force on his chest lifted. He felt the footwear move. \"Yes! It's working!\" He breathed in a long breath, letting his lungs fill, before shouting: \"RUBY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\" She twisted around on her heel, looking behind her. The sudden rotation loosened Blake's grip on the scarlet shoe. Once again, it drove into him - this time, just narrowly missing his groin. He yelped with all his remaining breath, listening it fade into a pathetic whimper, inaudible to even a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheer captain stayed turned, looking for whoever called her name. Indigo was passing through the halls - could it have been her? Didn't sound like her voice - but the blonde waved anyways. The other girl nodded back, arms too full of papers and binders to wave. \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, Blake noticed the footsteps on the other end of the hall. Another titan, shaking the tiled floor with the same strength, served as a reminder to how tiny the teen was. Utterly unnoticeable, pinned under this girl's pump. The new shoes were completely blue - a stark contrast to the ones that pressed on him now Shaking his head, he tried again - this time, his fingers clutched firmly to the smooth red heel. He pushed up, slowly, steadily. Soon, he was able to regain his progress. With a little more freedom of movement, he put his back into it; he wrapped his arms in close to avoid slipping again. Little by little, the shoe moved from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiled, pointing to the bulletin board. \"Indy, you got great exam marks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Who'd have thought.\" The studious girl spoke in a dry voice, fidgeting with a book. Her purple skirt fluttered gently. \"Did you see the game schedule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, hands to her hips. \"Yuh-huh! And I'm already boiling up with schooool spirit!\" The young woman in red and white performed a high kick, to show off that energy; not really looking where she aimed it. The toe end of her left shoe collided with Indigo's book pile, knocking it out of her hands. \"Gah! Omigosh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" she said, kneeling to the ground with a little sigh. The papers fluttered to the ground in a mess. \"Just help me pick them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was putting in such an effort to keep hold of the heel that his arms froze in place. The lift was followed by relief, then jaw-dropping fear, then an acute loss of his sense of gravity. He nearly flew up as the gigantic girl kicked - the impressive length of her smooth leg just adding to its heel-bound passenger's panic.

But then he noticed Indigo. Ruby and her were grabbing up papers from the ground - though it looked more like giant, heavenly hands shaping the earth. This was a chance. He could grab their attention while they  had their eyes to the floor. Then again, the blue-shirted student looked like she was suspicious about him lately... And with her brains, she could probably figure out he'd been dealing with spirits. But then again, she was more level-headed than the blonde, who could take things a little too far with her playfulness. Would it be better to get help from either one? From both?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, wondering what to do.</span></div></div>",

Her fingers tapped the side of her mouth slowly, her lips staying in a completely stiff, flat line. Her eyebrows, too, remained parallel to her narrowing eyes. It felt like she was shining a spotlight on Blake's diminutive body... No, he felt like he a specimen under a microscope that she'd been assigned to study. A disgusting specimen with a simple single-cell structure and no brain that his friend could see right through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the side of his head, fidgeting with his glasses frames - forcing himself to maintain eye contact. \"Look, I know it's hard to believe - but have I ever lied to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman kept walking, keeping a careful balance over her handheld passenger. Her fingers wiggled slightly to the side, as if to make a cage around the shrunken boy. \"Aria doesn't strike me as a person who'd particularly be interested in tiny people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That part was an accident!\" He shouted up, before covering his mouth. He couldn't be too reactive. Indigo might not believe him. Coughing inaudibly, he paced slowly around the palm, murmuring: \"Y-yeah, the spirits I called on...\" He glanced back and forth, making sure nobody was there. The hallway was still the endless expanse of tiles - only now, he was looking at it from a new perspective, moving at an uncomfortably fast pace. \"...they said it was the 'cost' for what they gave me. Strength. I mean - upper body strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a reaction. Her footsteps halted for a moment, and her slanted eyes widened. She moved her face closer to Blake's teensy body. \"Huh, not unlike an ant's exoskeleton. That's a smart way of doing it.\" Her eyes wandered upwards for a moment, chin tilting to the ceiling lights. Their reflection on her face looked intimidating; like she was some sort of holy figure bathed in light, passing judgement on a boy who dealt with forces beyond the mortal realm. \"I don't often get into this mythological stuff - but in China, ants are considered a symbol of hard work and diligence. They're called 'The Righteous Insect'. It's almost ironic, isn't it?\" She let loose a sardonic smile, one side of her mouth just twisting upwards slightly. \"You wanted to skip that hard work and righteousness part, to get your power. So you became an ant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last word slid right over Blake and engulfed him, crushing his diminutive chest. \"H-hey. You know how I am with bullies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, he heard some rowdy chatter at the other end of the hall. Someone was coming - no, multiple someones. Indigo tucked him quietly in her own chest. His first instinct was to yelp; but he quickly suppressed that, just falling back into the cushion-like fabric. His body froze: to avoid getting these people's attention, to keep from irritating his carrier, and to keep from falling to the floor below. Still... It was hard. This was shockingly intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the studious girl's arms swung her arms up, holding a book in them. It covered the shrunken boy entirely. With darkness in every direction, he felt his other senses kick in. The temperature of her immense body seemed to be rising. He could vaguely smell the cleaner she'd used on the shirt, and feel the folds of its material. And he could hear the thumping of the heart behind him, the rumble of footsteps below, the shout of \"NERD!\" outside - and the impact against his makeshift shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Indigo revealed him to the refreshing air again, she let out a quiet sigh. \"Yes, bullies.\" She wiped the cover with her elbow, which itself could overtake Blake's body. \"I didn't mean to accuse you of anything. Sorry. I'm simply thinking from these spirits' perspective. Perspective can give context to these problems. For example...\" She looked down at him, poking her side. \"I'm curious: what does it feel like in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed. Revealing his love for Aria and his magic was bad enough - but THIS? What could he say about her breasts that wouldn't offend her? He mumbled: \"Uhm... It was dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, stumbling over his own words. \"W-warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt pressure on either side of him. His holder - she'd cupped her hands around her breasts, and was squeezing them in! \"Indy, wait-\" His voice was muffled as his body turned, face pressed into one tit. She kneaded him around, bouncing him this way and that in private. When she finally let go, Blake began panting, desperate to regain the lost air. \"I'm sorry... I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo blinked, looking gently puzzled above. \"For what? You just confirmed yourself, verbally and physically.\" She plucked him from the crevice of her cleavage, carrying him once more. \"If that book didn't hurt you when the rabble-rouser pushed it, and if I didn't squish you there - that must mean you're telling the truth about your strength and the spirits. My sincerest apologies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was still dizzy. He rested his back on one finger, rubbing his head. The tone of her voice made it hard to know exactly how \"sincere\" she was, or what she thought of his feelings for Aria; but she didn't have any reason to disbelieve he'd made a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the footsteps below trembled him again, he stared up to Indigo and spoke. \"So, uhm - with that gone... This is a bit of a public place to discuss witchcraft and wizardry and all that. Where are you taking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared down, answering:</span></div></div>",

His heart belonged to Aria, but somehow, this experience of being so close to his Asian friend's breasts felt...pleasant in a way. He tried to shake off these feelings, but his hormones only complicated the situation further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around to ensure no one else was snooping, Indigo quietly opened the closet door and slipped into the room, before closing the door and shutting herself and Blake into darkness. This darkness would quickly be illuminated when Indigo flipped the light switch on, revealing all the odds and ends of a janitor's closet. Spying a strange trap door on the floor near one of the mops, the girl flipped this compartment open, and there it was: a crystal ball. Indigo carefully plucked tiny Blake out from between her boobs and allowed him to stand atop her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is where you cast your magic...\" Indigo marveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Blake sighed, \"but please...d-don't tell anyone about this!

Everything was dark; everywhere he tried to move, he only ran into a mass of wet, tough cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting in panic, the newly-digested boy screamed again: \"Ruby, please! I'm down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Everything was drowned out by reddish-black. All sound was drowned out by the groans as the mage's new home stretched and flexed. He could hear something not unlike rushing water, following steady pulses in intensity. Her bloodstream, he guessed. It came from above - no, from below... His left... He couldn't even tell. His sense of direction dissolved into the immense bleakness. Did he even have eyes to see with, a mouth to scream with? If he reached out, would he see a hand in front of him... Or had that been lost in the digestive process, clutching desperately for safety from the churning stomach acids? Could he even qualify as human anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should toss out that treat bag, seriously.\" Even more jaw-dropping and spirit-shaking than the noises of digestion or a pounding heart, the familiar voice boomed out. It had more presence than a judge's grovel, more certainty than a unanimous jury, more power than an executioner's weapon falling, and a bright, girlish little chirp. \"Or is this just a sign I need to exercise more? I mean, my ancestors didn't survive on iceberg lettuce and granola!... At least, not my ancestors from the way back before times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding to his existential horror - this prison he'd been sentenced to constituted his friend's backside. The same one that swung so much during games, or even swayed when she walked down the hall. This'd be bad enough if the blonde had ever drawn attention to it, but no; her humility and modest nature kept it hidden under the red cloak of her cheer uniform. He was totally unnoticeable, less than an insect, a lint bit, or a piece of dust. Blake's body had been accepted into Ruby's, and was restructured for the sole purpose of powering her thundering, energetic exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned at his luck, not sure what to do. He'd now be indistinguishable from any other inch of her rear. The pull from her cotton panties pressed against him, holding him firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost at the same time, she sighed, rumbling all the other fat cells surrounding him. \"If only I could cast a spell to get it all out...\" Her hand descended from the plump cheek, letting it fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! Blake began chanting: \"Crossing past reality's knotted lines, bridge this pair of souls, bridge voices, bridge minds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he felt a painful electricity shoot through where his spine would be. He gasped for a second, taking a few moments to get used to the sensation of brains connecting. Telepathy magic wasn't a skill he used often. If a classmate heard his voice in their head, that would be the end of his secret mage life. But secrecy was worth very little to a piece of ass fat desperate to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he focused, he could see a blurry image of the blonde cheer captain; reflected in a clean mirror. Nearly naked, this woman hid nothing before herself, carefully looking over the growth of her curves, the definition of her abs, and the shape of her legs - one of which she jokingly kicked in the air. He could feel everything shaking with that sudden jolt, pushed back and forth by fatty tissues. Annoyed at the shape of her rear, Ruby backhanded a cheek, trying to force it into place. The shaking was like an earthquake, making his heart pound at lightning speed - and almost cutting his concentration enough to sever the telepathic link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby!\" He shouted - or rather, thought as loud as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, yeah, it's rounder for sure. But self-care is important...\" She blinked, and looked behind her. The miniature mage's field of cloudy vision twisted with her head. He realized he was looking through Ruby's eyes. An effect of his spell? A sign that he was merging more with her, losing his identity in the mounds? It twisted back, looking sideways. \"That sounded like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me! It's Blake!\" Casting aside his fear and dread, he focused deeper on her thoughts, trying to squeeze his way in the confusing mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake? Where the heck is your voice coming from, Blake?\" It was hard to tell if she spoke this out loud, or was thinking it. Everything a few feet beyond her was like a soundless, endless void at the edge of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, he'd gotten into her head! He wobbled more, trying every method at his disposal to maintain her notice. \"Down here! I'm fat on your backside! Help me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment, eyes widening. It would be a huge shock to Ruby, for sure; but the boy was sure she'd understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, so this is what my guilty conscience sounds like.\" The young woman nodded her neck, shutting her eyes in thought - and closing her friend into the oppressive darkness again. \"A voice telling me my butt is fat. And it's got the same sound as a guy I know, because...\" - In that terrifying breath, he felt the world shudder in anticipation - \"Well, because of Sigmund Freud.\" Her hand now ran over her underpants, snapping them into place - sending a tickling shiver across Blake's body, or lack thereof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage protested, but he was already feeling lost, burnt out amid the other bits of energy broken down by her diligent enzymes. When she opened her eyes, his sight blurred with the reddish darkness, painting Ruby's reflection in a pulsating pink glow. \"No! Don't do it! You could kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"Yup, my body will be real killer after this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time she walked, it was like a landslide of muscle and fat for the still-trapped Blake. He could feel every joint in her legs stretch out, sense the floor's temperature traveling up her nerves, and the fluffy texture from her underwear vaguely tickled him. Moving slowly into his field of vision was a simple, but comfy, red chair. She turned, and sat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Compressed against the seat, he groaned, trying to push back with anything he had left against the pressure around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's mighty glutes flexed. She used them to jump up from the seat. It stretched everything inside her butt, like a medieval torture rack for magicians. He felt himself flying through the air for a moment, before -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SLAM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squatted back on, pushing him into more of the all-engulfing backside once more. A chair squat jump. Something simple to keep her back in shape. As if he weren't already close enough to the cheerleader - having seen her half-naked, being currently trapped amid the energy stored in her rear - he was now involved with her exercise routine up-close and personal, pulled with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SLAM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremor-like energy in the playful girl's rear snapped him out of his terror, to some degree. He hadn't even noticed until the painful squeezing pressed against him again. And once more, he took flight, her backside wobbling a little from the sudden pressure. It pushed everything back and forth. The impact of her soles against the ground came next, destabilizing him. While he was off-guard, she completed the next twist of her legs, harshly <b>slam</b>ming him into the chair once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the terror around him, the idea that he could be trapped forever as fluff inside a girl's butt... Something about her motion moved something in him. It was far from acceptance, or a sense of comfort; the motion of the muscular orbs around him was still awkward and compressing. And it wasn't arousal, per se - his mind still kept Aria at the top. No, this was a sense of inspiration, an admiration of her devotion. A sense that he should try harder for himself, and muscle past the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the power... Of a cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about all the times they'd spent together, every word they'd shared, everything that made her unique, each glittering fragment of time that defined their link. With this, he shouted, shaking: \"RUBY! PLEASE, STOP! I NEED YOUR HELP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, just as he braced for the oncoming <b>SLAM</b>, she halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... This doesn't sound a lot like a voice of reasoning and conscience. Is that...\" She gulped. \"Blake? Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook for a moment, pausing, as if he expected a cruel twist of fate, or trick from the ghosts. \"Y...yes. I... I hope I'm still Blake. You swallowed gum with me on it, and when I digested, I became part of your butt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't see her facial expression from the first-person view; but she seemed to be looking behind her, trying to glimpse her cheeks. She stroked a hand across it, wiggling the ensnared young man again. \"Man, my body picked a REALLY awkward spot for you. What were you doing so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... There were these ghosts, and I had them cast a spell to impress Aria. Shrinking was a side-effect. I-I think it's thanks to that I could survive your workout...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned. \"That leaves a lot of gaps. Like, what were you doing with ghosts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed aside something wet in his face. \"Please, I can - I can explain this all when I'm out. Just help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby said:</span></div></div>",

You're my big brother, not my boyfriend you little perv!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was beyond scared at this point. It was clear his worst fear had come to pass. Jade wouldn't listen to a word he said. She only cared about how she found him and nothing else. Trying to reason with her was pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken boy started struggling like made, but Jade's grip was too strong. He tried to cast a spell but the earlier climb and wind spell had taken their toll. He was essentially helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade eyed her struggling brother with a grin. Watching the pathetic mage struggle in her grasp did wonders for her heart. For years he'd been the top dog but today he was little more than a pup. No! Scratch that! A puppy was bigger than he was. Blake was little more than a bug now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Alright Blakey... In you go.\" Jade teased before easing him towards her mouth. Jade's eyes bulged as he drew near. His sister's morning breath was unreal at his size. Almost as bad as her ass. No human should have to smell something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing that stuck out were the teeth. Those mountainous white pillars that could crush him flat like car in a junkyard. All of this was frightening. But not as much as the large pink snake covered in slime that was Jade's tongue. Nothing in her mouth frightened him more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the way it slithered through the built up saliva awaiting it's prey sent shivers down his spine. He needed to escape! He needed to get away from all this! Damn it all! Why hadn't he bothered to learn a teleportation spell?! \"Jade please! I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words fell on deaf ears as his body passed his little sister's lips. Again he struggled as the light behind him cast a dark shadow down below. The tongue was ready to receive him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade released her grip... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Blake landed with a wet splat... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the light faded.</span></div></div>",

Then again she came from a family of mages and sorceresses so she shouldn't really be all that surprised. Besides, it served her brother right for finding his way into her underwear. Perverts deserved to be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile within the confines of her maw, Blake was fighting a loosing battle. Jade's tongue was indomitable. Try as he may, he just couldn't escape this thing. Every time her ran left, it shifted. Whenever he tried to run forward, it would rise. Whenever he tried to jump, it would pin him to the roof. This slimy pink serpent was just too quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't know how long this game of cat and mouse had gone on for but it must've been a while. He was tired, out of breath, and covered in only what he could assume was saliva. It certainly smelled like spit. As a matter of fact, everything around him spelled like spit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention it was freaking hot. He really needed a way out of here. Maybe if he focused hard enough he could squeak out a little magic? Anything was better than nothing at this point. All he needed was to make Jade spit him out. With that thought in mind, Blake began to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe channeled as much power as he could gather into his hands and felt the warm feeling of mana surround them. He clenched his fists hard, and before he knew it, they erupted in bright blue flames. He could now see the pink leviathan beneath him and the large cave he was trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" he said to himself. \"I've only ever done this once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside, Jade was wondering the halls still until she yelped in pain. It felt as if she'd just burnt her tongue with hot coco. On instinct she opened her mouth and extended her tongue. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a beauty mirror to survey the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrowed in fury at the scorch mark her brother obviously left. Speaking of the little twerp, he was hunched over in the center. How dare he burn her. He was the one in the wrong and now he wanted to hurt her. This would not stand. Two could play at this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally... I'm... free.\" Blake wheezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis moment of reprieve was shot lived however as the booming voice of his sister sounded above him. \"YOU WANT TO BURN ME, HUH? WELL TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake could react, the tongue retreated back into it's cave, and the light again faded. Blake felt his world shift as the tongue began to rise. For some reason this felt different. It hadn't risen high like this before. Was Jade about to...? \"Oh no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade swung her head back and swallowed hard. Blake could do little as a wave of saliva swooped in and carried him down the long pink slide. It was probably a good thing it was dark, because if he truly saw where he was going, he might've actually fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Blake could do was shut his eyes as he put two and two together. Down the throat, past the gums, look out stomach, here he comes.</span></div></div>",

All around him was a dark tunnel of flesh and slime that seemed to go on for miles. Eventually he passed the threshold  that lead him straight to Jade's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scream of terror only intensified when he felt his miniscule body in freefall. It was far too dark to see and there was absolutely nothing to grip on to. He just continued to fall bomb being dropped from a jet before hitting the warm and bubbly stomach acid down below with a huge splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn instinct, Blake's limbs responded as if he were at the beach and he swam to what felt like the surface. When his head broke through he immediately began to suck in air. The action made him cough. The air itself was rancid, so much so he could actually taste it on his tongue. It reminded him of the first time he ever tried to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's mind raced as he stared frantically into the darkness. Jade swallowed him. His little sister had ate him! He was in her stomach right now treading stomach acid. Wait? ACID! Blake's sense began to truly kick in when he felt the warmth of the liquid his body was currently submerged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was swimming in acid right now! This was bad. Very, very, bad. He needed to find shelter. An island. Anything in here that could presumably be used as a floatation device. Trying his best to channel an magic he could, Blake managed create a small orb of dim light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relief he felt at being able to see was short lived as his eyes widened. The inside of Jade's stomach was like something out of a horror movie. Her stomach was pink, veiny, and it was pulsing. All around him was a sea of green liquid that looked akin to raw sewage. \"Oh. My. God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could hear his heart beating erratically in his ears... or maybe that was just the sound of Jade's own drowning his out. Either way he was a dead man if he didn't find a way out of this place and out of this acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around desperately and found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began to feel more and more faint as time passed. His sister was like a damn leech, she'd suck him dry in mere minutes. Again he tried to struggle, only to be painfully reminded that he couldn't move. He was part of an ass now and that meant he had no limbs to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above he could hear Jade laughing. \"Struggle all you want, it makes no difference. This is what you get for trying to perve on me then hurt me when you got caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Blake could cry now he would, this was worse than even his worst nightmares. He was completely at Jades mercy and unable to free himself. He couldn't even talk Jade out of this. Was this really it for him? Was this really his fate? To be one with his own sister's ass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute went by, and Blake could see the black spots in his vision. He was blacking out. That could only mean one thing... Jade was just about finished. He desperately tried one last time to fight, but it was all for naught... He couldn't feel his magic... And his world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade on the other hand smiled in delight as her body begin to tremble. Her brother's prana was flowing through her like electricity. She'd finally finished draining his power and it was now mixing into her own. \"The power! HAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMana surged through Jades entire body, supercharging her reserves and heightening her power. She couldn't ever remember a time she felt so powerful. Absorbing Blake's power had put her on a whole new level. There was no limit to what she could do now. She looked back at her ass and smirked. Her brother had blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her ample rear a good pat as she reveled in her new power. \"Thanks Blake, you're the best.

The moist tongue below then flicked Blake into the tight abyss of her throat, and Jade swallowed her brother whole with a quick gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds of being squeezed down his sister's esophagus, Blake was deposited through a tight sphincter before falling onto the squishy floor of Jade's stomach. The walls were pulsating, and a nearby green lake bubbled with gastric acid -- a liquid that's best left untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Blake was scared for his life, and thus he ran to the nearest fleshy wall and pounded repeatedly, screaming for help all the while. On the outside, Jade felt this and placed a hand on her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cut that out, bro!\" Jade remarked. \"I'll just keep you in there until I can find Aria, and then I'll let you out. If it makes you feel any better, you were delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words didn't do a thing to comfort tiny little Blake, but at the same time he didn't want to upset his sister, so he stopped struggling right away and sat on the stomach floor, letting out a hopeless sigh.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake sat back inside Jade's belly, staring up at the unfamiliar ceiling. The smell was ghastly, like multiple kinds of meat mingling together; and the visuals weren't much easier, with the rosy perimeter of her gut's tissue clashing with waves from the murky sea of stomach acids. But worst of all was the continual, uneven sounds of her stomach - moaning, gurgling, calling out in pain on every end of him. It sent a clear message: despite her latest tasty snack, this little girl's metabolism was still fully active, and demanded more fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaaaake?\" She called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"You're still hungry, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dragon-like roar swept him off his feet. His whole body flipped over, and the stomach acids splashed in great waves. He inched back from them nervously, clinging to the stomach's walls for support. He could feel the pulse through her muscular tissue, creating no small amount of discomfort in his own gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, kinda.\" She chuckled nervously, shaking her brother slightly. \"Could you call on those ghosts to conjure me up a ham sandwich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouted at the great expanse of her stomach wall: \"Magic doesn't work that way! It's a delicate, complicated process! I can't call on them for just anything! We're dealing with forces beyond the knowable!\" He nearly collapsed against the rosy surface, the yielding mass producing a gross squelch, and a disapproving him emerging from Jade's mouth. \"If you use it for dumb things, without knowing the process, then... Then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny gurgle. The pace of her heart increased slightly, indicating that she was moving faster, still on the lookout for Aria. She continued where he trailed off: \"...Then you get shrunken, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bespectacled shrinkee twitched in anger. <i>She's just a kid, she's just a kid, she doesn't know any better, she's a full two years younger than you...</i> \"You've made your point. Well, then - \" He turned to his reflection in the misty pool of green acid. To stay calm and composed - and avoid lashing out again - he tried focusing on his mouth's movements. \"Spirits, make my sister a sandwich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, he felt a great force from outside, at the right side of the green-and-red room. The sound of gurgling intensified. The harsh blow forced him towards the foul barrier of the stomach wall. He pressed deep into the labyrinthe curves formed by the gut, the pink stuff nearly engulfing his body as it accommodated him. No matter how much Blake squirmed, the wet texture kept him stuck hard. That is, until another tremble came from right below his ribcage - knocking him into the other direction... And into the churning fluids below! He tried to yelp out a spell, but it was too late. His face fell first into the acids gaining a hefty mouthful; followed by his chest, and then his gangly legs. Soon enough, the bumping from the exterior of Jade's body raised up another great wake. Before he had any time to recover, the sea within his sister lifted up from under him, sweeping forward. He nearly flew through it, before finally landing on a relatively dry patch of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms slipped a bit on it as he struggled to keep hold. The green sea kept rippling below. With one mighty tug, the boy propped himself up, and collapsed onto the surface. He sputtered out some of the juices that found their way in his mouth - only for one last bump to send a fine mist splashing onto them. The shrunken boy made the best attempt he could to rub his glasses clean of the muck, considering how not a single part of his robe was uncovered from his sister's digestive acid. Wait - Jade! He shouted up: \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replied: \"Urgh... Yeah, two girls just bumped into me from either side. They should really watch where they're going! It's like they were trying to make me into a sandwich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a moment, before realizing: <i>Oh, right - \"Make my sister a sandwich...\" Very funny, you smart-aleck spooks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm still hungry..\" She complained above, rubbing her stomach. \"If you can't make a sandwich for me, can you at least tell me where the cafeteria is? Maaaaybe Aria's there. Who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother droning groan from her intestines cut through the air, merging with her careful footsteps and half-whispering but still-booming voice. The splashes and gurgles were getting to be too much for Blake's mind to handle. With a heavy heart, but a heavier sense of nausea, he receded. \"Sure, if it'll stop this rumbling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they traveled. The smaller sibling gave a couple of directions as she described her surroundings - still occasionally yelping in panic as the stomach acids approached him. His body might have been strong enough with its enhanced capabilities to dive in... But there was a time and place for testing his powers. Jade's stomach was not the place. Snacktime was not the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween one swerve down a hall, he asked her: \"What are you doing at the high school, anyways? Kinda a weird place to spend your free time, isn't it?\" As she turned on a sneaker-clad heel, he felt himself nearly flying again - murmuring a quick spell put him back intact, sticking like glue to his sacred island in the chaotic waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't treat me like I'm dumb!\" She said it loud enough that people outside could probably hear - but didn't really seem to care. \"Your little sister just cares about you, and wants to see what you're doing. All there is to it. That's why I'm keeping you safe and carrying you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned again. <i>Just a child, still growing, don't blame her...</i> One more rumble from her stomach sent him bouncing up again, followed by a few bumps from her long legs stepping forward. \"Thank... You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long period of silence reined. He felt vaguely discomforted... Was Jade angry with him? Or was there something she was trying to keep hidden... Was that why she ate him? To remove any sense of suspicion? No, that was crazy. But then why else was he in here, this dark, musty cave, with her inadvertent bodily functions causing an unholy experience as he sloshed around? Making now too-familiar squelches, and purrs, in an uneven, yet almost hypnotic rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil a new noise entered the mix. Something harsher, sharper. It came from above. He gazed up... And found the opening in the ceiling expanding, bringing down a mouthful of food into the cavernous belly. Stepping aside on instinct, he dodged the incoming mountain of mashed potatoes - and realized he was knee-deep in green liquid. He scurried back up, only to be met with another pile. This spoonful was large enough to engulf his whole body, And engulf it the food did; he clawed his way out, only to find some more of the chewed, masticated goop flopping down onto him. An attempt to contact Jade was ruined by the potatoes falling on his face - which soon became full of his sister's candy-scented, but nonetheless disgusting saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her stomach, rearranging the hillock of foodstuffs within. It now formed its own island in the green sea. \"Aria's not here. Well, lunch is soon enough! I'll just stick around and keep munching until she shows up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow soon did that mean? His attempt at questioning was ruined by a torrent of milk, pouring down her esophagus into a steady waterfall. The pale liquid splashed against the acids around, sending the island in motion; like a bowl being stirred. And once it finished, Blake only had a split second to crawl back out. The now-wetter food was easier to push apart, though no less enjoyable; the cold chunks of white stuck between his skinny fingers. He tried to shake it out, but the more he moved, the more the food platform underneath him crumbled away. And if it was gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stream of food from above didn't seem to stop, though. In steady streams, chewed-up portions of his sister's early meal rained down, spreading across her gut. Contrary to the mage's hopes, the gurgling only grew stronger as it dissolved the food. And the walls, pulsating with her heartbeat - they moved around to join the enzymes in breaking down the food, tossing the pieces around slowly but firmly. To think, this maelstrom, this rise and fall of archipelagos happened every time he had a meal with Jade in the past. It would take him a long time to eat with her again - or maybe to even eat, period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the churning and burning continued...</span></div></div>",

It's...a little terrifying, to think about being a part of Jade's digestive process, even if he could survive it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, those look good!\" Jade went to get more food, which sloshes Blake and his boiling foodstuff companions around in her belly, still rumbling with hunger. She came back to her seat with a burger and fries and began to scarf it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, you're really hungry today!\" Blake shouted to Jade, but as he expected, she didn't respond.

He admitted it sounded pretty dumb but if she lifted him up, she might be able to hear or see him a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea he thought of was to try and climb her. It would take a while and a lot of energy but it was technically safer than waiting to be scooped up. He thought about trying to use magic to help but something like a levitation spell was no easy feat and it would take a quite a bit of energy to accomplish. Even then, there was no guarantee it would work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake knew he had to decide fast if he didn\u2019t want to end up as nutrients for the girl he loved.

I guess that those sprits really made me stronger! I can\u2019t think of how I\u2019d make it through this venture without it.\u201d Blake said to himself. And once he got to the top, he hopped into the flat, and landed right in the toe section. He landed right on his feet, completely fine and everything, and it seemed like his reflexes were also better than usual. He looked down, and he was surprised to see how darkened the imprints under him were, but then he remembered how frequently Vixen wore these flats. And he looked forward, and saw a set of 5 impressively massive and powerful toes wriggling and writhing about. But then they started to move closer to him, and he ducked down in fear of them pouncing on him, but they luckily stopped a few feet away from Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake continued to think about what he should do next, and if he should have taken the smarter route of going to the desk instead. Although it was hard for him to focus as Vixen\u2019s toes continued to give Blake a loud and mesmerizing show, especially now that they were a lot closer to him. They continued to wiggle about, and he could see little bits of dirt fling around from the wild movement. She would also curl her toes up and down, making sure to keep them moving. And the most terrifying and awe-inspiring action that these incredible feet would make, would be when Vixen would remove her other foot from its flat completely, and then begin rubbing both of her feet together within the flat that Blake was in, and wildly wiggle all 10 of her colossal toes against each other at the same time. Blake made sure to stay as far as he could at this point, because it looked more like a terrifying monster that could crush buildings with ease than a person\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake thought of a plan, Vixen\u2019s toes went forward unexpectedly. To Vixen, she was just stretching her toes a little bit. It was a harmless action to her, but for Blake, it was the complete opposite of harmless! Blake was grabbed by Vixen\u2019s 2nd and 3rd toes, and they squeezed him tightly. If Blake was not gifted this great durability, he probably would have popped. And it seemed like the super strength he was gifted with made it not very painful either, and it felt more like getting a tight hug, although it would be more accurate to describe it as a hug from something that was more than a few times his size. The snaky toes gripped him, curious to know who they were currently embracing. As uncomfortable as it currently was, he found it extremely satisfying to be used like this by these beautiful toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Vixen sighed as she stretched her toes. She thought she felt something in-between them, but she quickly ignored it. She had more important things to think about, and some poor unfortunate pebble getting caught by her toes was the least of her concern. Although she did not consciously think anymore about this sensation among her toes, her toes were having a ball. They continued to squeeze Blake against their soft toe flesh, and his face was shoved deep in the flesh. After the 2nd and 3rd toes squeezed him enough for their satisfaction, they passed Blake to the other waiting toes to repeat the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake found himself stuck in-between her 3rd and 4th toes when the class ended. Vixen quickly wormed her bare feet back inside her flats, and Blake was caught for the ride. Even these relatively smaller toes could use him however they wished. Blake felt her 4th toe start to rub against him again, and it seemed like it wanted his attention, so he started to rub it vigorously. But as he was satisfying that toe\u2019s curiosity, it seemed to make her 3rd toe more jealous and pushed into him harder, smothering him between both playful and possessive toes. And these antics were starting to bring Blake back to Vixen\u2019s conscious mind, and she quickly did something to stop her irritation. But instead of Vixen checking the flat to see what was bothering her, she decided to harshly scrunch her toes from within her flats instead. Blake was shoved even deeper into her unyielding but intoxicating toe flesh, and it seemed to satisfy Vixen\u2019s curiosity for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Vixen stopped paying attention to the small pebble consciously, her toes went back to their actions. They started rubbing him rhythmically, almost like a loving massage. Blake was really enjoying this toe treatment he was getting from Vixen, even if she was not consciously aware of her toes\u2019 friendly behavior. Something about being played with like an inhuman object by these powerful and titanic toes excited Blake, and he wondered if this was why he was shrunken down to this size. There was a part of Blake that didn\u2019t even want to be discovered by Vixen, and it was beginning to affect his levels of affection for Aria and Vixen. But then he rationalized it, saying to himself, \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019d be feeling the same way if I was inside Aria\u2019s shoe. I shouldn\u2019t give up on my love so soon!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was a mere plaything to a set of physically imposing and highly possessive toes which found no greater pleasure than to use him thoroughly.  And Blake wondered how Vixen would treat him if she knew that he was this tiny. She was always very playful with him and teased him a lot, so she might do things like this to him anyway if she found him. But no matter how playful she was with him, she would still consciously hold back, because she wouldn\u2019t intent to actually harm him. So while he was undiscovered, he would receive the completely merciless treatment that these toes offered to him. And that alone was pretty dang exciting, and he hoped that he wouldn\u2019t be discovered for awhile. But then Vixen\u2019s 3rd toe simply pinned him down, as she focused on some school work up above, and he realized that he was completely immobilized for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Blake was pinned among these god-like toes, he began to notice an odor emanating from them. It seemed like a mixture of berries and foot sweat. She probably put a sweet smelling lotion on her feet and the sweat was beginning to wash it away. It was not a bad smell to Blake, in fact he kinda liked it, but his current size and the size of these toes made the smell somewhat overpowering. But Blake was starting to like the overpowering smell that was surrounding him. Maybe it was because of the constant massaging he was receiving and the playful nature of these amazing toes. Or maybe the smell was getting to him. Because to be fair, he never had this intense of thought about feet before, he would only glance down every once and a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the last period ended, and the students started to file out of the classroom. So Vixen stood up and prepared to go to her next destination. She was feeling pretty hungry, and she had a good idea on where she wanted to eat now that school was done for the day. But she also wanted to head to the nearby library, so she could get a few books she wanted. And she also found out that there were a few old occult books that could be useful for magic training, so she\u2019d grab them once she got there. Where should she go? And wherever she chose to go, Blake knew that he would be dragged along for the adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is a bit of a retelling of one of the old chapters I wrote from the original Small Bargain. I figured that it'd be good to re-insert it here)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vixen decides that she should try and go to the local library first. There were a few really useful occult materials that would speed up her studies and plans greatly, so she wanted to get them before anyone else got to them first. She knew that there weren\u2019t very many mages around the area and the school, besides her Blakey and her friend Alena Scaria, but you could never be sure who else was a mage, or if they were a less easily detectable type like she was. And Alena was actually a Nether Mage too, just like Vixen was, and they frequently bonded over similar training and studying methods. As she thought this, she reflexively scrunched her toes, which gave Blake a heavy smothering, and she wondered if she should tell Blakey that she knew about his status as a mage. It would be an easy way to get him to like her better, and maybe even get him to get over that silly crush he has on Aria. But she stopped daydreaming, and texted Alena, writing \u201cHey Alena, can you come to the library in a bit? I think they\u2019ve got some useful occult stuff that we could use for magic training. Let me know if you can come!\u201d And as she waited for a response, she headed towards the library to ask the librarian at the front desk about where the book was located. As Vixen walked, Blake was continually pounded by these toes that seemed to love him so much, and Blake was actually enjoying the experience under Vixen\u2019s heavenly toes. And because he was deep in-between her 3rd and 4th toes, he was protected from the worst of the impacts caused by Vixen\u2019s walking. Although, because of his spell, he\u2019d probably be okay even if her was directly under her big toe, or even her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Vixen reached the library, she went to the front desk. She asked the librarian where she could find the occult book she wanted. The librarian, thinking that she was a normal high school student, started telling her about all of the library\u2019s policies and how to locate the books. Vixen appreciated the gesture, but she really didn\u2019t need to know much else besides where her special book was, especially since she was a mage, and not a regular student. As she listened to the old librarian drone on, she wanted to look attentive and polite even if she was dying on the inside, she started taking her right foot out of her flat to entertain herself. Blake was brought out of the flat and he could see that he was now inside the library. She started cracking and stretching her toes, trying her best to look like she cared about what the librarian was telling her, while messing around with the strange pebble that was in-between her toes. Blake was crushed more and more as Vixen used him as a stress toy. She also shuffled her right flat around and pushed it about with her foot, further disorienting Blake. And she would sometimes try and grab at the front desk wall, kneading Blake with her powerful and huge toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the librarian kept on lecturing, Vixen heard her phone go off, and used that as an excuse to leave, saying \u201cOh I\u2019m really sorry sir, but I just got a message from my mom. Thank you!\u201d The old librarian just waved her off, and Vixen quickly shoved her flat back on, brutally crushing Blake under her mighty toes, and ran off to a different section before checking her phone. Vixen saw that it was from Alena, and she wrote \u201cOh wow! I\u2019m coming right over. I should get there in a minute. Don\u2019t look for the book without me!\u201d Vixen smiled, and sat down at a nearby couch chair and simply browsed with her phone until Alena arrived. As she checked her messages and her social media stuff, she popped off her flats and shuffled them around, making Blake feel very dizzy. And after a few minutes of this, Vixen saw Alena walking over to her, and she quickly slipped her feet back into their flats, and stood up to wave. She excitedly started jumping up and down as she waved at Alena, harshly and repeatedly crushing Blake under her uncaring and monolithic toes. Alena simply said to Vixen, happily and energetically, \u201cLet\u2019s find that book!\u201d And with that, the two titanic Nether Mages happily go up to the 3rd floor of the library to unravel the secrets of that book. And Vixen treaded on Blake unknowingly the entire time, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlena was a Middle Eastern girl and was about 6\u20191\u201d. Alena was a kind, playful and a bit mischievous person, and sometimes used her magic to pull crazy pranks. But she never used it to actively harm others, although she has sometimes done a few pranks that went too far, but she never intends for them to actually harm others. Alena is the same age as Vixen is, but she goes to a nearby private school, so Alena doesn\u2019t know any of the gang except for Vixen. She has dark black hair and a tan, almost dark, complexion. She also has light brown eyes. She decided to wear a pair of sweatpants, a simple T-shirt, and her favorite pair of tan moccasins. She also did not wear socks, because she never liked the feeling of socks on your feet, even if she was wearing sneakers. She did not care if it made her feet smell, because it wasn\u2019t like anyone would even smell them. She also had fairly large feet, and they were a good few sizes bigger than Vixen\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while of walking, which kept Blake thoroughly crushed and pressed against Vixen\u2019s large and powerful toes, they finally found their targeted book. They looked for a table to rest their feet for a bit and chat, and more importantly to go over that book to see if it will actually be useful to them. Once they found a nice table that was pretty secluded from too many others, they both sat down. Alena started reciting a magic spell and a small forcefield-like thing surrounded them and the table, and she explained \u201cThis way we have a bit more privacy! Nobody can see what\u2019s in the sphere from the outside. Great idea, huh?\u201d Vixen agrees, and then they both removed their shoes to get more comfortable.  Since Blake was stuck under Vixen\u2019s toes, he had no way of noticing the spell that Alena just cast. Now that Vixen had freed her feet and toes from their flat prisons, Blake tried to identify where he was in-between the wiggling and cracking that her toes did. He looked right in front of him, where he was attached to Vixen\u2019s 2nd toe, could see another pair of feet. And this pair was even bigger than Vixen\u2019s beauties. It was dark tan colored and it looked damp, and it almost seemed like it was glistening, with sweat.  He could also see a pair or large tan moccasins discarded near her imposing feet. She was currently rubbing her feet together, savoring their new found freedom. As the titans conversed above, the feet and toes had their own little play-date down below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen stretched her feet towards Alena\u2019s moccasins and dipped them inside of them. As Vixen did that, Alena started playing with Vixen\u2019s smaller flats. Vixen shoved her feet deep inside of the moccasins and shook them about, and Blake could already tell that these shoes had a terribly strong odor. She dragged them closer to her chair and began wiggling her toes as she worked her feet into the larger moccasins, wanting to rub her toes and soles against the fluffy cotton insides. Vixen\u2019s feet started to sweat profusely, and Blake was getting drowned in it. Blake couldn\u2019t even fight back, because she was playing even more rigorously and ruthless than before. It was probably because of how much of a good time she was having chatting and researching with Alena, and how much of a good time her feet were getting to know these moccasins, and of course making sure Blake was thoroughly included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As that was going on, Alena was flattening Vixen\u2019s flats and dragging them about. Her larger feet were trying their hardest to work their own personal magic on Vixen\u2019s flats. They overpowered them only how a pair of feet that much bigger could. And the sweat covering Alena\u2019s huge toes were beginning to coat Vixen\u2019s flats slightly. It probably wasn\u2019t something that Vixen would notice consciously, but it would make her feet sweat a lot more than usual, which would have a significant impact on Blake. Both of their pairs of feet were having the time of their lives, and Blake was caught in the middle of it. But Blake was actually enjoying this experience even more than before, and he was silently thanking the sprits for interpreting his request this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vixen played with the moccasins and as her toes wiggled about vigorously, Blake could feel himself slip little by little. It seemed like the sweat was beginning to finally dislodge him from these powerful and possessive toes\u2019 grasp. And although he would enjoy being freed, he was not so sure of getting stuck in this pair of moccasins. They were badly sweaty, and they really made the experience a lot more intense. If he got dislodged from his current location, then he would be at the mercy of Alena instead, and he didn\u2019t know her at all! And he had grown to love Vixen, and her majestic and godlike toes, so he didn\u2019t want to be separated from his personal paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Vixen and Alena both prepared to leave to go home for the day, Blake continued to slip. Does Blake slip away from Vixen\u2019s toes\u2019 grasp, and get forced to get to know Alena\u2019s feet instead? Or does he somehow hang on and remain with his new goddess Vixen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(I changed Alena into a Nether Mage too. I figured that with the increased focus on magic stuff in the current version of the story, it would be better to build on that theme too. Hope it makes sense to everybody!)</i></span></div></div>",

It was as if he was in a miasma of Alena\u2019s foot sweat, and it was beginning to make his head hurt. It was nothing like Vixen\u2019s heavenly toes that played with him so affectionately and lovingly, but part of Blake was still excited to be brutalized by Alena\u2019s massively titanic and sweaty toes. He also looked at the top of the shoe, near the tongue, and he saw the number 12 printed on it. He realized just how much larger Alena\u2019s feet were, when compared to Vixen\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake began moving into the toe section, knowing that even though he was made invulnerable, he wasn\u2019t immune to pain, and being smothered and crushed by Alena\u2019s heel or sole would be very painful indeed. As he started to move to the toe section, he saw Alena hover her right foot over the mouth of the moccasin, and she balanced her upper sole on the back end of the moccasin\u2019s opening. She began cracking and wiggling her toes wildly, which caused the whole shoe to shake from their terrifying strength and size. She also bumped her toes into the upper inside part of the moccasin occasionally, shaking Blake up in the process. She even started gripping the shoe\u2019s opening with her large sweaty toes, making sure to squeeze them tightly, almost as if they were taunting Blake and his tiny form. She then started lifting the right moccasin with her right foot, grasping it with her dexterous toes. The angle she caused the moccasin to rest at made Blake start tumbling faster down into the toe section. As he fell, he was covered with Alena\u2019s foot sweat and fluffy cotton debris from the shoe, which made discovery an even greater challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he thought that the smell was strong near the heel, then this was something on an entirely different level. He could actually see the fog that formed because of the odor, and the entire area felt incredibly humid. He even saw small droplets of sweat fall from the top of the moccasin, which exemplified just how sweaty this shoe was. He was beginning to wish that he was able to hang onto Vixen\u2019s perfect toes, because they would have been a much more favorable mistress than Alena\u2019s toes probably would. He then saw the one thing he wished he wouldn\u2019t, but knew that he would eventually. Alena lowered her foot into the moccasin, but she realized that she needed to do a bit more homework. She said her goodbyes to Vixen, saying \u201cSee you later Vixen! I\u2019m gonna stay here for a bit. I need to do some \u2018real\u2019 homework before I head out. Bye!!\u201d, and prepared to do some studying. Vixen gave her a light hug, and replied \u201cTake it easy Alena! Glad you could join me for our magic pow-wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the foot made contact with the sole, Blake saw 5 impossibly large toes face him. They wiggled about excitedly, prepared to return to their smelly home. And Blake was currently residing in their resting place, and he hoped that they would treat him as a guest, and not as an unwelcome pest. Alena wormed her feet into the moccasins, until they were snugly situated inside. For Blake, her 2nd and 3rd toes just barely touched him and he could practically feel the scent radiating from them. They were less than a few inches from Blake, at least from his perspective, and he tried to remain still as to not alert them to his presence. And he watched nervously, as Alena\u2019s toes kneaded the fabric in front of him and wiggled against each other. But sadly, Alena lifted her feet up so they balanced on her heels, which sent Blake tumbling towards the waiting behemoths that were Alena\u2019s toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake quickly gets grasped by Alena\u2019s 2nd and 3rd toes after colliding with them, and her toes did not plan on letting their new capture get away easily. She started to stretch and shift her feet and toes around, wanting to let her toes feel every inch of the fluffy interior again. She then began squeezing her toes harshly, shoving Blake deeper and deeper into her sweaty toe flesh. Blake could not even fight back, because these toes were at least two times larger and more aggressive than Vixen\u2019s were. And as much as Blake was currently being abused right now, he didn\u2019t completely hate the experience. It was a much more oppressive and intense, but it was still quite enjoyable and exciting. Although, he still enjoyed being a tiny bug among Vixen\u2019s toes more, and as he thought that, Blake wondered if he\u2019d like being among Aria\u2019s toes as well. It made him wonder if his crush on Aria was really as strong as he expected, especially if it took so long to think of her in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was completely unprepared for what Alena was about to do next. She took her right foot slightly out of the moccasin, giving Blake a tiny bit more room. That respite didn\u2019t last long when her left foot flew towards Blake and the moccasin that he was in. She slammed he left foot on top of her right foot, with those toes prodding at Blake as the right ones squeezed him. She then pushed both feet into the moccasin. As she pushed them in, she made sure to wiggle forcefully in order to make more room. Unfortunately for Blake, that meant that he would be given up close and loving tour of all 10 of her titanic toes. It felt like each one was fighting for possession of him. Up above, Alena was innocently reading a chapter for tomorrow\u2019s class, completely oblivious the way she was treating the tiny mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlena was beginning to get a bit restless, so she removed her feet from her moccasins. Blake was still stuck to Alena, with her right toes continuing to grope him all over. She effortlessly shuffled Blake from toe to toe, giving him an up close and personal tour of her huge feet and toes. And Blake could swear that a strange barrier was set up in the distance, but he was being much too harshly pushed and shoved around to determine that one way or the other.<br>\r\nAfter some time of studying, as Alena\u2019s toes continued to use Blake as their personal plaything, Alena decided that it was time to go. So she put back on her moccasins, and Blake was taken along with the toes inside. Alena considered going home, because it was a school night after all. But she was also hungry, and she knew that her parents would not be home to make dinner. So she could go to the diner nearby. And that magic spell, coupled with the time she and Vixen spent pouring over that occult book, wore her out more than she expected. No matter where Alena chose to go, Blake knew that he would be forced to be taken along for the sweaty ride. Where does Alena choose to go?</span></div></div>",

The new girl then made her way toward the classroom, being extra careful not to swallow her shrunken friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt scared as he sat inside Vixen's mouth, and why wouldn't he? The pink tongue below was covered in countless taste buds and a slimy fluid that made him very uncomfortable. In the back of this organic cave was the pitch-black entrance to Vixen's throat, a pathway that would mean certain doom for him. But since he couldn't escape through the wall of pearly-white teeth, Blake sighed and waited for his captor to release him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after class...</span></div></div>",

But I\u2019d really rather not. What if you swallowed me?\u201d And Vixen retorts with a smile, saying \u201cI\u2019d be careful with my tiny buddy, Blakey! But I won\u2019t press the issue any more, if you\u2019re so against it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Vixen started to think of where she could stow away Blake, and she started to shuffle her flats while she thought, and Blake couldn\u2019t help but glance down at the show that was unfolding. Sadly, because of his size and the sheer distance he was from her feet, Blake really couldn\u2019t see anything down there very clearly, but Vixen catches his glance nonetheless, and she grins. Then Vixen says \u201cI\u2019ve got a perfect idea, Blakey!\u201d Vixen\u2019s sudden announcement nearly made Blake fall over, in an attempt to hide the fact that he was staring down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen continues, saying \u201cHow about I place you in one of my flats, Blakey! You\u2019re small enough to fit comfortably, and I wouldn\u2019t mind having an adorable pebble to get me through the day.\u201d She winks and giggles at Blake as she sees his face turn beet red, and he starts to stammer, saying \u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know Vixen. I\u2019m super durable now, but I don\u2019t want to take any more risks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blake realized that he just blabbed about his magic background, and he was worried that Vixen would judge him or something, but she casually says \u201cDurable, huh? So you really are a mage, Blakey! I had a feeling about you.\u201d Vixen smiles, and Blake gets a bit flustered, and says \u201cYou\u2019re crazy, Vixen! Magic and all that are fantasy nonsense. And just forget I said anything about being durable. My head\u2019s still all shaky!\u201d Blake felt bad about lying to Vixen, but he still couldn\u2019t be sure about how much he could trust her, but he never expected to hear what she said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixen says \u201cWell that\u2019s a bold claim, Blakey, because I\u2019m a mage too!\u201d She winks as Blake\u2019s eyes widened, and he says \u201cWhat?? But\u2026 but how? I never felt anything magical about you.\u201d And Vixen grins, and says \u201cWell, that\u2019s because I\u2019m a Nether Mage, Blakey! We\u2019re really good at hiding our magical attributes and auras, although it\u2019s more of a natural ability than a skill. I\u2019ve had my suspicions about you, but I didn\u2019t really know how to just bring it up. But I\u2019m sure you get that too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Blake calms down, and says \u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t want to tell other people about me being a mage, because I don\u2019t want them to see me any differently. And I still don\u2019t know all that much about the magical world, so I have no idea what could be dangerous or not.\u201d But Vixen changes the subject, and says \u201cWould you mind making a decision though, Blakey? I\u2019m really gonna be late to Ms. Solar\u2019s class if I don\u2019t hide you somewhere soon. And I already know about how much you like you stare at girls\u2019 feet, so don\u2019t waste anymore time trying to hide it. I\u2019m sorry about being blunt Blakey, but I really don\u2019t want to be late again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s cheeks get red again, and he says \u201cWell, if it means getting you to class on time, then I can handle riding in your flat, Vixen.\u201d So Vixen cheers, and says while popping off her left flat \u201cYou\u2019re the best little buddy a girl could ask for, Blakey! I promise I\u2019ll treat you right down there.\u201d She winks at Blake as he starts to cough from embarrassment, as Vixen adds \u201cJust kidding, Blakey!\u201d And with that, Vixen lifts her left flat up towards the hand that was holding Blake, and carefully slides him into the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake lands in the flat, Vixen tilts it so he rolls down into the toe section, where the unique aroma of her feet was a whole lot stronger and distinct. Vixen teases Blake, saying \u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t like being stuck under me boring heel for the whole class, Blakey. I\u2019m such a thoughtful friend!\u201d Blake didn\u2019t really have a chance to confirm or deny Vixen\u2019s claim, because soon she placed the flat back onto the floor and wormed her foot back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked ahead of him as her completely massive foot slowly entered its home, and he hoped that her toes wouldn\u2019t mind him sharing their living space. And as her foot came closer to Blake, he noticed just how much larger each of her toes were, especially now that he shrunk even more than he originally did. And once Vixen was able to get her foot all the way inside, Blake looked up to see her absolutely huge 3rd toe staring him down above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake braced himself, as her toe quickly slammed down into him, and he felt his body contort to its shape completely. Vixen immediately felt him under her 3rd toe, and she skillfully moved him between her 3rd and 4th toes, not wanting to harshly tread all over him on her way to class. Once Blake was deposited between Vixen\u2019s toes, he took the moment to appreciate how it felt and smelled. He noticed that she used a sweet banana scented lotion, but her natural foot scent was already in the process of overpowering it, because of the hot school day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Vixen felt that Blake was nice and secure, she quickly started running to class, knowing that she had less than a minute to get to Ms. Solar\u2019s classroom. Luckily, Vixen was able to make to class on time, thanks to a few skillful uses of short hasting spells. The moments of increased speed caused the toes that neighbored and hugged Blake tightly to squeeze in even more in response to the increased force and pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Vixen reached her desk before the bell rang, and slipped out of her flats instinctively. Then she started to forcefully squeeze her toes, which crammed Blake deeply in her strong smelling toe flesh, but then she realized what she was doing, and she immediately stopped and separated her toes. She silently mouthed a \u2018my bad!\u2019 at Blake while smiling guiltily, and he tried to give her a thumbs up as best as he could, while his body was harshly contorted among her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she shuffled back on her flats, wanting to try and focus on the lesson. She quickly took down notes, making sure that they were detailed and specific. Since she happened to have the same classes as Blake this year, she felt that it was her duty to review all of the lesson material with him after school, now that he was the size of a tiny bug. And her feet remained fairly still for the moment, and Blake took the chance to admire the tantalizing toes that lovingly embraced him.<br>\r\nVixen\u2019s toes were beginning to sweat a little bit, but Blake still enjoyed being wrapped around them, and he thought about what she said to him before they left. He had to admit he has taken glances down below the desks at school, especially if a cute girl was playing with their shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Aria usually wore sneakers, so he didn\u2019t get to see her play with her shoes very often. And it was annoying because Indigo also wore sneakers frequently, and Blake would see her shoes off constantly, and he even saw her take off her socks once or twice. But Vixen almost always wore the same pair of flats, so she constantly shuffled and played around with them, and he almost couldn\u2019t believe that he was able to join them in their crazy fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much of an effort Vixen made with keeping her feet still for Blake\u2019s sake, some habits were more challenging to break, so she slowly started to play around with her flats again. She starts by popping her feet out of her flats, and gripping the backs of the shoes, treating Blake to a vigorous massage session. Then she started to spin them on the floor, back and forth, which began to make you a bit dizzy and confused. Then she placed both feet onto a single flat, and she started to rub her left set of toes with her right foot, causing you to be affectionately poked and prodded at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Blake heard a piercing noise that he quickly identified as the school bell, and his thoughts were interrupted when Vixen scrambled to put back on her flats. She shuffled her feet inside, without looking down, but she realized that with all her shoeplaying, the flats were backwards. So she swiftly turned them around, and planted her feet inside right afterward, smothering Blake among her heavenly toe flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was Vixen going next?</span></div></div>",

The tiny mage maintained his hold in his current position, fearing that any attempt to get Violet's attention might cause him to end up lost...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, boring day of classes, Violet heard the familiar ringing of the school bell and smiled softly, grabbing her things and making her way back to her locker, the goth girl opened the metallic door and took out what appeared to be a different set of clothes...mixed martial arts clothes. She was into this stuff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake continued to hold onto Violet's foot as she exited the school building and walked her way to the local gym. He wasn't particularly a fan of fighting, but this giantess was his only chance to find Aria...if he could just get her attention somehow. Violet trotted into the changing room, coming out in a black two-piece martial arts outfit and was greeted by someone she knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Violet!\" a Brazilian girl smiled. \"Ready for the big tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet, Valentina!\" Violet replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...actually not a gambler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was unfamiliar with this Valentina girl, but her features interested him. Valentina's eyes were almond-shaped gold pools, and she had large, full-bodied lips. She had perfectly-tanned olive skin, smooth and supple all across her body. Her hair was cut in a graduated bob with blunt bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puny boy gulped in fear -- he was now an unwilling spectator for a mixed martial arts tourney, and at his current size, he was bound to be kicked around mercilessly...and Violet wouldn't even realize it.</span></div></div>",

Oh, and I know you can't take notes in there, but try to pay attention to class so you aren't too far behind tomorrow.\" \"Wait, Ms. Solar!

Aria Gleam stood up to leave, only to hear her teacher call her name. \"Aria, I'd like for you to stay behind after class for a short while.\" \"Oooh, someone's in trouble.\" Aria shot a look of amusement at her classmate, Indigo, as she walked out the door. Aria approached the teacher's desk and asked why Ms. Solar wanted her to stay behind. Blake felt his heart rate quicken. His crush was a few feet away from him, yet his teacher was the only obstacle between them. If only he wasn't stuck within this cramped shoe, he could get to her. Ms. Solar looked at the door to make sure everyone had gone. \"Aria, what did you think about that story of Icarus we learned in class today?\" \"Oh. Well, it's certainly a story about boldness going too far and getting someone into trouble. Though I also think it's a warning story about the dangers of poor craftsmanship.\" They both chuckled. \"I have something I need to show you, Aria.\" Suddenly, Blake felt a strong shift in the wall of flesh pinning him down. It pulled Blake to the middle of the leather pump. Light shone in and hurt Blake's darkness-adjusted eyes. He felt pressure on both sides of his body as he re-oriented himself. He found himself pinched between his teacher's index finger and thumb, being lifted high into the sky and placed on her other hand's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed at the unannounced manhandling, Blake looked up so he could give his teacher a piece of his mind. Only, he was facing the opposite way. Directly towards the most beautiful, confused face in the world. \"I-is that... Blake?\" \"Yes, it is. Blake has something he'd like to tell you, Aria.\" Being put on the spot like this wasn't what Blake thought was going to happen. He hesitated as he looked at his gorgeous crush's face. \"Uhh... Well. I sorta... Shrunk myself on accident trying to make myself stronger\" \"Blake, why in the world would you do that?\" \"Uh... Well... I wanted to impress you, Aria.\" \"...Me?\" \"Yeah, I kinda... like you and thought you'd want a guy who was strong but I... messed things up.\" The next couple of seconds felt like hours to Blake as he winced in anticipation at what his crush might say. Aria actually ended up laughing. Oh no, she was laughing at him. She thought this whole thing was stupid at was laughing at him, that must be it. His moping came to an end quickly as Aria told him \"That's so sweet, Blake.\" He was surprised at what was to him a sudden turn of events. \"Wait... really?\" \"Yeah. But you don't need to make yourself super strong for me. I like you just how you are.\" Blake was over the moon. Aria liked him! She actually liked him back! Aria's huge hand rose up and reached towards the tiny mage. She picked him up and put him in her own palm. She held him there for a second before bringing him up to her lips and giving him a kiss that covered his entire body. Blake kissed back as best as he could at his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Solar smiled. \"Well, everything worked out in the end. I won't keep you two any longer, run along now.\"  Aria turned toward the exit, Blake still in her palm, ready to head...</span></div></div>",

But in my bra you'll be next to a... very sensitive place. My... nipple. You're very small right now. In fact, my nipple may be bigger than you. There's only one other place that's sensitive enough to feel you and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina's face goes red and Blake can see her eyes look down for a second. Blake can feel his own face turn red as he realizes what she was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course! Your bra would be a great place. I'd love to be there and not... down there.\" Blake laughs nervously as he tries to defuse the awkward situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake... just... shut up for now.\" Feina moves her other hand down to her chest and begins unbuttoning her shirt. With each button, her breasts almost seem to grow in size as they are brought one step closer to freedom from their restraining prison. As she finishes the fourth button, her bra becomes visible to the outside world. Luckily, she's alone save for the tiny boy on her palm. Jake looks down and sees the black lace bra straining to hold in Feina's surprisingly large mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be a bit tight but you'll have to deal with it. It's hard to find bras in my size nowadays.\" Feina digs a finger underneath her left bra and pulls it out. The bra seems to go on into darkness but Blake is able see the slightest bit of pink on Feina's breast, indicating the start of her areola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maybe this isn't such a good idea.\" Blake steps away from the edge of Feina's palm. Feina removes her finger from her bra and it snaps against her skin. Her hand moves over Blake's body, prepared to pinch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be just as hard for me, Blake. Do you think I'd enjoy having my shrunken student hugging my nipple? But we don't have ti-\" Feina jumps as the school bell rings once more to indicate the start of the next class. \"See?! Stop being a scaredy-cat and... Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her palm, Blake is no longer there. She looks at her palm, somewhat fearful for what might've happened. Suddenly, she feels a tiny itch in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Blake, Feina's small jump was enough to send him flying and as he came back down, Feina's cleavage was directly below him. Thanks to her constricting clothing, Blake was only able to fall maybe an inch at best, but to him it was several feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Blake! My cleavage is NOT where we agreed you'd go!\" Feina tries to maneuver her breasts to reach in, but as she tries to spread them apart to reach inside, all she's doing is giving Blake more room to fall. Before long, Feina can feel Blake is beyond where just her fingers can reach. As she prepares to plunge her entire hand into her cleavage, she hears the door to the room rattle as students attempt to open. It was, thankfully, locked. But she was out of time. \"Blake! The students are here! I have to start class! I'm going to button up my top and I need you to make your way to my nipple. I only have 5 minutes between classes so I won't have time to move you between them. If you can't make it, you'll be stuck between my breasts for the rest of the school day! If you make it, give me a sign!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina struggles to button her top as her breasts fight to stay free. Finally, she finishes and walks towards the door to unlock it. Blake is squeezed tightly between Feina's breasts, not helped by the constricting clothing. Every movement she makes sends ripples down her chest as they continue to fight her. Blake, not wanting to be stuck like this for the rest of the day, puts all of his effort into wriggling through her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina had begun teacher her class when she began to feel an itch between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... I can still feel him clearly...\" Feina's face become flush as she feels Blake's miniscule body making its way through her cleavage. She can feel her legs start to shake and her body starts to heat up. \"It... feels good... N-No... I'm in the middle of class... I'll have to endure. For Blake's sake, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sentiment was lost on Blake, however, as her body was now attempting to cook him alive. Each breast increased in temperature and now it felt like he was between two grills. Then, a sweat drop rolled down onto his body. He fought to escape the sweat and gasped for air as he managed to get away. Now desperate to get away from this deathtrap, Blake doubles his efforts to get through Feina's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph ~ !\" Feina put a hand over her mouth as she stood facing the board. Feina could feel tears in her eyes as the pleasure she felt increased with Blake's pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My breasts have been pushed together for so long that they've become super sensitive! Ahn ~ ! Oh, Blake ~ ! Why'd you have to fall down there... Ah! W-What will happen when he reaches my nipple...? I-I can't let him make it there now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright. I will write a few things on the board. Please make sure you copy them into your notes.\" Feina walked up to the board and pressed her breasts up against them. Blake could feel himself get squeezed further, unable to move. He could feel the air leaving his lungs, unable to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Go to sleep, Blake. Please.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could feel his consciousness fading. After about a minute, Feina stepped away from the board. Focusing on her breasts she could feel...</span></div></div>",

I bet she forgot I was even down here!  I have to hurry and remind her by getting into her bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina leans against her desk. Her legs are practically jelly now. She hadn't even finished a single class period and she's already regretting her choice to not put Blake in her panties. At least in there, there was a chance he wouldn't touch anything. But now, all she can feel is his tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Solar? You don't look so well. Do you need to go to the nurse?\" Jade Heart, a student in her class, speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I-I'm fine. But that reminds me, Ms. Heart. I'll need to speak to you after school if you can spare a few minutes. It's about your brother.\" Jade looked confused but simply nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I just need to make it through to the end of the day. Then I'll give Blake to Jade. I'm sure she'd be much better suited to helping him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Feina spend the next 20 minutes fighting their own battles until, finally, the bell rings and the class is dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Finally...\" Feina sits down on her chair, exhausted. \"The things I do for my students...\" Feina can feel a yearning in her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Urk... I-I could probably take a bathroom break... N-No... That... I can't do that. Blake came to me for help! I can't betray his trust by using his predicament... Come to think of it, I haven't felt him for a while. Did he pass out...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina focused on her breasts once more. She could no longer feel Blake's tiny body between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He didn't fall out, did he?\" Feina started to worry as she couldn't feel Blake's body, moving or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blake was in high spirits. No longer was he trapped between to heated mountains. He crawled his way across the flesh below him and enjoyed the somewhat cool feeling of fabric against his back. The texture of the ground changes and gives way to a pink color. A pink hill appears before him. He made it. This was Feina Solar's nipple. His well-endowed teacher's pink plateau was certainly bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I get her to feel me at this size...?\" Blake asked himself as he began to crawl onto the nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyah?!\" Feina could feel a tiny lump in her bra. Microscopic hands grabbing at her flesh. The sensation of her miniature student dragging his body across her sensitive nipple. \"N-No... He made it... P-Please don't make this harder than it has to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could feel the fabric on his back pushing down on him. The space he had was rapidly decreasing as Feina's nipple reacted to the stimulation. Blake...</span></div></div>",

Ah...!\" A bolt of pleasure shoots through Feina. She can feel the heat in her nether regions reach peak levels. She can no longer hold it. She needs it now. Getting out of her chair, Feina makes a dash for the door. As she opens it, several students start coming in. \"S-Study hall. U-Until I get back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake can feel every bounce of Feina's breasts as she dashes for the staff bathroom. He hears a door open and shut, followed by the click of a lock. He's not sure what's going on, but he feels his body break into a cold sweat. He hears a pop accompanied by his prison shifting. Then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Blake. I had hoped... to endure. But if you're going to treat my body like a playground then... I can't just sit still.\" Another pop. Another shake. And another. \"One more...\" With one last pop, Blake can feel Feina's breast drop. Light fills his enclosure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Blake hazards a look behind him. He can faintly see through the lace of Feina's bra. His world turns upside down as she bends over, followed by the sound of cloth hitting the ground. As she stands up, Blake is able to see a mirror. Standing there is Feina in nothing but a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Feina speaks softly as she removes her bra, exposing Blake to the outside world. \"I'll be gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer held down by her bra, Blake is forced to hold on for dear life as Feina moves to sit down on the toilet. Blake watches as Feina's right hand moves up towards her right breast. To him, it was a distance of several meters at least from nipple to nipple. Feina grabs her breast from underneath and places a single finger against her nipple. She pushes her nipple inwards and her soft breast effortlessly molds its shape to accommodate. Blake feels the breast he's standing on shift as Feina's left hand moves downward. Hazarding a peek over the edge, her hand tugs her panties away from her pussy. As it moves away, a white strand of her sticky juice attempts to stay connected between her body and the cloth. Even from his position, he can hear the wet sounds as she removes her undergarments. However, her pussy is partially hidden from his view by the modest amount of pubic hair that lies above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll handle two of my sensitive spots, Blake. I need you to take care of the third.\" Feina speaks before plunging her hand into her wet pussy. Blake can hear her voice coming out in moans as she masturbates. \"T-Think of it as payment... For me helping you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake... </span></div></div>",

She felt kind of bad for Blake, having been suffocated between his teacher's breasts, but compared to what might've happened if he had kept going she felt he got off easy. She could feel both her bra and panties squish as she moved. She could only hope both were because of her sweat. As she removed herself from the board, she turned around to face her class. Some murmurs arose from some of her students and, looking back at the board, she could feel her face heat up in embarrassment. She had left a large, wet spot on the board. Looking down, she was at least relieved to see her blouse did well enough in hiding her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry, Blake.</i> Feina thought to herself. <i>But at least I can catch my breath now...</i> Feina continued with her class. At first she was still a little shaky, but now that Blake was little more than a tiny pebble in her cleavage, she could feel her libido dropping. When class finished, she made sure to lock the door and sat down in her chair and unbuttoned her blouse. As she did, a waft of her sweaty smell came up. She grabbed a tissue from her desk and wiped the beads of sweat off the top of her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I won't be able to pull Blake out of there right now, but I can at least cool it down a bit.</i> After a minute, she buttoned her blouse once more and unlocked the door. Upon doing so, a few students that had arrived early came in. She welcomed them and began her next class. As this class went on, she noticed her mind began feeling clearer than before. <i>I must've been pretty aroused. Glad I got him to stop.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class ended, she once again locked the door and opened her blouse. Blake was still unconscious and although she could smell a bit of sweat, Feina didn't see anything she needed to wipe. Deciding there was nothing she needed to do, she buttoned her blouse again and unlocked the door. By the time the next class started, she was back to teaching normally. After class she didn't bother locking the door and just sat down in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It sure was hot earlier. I should shower when I get home.</i> Feina thought to herself. The rest of her day went by uneventfully. She ate her lunch with no issues and taught her classes with no issues. She never once opened her blouse to check on her little rider. As the day ended, Feina Solar made her way to her car and began driving home. She climbed up the two flights of stairs leading to her apartment and unlocked the door. Locking it behind her, she took of her pumps and tossed them to the side. She was so tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It seems some other teachers also lost air conditioning for a few minutes.</i> Feina laid face down on her bed. She lifted her legs and pulled off her ankle-high socks. <i>Good thing I didn't go with stockings.</i> She tosses the socks onto the floor before going to unlatch her skirt. She shimmies the skirt down her legs before throwing it onto the floor as well. She then reached behind her and felt the latch of her bra through her blouse. She quite quickly found the hook and undid it. She then rolled onto her back and began unbuttoning her blouse. With each button, her breasts fought to break free. Before she can even finish the fifth button, her breasts force themselves free. Her bra slides off to the side and she grabs it and tosses it onto the floor. She can hear it hit one of the empty cans of beer on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to clean...\" Feina says to herself. She finishes the last of her buttons and then continues to lay on her bed. \"Ah... This feels so nice...\" Her air conditioner kicks on and she feels a shiver go down her body as the cold air touches her bare skin. Save for the now completely open blouse and her black lace panties, Feina Solar was completely nude. It's unfortunate that, in her fatigue, she had forgotten about the tiny bug that she had nestled between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake began to stir as a gust of cold wind blew passed him. Raising his head, he felt incredibly fatigued, despite only just having woken up. He was very confused. From his prone position, he could see light creeping in from his north and south. South was also where the wind was coming from. However, everywhere else was just soft flesh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Blake suddenly screams out. <i>Is Ms. Solar laying down? I must be laying between her breasts, right up against her body. I can't believe I'm small enough to fit in this little gap.</i> Looking up, Blake could see the divide where her two breasts met. It still smelled heavily of sweat. <i>I guess she brought me somewhere she could open her blouse.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina laid there for another minute or two. She was in bliss as the cold air ran all over her tired body. As she laid there in a daze, she suddenly remembered...</span></div></div>",

Luckily, he was still in the narrow gap between her breasts. His world then turns sideways again as Feina rolls onto her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm so tired ~ !</i> Feina grumbles in her mind. <i>But I'll smell terrible if I don't...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly, Feina slides one foot of the bed and then the other and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Blake's world, he had once again fallen between Ms. Solar's cleavage. As she stood up, the weight of her massive breasts kept him pinned even as she walked towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina turned the knob and water began to flow out of the shower head and into the tub. She began to strip out of her panties and removed the blouse from her shoulders, dropping both on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could feel every movement she made and heard the shower curtain move as she stepped into the bathtub. Her breasts muffled the sounds of her feet stepping into onto the wet ground. Blake could hear Ms. Solar sigh as the water hit her breasts. He  could feel each drop like dozens of tiny drum beats. Things begin to get worse for him, though, as warm water begins to seep into her cleavage. The water hits him hard but he's still firmly stuck between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina is once again in bliss as she feels the water warm her body. Despite having sweated so much, the warm water melted away her fatigue. She rubbed her hands across the top of her breasts before grabbing them from underneath, pulling them apart to allow water into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow exposed to the world, every sound felt like it doubled in volume. Blake began sliding down Ms. Solar's breast. Fearful of the fall to the ground, he screamed and scrambled for anything he could grab. Unfortunately, he was unable to take hold of her skin and began sliding down. Luckily for him, he managed to grab onto her fingernail as her hand was currently positioned underneath her breast. Holding on for dear life, Blake kept his head down as a waterfall of water poured down onto the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I showed something so embarrassing to my students.\" Feina spoke to herself. \"My breasts were so sweaty. I'm surprised none of them complained about it. It was all the teachers were talking about...\" Feina feels something tugging at the back of her mind. Looking down at her cleavage, she scanned the sides of her breasts. She then chuckled to herself. \"Of course he didn't. Why would he? That'd be a stupid way to get close to Aria.\" Convinced she had just imagined her interactions with Blake, Feina released her breasts and they slammed together with a wet slap. Feina reached over to the side and grabbed a bottle of shampoo that was next to her loofah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake now had a good understanding of the situation. If he wants to survive, he needs to remind her that he really did shrink himself. But first he has to survive the shower. As Ms. Solar reached for the shampoo, he allowed himself to drop off her finger and onto the loofah below. As he lands, he finds the loofah isn't nearly as squishy at his current size. He lands on his side and slides into the center of the loofah. After taking a moment to readjust he stands up. His jaw hits the floor as he beholds Feina Solar in all her naked glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina squirts some shampoo into her hand and begins to lather up her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Aria, she seemed a bit upset about something. I should check up on her. It's a weekend but she doesn't live too far...\" Feina talks to herself as she dips her head under the water to rinse. It's a bit inconvenient being as tall as she is. She managed to find a place that had higher ceilings, but the shower head is still level with her head when she's standing normally. \"Fufu... A tiny Blake... I suppose all of my students are tiny compared to me. I need to have a good talk with some of those boys. I understand they're getting an interest in girls, but taking advantage of my size to peep is naughty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn't deny being somewhat guilty of this himself. He doesn't mean to but with the difference in their normal sizes, he can't help but take a peek when he needs to crouch to grab something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pants are probably hard to find.</i> Blake thinks to himself. He peeks his head over the edge of the loofah. Starting at Ms. Solar's fiery forest, he follows her long and slender legs to the ground. Water drips down from above forming a small puddle that flows down into the drain. <i>Her legs are kinda pretty, if I'm being honest.</i> Blake is brought back to attention as he hears Ms. Solar's hair flip back. Looking at her face, he can't help but be captivated. Even without makeup, she's a beauty to behold. His view of her face is then immediately blocked as her hand reaches towards him. \"Oh shit-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeina picked up the loofah and grabbed a bottle of body wash with her other hand. Had she been looking, she'd have seen Blake's tiny body stand out against the orange loofah. However, she instead just squirted the body wash onto the loofah and began rubbing her hands around it, building up a lather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's vision immediately turned white as the suds covered his body. An intense feeling of vertigo fills his body before his world flips upside down. He is immediately met with a flesh colored wall as Ms. Solar slides the loofah down the top of her breast. Blake is momentarily freed from the loofah but continues to slide down the slope of her breast. He kicked and clawed at the breast but the soap combined with her naturally smooth skin gave him nothing to grasp. He slid off of the breast and had another rough landing on the loofah. Looking up, he had only a moment to react before he was pressed firm against Ms. Solar's nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...\" Feina felt her nipple perk. She remembered being slightly aroused earlier in the day. She then feels a hint of embarrassment as she remembers the cause. <i>Did I really have some kind of fantasy about a tiny Blake? He's just my student...</i> She then brought the loofah underneath her breast before moving on to the other one. After making sure her other breast was properly soaped up, she placed the loofah between her breasts and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squeeze!\" With a smile on her face, Feina squished her breasts together, causing loads of suds to spurt from the loofah. \"Haha! That's one upside to having big breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shower pointed firmly at Ms. Solar's breasts, Blake found himself caught in a river of suds. Blake had been caught in the spurt of suds and had landed on her breast and began to slide down through the same gap he had started in. Knowing it was pointless, Blake decided not to try and grab at her skin. He found himself stuck slightly to her skin as the water pulled him down her body. Looking up, Ms. Solar was scrubbing the underside of her breast. Blake shuddered at the thought of being caught under the weight again. Looking down he was quickly approaching her pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not ideal, but I should be able to get a grip...</i> Blake reluctantly thought. Looking up again, Blake screamed as the gigantic loofah was chasing down her body after him. In no time he is once more dragged along by the soapy monster. He had no time to react as he is dragged through Ms. Solar's pubic hair. He tried to grab them to pull himself free but in only a second he was passed the hair and was only a few feet (to him) from Ms. Solar's love canyon. He looked back on the events leading up to this moment. Was it his fault for using spirits instead of talking with a girl? Perhaps for seeking out Ms. Solar for help? Was it her fault for forgetting about him? These questions prove futile as he is immediately slammed into the meaty folds of Ms. Solar's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph ~ ! You're a bit sensitive, aren't you ~ ?\" Feina comments to herself as she rubs her groin. Not wanting to get too aroused, she drags the loofah across her taint and brings it between her cheeks. She makes an effort to ensure every bit of her butt is cross and clean, as it is one of the dirtier parts of her body. After finishing, she brings the loofah up to the shower head and rinses off the suds and puts it back where it belongs. She turns around in the shower and allows the water to rinse the soap off her body before turning the water off. Dripping wet, Feina steps out of the shower and grabs a towel. Drying the various parts of her body, she wraps her long hair in the towel and steps out. Her nipples perk as the cold A/C causes a stark contrast from the warm bathroom. Ignoring the slight chill, Feina makes for the fridge, humming to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufu. To think I was thinking about sleeping 10 minutes ago. The weekend has just begun!\" Pulling the tab on a beer can, Feina starts chugging it down as she walks into her room. Grabbing a remote from her bedside, she turns on the TV and begins scanning through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake heard the TV come on and realized he was in danger. He was wedged in Ms. Solar's ass and if she sat down... Wriggling like mad, Blake managed to pop himself free of his prison, only to now be in free fall. Luckily, he landed on a soft slope and began rolling down to the center. Looking around, he was in a black-lace bowl the size of a mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be her bra...\" Blake muttered to himself. He looked up and saw Ms. Solar reaching back, examining her ass. However, she quickly dismisses whatever she felt and walks away. Blake hears her fridge open again and she comes back into the room, cracking open another beer can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a pillow from her bed, Feina throws it onto the ground right in front of her discarded bra. Her TV sat at an awkward angle and so she had no choice but to sit on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's probably how these cans get here...</i> Feina thinks to herself looking at the empty cans littering the floor. Regardless, she sits down on the pillow and begins watching the TV. Feina...</span></div></div>",

Desperately he tried to fly in the opposite direction, but he could not get away. From Ms Feina walking and yawning, he was pulled inside her immense maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Feina NO!\" Blake shouted, hoping his teacher would hear him. He was almost pulled down into her throat when she exhaled, sending him outward. \"Yes Yes Yes!.... No No NO!!\" But before he could be exhaled out, Ms Feina closed her mouth into a curvy smile. There Blake floated helpless inside of his teacher's unaware maw. Even worse he started to float back down, the spell wearing off \"NO! Come on! Can things get any worse.\" Blake sunk further until his feet touched the velvety and soft squishy surface of her tongue. Blake hadn't noticed but Ms. Feina had a strange minty atmosphere in her mouth, which he attributed to her chewing of spearmint gum. He looked around in the fleshy maw and saw what was normal in a mouth. Tongue, teeth and the throat in the back.Blake stood still on the wiggling muscle and tried to think of a way out. It would take some more time before his levitating spell would be able to be used again. For now, he slowly made his way to the front of her tongue towards her lips. Slowly and carefully he traversed the slimy muscle, getting saliva on his legs and lower torso. That changed however when he lost his footing towards the front and slipped, landing on his face onto the squishy surface, giving Ms. Feina a better taste of what was in her mouth. At first she hadn't noticed but with him moving around she noticed the strange feeling in her mouth. She was sitting down and grading and making a test when she tasted something nice in her mouth. She figured it was a piece of her lunch and decided she'd taste it a bit more before swallowing it. It would also be nice to chew on something while she worked too. Inside Blake laid there, getting some minty spit in his mouth as he waited for a reaction that never came. He spit out his teacher's spit and shuddered \"Eyuck... I'm almost out of here... \" Blake crawled slowly towards the lips, but before his could get to them ...</span></div></div>",

After a few deep breaths Blake was able to steel himself, so he could explore his teacher's innards, albiet barely. When Blake entered Ms. Solar's mouth he regreted his decision damn near instantly, it also didn't help that Feina had closed her mouth the moment that Blake had entered, making it that much harder to see, granted Blake's eyes adjusted to the darkness of his teacher's mouth after a few seconds, but the fact still stands. Blake was pretty much by himself, inside of a dark, slimy, organic cave, that he would have certaintly thought was some sort of realm that demons were living inside of if it wasn't for the fact that he knew that it was actually the mouth of Feina Solar, his favorite teacher, at least the minty air made this slightly more bearable. Meanwhile on the outside of the teacher's body, Ms. Solar was thinking about what just happened. She honestly wasn't expecting Blake to accept the assignment, she was just teasing the lovestruck mage, but it was to late to stop now. Okay, maybe it wasn't too late, but she thought that it would make things awkward if she said so right now if she didn't earlier, Feina felt a little stupid for not saying that she was joking. Back with Blake, he is currently running through the forest of tastebuds pretty quickly. However, because he's running so fast, he needs to stop and catch his breath. Blake also took a moment to take in his surroundings, as it turns out being inside a giant mouth isn't really that bad, it's still not the first place that one would immediately think of when they want to relax, but it could be worse, a lot worse in fact. Blake could be inside the mouth of Nora Comet. After that moment of respite Blake was just about ready to continue his assignment.</span></div></div>",

I'll be sure to take you out after class.\" Just then, your hot teacher's massive, nylon covered foot lowered down into the high heel, positioning you under her sole. As she wiggled her foot into the pump, she thought to herself: \"Wow, blake feels pretty good down there! Maybe i'll give him a nice stomp or two every now and again just to keep him wiggling!\" Meanwhile, Blake wasn't necessarily having a bad time. Turns out, little Blake has a foot fetish that even he didn't know about! As he was just discovering his newfound interest in his teachers feet, he noticed that they didn't smell very bad at all. They actually smelled very pleasant to Blake, almost like a scented candle. It was then that Ms. Solar had taken her first step with him under-tow (literally). As he was forcefully pressed into his teacher's warm sole, he had realized being crushed wasn't the worst thing either. The way she forced him into the ball of her foot had a very sexy appeal to it. Maybe he could get Aria to do this to him, granted he even made it out of his teacher's shoe. Now Ms. Solar was in her classroom, as class was about to start. She gave Blake a little stomp and ground him into the floor, twisting her foot back and forth before sitting down at her desk. The students began to arrive one by one and class started. After a little over an hours worth of Ms. Solar grinding you into the floor, the students started to leave the classroom, and class was over.</span></div></div>",

Leaving to go home after a long work day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Blake was a very dizzying situation with constant steps, and after his first lick which was just to communicate, her teacher twisted her foot occasionally, this time he learned that this meant she wanted some licks from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Feina Solar wasn't paying attention to her habits, making her think that Blake was doing it for the kindness of his heart, no knowing that once again she trained him to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she reached her home, and started to prepare dinner for her and her student, at last she took him out of her stocking, and gave him some dinner, they both ate, and after that she decided to see some tv taking Blake with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time seeing tv Feina Solar was holding her student in one hand, and with the other she stroked and rubbed Blake absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later she decided that was time to sleep asking where Blake wanted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Blake is time to go to bed, and I need to feel you at every moment to be sure that you are safe, which limits our options, I can put you in my fluffy sock for this cold night, sorry if isn't clean, today I was supposed to do the laundry but with your incident I completely forgot, or I can place you in my cleavage putting on this bra to secure you in place\" Feina Solar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing Blake in one hand an old and well worn green sock, and in the other an also worn sport bra.

I just wanted to keep you someplace safe....and maybe see what exactly your body can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not going well. A normal person trying to experiment with Blake might be bad, but another mage?! Who knows what Zella could do to his body with her powers. \"Zella...I'd rather that-\" he started before being silenced by Zella, \"Great, I'm glad you see it my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful giggle, Zella tossed Blake into her open mouth, the tiny mage screaming as she did so. Inside the dark cavern, Blake was soon met with her mighty tongue that began to take long licks of his body, obviously trying to find his flavor. \"Mmmmm, sweet and savory, a nice combination~\" she noted, heading towards an exit so she could bring Blake home for more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZella was ready to take it to the next level though, and began to chew on Blake's body, mushing him into a little wad like gum. \"Zella...please stop!\" Blake cried out, falling on deaf ears as she went on squishing the tiny mage. His body molded to the grooves and gave off more of his delectable flavor, causing Zella to chew harder and have more fun with Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing him to her pillowy lips with her tongue, she began to blow the mage out of her mouth in a tiny bubble, working her way up slowly to increase his size. \"Wow Blake, you're alot more durable than I thought you'd be.\" She thought to him, quickly sucking his body back in to chew once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Blake could do was sit back and let Zella enjoy his body. In this state, their wasn't a safe way to escape unless he was taken out. The tiny mage continued being stretched and chewed untill his next stop......</span></div></div>",

So, Blake figured he might as well enjoy this prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was perhaps his worst idea yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella walked toward the science lab, her class materials in hand, and her shrunken student in her mouth.

Not willing to take any risks, Mariella tilted her head back and let out a quick gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was horrified to feel the slippery tongue flick him into the dark abyss of Miss Weiss's throat. The esophagus, while tight, squeezed his tiny body downward quickly before depositing him through a small sphincter, at which point he fell onto the squishy floor of Mariella's stomach. The walls were pulsating, and a nearby greenish lake bubbled with acid. Now in a panic, Blake ran to the nearest wall and pounded on its fleshy surface repeatedly, yelling for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the tiny boy's struggles, Mariella looked down and gave her belly a slap, throwing her internal prisoner about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop squirming down there!\" Mariella ordered. \"I'll get you out after class, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Miss Weiss's words didn't calm the shrunken mage, Blake still followed her instructions and stopped beating at the stomach walls.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake made another attempt to explain what was going on, but Arina made it very clear that she wasn\u2019t planning on listening to him right now. Class was about to start and this was her weakest subject crazy shrunken boy or no, she needed to dedicate all of her attention to the classwork. \u201cJust stay put and keep quiet for now I promise to listen to you right after.\u201d Arina said as her Russian accent seemed to echo in Blake\u2019s ears. \u201cBut I need-\u201c But that was all Blake could get out before he was tucked back inside the pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark and completely uneventful in here. Blake was the only thing inside the pocket so there was nothing around to entertain himself with. Just boring silence. He considered calling up to Arina again, but figured it might be best to just do as she asks for now. Though she seemed nice so far, he didn\u2019t want to test how far her patience would go. Especially not at doll size. But at the same time, Blake felt like he was actually dying of boredom inside her coat pocket. He needed something to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Arina was trying to solve several problems on a worksheet that was handed out. The stuff was unfortunately above what she had learned before her transfer so she was mostly staring cluelessly at the paper. Staring so intently that she didn\u2019t notice a tiny figure poking out of her pocket to look around. This changed half a minute later after he examined the paper. \u201cThe answer\u2019s D\u201d he whispers, making the Russian girl jump a little. After looking around embarrassed to make sure nobody was looking at her for that she glared back down at Blake. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cheat. And stay down you idiot.\u201d Blake quietly started to oblige her order when a finger stopped him. \u201cYou got that answer really fast. A-are you sure that\u2019s the right one? Do you get this stuff?\u201d She asked quietly, making sure she wasn\u2019t drawing attention. Blake simply nodded. \u201cI... I had this class last year actually. I... if you want I can tutor you.\u201d He answered. He clearly said the right thing as the giant smiled before gently pressing him back down. \u201cJust stay put for now. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d And with that there was silence again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake sat there he was surprised at what he seemingly just did without thinking. \u201cDid... did I just get a it to agree to hang out with me after class?\u201d His mind rushed as this realization hit him. Not only did he talk to a girl and maybe set up a metting later, but the girl in question was actually quite pretty, and also a bit intimidating.. Figures he somehow pulls it off when he\u2019s stuck like at this size and confined to a coat pocket. Still it was a good step he supposed. Now just to wait out the rest of the class and he can try to talk to her about getting him fixed. Or maybe the tutoring thing or some other meeting. Someone like her definitely seemed like a great friend to have when he\u2019s in such a vulnerable state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the bell rang again. Arina fathered her things and started to leave. She thankfully didn\u2019t have practice today so she have all day to figure out the deal with Blake and at the very least get some study help from him. As she plucked him out of the pocket she inspected him once again inally getting a close look at the shrunken person. The probing eyes were not helping Blake\u2019s shyness. Earlier was a bit easier when she was focused on something else, but now Blake had her full attention and his legs were pretty much turning to jelly as a result.</span></div></div>",

Is that you you~?\" The girl said, smiling down at the tiny mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Crud!\"</i> Blake thought to himself, knowing he's done for...and groan at his nickname she said \"...H-Hi Kat. Nice to see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I didn't know you were into my feet. that's so cute. But being this small and get near my feet is a bit weird.\" Kat said while wiggling her toes slightly, making Blake loses his balance. Kat reaches down to grab Blake and holds him right in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I-I can explain...but I need to find Aria quickly, can you help me?\" Blake asked, hoping she'll help him find his love, but it looks like he won't see her as Kat giggles at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Should of known</font>...\" Blake said to himself and sighing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...I can take you to my big sis, I mean she likes you, ya know? She'll be soooo surprise to you being small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointing as it sound, Blake does see an opportunity to see Vixen and may be able to help reach Aria and reveal how he loves her, but if what Kat said about Vixen really him...that's gonna be a problem, though she is cute and sweet just like Aria...He hopes Vixen could rather be friends, if not, he might as well settle with her...</span></div></div>",

She began to skip again, making her way to Biology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap!</i> Blake tried to hold on as the build-sized foot he was clinging to pitched forward. How could something so big move so fast!? His grip was almost instantly broken, leaving him prone on the plain of lightly tanned skin. Each hop from the giant teen launched him into the air. He would then crash down with the reverberating slap of her soles on the floor. He slid down the slope of the foot, bouncing over the broad strap of Kat's sandal. Unpolished yet flawless-looking toes rested just beyond the huge, leather band. Blake was careening in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat yawned as she watched teacher from her desk near the back of the classroom. Nothing was more boring than a Biology lecture to start the day. As discreetly as possible, she turned on her phone in her lap. She absently wriggled her toes as she scrolled through Twitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had definitely overestimated his size. He had figured himself somewhere around an inch at first. Now, sandwiched between this girl's two largest toes, he knew he couldn't be more than a quarter-inch. Ant-sized. Walls of heavy flesh threatened to crush him, the enormous digits squeezed neatly into the sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, the smell wasn't even that bad. The flowery aroma of soap mostly overpowered the musk of her sweat. She must've showered that morning. However, that one mercy didn't outweigh the fact that he was trapped between a couple of huge <i>toes</i>. He groaned as they began to shift powerfully, cramming him even deeper into the damp sleeve.</span></div></div>",

Blake shuddered. Her grasp felt oddly cold. He easily sunk into the fleshy mounds of her palm, which nearly engulfed his limbs. Her eyes darted around quickly, her lip rubbing gently. What was she planning? Was she serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering terror tugged out a piece of gum. Not only that: USED gum. Off-pink, molded in the shape of gigantic molars... and, as she removed it from its plastic bag, the minuscule mage noticed that it smelt of her breath. He nearly squealed, reeling away from the chewed wad. His hands clawed across the wrinkles in her skin, tickling her gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, shrimp?\" She taunted above, after making sure nobody was around. \"Are you THAT scared of a bit of candy?\" It wiggled teasingly in front of his face - so close he could almost taste the wet surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, she plunged him in, back-first. Blake bit his teeth to withstand the pressure against his chest. The great pillars of Nora's fingers squeezed quickly, brutally mashing him into the wad. Within a few idle twitches of her digits, the shrunken black shirt and pants were indistinguishable from the snack. No matter how hard he tried to move his arms, the rosy wet mass stuck to them - immobilizing the boy completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk slid across her face. Nora slid her tongue out, opening her jaw - salivating intensely as she swept it over her victim's exposed face. Her lips closed teasingly around the gum piece, cutting him off from all light - and she started sucking. Blake felt as if his head was about to be torn off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly tugged him back out, cheeks spread in a mockingly-innocent smile. \"How does it look like in there, smallstuff?\" One finger picked her nose. \"Like an inescapable cave? Or... like a red carpet, welcoming its guest? Maybe like a graveyard of my last few meals?\" She bit the air in front of him, nearly nipping off his nose. Her stomach groaned softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Please don't eat me!\" He wailed, unable to wipe the sweat from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimming pools of her eyes narrowed to laser beams. \"Eat you? And clog my system with a sniveling deviant like you?\" She laughed loud and hard, spew flying from her mouth out at Blake's face. \"I'd rather swallow down a turd! But if you REALLY insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his protests, she opened wide - and carelessly flicked the gum wad in, along with Blake. He landed on her tongue, splashing into a pool of her juices. The muscle instantly began flipping his squishy prison around. It alternated between a perfect view of her throat, and a faceful of her drool. Then, she lathered him with wave upon layer of spit, soaking his clothes. He kept pushing back, trying to bear the pain - but it was no use, the nightmare of a girl had him completely at her mercy.<br>\r\nThat's when she decided to start chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora's tongue tossed him brusquely onto her right molar. He knew what was happening, and cried out for a shred of compassion one last time. His answer: the full force of her upper jaw squeezing down on him. With a horrible CHOMP, she ground her teeth together. Blake felt his limbs twist into impossible positions with every motion she made. When the two while walls separated once more, some of the pink candy clung to it - he could see the thin traces of moisture running across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, her tongue grasped him again - tossing his body to the other side of her mouth. He could see Nora's cheek curl up in a smile, even from the inside. It disgusted him. Blake's back felt to brunt of her molar's assault, compressing him tighter into the candy - and pushing his mind closer to breaking. He hated it. That smile - it looked so innocent and unassuming from a distance. Almost sickeningly cute. But whenever she put it on, it was followed by a taunt, or a threat. As the teeth kept driving into him, like fierce daggers jabbing into him, it was all he could think of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora chuckled softly. By now, she'd walked a fair distance with this tiny boy in her mouth. Finally, the school would be free from his stupid looks, his weird murmurings, his stupid whining. Her mind ran free with possibilities, dreaming about new ways to torment him. Until one enticing question popped into her head. How did he get so tiny? People didn't just shrink, no matter how weird they were. Did he build a shrink ray? If he knew how to do that, he might know other things. Things she could use. Things with which she could terrorize him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving felt enough of his pointless struggling, she started to blow a bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spread him across the roof of her mouth, pressing hard. The ridges drove into his chest, making him cry out in terror. When it was flat enough, her lips puckered out. The gum moved, pulling Blake with it. It expanded. The pink surface was weak enough for Blake to get free from, now - only for the minuscule mage to face a hurricane of her breath against him. He forced back, but his legs were still numb from torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he was hurdling to the bubble - a pink globe that just kept getting bigger. He landed on its side, not leaving even an indent. Across from him lay lockers and classroom doors he recognized. Below, way down below, the floor tiles spread out in a hypnotic pattern - should he drop, it'd be a harsh impact. And behind him... Nora. Still smiling as wide as ever. Her hands planted firmly on her hips. With a wink, she blew a little more -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little speck of a boy fell through the air - only to land right back into his captor's palm. She peered down, licking her lips clean of the pink gum surrounding them. He quivered, nearly bowing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"I'm sure you will. If you don't... I might just decide you taste good after all.\" She rubbed her cheek. \"Now, how to break you in next...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nora's looming face peered in closer. He got a full view of the flesh mountains that formed her nose and cheeks. The crashing bangs across her head were like branches swept in a storm. Her other hand lifted upwards, index held behind her thumb - in a flash, she flicked Blake. The force made him fly halfway across her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruel girl's laughter boomed in his ears - followed by her gum-chewing. This couldn't be it. There HAD to be some escape route, some way to talk her out of this! He gulped, gathering his words - but she cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I've got a few questions. How did you make yourself a bug? Not that you weren't pesky before, but seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shook his head. What a girl like Nora could do with his secrets... He didn't even want to think that. \"No idea! I just woke up like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared down to his tiny eyes, brow falling down. \"You're a pathetic liar. A pathetic everything, really.\" Her face twisted upwards, scooping him up with her nose. \"Spill. Spill it. Did you get caught in an embarrassing science lab accident? Get caught in the clothes dryer?\" She tilted her head slightly, making him slide down the ridge. He could feel her heavy breathing underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you! I don't know!\" He started running - leaping off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beeep! Wrong answer.\" She called out, snatching him from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in her fingers again. His owner spat her gum out, and began sticking it to him again - this time, tying it like a rope around his arms and legs. He froze, unsure what she'd do if he struck back. By the time he was fully tied, there was still a bit of stringy gum hanging behind him. Nora pulled him up by that - dangling his body back and forth like a pendulum above her mouth. \"Maybe a few hours trapped in my big, bad belly will jog your memory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You wouldn't!\" He gasped. The mouth below had red, glistening walls, leading far down below. \"You're going to kill me!\" Of course, he was halfway bluffing - she didn't know about his super endurance. But maybe, if he could appeal to her kinder side-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bounced him slightly, using the candy like a bungee cord. \"Gum doesn't digest, stupid.\" She rubbed her stomach, calming its slight gurgles. \"At least, I'm pretty sure that's how it works. I'd like to find out!\" Her pink lips parted, as she dangled Blake's trapped body a little more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! Nonono! This couldn't be happening! His mind went over every spell in his books, trying to come up with something. But - to reveal himself here, like this? He couldn't take that lightly - but he couldn't go hurtling into her mouth! This was NORA, for crying out loud! Finally, he swallowed, and yelped out: \"WIND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great tornado took him - a gentle breeze to the titanic girl. The wind's strength snapped through the thin strand of gum - and sent him pummeling down into the hungry gullet. His senses were overtaken with Nora's breath, the feeling of her saliva against his face, the mocking laughter that erupted all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, her esophagus forced him down. It masticated him with the gum. For a second, it froze, struggling to bring the mass down. A like poke from the titanic finger on the other side of the throat pushed it down - and he soon found his free-fall continuing, down into the murky depths of her gut. He splashed into an off-green sea of acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe micro mage could barely look. The place was like a lost world of half-digested snacks, meals, and muscle, spreading out everywhere - slowly sloshing. Sure, he'd seen anatomical diagrams of it. But they always looked so clean, so formal... They didn't have the rhythmic movements that sounded out here, the foul smell of digestive bile, the sound of juices mingling and a frozen heart thumping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft stomach wall to his right hit him, hard. Blake knew Nora was patting her pudgy belly. It made the waves of liquid and food around grow wilder. Even worse than the sounds of her body processing food, her voice boomed around, in every direction: \"Wind? What the heck was that? Some sorta magic? Well, best hope you're better at escape tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the horrors around him - even with the girl having seen proof of his best-hidden, most potentially destructive secret - Blake tried to stay calm. He focused his strength, whispering mage chants. With the way she'd wrapped the gum, he didn't actually have much trouble moving this time. Though gross, it made a suitable armor against her enzymes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teensy mage took a long moment like this - just thinking of potential ways to leave. He slammed his shoulder into one pulsating pink wall - only to stick to it. He unglued himself, and rammed into it again - with greater strength. It only bounced back at him, like a boxing weight - forcing him to the liquid again. When he got up, some minuscule crumbs from crackers and cheese had gathered across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sudden roar sounded out - this one from the outside. Shortly after, Nora's voice rang in his ears. \"You're probably lonely there, huh? No friends, no way out... Don't worry, I'm sending you some company!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little mage's mind raced. What company? Was someone else tiny? He held his neck up, meeting the new arrival - a stream of clear soda that sputtered against his face. Some slid between his lips, which he immediately spat back out. He was willing to endure many things to keep his magic a secret from evil. But he would NOT swallow anything his old tormentor had already slurped down. He remembered that she'd usually order this drink with his lunch money - and always almost accompanied by-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLORT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat. He could barely dodge before a glob of curry pinned his legs down. The orange sauce crawled down like toxic ooze; its strong, meaty odor mingling with the bazaar of other scents in the realm of his bully's protruding gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, she poked her navel - squeezing the walls in again. \"I've ordered a nice, big portion in case a certain little parasite down there gets hungry. Be thankful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother forkful fell down, spreading out before Blake like an island in the murky, warm sea. Her stomach growled, which came out to Blake like the sound of twelve lions about to devour him. The immense trembling made acid fall from the ceiling, and churned all the contents around - tossing Blake to the other end of the digestive organ. She slid a hand under her shirt to rub her belly, deliberately being as slow and hard as possible - wondering what sort of torment it was sending her plaything. \"You really should try some, this stuff's great. But it always upsets my stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punctuated that with another sip of her soda. Nearly immediately after the waterfall of liquid descended, the mage made out small bubbles ascending to the roof of her mouth... And soon, another earth-rattling sensation came forth from the depths of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUURRRP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belch blew him of the squishy ground, and shook the whole miasma-laden microcosm. Blake remembered a time he was on a water park ride like this - safety inspectors had it shut down not long after. Nora's stomach, though - it made that whole thrilling experience feel like a playground slide in comparison. It was like being caught in a whirling, violent tempest of gunk and juice, lathering his gum-coated body again and again in thick coats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she didn't stop. No - she went out of her way to buy refills, salads, side-dishes - everything she got her hands on, she instantly stuffed in her greedy mouth. And everything that fell down added a new, unique sensation to Blake's pain. The strong mingling of ketchup and mustard. Floods of energy drinks, sweeping across the biological prison. Whole tectonic plates of masticated chips, smothering out the breathing space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, moving became an impossible dream, so heavy his body felt with the foodstuffs hanging over his body. And each moment it seemed like the storm would stop - that the rumbling and burping would slow down - that maybe, he could have a moment yo rest from the violent sloshing... She got up for more. Her movements were wide, exaggerated, as if to make sure her body kept stirring the snack of a boy inside. Sometimes, she seemed to just stand up to stretch, or jog in place - tilting Blake's center of gravity this way and that, and leading to more wails from deep within her inescapable body. Every attempt he made to escape just had him fall back into the acids. And every time, there was more of her food and drool clinging all over his body, making him nearly indistinguishable from the other contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing one muffled scream from deep within, Nora rubbed her shirt again, smiling. What would people think if they knew he was in there? Well, that didn't matter - nobody could see him. Nobody could help him. He was truly stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuck in another whisper down to him when nobody was listening: \"Welcome to hell.\"</span></div></div>",

In nearly a minute, Blake's chewed-up shackles were dissolved completely, allowing him to wade to the fleshy stomach walls and pound repeatedly, yelling for help as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds into his vain struggles, Blake felt a sharp irritation in his legs and feet...followed by an even worse burning sensation. Nora's stomach acids were slowly eating away at the shrunken boy's skin, bringing his pain to even more intense levels. In about three minutes, Blake figured his feet were completely digested, and in six...he blacked out, sinking into the boiling lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora looked down and rubbed her tummy, no longer feeling the annoying efforts of her little snack to fight for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, the little runt stops squirming,\" Nora said to herself, \"I bet he'll go right through me in a matter of hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the bell rang -- lunchtime was over. Nora got up and grabbed her things before making her way toward Ms. Solar's homeroom for her next class.

But such was not the case at all...the poor boy had suffered a fate far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slowly and groggily awoke to a startling sight -- a classroom? But how? He tried to move around, but came to the shocking realization that he couldn't budge! He then peered around in place to discover that he couldn't see his arms...his legs...or his body! The only things Blake was aware of were a low growl behind him and a hand rubbing him...then the horrible truth dawned on him - he had been digested completely and converted entirely into muscle for Nora's abs! Blake panicked, yelling to his host for help...well, TRYING to, anyway. He couldn't speak out loud in his new form, so he had to come up with some other way to get Nora's attention. What did he have left to lose? The bodiless soul concentrated deeply, but all he could manage was weak jiggling in the skin of his bully's chubby abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully Nora would notice this...</span></div></div>",

If he couldn't think of it soon, he would be trapped in the abs of his enemy for the rest of her life! \"Alright, here we are. Time to make your new home look comfy and stylish.\" Nora laughed evilly as she patted her gut. When she opened the door she was quickly greeted by a woman decked head to toe in tattoos and a few nose piercings. \"Hello, I want to get a belly button piercing. Something with a little flair to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman quickly came back with a piercing that was shaped like a tiny key, oh irony. \"That's perfect!\" She exclaimed, rubbing her gut to tease the tiny mage in his frantic search through his brain. Part of the spell has come back to him, but it wouldn't be enough to get back to normal. \"Take these two that are now one......what was the rest?!\" Blake said, hoping to escape as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking care of all the proper requirements before, Nora hopped up onto the chair and lifted her shirt up. The woman brought the small key and the device that would seal Blake away closer to her belly button. \"Take these two that are now one.....and....undo the magic....that has been done!!!\" Blake exclaimed from Nora's abs, but as he said the word done a sharp pain shot though him. Nora had gotten the piercing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light that Blake started to create from his spell immediately faded, essentially killing all of Blake's magical powers. \"Wow, it looks so nice! Thank you, I imagine this will make a special little guy very happy.\" Nora said as she paid for her new piercing. She was in a decent amount of pain, but she knew hers would be shorter than the long emotional pain Blake would now endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what will become of our little mage?</span></div></div>",

No one would ever think that a tiny mage was sealed inside, crying to the world for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora, get me out of here, I need help!!\" He screamed, wondering if she would even be able to hear him over the jiggling protests. Nora quickly slapped her abs, silencing his moves, \"Stop squirming down there, if you wanted to get out so bad why don't you just do it?!\" They both were silent for a minute, and that's when she realized what was going on. \"Wait a minute.....you can't get out can you?! The piercing is holding you inside like a lock! Bwahahahahah!!!!!\" She laughed, tightening her gut and getting tears in her eyes. \"Oh that's perfect! You can't get out unless I let you! I think school will be interesting tomorrow for you.\" With that said, Nora continued on her way home, paying no attention to Blake as she traveled back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora no! T-thats not true, I can get out, I....just want to be able to do it when you least expect it!\" He tried to lie. The whole trip home, Blake was trying to think of some way out of this, but every option was useless as Nora kept slapping him, as if to reject the idea. Before long, she had made it back home and flopped onto her bed, getting ready for a well earned rest. \"Night gut, see you tomorrow for a day of humiliating torture!\" She laughed, wiggling in bed before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake cried silently the whole night, praying he could get some sleep as the hours ticked away. He thought about life as Noras abs, being forced to see everyone and everything he knew and loved, but not being able to interact with them. Stuck with the person he hated the most until she decided to take the piercing out. The night went by slowly, but eventually Nora was up and about, getting ready for school and not even giving Blake a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls were filled with their fellow classmates; and it seemed that everyone was in love with Nora's new piercing. Usually, people didn't look at her much, but it was like the new accessory took the weight off of her. \"Looking good Nora, love the new you.\" Came the happy voices of students. But it was one that made Blake begin to panic especially: Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nora you're looking great today....Uhm....I have a strange question...have you seen Blake, he's been a bit.... different lately.\" She said nervously, wondering if she knew what she meant. Blake was screaming for help, thrashing and jiggling around. The look on Nora's face was one of fear, knowing that she couldn't slap him or she would be caught. She could feel her abs moving, but the question was, did Aria notice?</span></div></div>",

While many a student would find it boring beyond words, it was an extremely calming sight to the bookworm girl, who vastly preferred the company of books to that of most people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding whatever she had heard was nothing more than a small trick of the mind, she quickly returned to her studies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInd-go! -leas- he--!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she heard the noise, much clearer than before and easily discernible as a voice, and this time Indigo pulled her head up from her book to scan around the room.

Her pudge didn't seem to bother anyone -- they were far too dazzled by the tiny adornment on her navel to notice it...or the fact that Blake had been missing for several days now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Blake, the poor mage sobbed softly as his captor showed off her piercing. Whenever he would try to jiggle her abs and get someone to notice his plight, Nora would slap her gut, sending a brief surge of pain through Blake. Unfortunately, with the key-like object pierced into Nora's navel, he couldn't cast the separation spell, and thus he couldn't return to his normal self. He was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Friday afternoon, however, Nora had already forgotten about her little prisoner, having a new problem to deal with -- she had come down with a bit of a stomachache! She figured the piercing may have gone a bit too deep into the skin of her abs. The chubby bully put two fingers to the cold metal and, with some painful effort, managed to remove the piercing from her belly button before heading out of her room to fetch some medicine for her aching tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was Blake's chance to escape! The mage sighed and concentrated deeply, preparing the spell that would get him out of his tormentor's abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take these two that are now one...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nora chuckled, walking over to a bench - resting her large buttocks on a spot where she'd carved her initials. She tossed Blake up and down in her palm. At the sudden changes in gravity, pulling his messy hair up and down, he desperately screamed out - his voice only a faint whistle to the rest of the world, but like a wonderful solo performance to the bully's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome curious students turned their heads to check the noise's source. With a few dark-intentioned stares, and directions from her hand, the bully warded them off. She kicked her feet out, looking at her purple sneakers. Ages of abuse had made the laces brown. They presently hung next to the treads across the bottom, the spongy grips like the walls of an ancient ruin. An idea came into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her open jaws chomped him in midair, like a shark grabbing prey from above. The mage was subjected to a few more excruciating chomp cycles. They drove him back into the gum wad, and deep, to boot. Nora had to make sure it had been softened up enough, and was soaking wet - that would help bring out the old gum's stickiness. Suddenly, her lips fell close together in a pucker - and she spat him out, hurdling the half-inch body to the floor tiles at exit velocity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake lay aching below, a pathetic black dot in the pink mass. Thankfully, his superhuman strength - and the fruity candy's padding - protected him from any injury. But under Nora's laughing - the girl looking down through her nose in callous disdain - he knew more pain was coming . The wad constricted him, preventing all movement. Even if he could lift an arm, pull off a spell, Blake was too shocked by the sudden halt to make a move. He only sweated as he watched her scraped knees swing back and forth in the sky, making her shoe's sole a looming pendulum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp. Your flavor didn't last.\" Nora didn't even try to lower her voice - she was skipping, and the halls cleared out quickly. She hovered her worn sneaker's toes over him, laughing at how easily she made him recoil. His head twisted back and forth to get away from the white-tipped, titanic footwear. It tapped his chest, releasing the wind from him in one swift puff. When he tried to breathe again, all he cloud grab was the slight musk from the gigantic, worn shoes that lay above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stepped down. Her heel fell onto him, squeezing him against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink gunk slid easily between the treads, gripping onto them. They pressed deep in, the gum spreading further under Nora's foot pressure; it slid around Blake's arms and legs, gluing him in deeper. When her sole lifted, he felt himself rising with the leg. And as she leaped off the bench, he fell to the ground - hurtling onto the cold tiles, protected only by a tight layer of candy and a bully's disgusting spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped. She'd just glued him to her right sneaker's sole! That filthy, worn footwear that gathered all sorts of bugs, dirt, and bacteria... He was a piece of gum stuck to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully took a step forward with her left leg. He heard the THWOOM in the distance, a muted echo - but couldn't see a thing. At least, not until she began lifted the other leg, showing him a blur of lockers and the familiar-but-dizzying wall paint. Within a second, she'd finished her step, slamming him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard another deep noise forward - the only indication of direction in the void underneath her treads. Another step, sending the mage flying forward - and he was already praying for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hall monitors will catch me if I stay in place for too long.\" She giggled, deliberately stomping as hard as possible. \"But don't worry about them spotting you. You'll soon be so covered in dirt and motionless that nobody will be able to tell you from the gunk gathered on my shoe.\" Another harsh step - Nora bent down a bit to shift her weight to her right foot. \"And if they can see you - well, who'd blame me? People step in gum all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now leaped forward, landing hard on Blake's body.  This was a horrifying experience, sending him twitching in terror. Nora bore some very unique physical traits. One, tucked snugly under the T-shirt, was a rather chubby gut; it held an above-average amount of body weight, which the minuscule mage had to handle all at once. Another was her strong leg muscles - useful for kicking soccer balls, kicking people in the shins, and, as she'd just discovered, crushing and grinding little people into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torture continued, her mind swimming with new ideas. Occasionally, she'd jump in the air, to see if she could hear his tiny shriek. At intersections, she turned on her heel, rubbing him across the brunt of her shoe sole. Once, she shuffled across a hall. He was smeared back and forth, unable to react to her rapid leg movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified little boy made her feel huge; important. The floor tiled, lined neatly along the lookers, became like city blocks in her mind; the paste between them, like bustling streets. With her head lifted high, she continued forward, imagining in glee every bit of terror Blake was feeling. And that was only the start; she knew she could drill in deeper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they reached the bench again. The girl lifted her foot up, to inspect the shrunken teen's mangled body. His gummy just as black as his shirt and hair. Blake himself was still breathing - loudly, erratically, in huge gulps. She laughed, resting the sole in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken mage calmed his chattering teeth, and gathered just enough thin air in his minuscule lungs to say: \"P-please... Nora, stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips opened again, as if to speak - but then landed together again. Instead of words coming out, a liquid comet fell from her mouth. She just spat on him! The glob of saliva coated Blake's head, sliding into his own open jaws. This cured his catatonic state, if anything. He began struggling helplessly, brain yelling to unresponsive pink-covered limbs, helplessly sputtering out the bully's disgusting drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choking on drool? You've hit a new depth of pathetic.\" One of her fingers wiped a slimy stalactite from her mouth, before she licked it back in. \"You should thank me. That's the only time you'll ever share spit with a girl. Now, how could a spineless piece of garbage like you survive chewing and stomping for so long?\" She lifted her other shoe up, dangling it above his stuck body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't dare speak again - knowing that whatever he said would just dig him in deeper. Instead, he tried to clear his mind - ignore the shifting ceiling lights under the shadow of Nora's gigantic sole, ignore the faint traces of dirt raining down on him, and find a spell that would save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, it's a secret.\" She chuckled. \"I <i>love</i> squeezing secrets out of wusses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily, her left leg slid across the bench, and swung forward. The slanted shoe-ground erupted around Blake. All his thoughts were tossed out by a sudden surge of panic and pain. The bully was crushing his lower body between the tip of her left shoe and the heel of her right one. His eyes darted open, running across the tree trunk sized laces. He looked across them, up the smooth expanse of her half-bare legs, and into her own eyes, looking for a trace of mercy. Her chin rested in her palms, fingers puling up her cheeks - making her smile look catlike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rotated her ankle, drilling down into the gum wad - and grinding poor Blake's limbs and crotch into the worn-out, tough rubber. \"Wow, it's fun just WATCHING you squirm, even if I can't feel you. I wonder how much more weight I can put on?\" She slid the shoe further over him. In a disgusting display, the treads clung hard to her chewed-up gum, lifting it from the floor, and pulling with her sole. Now, his whole torso was being crushed by the sneaker's tip. And more of it crept forward, spreading the overwhelming mass over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laugh filled the air. \"Spill it. Spew it out. I want to know how you got so small, idiot - and how you survived.\" Even if she was grinning, the glare in her eyes and bared teeth reflected a boiling rage. \"What have you got to lose? Your dignity? That's gone. Your chances at love were always doomed. What else - your life? Your friends? Come on! Five, four...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. This wasn't possible. The bane of his existence, towering over him... Trying to pry away his secret. This teenage girl, who he'd been trained to fear and avoid, had full control over his tiny body, the ability to mold him in any way. And she was seconds away from finding out his other life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three, two... Time's almost up, shoe stain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt naked before her, red with tension and pressure. Crying for help was useless. Worst of all, she was so happy about it - just getting so high off the ability to grind him into nothingness, send pain shooting down a human body with nothing but tiny flicks, twists, and steps...</span></div></div>",

The wind carried Blake like a fallen, lightweight leaf away from Nora as she stared in shock at what she'd witnessed. The little twerp had magic powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Blake, he had no control over the direction or strength of the gust he'd conjured. Tossed and turned helplessly, the boy could only let the wind carry him through the halls of Opal High until it would wear off.

Blake did try to scream for help, but his pleas went unheard from the walls of elastic and denim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was humiliating.

Though her tone sounded weirdly sweet, her expression told him all he needed to know. This girl was dangerous. \u201cI know nerds like you get a little clueless but I know you\u2019re at least smart enough to figure out what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was literally shaking in Nora\u2019s tight grip. The thought of being a plaything for the pleasure of this monster crushed him emotionally much like her hand was starting to do to him physically. With a loud scream of pain Blake struggled futilely to fight back against the hand. \u201cGood you do have some fight in you. You\u2019ll need it for the job.\u201d Before he could act she dropped him inside her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took this brief reprieve to think about his horrendous situation. Of all the people to find him it had to be her. \u201cYou better do a good job down there lover boy.\u201d Her voice echoed above. The nature of this task brought to mind all the times Blake heard that sometimes bullies of the opposite sex secretly have an attraction to their victims. The thought of him dating Nora made him cringe a bit as he thought of the hell she put him through for his entire life. Never letting up no matter what... and yet, the faint hope that that story was actually the case did flash in his mind. The slightest possibility that she likes him enough not to kill him, or she\u2019ll maybe treat him slightly better, especially when he\u2019s like this. Of course, Blake wouldn't dare to bring this up with Nora herself. That would get him a whole day as her punching bag for even thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what exactly is Nora\u2019s deal</span></div></div>",

The strong gust of wind from the impact sent him flying into some nearby grass, but he's unharmed. He may or may not have discharged his bladder and/or bowels from the sudden near death experience, but he's still fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also may or may not discharged his bladder and/or bowels again as he tipped his head upward to gaze at the ginormous tall tower of a woman whose sporting the work boots that almost grounded him to paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, way way WAY above, was a black-haired girl in thick glasses wearing a fancy executive shirt and tie that certainly did not go well with her dark blue jeans and fucking leather work boots that almost murdered an innocent tiny human being! Even if Blake wasnt dumbstruck by the incredible size of the girl, he'd be kinda dumbstruck by that unique ability she's got with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's scribbling a note on a notepad with one hand while carefully applying a little mascara with the same hand. The other hand's holding said notepad AND a little compact mirror to help her guide her as she's applying said mascara\u2026 and on her pinky, she's holding a coffee cup she's drinking out of WHILE scribbling notes and applying mascara!<br>\r\nThat's pretty impressive. And you know what they say about girls that know how to use their hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Theyre very 'handy'! (what, did you think I was gonna make a perv joke?!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 are we gonna film something yet?\u201d grunted the big balding towering beast of a guy with said handy girl carrying a camera and a huge box of camera equipment. It looked like it all weighed a ton, but the guy was pretty muscley, so he looked like he could handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost ready! I'm almost ready,\u201d the girl said as she applied the finishing touches, \u201cThere! Could you pass me the mic and hold the rest of these, please?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 I dont have any free hands,\u201d the big camera guy stated, \u201ccant you put them on the floor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut they'll get dirty,\u201d she stated but sighed, \u201cok, fine.\u201d She crammed her stuff in the box of equipment and pulled out a microphone with a logo marked 'DDL'. Blake vaguely recognized the DDL from school. It was in the school newspaper, but he never bothered to read that part of it. Fanatical garbage was never his thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMic check. One two. Mic check one two. Ward, did you remember to turn the mic on?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d answered Ward the cameraman, \u201cKept it on since the trial run back at your place.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKept it on since\u2026?! That was simply to test the audio back over there! Why would you leave the battery running for a whole hour and a half?!\u201d the girl got understandably perturbed.<br>\r\nWard seemed unbothered, \u201cYou never told me to turn it off afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI seriously have to tell you to\u2026 ugh...\u201d she adjusts her glasses and forcefully shrugs it off, \u201cnevermind. How do my glasses look?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike the bottom of my dad's old antique coke bottles?\u201d if Blake wasnt terrified of his current state, he'd be exhaling hard at Ward's simple-mindedness.<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me later to take your name off the credits.\u201d Ward actually replied \u201cOk\u201d!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Turn on the camera and start the countdown,\u201d she ordered.<br>\r\n\u201cThen what?\u201d asked Ward.<br>\r\n\u201cSay go!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo! AFTER the countdown!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk. 3\u2026.2..\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you turn on the camera first?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are you counting?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou didnt tell me to-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood lord, Ward!!\u201d And it pretty much went on from there. As the two bickered, Blake edged a bit closer to the humongous reporter. He contemplated heading over to the two and trying to get help from them considering theyre within range. However the thought of being inadvertently stomped by a leather boot fought strongly against that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seemed like an hour but was actually a minute and a half, the reporter and her lacky finally got her stuff together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d the reporter smiled for the camera, \u201cthis is Lotta Mira, reporter/senior writer/producer/editor/director for Daily Dirty Laundry. Giving you the real gritty dirty details those big networks wont dare touch. I'm standing here near the corners of Williams St &amp; Maddison Ln, investigating an alleged top-secret government experimental program that's causing the latest disappearances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake squinted his eyes, intrigued by the potentially exaggerated news report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite a few students of local schools rumored to have gone missing have been reported to have last been seen in this street,\u201d Lotta said, \u201cthough a few sources claim that it's simply fans of the occult casting spells gone wrong,\u201d How does she manage to say that so casually?! \u201cOne source says some of these students were tricked and manipulated by government agents posing as gypsy fortunetellers.\u201d<br>\r\nBlake squinted his eyes! Gypsy fortunetellers, huh? Come to think of it, wasnt it THIS particular part of the street where Blake met a guy who sold him a spell book?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe source claims that these 'spells' these phony gypsies peddle are actually shadow-government approved experiments meant to test unreleased prototypes using gullible occult-fans as guinea pigs to try them out on.\u201d<br>\r\nBlake gasped hard. It couldnt possibly be true, could it?! All that time he spent learning 'spells' and 'tricks'\u2026 was it really the government just experimenting on him?! And even worse! Are there more like him?! He needs to know more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould what seems like a disturbing but completely harmless past-time gone wrong really be something cold, deceptive, and inhumane approved by our very nation's-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Lotta?\u201d Ward interrupted Lotta's report, \u201cwhat does a little red blinking X-ed out tape mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt means there's no tape in the camera. Why do y-\u201d Lotta's eyes widened behind her big glasses, \u201cWard, did you seriously forget to put tape in the camera?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 probably,\u201d Ward dumbly answers, \u201c...was it supposed to that one sitting on the table back at your place with the letters 'DDL' on it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cObviously!\u201d she remarked, \u201cwhere is it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c...Sitting on the table back your place.\u201d JEEZ! HE'S REALLY THAT DUMB?!<br>\r\nSurprise to no one, Lotta's jaw dropped at the shock of pure dumbfoundedness before her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOW COULD YOU HONESTLY FORGET-ugh!\u201d she took off her glasses briefly to rub your aching head, \u201cwell, let's get start heading back! Thanks Ward for sabotaging my ginormously big scoop!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYoure welcome.\u201d And with that, the two gathered their things and got ready to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake still contemplated following them finding out more about this whole secret government experiment schtick. His biggest opportunity came in the shape of that colossal boot that almost crushed him. He could hitch a ride and find an opportune time to introduce himself to Lotta.<br>\r\nProvided he doesnt slip off and ends up getting crunched underneath that boot, first! His fear of such a horrific death were overshadowing discovery and potential (hopefully) help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his fears, this was opportunity and opportunity was about to leave.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, her long slimy tongue lifted giving space for the new passenger to land on the wet gummy floor underneath. His screams quickly got muffed as soon as the tongue pressed down on top of him, trying it's damndest to keep him at bay. It was the only thing keeping him from slipping away to her throat as she gathered her remaining things and rushed off to catch up with Ward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake attempted to scream for Ward's help, but there was no chance he could hear him. And even if he could, there was most likely an even smaller chance he could save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Lotta?\u201d speaking of which, Blake heard Ward's voice call out from outside the pearly white flouride-free washed cavern.<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT IS IT, WARD?!!\u201d Strong storm forced winds shot out from the direction of the throat and the large tongued constantly shifted and turned over Blake's body as Lotta replied back.<br>\r\n\u201cI kinda sorta\u2026 got to thinking,\u201d the big bald dope mulled, \u201cif this report really is real, and that the government is using it's governing for evil running a human guinea-pig lab\u2026 what if they find out about the report?

Ya know, Principal Ashwynn said he was gonna expel us if we cause another big scandal without any evidence.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh ho ho. I got proof,\u201d Lotta chuckled. Unfortunately, that little chuckle was a big mistake. For that little chuckle rattled her tongue a lot, lifting it's massive weight off Blake as he bounced around the dark cavernous room with absolutely no protection! Sadly, his screams fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Ward jerked his head to her in full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYEP!\u201d Lotta quipped as the 'Yep' sent him flying towards her teeth, \u201cYEP I DO!\u201d Blake barely managed to miss the molars which wouldve no doubt crushed him into paste in just three simply syllables!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you have?\u201d Ward asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta tilted her head a little smugly\u2026 causing the mouth chamber to tip downwards and sending Blake toward the dark abyss! He ran like the dickens across that wet slimy tongue desperately trying to keep away from the throat of no return\u2026 but then her tongue constantly bounced him around as she continued talking!<br>\r\n\u201cIt just so happens I've discovered what may very well be the most compelling evidence anyone's gonna find that's guaranteed to put our story all over national television!\u201d Blake got chucked around, twisted, spun, and rolled about repeatedly via Lotta's simple bragging.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of compelling evidence?\u201d Ward questions.<br>\r\n\u201cVERY compelling,\u201d Lotta's 'Very' was emphasized so hard, her tongue flung Blake up in the air and he hit the roof her mouth! \u201cLike SUPER!\u201d Fling into the cheek. \u201cULTRA\u201d Fling into the other cheek. \u201cONE HUNDRED PERCENT!\u201d Fling fling fling FLING everywhere, \u201cCompletely undeniable evidence!\u201d Fling fling fling HOLY CRAP WATCH FOR THAT MOLAR Oh thank god! \u201cI cant wait to see what kind of B.S.  explanation the CIA or NSA has to come up with to explain what I got right here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, JUST SHOW HIM WHAT IT IS!!!\u201d Blake screamed off the top of his lungs.

Lotta's belly rumbled and groaned harshly, almost painfully! It didnt want that nasty ass stuff inside it anymore than Blake did! With the rumbles and groans came the rough earthquakes that shook the chamber about, tossing the poor little guy and whatever leftover undigested breakfast all across the organic bounce room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Lotta was clenching her stomach painfully.<br>\r\n\"Ouuuuuchh...\" she groaned in pain, \"oh god... I... I think it's working! Ward, quick! Get a wastebasket!\"<br>\r\n\"Ok. Then what?\" Ward asks.<br>\r\n\"B-Bring it over here!\"<br>\r\n\"Ok. Then what?\"<br>\r\n\"JUST DO IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Ward finally put his remaining brain cells to action, tiny little Blake was already being forced up the endless tunnel that was the esophagus with leftover chunks of pancakes, bitter coffee, and noxious barf-juice following him. No matter how many showers he'll have after this whole episode is over, he'll NEVER feel clean ever again! He'll be lucky he doesnt suffer a case of PTSD after this is all over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! URP! OH GOD! How could it possibly work so fast?!\" Lotta was retching, \"Urkkk!! Jesus... Christ... Ward where's the damn wastebasket?!\"<br>\r\n\"Got it here! Got it here! Hang on! Hang on!\" Ward finally rushed back to the room with a wastebasket in hand, \"Ok, let 'er rip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didnt get time to admire the creepy cavernous mouth one more time before he launched at mach speed out of Lotta's body along with the contents from her stomach being spewed out both her mouth and threw her sinuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graaacchh GRRAAAACCHH!!\" Lotta didnt just spit up her vomit. It burst out of her insides like a puke-breathing dragon! Everything that came out was wet, chunky, slimy, and unrecognizable! And poor little Blake was caught in the middle of it, drenched head to toe in pure yuck at the bottom of that wastebasket! He was relieved to be alive and out of that two-bit reporter's stomach, but he certainly wasnt happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil (and she shall appear), up in the sky he spotted the colossal coke-bottled glassed accursed reporter he was previously crammed inside gazing down at him with her bald-headed lummox of a sidekick staring down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of awkward silence (besides the faint gurgles of Lotta's gut) passed before finally the failed reporter's assistant opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 is THAT guy the compelling evidence you were talking about?\u201d he dumbly asks.<br>\r\n\u201cNo Ward. I was talking about the OTHER shrunken guy I found on the ground and accidentally swallowed,\u201d she responds sarcastically. Ward peered into the wastebasket.<br>\r\n\u201cI dont think he's out of you yet,\u201d spouted the colossal morning, \u201cwant me to get the ipecac again?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWARD\u2026 ssss...\u201d Lotta breathed heavily, counted quietly to three, and regained herself, \u201cjust\u2026 just sit over there in the corner, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk. Then what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen stare at the freaking wall. I dont care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ward went over to the corner and stared intently at the wall, leaving Blake and Lotta alone. Despite the little humorous scene between the two, Blake was in no mood to laugh. He was pretty darn pertubed. He had just been carelessly stashed away in that humongous reporter's mouth, accidentally swallowed and nearly digested in her stomach, then puked back out, drenched head to toe in foul smelling godknowswhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d Lotta attempted to break the ice, \u201chow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I wanna jump back down your throat and rip you open from the inside,\u201d Blake answered truthfully.<br>\r\nShe nervously laughed. \u201cHeheh. Sorry about that. Guess I got a little carried away, there. I mean it's not every day somebody just randomly stumbles upon a once in a lifetime miraculous discovery that could very well change US history as we know it!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI just came out of your stomach!\u201d little Blake gave zero fs, \u201cI have your predigested breakfast all over me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright. Dont panic. We'll get you cleaned up in a jiffy,\u201d Lotta assures you, \u201canyways, Mr. Summers, before we get started with the interview, there's a few things we need to go over.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can forget about it, Lotta,\u201d Blake cut her off, \u201cbecause I aint doing an interview.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? B-But you agree to do it earlier!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I never said I did,\u201d Blake had a good memory, \u201cand even if I did, I dont anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cant just cut out,\u201d Lotta tells him, \u201cthis is an investigative emergency of utmost importance! A lead to potential inhuman experimentation of innocent civilians by their own government! If we dont get the news out, more people like yourself will fall victim of this!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'd play you the world's smallest violent, but I think it's still stirring in your gut,\u201d the shrunken puke-covered boy did not care, \u201cjust let me go and I'll pretend none of this ever happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cant leave,\u201d she says, \u201cnot after what you just witnessed. You know too much. Youre a target now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake eyed that cocky giantess eerily, \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the government is!\u201d Lotta explained, \u201cyou think theyre just gonna let one of their victims wander off and run the risk of exposing their nefarious plan to the public?\u201d She shook her head, \u201cNope! They'll hunt you down and do whatever is necessary to silence you!\u201d Blake glared up at the two-bit reporter and\u2026 got to thinking. What if, and it's a BIG if, she's right? What if this whole bogus story she's spewing along with her breakfast is actually TRUE? That's\u2026 ugh\u2026 he couldnt believe he's actually considering it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, with a little help from Ward (VERY little) and a couple of my most trusted sources,\u201d Lotta offered, \u201cwe could offer you the protection and sanctuary you need until the crooked Deep State mafiosos are finally exposed and put in their place! Provided you agree to the interview, of course.\u201d<br>\r\nBlake wanted to say something\u2026 but he couldnt. He just let her keep talking.<br>\r\n\u201cAlso,\u201d she added, \u201conce this story makes the big time, I promise you a good share of the revenue for your cooperation. A big fat 20%! How's that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thinks, reluctantly considers it, weighs the pros and cons in his head, then finally makes his decision.</span></div></div>",

Her soft smile gradually turned into a disappointed frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Mr. Summers,\" Lotta said firmly, \"I'm going out of my way to get you the protection you need from those Deep State goons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was beginning to lose his cool. \"For the last time, my name isn't Mr. Summers!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.

Your story is nothing but a lousy hoax, anyway!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's words hit Lotta harder than any insult she may have ever received before. She was used to being called out for dressing differently from other students, but calling her big scoop a hoax? Not once had the reporter dealt with such a thing. Normally, Blake was the one to be pushed around, but this time, HE was the one who'd stooped low. After a momentary pause, Lotta spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you know what? Why should I believe what someone your size has to say?! This is my biggest scoop yet, and I'm sticking to it! So GET USED TO IT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWitnessing Lotta fill with rage, Blake's own anger quickly turned into fear. \"I-I'm sorry, Lotta! I didn't mean to -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lotta felt awful concerned that she was feeling a gentle cooling sensation in her stomach. That's completely opposite of what she SHOULD be feeling after swallowing ipecac! In fact, it's concerned that she's not so much as dry-heaving at this point! Combined with  that the rather minty chalky taste she was still tasting on her tongue and it all added up to one thing: Ward is a fucking idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, TWO things! Ward gave her the wrong drink AND he's a fucking idiot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe veteran rookie fake-news enthusiast kept her cool facade going. She let her face go blank, nearly emotionless, she took a deep breath, took off her coke-bottle glasses and rubbed her eyes a bit, then turned her attention to her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ward... are you absolutely sure what you gave me was ipecac?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh.... yeah?\" Ward answered in the form of a question. That casts doubt in his alibi.<br>\r\n\"Are you absolutely 100% without a reasonable sure, as God as your witness?\"'<br>\r\n\"I.....um.... think....?\" and he's even more unsure, \".....either that.... or it could be dad's old bottle of Mylanta-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*TINK!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat loud tink meant Lotta chucked the bottle in his face! Even Blake from deep down inside Lotta's minty milk pool-filled belly could hear that bottle bounce off his thick skull! Of course it wasnt surprising that he was feeling Lotta's body shiver with anger what with the tremendous earthquake going on within the chamber that was causing massive Mylanta tidal waves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU. FUCKING. <b>IDIOT!!!!</b>\" Blake not only heard his swallower's echoing roar, he felt it amplify all around, still tossing him back and forth in the uneasy Mylanta Ocean! \"Are you not already aware that your horrendous screwup is putting my potential interviewee's life in jeopardy?!\"<br>\r\n\"Er.... no?\" Blake could even hear Ward's slightly nervous response in the distance. On the plus side, the digestive acids that wouldve no doubt melted down his body into nutra-paste by now have completely calmed . No bubbling, no outrageous heat, just mellow sticky fluid now drenched in antacid.<br>\r\nGranted, it's still not a very pleasant experience for him. Now he's soiled head to toe in chalky white stuff and the chamber reeks of rotten food and altoids! But he had to admit, he just dodged a much MUCH worse situation. Also, he accidentally swallowed some of the antacid which is actually helping ease his upset stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly!! How do you manage to screw this up?!\" he overheard Lotta continuing to vent at her side-kick, \"It almost seems as if youre TRYING to sabotage my story! Almost as if\u2026 you could be a mole!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI aint no mole, Lotta! I swear!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah youre right\u2026 nobody would wanna hire a mole THAT dumb!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh, get off his back, girly!\u201d Blake could mutter to himself, feeling a little bad for Lotta's mistreated lackie. Despite having it far far FAR worse than the big balding dumdum outside the chamber of muck(raker), he couldnt help but share some sympathy for the big lug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem\u2026 Uh\u2026 Blake? Are you still there?\u201d no time for that now. He just heard his ginormous chamber owner call out to him, \u201cif youre still alright, PLEASE give me a sign! Anything!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I'm still alright!\u201d Blake shouts back, \u201cI think the antacids kinda saved me. Still dont enjoy being inside you, however.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am really REALLY sorry about this!!\u201d Lotta apologized, \u201cmy idiotic partner said he had ipecac for me to spit you back up but it turned out it was just Mylanta.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell to be fair, your idiotic partner wasnt the one who thought carrying me in his mouth was a good idea!\u201d Blake had to remind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Blake,\u201d he could overhear Ward thank him in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWARD!\u201d Lotta raised her voice again for a moment, but quickly gathered herself, \u201cjust stand over there, watch the camera equipment, and dont say another word!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen what?  ...OOPS! Right...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat concluded the Lotta and Ward's Duo Comedy Bit for an undisclosed period of time. In the meantime, the attention focused between the interviewer and the tiny interviewee still trapped inside the belly of the interviewer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Do not panic! This is just a very small minor setback!\u201d Lotta assured Blake, \u201cI'll figure another way to get you out of there safe and sound! Then we'll get you washed up and prepared for our interview that'll uncover the biggest governmental coverup since Pizzagate!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cPizzawhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStory for another time!\u201d the colossal reporter changes the subject, \u201canyways, since Ward's clearly no help, I guess it all comes down to me getting you out of there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d Blake bites, \u201cwhat's your plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026..Well\u2026.\u201d Lotta thinks, \u201cwe're kinda short on PROPER medicine. And I'd rather not swallow something rotten and risk making myself sick for real. Hmm\u2026 do you think you can climb out by yourself?\u201d And WARD is the stupid one?! Blake cant even see the tight opening up in the ceiling he was expelled through, let along can he climb the squishy gummy and definitely unclean walls to reach it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d was his polite answer. \u201cit's way to high. And climbing is out of the question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, what if I were to stand on my head?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHUH?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say it's too high, right?\u201d Lotta explains, \u201cso if my stomach were just upside-down, obviously you'd reach the opening to the esophagus because it'd be BELOW you instead of ABOVE you! So alls I gotta do is stand on my head, let gravity take it's course, and you just squirm out of my throat and bingo! Youre out of me! ...Sheesh, it seems so easy, how come WARD couldntve thought of that idea?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it seems pretty easy. But something told Blake it aint. You know, what with the muscles in the esophagus moving food downwards and stuff\u2026 but it could be worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 I dont know...\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2026 kinda dont want you coming out of me the OTHER way,\u201d she says with obvious embarrassment on her face, \u201cand I'm pretty sure you dont either\u2026. you get what I'm saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaying what? You talking about pooping him out?\u201d asks the tactful Ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DID I JUST TELL YOU ABOUT SAYING ANOTHER WORD?!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDONT say another word? ...Oh, right. Sorry\u2026. uh, do THOSE count?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without Ward's interference, Blake certainly understood what  she was saying. Though to be fair, the thought of exploring the human body did kinda interest him. It's like that one episode in the Magic Schoolbus, only the trip WOULD be finished! Sure, he'd be getting pretty dirty, but he's kinda already dirty! He's already covered in stomach muck, expired stomach acid, and antacid milk. How much more filthy could he get!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr heck! Why dont we wait on getting you out and just do the interview now?!\u201d Lotta spoke up, breaking his train of though.<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Now?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I mean, I'm sure I could write up a good backstory to cover the incident!\u201d she insists, \u201con your search for help, you accidentally slipped and landed in my bowl of cereal through no fault of mine and it wasnt until I heard your tiny squirming for help inside me that I conveniently discovered a victim of a huge governmental experiment I was investigating for so long! See? It writes by itself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was not amused by that idea. It also sounded pretty dang surreal to be true even if he WASNT the particular victim she was talking about! <br>\r\n\u201cI'm not sure that's a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?! It's a perfect idea!\u201d Lotta disagreed, \u201cbut ok\u2026 as a proper apology for my assistant's foolish behavior, I'll let YOU choose what we're going to do.\u201d Oh how fucking generous! And WARD's foolish behavior? \u201cPersonally, my professional opinion is to just get the interview over with now while I still have a great idea in my head, but it's up to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her, Blake. What's your choice?</span></div></div>",

Or rather, dangled our poor little protagonist's tiny body over her behind! Blake didnt get much chance to admire how round and shapely Lotta's backside was mainly because he was staring nervously at what was waiting for him down below in her back pockets! A lot of pencils and pens sticking out of those back pockets! Conveniently with their potentially jagged pointy ends facing upwards like pikes ready to impale the poor little shrunken boy and display him as a warning to any evil government agents plotting to invade Lotta's impenetrable posterior of justice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cringed with fear of such a terrible thought, then looked up at the colossal news reporter who was looking back with a nervous blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry,\" she apologize, \"I think that's the only place that still has room for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-w-well, in any other circumstance, I definitely wouldnt be complaining,\" Blake had the audacity to stutter like the closet perv he was, \"b-but I-I dont think this is a good idea! I mean I'm not saying I dont like it. It really is nice to look at! But... But at the same time, it doesnt look safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look it'll only be until we get back home,\" she assured him, \"I promise I'll be very careful if I have to sit down... now relax and hang tight!\"<br>\r\n\"No wai-OOPHH!!\" Lotta rudely crammed little Blake deep in her back pocket riddled with pencils and little eraser heads! His tiny body was shaken around as he was shuffled somewhere in the tiny pile of eraser heads. On the plus side, Lotta was careful not to prick him on any of her pencils. On the minus side, it was dark, humid and uncomfortable what him Blake being pressed against a firm and squishy wall! Even at his size it was pretty cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to move around too much or make much noise in there,\" Lotta held her pocket open with a finger to warn just before snapping it shut, \"p-please dont tell anybody I put you in there. ...And if you say ANYTHING about it smelling, youre gonna wish I hid you in the OTHER place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lotta? Why are you talking to your ass?\" Blake overheard Ward overhear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ERRPP!!\" Lotta flinched and cringed, causing the tight space Blake was trapped in to squeeze up incredibly tight against the firm and squishy wall! \"N-Nevermind that! Why are you still here? I told you to go on without me!\"<br>\r\n\"I kinda forgot the way back to your place,\" Ward shamelessly admits, \"and my phone died so I cant use GPS.\"<br>\r\nLotta sighs and relaxes her body, which in turn relaxes her glutes, which in turn relaxes the damp uncomfortable chamber in the back pocket Blake was in! \"Alright, c'mon.\" And she walks with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks with a rhythmic sway in her hips, the back pockets rocks back and forth to the tune of her sway, shifting the items inside rapidly with the pace. It wasnt long before Blake got sick of being knocked back and forth between pencils, erasers, and the pant-wall just in front of her ass! It wasnt a pleasant ride by a long shot. Erasers kept moving around, burying him in the pile until the sway sent him smacked against the pant-wall and back again. Lotta and Ward had a conversation to pass the time, but because Lotta wouldnt stop walking (or at the very least stop swaying her backside like she did!), Blake couldnt overhear it what with the sounds of rustling pencils and erasers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also pretty humid. The heat Lotta's butt was giving off was seeping into her back pockets, warming up her tiny passenger like a hot sauna! And Blake kinda had a bit of a sweating problem when it came to hot temperatures. Mix harsh sweat with strong smelling eraser material and well... it's not a pleasant smell. Whether Blake even wanted to help the gigantic reporter in the first place didnt matter at this point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hell with this!\" he muttered as he climbed out of the eraser pile and attempted to climb up one of the longest pencils in there. It wasnt an easy climb, cuz the pencil shifted side to side every once in a while cuz of Lotta's walking. Still, he continued his trek up until he finally felt the cool fresh air of the outside world hit his face again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad the brief relief lasted no more than a second before he saw how high above the ground he currently was! As soon as he looked down, he silently gasped in horror and almost lost his grip! He quickly turned his head to alleviate his fear of heights and focus only on the sight on the gigantic reporter he was behind and her enormous ass in jeans in which he was currently in the back pocket of, and the tantalizing rhythmic side-to-side sway that her jean-clad ass was moving that was rocking him back in front in the back pocket!<br>\r\nThe perverse arrousal did a good job taking his mind off his fear, but it didnt make him any safer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, stop worrying!\" Blake overheard Lotta shout to her cueball companion, \"We wont get expelled for this. My research is 110% legit!\"<br>\r\n\"But I dont think it's possible to be more than 100% legit,\" Ward complained, \"also, dad said that if I get kicked out of school he'd send me to join the Marines.\"<br>\r\n\"And did you ask him what kind of dad would leave his kid's fate in the hands of the Military Industrial Complex?\" Lotta remarked.<br>\r\n\"Uh... no... I figured this whole report is uh... complex enough.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I swear on my honor as a proper journalist you dont need to worry about any of that,\" she assures him, \"I've already acquired proper evidence to nail the Deep State mafiosos for good!\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I cant tell you right now.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n\"Cuz out here, the agents could be listening in our conversation as we speak!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh.... ok... do you think any of them heard the conversation with your ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Blake, overhearing said conversation from said ass, was making the most cringiest face he possibly could. Was this girl for real? He was heavily beginning to doubt this conspiracy theorist whacko. What was he thinking actually believing for a second that all that bullshit about government agents disguising as gypsies to experiment on people and disguising it as magic?! At this point, MAGIC made more sense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point, he picked the absolute 110% (SHUT UP, WARD!) wrong choice to come to THIS girl for help! He'd be better off leaping out of her back pocket and find someone else's curvy jean-clad ass to swing from!<br>\r\nHowever, that was easier said than done. It was an awful long way down and Lotta seemed in no mood to stop walking until she reached her destination! The risk of going splat seemed to heavily outweigh whatever Lotta and her bumbling camera guy had in store for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Blake has no clue whatsoever the conspiracy nutjob has in store for him! What if when she interviews him, he doesnt tell her what she really wants to hear and gets suspicious or even suspects HIM of being an undercover 'Deep State mafioso'?!<br>\r\nMaybe the climb down wont be so bad. And she most likely wont notice he's out of her pocket what with damn near everything else in there she's feeling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took one hard look down at the several dozen foot drop, then took one hard look at the back of the news anchor, then one hard look at the swaying behind in tight jeans he was currently riding.... then made his decision.</span></div></div>",

Better than being completely lost, right? The tiny mage endured the whole cramped ride to Lotta's place, even as pencils and erasers poked at him (thankfully non-lethally). It didn't take too long for Lotta and Ward to arrive at her pleasant-looking middle-class house. Not one car was parked in the driveway, so Blake figured that the reporter's family were at work...or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta fetched her house key from her other jean pocket, opening the door for herself and her assistant to enter the living room before swiftly closing the door behind them. Closing the blinds to conceal the group from any suspicious eyes, the fake news anchor reached into her back pocket for her little bit of evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake briefly flinched as Lotta's lithe yet enormous hand reached into his prison, but the shrunken young man quickly realized that his captor was his only salvation for the time being. Steeling himself to be revealed, Blake allowed the towering woman to scoop his puny form out of her pocket and into the open, Ward's eyes widening as Lotta displayed the tiny, live evidence atop her palm. Said evidence waved meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" was all Ward could manage to utter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those Deep State goons are TOAST!\" Lotta smiled. \"Now, let's get this interview started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" Blake chimed in. \"This is all happening so fast!\" Interviews always did frighten the poor guy. \"C-can I have a minute to practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta pondered momentarily, wondering if she should allow her tiny subject to rehearse before his big moment. On one hand, a well-practiced interview would boost Daily Dirty Laundry's ratings...but on the other, what if those Deep State mooks are in New Opal already, snuffing out all who dare to expose their plans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a decision, the reporter spoke at last.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortunately for Blake's sake, Lotta considered that giving her special guest interviewee some time to practice was more beneficial than forcing him to get the interview over with as soon as possible. In actual professional interviews, the special guest being interviewed is given time to look over the questions he/she is about to be asked and for quality sake, retakes and editing in post-production was a must. If she wanted this big scoop to be just that, she needed to ensure quality, otherwise no one would tune in and all this nasty business would be swept under the rug and the Deep State would win. Like it ALWAYS does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, perhaps she could use some extra time double-checking that the room is absolutely 110% leak-free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, go ahead,\" Lotta answered Blake's request, \"We're in the clear right now... might as well spend a little extra time making sure we stay that way.\" With that, she rustles through her pockets, rummaging for something. She sticks her hand in one pocket... then another... then a back pocket... \"Ow!\" then nearly pricks her hand on one of the pencils that almost impaled you... then she checks under her shirt... \"Here!\" and finally pulls out a stack of note cards from her bra! Little Blake blushed, hoping she didnt notice him staring a little too hard, but since she pretty much gave him an up close experience with her ass, what difference does it make?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the questions I'm gonna ask,\" Lotta placed a few of her note cards on the table, \"use the time you have to study them. But dont study TOO hard... I might not use some of the questions. Heck, I might think of one or two last minute, so be prepared for that, ok?\"<br>\r\nHe eyed one of the huge note cards uneasily, \"O...ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While youre doing that, Ward and I will be leak-proofing the room,\" she insists, \"Ward, go get the aluminum foil!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? What for?\"<br>\r\n\"I need you to foil all the windows.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... why?\"<br>\r\n\"So their waves can seep in!\"<br>\r\n\"Waves? What waves?\"<br>\r\n\"The radio frequency waves! How else do you think theyre able to spy on us?!\"<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026 maybe\u2026 hidden\u2026 cameras?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c...Hm. We should probably check for those too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta rushed over to her comrade in arms and a long frustrating explanation regarding secret agents and radio frequency that quickly made Ward looking almost as uneasy as Blake did.<br>\r\nAs for Blake, he was still contemplating sneaking out of the house and trying to find someone else to help him out. This was not gonna be a fun experience for him. As if the journey to the house of this two-bit conspiracy theorist posing as a reporter wasnt awful enough (Blake took hate-filled glances at Lotta's backside while she drilled her associate, loathing the time he spent being smacked against it deep within her jean pocket, remembering with dread the repeated agony it gave him with each sensuous sway back and forth, being brutally pummeled from inside the confines of her backside that swung so rhythmically eye-catching to any onlooker from outside... ok, seriously Blake! Seek help!) but to be subjected to such mind-numbing drivel written on the huge note card is something else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the text was a little hard to read what with Lotta's fancy cursive trying to look too much elegant and not enough LEGIBLE... but the stuff Blake could read left a nasty feeling in the pit of his stomach. A whole lot of questions he not only not knew the answers to, but questions he had a feeling he shouldnt be taking the time answering.<br>\r\nUndiscovered types of experiments and torture methods that the government is allegedly involved in. <br>\r\nNames of people in high ranks of the government who would no doubt sue Blake and his family for libel after hearing the allegations asked.<br>\r\nA damning allegation stating that the mayor knows of the disappearances but is blackmailed into silence because an agent caught wind of his affair with a high school student!<br>\r\nSomething about the Sword of Jerusalem and Rods from God but you couldnt make out much from the fancy cursive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Charlotte Heart?!!\" Blake managed to read out a very familiar name in the middle of the fancy cursive gobbledygook, \"how does she know my grandma's name?! ...What does grandma have to do with all this?!\" Alright, THIS was getting a bit too personal! Poor little Blake had no idea how this conspiracy nut would know anything about his family or how much she knows about them and at this point, he'd rather NOT know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Blake needed any more conclusive reason not to go through with this stupid interview, he'd be brain-damaged! The only thing remotely close to convince him to go through with it at this point would be to compensate him with another free ride in Lotta's back pocket but WITHOUT all the pencils and pens crammed in there first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd knowing such a tempting offer will most likely not be offered, he's pretty much already looking around for a quick escape. The front door is locked tight (not like he could open it himself) and it didnt look like he could squeeze through the crack underneath. Maybe there's an alternate way out down the hallway not too far away. Hopefully he'd at least have plenty of hiding spaces until he can find a way out. The coffee table he was standing on wasnt too high and the soft carpet is sure to cushion his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath and giving that voice in his head a nod, Blake...</span></div></div>",

She'd made no sound as she swooped him up. The bookshelves just swooshed past his gaze as she pulled him up. Even with her eyes shaded by the mask, he felt as if her gaze was piercing through him. How did she track him down here, behind <i>this</i> book, in <i>this</i> library? Why was nobody else around? And how was her grip too firm for even his specter-enhanced strength to escape? He screamed out, but found his mouth covered by the gloved thumb. Soon, the delicate phalanges tightened around him. They squeezed his tiny limbs on every side, and snuffed out all the library's warm lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShysie Tactica was curling her fingers into a fist, trying to squeeze her target to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miniature mage resisted, all four limbs forcing back. He found each end sinking into the white, leather-clad expanse of her hand. Blood pulsed through his miniature veins, each working against the compression. Ever twitch of her titanic wrist or immense fingers, even the pinky, dug deep into his bones. His mind flashed back to biology classes, where he learned how intricate human hands could be with their movements. And by the way the digits flexed here, each dainty thing making precise movements to hit his weakest spots, he could tell that his captor was trained in using them for intricate spells and rituals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense fist uncurled. Blake was still in one piece. Panting desperately, sweating like a pig, but completely intact. Far from the red speck that she expected to see upon opening her hand. In fact, from the widened eyes, he looked even more surprised at his survival than her. Shysie's lip remained a flat line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glasses-clad mage called out: \"P-please... You don't know what you're doing!... This isn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, her fingers curled. Blake felt his torso pressed harshly into the tip of her middle finger, while her ring finger held his legs in place. Together, they pinned his back into her palm. His teeth gritted. The apprentice's thumb sunk onto his head, ruffling his dark hair into the material. It pushed deeper on him. Then pulled off, and pressed on. The twitch from her thumb bore all the emotion and ceremony of someone clicking the button on a retractable pen. Squeezing down, she twisted his head in a circle, the unbreakable hold on his chest still compressing his breaths. Like a weight on his lungs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShysie had moved to a new disposal tactic: trying to snap Blake's tiny head off his neck. He saw the library's distant ceiling lighting fly by his specs, followed by the carpeted floor, the books, and the dark robes. Her digit's spirals became larger, faster - but still carefully controlled and timed. The miniature captive felt as if something would crack any second; but each time it came close, something held it back. Something kept his body in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, he realized, the curse from the ghosts. Their spell gave him flexibility and firmness that spared him from a quick, snappy death. His neck would stay on. But Raven's student wasn't relenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library door swung open. She paused. Her whole body turned to face them, hood not even folding slightly. A crowd of students bustled in. Probably people looking to study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShysie's whisper was still barely audible: \"Shade.\" She opened her palm, and threw her arm to the ceiling. Blake flew out of the glove, along with a murky ball of mist. The woman before him then slammed her hand down, as if smashing an invisible table before her. He barely dodged her fingers. The swirling magic above spread out over them like a curtain unfolding as he fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the carpet permitted Blake a soft landing. When he looked up, the mist had shifted to magic runes surrounding the two in a dome. He could see the incoming people at normal size spreading around; a mix of familiar faces and feet, parts of his natural background, all towering above him. The boy screamed out. Nobody heard, or even looked towards them. The Shade spell hid both Shysie and Blake from prying eyes and ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and broke into a sprint forward, only to be met with crushing pressure on his back. Even her stomps were silent; she used only her boot's toe section to squeeze down on him. All the wind exited his lungs in a single puff, pushing him against the floor. He made a valiant attempt to crawl away, which was thwarted as his hunter pulled her leg back. It brushed his face against the carpet fibers, tickling him The muscles in her towering, slender legs, kept pushing the witch's entire weight on him. Back and forth, the stockings swayed, heeled boot below manipulating the smaller magician with the greatest of ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air, the miniaturized teen had it all pushed out with every tap, jab, push, and tilt of her ankle. Nobody could even see them - some people were gathering around bookshelves, walking right by, or staring right at them without spotting the cloaked girl and the tortuous motions. It became a rhythm, the black heel grinding him into the ground. Soon, he got a feel for the painful, precise tempo. Taking advantage of a pause in Shysie's twists, he took a shallow breath and screamed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Quake\" spell wasn't one he had much practice with. Casting it made books drop from shelves and knocked everyone nearby on their backsides, even at low levels; not things that helped him hide his identity very well. But as long as he was in Shysie's veil from the \"Shade\" spell, nobody would be affected but the black-hooded titan herself. And she took the full blow of it; having only one heeled boot to balance on, it knocked her right off her feet. Her bosom hurdled down towards Blake, catching it in her shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a hard gasp, and dashed forward. Noticing a shadow before him, he made a sharp turn - just as his opponent's hand hit the carpet, breaking her fall. It was so close that he only just squeezed between her gloved fingers, shaken up by their impact against the ground. They would have squashed him again had he not made the sidestep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other hand loomed above, ready to grab. No time to wait. Blake's little feet hit the ground. His arms pumped. He cast a gale spell, dodging her snatching palm - and flying in the air. Right next to her face, keeping its neutral expression. He just had to position his fall right, to escape the cone, get help from one of the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped. Right in midair. Gravity had no control over his body. His arm muscles, which were just repositioning themselves, felt as if they were paddling through molasses - then concrete. He froze completely, unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one glove off. Her bare finger brushed across him slowly, feeling cold to the touch. It lifted goosebumps across the back of Blake's neck. The prodding mass kept pressing at different spots, as if teasing him. And there was nothing he could do but hold his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShysie finally spoke. \"A protection spell.\" Her hands flew out in a  series of complex motions, tracing pentagrams across the little boy. \"Shatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA magic arrow with inscriptions in a foreign language pierced him. He felt nothing. She squeezed the boy again, testing his strength. The bare fingers made him shiver again, his mind shouting out telepathic messages to try and reach anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few words from his captor: \"No changes. Too strong.\" She sounded about as fascinated and alarmed as someone discovering that the price of cafeteria lunches just increased by five cents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stronger wind pulled him in from behind. Shysie was sucking in, pulling the boy closer to her mouth. The gaping mouth came closer and closer, about to snatch him from the skies. He squirmed harder, almost feeling one finger getting less numb. Her teeth glowed gently in the library's light. His neck and eyes failed to move much, forcing him to see every detail of the mouth. Clean, empty, the tongue resting carefully between teeth. If only he could move. Darkness came over him... A single jaw muscle budged. Just a bit more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake mentally shouted: \"Beam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands, still frozen, couldn't aim the light that emerged from them. It flew at her mask. The ray had enough strength to tip the dark mass off her face. Shysie's facial covering pushed him down, knocking him from out of the air, sending him crashing to the ground. And it covered him completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a soft moan. His arms regained feeling.They could grab the carpet fibers. That surprise attack must have broken the spell! He looked above to see the mask as a ceiling, fitted perfectly to cover Shysie's face. Through the eye hole, he glimpsed his captor covering her face with one cloaked arm. The other grabbed below for her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look. Don't look, please.\" She was still whispering, but now - there was a shiver in the way her breath released itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran out, trying to escape the Shade cone once again. Her hands crossed the floor haphazardly, in an unpredictable pattern. As it crashed down, one finger tapped Blake's face, knocking his glasses clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarn it. He couldn't lose those. He felt around on the ground for them, almost thankful for the cone hiding them. None of the people studying would be able to see the mages each fiddling around on the ground for their eyewear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake found his first - not having such bad vision. But as for Shysie... Her movements were much quicker. She knocked down some books, pounded the ground again and again, and pulled the hood further on her face. \"My mask... My mask...\" It was obvious she was having trouble expressing herself. \"Raven... Raven...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized that his legs weren't moving. He'd been gawking over her cloak twirling and twisting. Seeing her so desperate was odd. Then again, the whole situation was strange, having just faced death and came out unbreakable. Still, he had no idea what other spells she could try; so he ran for help.</span></div></div>",

Needless to say, the tiny mage turned and made a run for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Blake crashed into something that immediately halted his escape. An invisible barrier. Crystal had erected magic walls to trap the shrunken teenage boy in her possession. He pushed and pushed, but was unable to thwart the transparent barrier.

Blake tried to struggle with all his might, but aside from the most minute of muscle twitches, couldn\u2019t budge Gemma\u2019s abs an inch. A grin spread across the girl\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no use trying to escape. You\u2019re merged with me now. You\u2019re just a part of me.\u201d Blake felt Gemma press her hand against what was now effectively his face, and begin rubbing it in a circle. Blake begged to differ. He could always use magic to free himself, right? It might take a little to gather it up, but he was sure he\u2019d read a spell to escape his current situation! But before he could think too much about it, he heard Gemma start to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re thinking about using magic\u2026 You\u2019d better do it quickly. I\u2019m not an ordinary girl after all. Mom taught me a few tricks. You see\u2026.\u201d Gemma paused. \u201cHmm\u2026 Should you even have a name anymore? Nah. You\u2019re just my abs.\u201d She told him, with a grin. \u201cBut\u2026 now that you\u2019re part of me, I can absorb your magic. It\u2019ll take me a little while\u2026 about as long as it will take to finish digesting what\u2019s left of you. But once I do that, you won\u2019t be able to tap into your magic anymore. No escape. You\u2019ll be a conscious part of my belly forever~ And making me even stronger. So\u2026. Thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Gemma pulled the top of her dress down in front of Blake\u2019s view, hiding him from the world again. He felt her beginning to walk off again, with a skip in her step. So this\u2026 this was the fate that had befallen many of Raven\u2019s other rivals? Turned not just into nutrition but into a sentient power boost for her daughter? Blake knew he didn\u2019t have long to figure out the counterspell if what Gemma had told him was true.

A hard task that grew harder when he felt Gemma begin to move. With every step she took, she shook her hips from side-to-side in a clearly exaggerated manner. He could feel the movement\u2019s vibrate up into her belly \u2013 and by extension, into him, it\u2019s inhabitant \u2013  and silently he cursed himself at how good they felt coursing through him. He needed to remember the spell <i>fast</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide smile on her face, Gemma ceased her hip-shaking steps when she reached her bed. Squatting down, in the process squishing her belly, she reached beneath the furniture and pulled out a large bag of jellybeans from the darkness underneath. She couldn\u2019t help but smile smugly at the sight. Her mother had been trying so hard to ween her off them that she destroyed all Gemma\u2019s stashes hidden around her room\u2026 <i>except</i> for the one in the most obvious place of all. She chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer snack now secured, Gemma crawled onto the bed and got herself comfortable, laying on her back with her head on her favorite pillow. Her finger floated down and slowly shifted her dress out of the way, giving her a nice view of her now free tummy. She dangled her bag of sweets above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like sweets, don\u2019t you?\u201d Gemma asked, before answering for her prisoner. \u201cOf course you do. You\u2019re part of me now; I like sweets, so you must like sweets!\u201d With gusto, she opened the bag and immediately shoved a handful into her mouth. A part of her wanted to take it slow, to torment her prisoner more, but damn, she just <i>loved</i> jellybeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, Blake heard a splash as the first clump of jellies fell out of Gemma\u2019s throat and into her stomach. At first, he dismissed it, choosing to focus back on the more pressing matter of escape. But then came another splash. And then another. Then another. Gulp. Splash. Gulp. Splash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her stomach <i>rumbled</i>. Responding to the food dripping in, it came to life with gurgling roar as it began to pump digestive juices into the organic sack. With those juices came movement. The awoken beast behind him flexed over and over, intent to marinate and compress the jellybeans down into an absorb-able slurry for her intestines. Blake was rocked violently with every pump. Bounced with every pulse against his will within the confines of Gemma\u2019s abs. If concentrating was hard before, now it seemed impossible. And from the blissful look of Gemma\u2019s face, she seemed to have no intention of stopping anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly, he cried out, barely hear-able over the storm in her stomach. \u201cG-Gemma\u2026 please let me out\u2026\u201d He doubted he could make her stop. But if he could stall her for a just little bit\u2026 \u201cI\u2019ll do anything\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGemma paused, sparing the jellybean that dangled over her lips for the moment, and glanced down at her belly. \u201cAnything?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Anything!\u201d Blake cried, louder than before and sounding more desperate this time. Her noisy gut was already calming down from only this slight pause. If he could get her to pause for a bit longer\u2026 \u201cI-I\u2019ll be your slave! Y-you can turn me into any sweet you w-want and eat me w-whenever you want! Or into clothes to wear! Or any part of your body! Just, please don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t absorb me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen\u2019s lips pursed in contemplation. A slave could be nice, she thought as she turned her gaze towards the ceiling. Someone to boss around, have her way with, to do her homework for her\u2026 It was definitely a tempting idea. But her eyes fell onto the jellybean still dangling above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Nah.\u201d Was Gemma\u2019s response. She let the lonely jelly fall into her mouth and swished it around, preparing it to join it\u2019s friends below. \u201cA cute slave would be nice and all, but getting rid of you will make Mom <i>reeeally</i> happy. Not to mention the magic power I\u2019ll get from breaking you down!\u201d After a quick swallow, she gave her gut a few soft, almost-comforting pats. \u201cSo I\u2019m gonna keep you in there til you\u2019re gone, okay? But don\u2019t worry, cutie; I promise I\u2019ll make your last days <i>very</i> enjoyable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer prisoner was silent. Gemma rubbed him in a reassuring manner, then helped herself to more of her sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gemma was wrong in thinking Blake had fallen silent in defeat. He had known from the beginning that such a request was doomed to failure. Blake was silent from his own success: the few seconds of calm from Gemma\u2019s thundering gut had given him enough time to remember! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Blake let the incantation spill forth. \u201c__________!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with it\u2026</span></div></div>",

I didn't hear you\" Citrine blushes and tries to think of another excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I said... I can't take you out in school... t-too many people could notice.\" Which, did make sense to the tiny mage. The last thing he'd want would be to reveal to the school that he was shrunk... and... swallowed by Citrine. He figured it would be in both their interests if she waited. He didn't have to like it but <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright but... please don't take too long. I don't wanna be digested...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I understand\" Citrine responded happily, eager to keep the tiny boy inside her for as long as she could. And so Blake waited... and waited... and ... waited. Until the last class started. Since then he had grown quite impatient, with only the grumbles of the belly around him and the digested leftovers of lunch to keep him company the tiny mage grew bored and wanted out. So he called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citrine! I'm ready to come out now....\" Blake waited a few moments... but received no response. \"Citrine?...\" he waited again and hoped even more for a response. Nothing. He sighed and started to press into her gigantic belly walls. The fleshy muscular walls offering some give before pushing back.  It seemed like the giantess wasn't going to let him out so soon. Blake sighs and thinks of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Citrine hears Blake call out from inside her. She basically looks around and tries to see if anyone heard. Once she finds that no one heard her, she feels him press into her and lets a soft breath escape her lips and bites them. She giggles and rubs and softly pats her tummy underneath her shirt. She looks around to see if anyone had noticed her and smiles once she observes that she was not caught. She enjoyed this, she thought to herself. She enjoyed this and could see herself enjoying this for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Blake is pushed back from the inside of her belly he hears soft rubbing outside his prison. Soon followed by loud thunderous pats that echoed about her cavernous belly. Blake blushes at the simple display of dominance his classmate was showing, absolutely stunned this was all happening.  He had to get out of here. Or more specifically, out of her. Blake gazes out onto the landscape that is Citrine's belly and ponders what he could do to escape. He thinks and he thinks and concludes that the best, and cleanest, way out of Citrine is to go back up her throat. Blake grips and feels around the giant stomach and finds he is able to find dry purchase along the stomach lining and uses his skills to climb up the near verticle walls of Citrine's stomach. The walls are firm yet squishy and easily tickled the titaness. Blake found it quite easy to scale the inside of Citrines' tummy and made it to her esophageal sphincter and due to his tickling it allowed it to flex open from time to time. Blake timed it and leaped into it and braced himself inside, pushing his feet and back against her throat as he slowly made his way back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitrine felt all of this blushing deeply when she felt Blake grab and climb inside her belly, enjoying it greatly but started to get concerned when he neared the bottom of her throat. She could actually then feel him climbing back up. Her eyes widened a little and she glanced around, blushing and holding back a moan as she felt Blake make his way up her long throat during class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had made it to the flap that prevented food from entering her lungs and thought for a second. He realized he probably couldn't just push it open but then came up with another idea! He winced and apologized under his breath and kicked the back of Citrine's throat, causing her to blush and cough, she tried to keep it down only turning a few heads. She coughed and managed to spit Blake back up into her mouth. Citrine was impressed but still knew she couldn't let her friend out now. Especially since she just cough and brought even more attention to herself. She blushes softer this time as she moves Blake back to the center of her tongue and pins him to the roof of her mouth. Blake grunts as he is pushed against her palate and as her large tongue lathers him in spit as she softly moans at his flavor. Blake blushes at this lewd show of dominance as she rolls Blake around the entirety of her mouth, enjoying him like a sweet candy. A few minutes of him being tossed around and treated like food Citrine easily maneuvers the tiny mage to the back of her throat with a pool of spit and swallows it down. Citrine moans in pleasure and smiles as she gets to feel Blake squirm all the way back down into her happy belly. She giggles softly and rubs her belly again, paying attention to the last part of the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake yells out as he is dragged back down into the warm confines of Citrine's massive body. He blushes and spits out the invading spit forcing its way into his own mouth. The return journey is quick as he slides down the side of Citrine's belly once more and is swept into a pool of her belly's juices. Blake groans as he ends up back where he started and sighs, not knowing quite what to do. He lays in the pool of stomach acid as the class ends and as he tries to come up with another way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitrine stands and retrieves her belongings placing a  hand on her stomach as she rubs it and leaves the school, starting her walk back home.

It would most likely be some time before Citrine started to head home, Blake didn't even know what time of day it was and when class would end, so he sighed and decided it would be best if he took a nap to pass the time, as there wasn't much else he could do. Blake shuts his eyes and wiggles a little before finally falling asleep and having dreams of Aria...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opens his eyes and sees he's in a wide expanse of white, nothing to the left nothing to the right... then loud thunderous booms shake the ground under him as he is jostled and falls onto his rear. Blake nervously and quickly looks behind him to see Aria! Blake smiles and tries to call out to her but find he can't, no voice comes out... Aria keeps walking, closer and closer, her shoes hitting the floor as she walks on unaware of the tiny crush under her on the floor. Blake presses backward trying to avoid the giantess but to no avail. Aria's sole lifts high above him and all Blake can do is let out a terrified scream! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH\" Blake yells himself awake. He quickly looks around and observes his surrounding... still dark.. and now.. darker. Still in the backpack.. so that means still small. A spooky and terrifying thought for the young mage. \"ugh... I n-need to find a way to Aria.. and fast!' Blake looks at the opening of the pocket and sees the light is significantly darker than earilier. Blake climbs his way out and looks around and sees he is in the dark room that he would assume to be Citrine's. The room is dark and dim from the night outside and from the lights that are turned off as well. Blake looks around and sees; a bed, desk and door, as well as the posters on the walls, the details too small and too dark to make out what they are for the tiny mage. Blake sighs as he climbs out and sees that...</span></div></div>",

Blake sees her sheets touching the floor allowing him a path to her bed to get her attention. Almost everything inside Blake is telling him to wait till morning but with dreams like those, he decides that he just wants it to be over and ventures to climb and get the attention of the sleeping titaness. Blake climbs up and stares in slight awe of the teenager before him. She was massive. Not in a mean or derogatory way but\u2026 she seemed so surreal. Her massive frame to the soft pillow-like pudge that leaked from above her night skirt. he finds himself blushing at the sight of her panties as well deep into her skirt as she sleeps unaware of the little voyeur. He keeps going finding his heart beating faster as he nears her giant belly. Her warm body radiating massive amounts of heat as he walks close. He goes up to her belly and for some reason he can\u2019t explain he feels compelled to reach out and touch it. He lays his minuscule hands on the flesh and it feels incredibly warm. Blake leans into her and literally sinks into her soft plush flesh about a good half foot in. It is ultimately summed up in the word squishy. he lays on her and even nuzzles her  before he hears deep within her a deep grumble followed by a soft burp escaping her lips in the distance. The fact that he could hear that from the inside was kind of interesting to him. Blake once more pushes into the soft flesh before he hears a moan in the same direction and sees Citrine in slight discomfort or.. Is it pleasure. The darkness is definitely not helping discern which. Blake takes a step back and realizes this may not be the BEST way. Is it a way, yes but not the best. BLake decides to think on which would be best. Going to her face, rubbing her belly some more or even going to her feet in case she rolls over or gets up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake looks up to the long path of Citrine's plush sleeping form. Very dangerous, as he's not so sure of what could happen. She could roll over. She could pin him down and suffocate her in her-... plushness. She could wake up and leave, leaving Blake stuck on her bed. When he got back home he was going to have a firm talking to with those spirits. This was all too intense for Blake. Blake looks down the other end of the bed and sees Citrine's bare feet. A small blush comes across the mage's face but he isn't sure why. He sighs and thinks of what could happen. She could pin him under her foot while she slept... but.. he could just wiggle out, It seems much easier than her massive belly. Blake tries to think of anything bad that could also happen if he ventured near her feet. He couldn't come up with anything else and it seemed like a fairly good spot to get her attention. With that settled the mage starts making his way towards Citrine's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake isn't quite sure why but he feels a blush upon his face while looking at citrine's feet. He felt a bit... embarrassed about something but couldn't quite pin down why he was feeling what he was feeling. Eventually, he makes it to her feet and stands near her soft pudgy ankle. Blake, tired from the walking, rests his hand on Citrine's ankle. He is surprised to find that it is softer and smoother than what he expected. Blake feels his face flush more as he feels Citrine's massive foot. He walks over to inspect her sole and sees it is broad and smooth. The small area where her arch should be is smoothed out, her toes are short and pudgy. Suddenly a scent captures Blake's nose and he blushes, surprised by the scent. The smell of feet but also of oranges, sweet citrus. Blake blushes as he takes in the sights of Citrines rather.. cute.. feet. Blake huffs a bit, unsure why he found them cute... or ..in any way attractive. He Sighs and decides to go up to feel her sole... To get her attention... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake makes his way up to Citrine's sleeping sole and presses his tiny hands into her heel. They sink in about an inch or two and cause the mage to blush. He looks up her expansive sole and wonders if the whole foot feels the same. Blake starts to press and even rub the massive heel. He presses and rubs, unsure of what exactly he was doing. Eventually, however, Citrine reacts to the stimulation and moans, moving her massive body onto her side and nuzzling into the bed, causing her soles to lay on top of one another and allow Blake full access to her sole and even her toes if he wanted. Blake is surprised by the movement and thankfully jumped back before any harm could come. His mind screams at him to get away but he finds himself walking towards her plush sole. He makes his way to the ball of Citrine's foot and presses into it again, surprised to find his hands sink in a good 6 inches deep! Her feet were really soft!! Blushing with an idea Blake presses his body into her foot and sinks into the soft warm flesh. He blushes brightly and rubs the soft foot as it feels soothing to be pressed against it. Blake sighs and enjoys the moment, happy to feel the warmth and some semblance of comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware to Blake, Citrine moans softly and flexes her toes softly, not alerting the mage yet. His rubs further stimulate the titaness and cause her to move again! This time she scoots up in the bed and rolls back onto her back and pins Blake under the ball of her foot. The swift action catches Blake off guard as the massive appendage takes him by surprise and pins him down to the soft mattress. His fear of her rolling over on top of him happened but it wasn't too bad. The bed was soft and the foot softer. Blake was stuck to the bottom of Citrine's soft plush foot and found both he and her foot were warming quite quickly. Blake freezes unsure if he should wiggle to get out or stay put in fear of her smothering him out. He figures he might as well try to get out and starts to wiggle. Not too soon after he starts Citrine moans again and starts to smother him. While not unpleasant its certainly not comfortable. She grinds him into the bed and her foot unknowingly, trying to soothe the small irritation. Blake blushes and groans trying to get out. </span></div></div>",

Go ahead and continue.\" Sapphire immediately replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his curiosity, Blake decided it was best not to intrude on his cousin's private thoughts and continued to climb, until he reached the top of the fleshy hill. He sat down and looked to his left, where he got a good view of Sapphire's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his right, he was able to see the rest of the military officer's torso and some of her waist and legs. He was even able to make out her abdominal muscles...and the scars that decorated them. \"I...didn't expect how fruitful your military training would be on your muscles.\" He said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire perked up, \"You mean my abs?\" \"Yeah.\" Her cousin said. Sapphire sighed, \"I...don't know why you like them. They have scars...and because of that...\" \"They're still beautiful, regardless of the scaring.\" The mage cut her off, knowing that his cousin was still insecure about her body, due to the scars she received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire was, needless to say, shocked by this. \"Are you...certain?\" She asked, causing Blake to nod without hesitation. \"May I feel them?\" He asked.

Especially after a recent mission.\" She said. \"I'd...rather not delve deeper into it.\" Blake nodded and continued eating with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Blake was stuffed. Sapphire had finished the fruit a bit ago and was now washing it down with the water. \"You seemed to enjoy your meal.\" The officer chuckled. Blake nodded in agreement, \"It seems you did too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his cousin's stomach rumbled again. \"Are you kidding me!?\" Sapphire shouted and groaned. \"I had two full apples. How am I still hungry!?\" The boy tapped his chin as Sapphire continued complaining. \"I think I got an idea.\" He said.</span></div></div>",

The two nodded as the boy brought more pieces and fed them to his cousin. By the fifth piece, Blake decided to change up the routine a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sapphire opened up her maw, Blake went inside and placed the bread piece on her tongue, before going back outside. Since Blake was immediately leaving her mouth, the military officer didn't seem to mind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes of this, the bread was gone. Sapphire smiled and gently patted the boy's head, \"Thank you for the offer, kiddo.\" She then drank the water, washing down any chewed up pieces that were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can I ask you something?\" The mage asked, catching Sapphire's attention. \"If you're still hungry...\" Blake took a deep breath. \"Could you please eat me?\" The reaction he got from his cousin was, quite expectedly, her choking on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coughing for a bit, she looked at her cousin. \"Are you out of your mind!?\" She shouted. \"No.\" \"Please?\" The mage asked. He was practically BEGGING for it at this point. Sapphire sighed, \"No. I will NOT risk your safety and life like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll be safe. Please, Sapphire?\" The boy begged again. The military officer panicked when her stomach let out a soft growl. It was still hungry, but all it needed was one more thing to satisfy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Blake, who didn't seem to hear her stomach rumbling. The officer bit her lip; she knew Blake promised, but would actually keep said promise without her demanding it? 'Shit. Shit. Shit! What to do? What to do!?'

She took a deep breath once the clone made it past her F-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing how Sapphire was having some issues with swallowing a clone, Blake casted a spell that would make things much easier for her. \"Will the clones enjoy being inside me?\" The elder cousin asked.

Sapphire chuckled again as she brought more clones up to her mouth, swallowing them down much easier now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, Sapphire managed to swallow every last clone, while the real Blake sat in her cleavage, having the time of his life.

The elder cousin nodded, \"Then you should....well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Sapphire both blushed heavily, but in the end, Blake removed his clothes, which would hopefully make things more comfortable for them. The mage wasn't even in the woman's mouth yet and already he was excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire chuckled, \"You are one dirty boy. Though I might as well join you in that dirtiness.\" Blake smiled as Sapphire gave him a quick kiss before sliding him into her open maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt like he was in a dream. He knew it wasn't though and he couldn't be more excited. He offered no resistance as his cousin toyed with him using her tongue. She tossed him against her cheeks, gently nibbling on his exposed nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military officer then pressed him against the roof of her mouth, causing him to release his fluids unexpectedly. Despite this, both cousins knew that wasn't enough, so after the elder cousin pinned the mage under her tongue, she swallowed, before playing with him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time the boy released was when he was pressed against the back of Sapphire's front teeth and probed with her tongue. The third time was by himself, as Sapphire decided to stop playing with him for a bit and let the mage view the site of the inside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Blake poked out from Sapphire's lips and said, \"I'm ready now.\" Reluctantly, the elder cousin nodded, patting the boy's head gently, humming as the boy gave Sapphire a tiny kiss. She sucked him back inside, planning on toying with him one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, it lasted longer than usual. Blake felt like he was going to burst, but continued to wait and let it build up. Soon, the military officer tilted her head up, causing Blake to slide deeper into the woman's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cousin's uvula arced upwards and the boy was very ready for the next part. After having his legs get caught in the woman's throat, he was pulled down, powerfully releasing his fluids for the fourth time as he slid down the military officer's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the boy reached his cousin's stomach, he passed out, not even noticing the stomach acids that digested. Despite enjoying the events prior to swallowing Blake, Sapphire looked at her stomach in concern and worry as she prayed that the spell would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was given a joyful surprise when she felt him....</span></div></div>",

The military officer then pressed the mage against her front teeth, pinning him by biting down on his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the real fun began, as the elder cousin began probing the boy in various areas using her tongue.

After parking and bringing the bag with her, the military officer sat in the lobby and texted Ashley the address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is Ashley's bio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ashley Jonah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: Early thirties (around 33)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: 6' 8''. Her bust size is F-cup and she has toned muscle. She also has brown hair in a braid, a few scars, and usually wears her commander uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: She's the elder sister of Sapphire's love interest, Sean Jonah. She sees Sapphire as a sister and doesn't blame her for Sean's passing. She's quite protective of her like any older sibling would. She's never met Blake before, but through the stories that Sapphire told her, he seems like a great person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a tad serious due to her being a commander, she does show her gentle side to people who are kind, animals, and respectful. She would and NEVER will harm innocents, regardless of what happens to them (i.e. them shrinking or being transformed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she's not too pleased with disrespect. She will kick your ass if you DARE disrespect her or someone she cares about. She also has a hatred for Sylvia and can be considered her rival or arch-nemesis.)</span></div></div>",

Locking the door as she entered, the officer gently put the bag on the other bed, opening it slightly so the tinies could have fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire pulled Blake out of her cleavage, who tiredly asked, \"Where are we?\" \"Holiday Inn. We're in a suite and Ashley will be here in the morning.\" Sapphire whispered. \"Now, sleep. I'd want you to be fully rested and comfortable before heading home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the mage quickly fell asleep again as his cousin placed him on the pillow beside her. Soon, Sapphire also fell asleep, exhausted from the past few hours.

After a few minutes, Sapphire witnessed her commander walk in and proceeded to give her a gentle hug. As the commander returned the embrace, she gestured over to the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting some food and a table, Ashley asked, \"The bag?\" \"Other victims of the shrinking technology.\" The military officer replied. \"Blake shrunk himself via magic to impress his crush.\" The elder woman sighed with a chuckle, \"That doesn't surprise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire nodded with a smile, \"It's pretty cute, which is very like him.\" The commander noticed Sapphire's eyes still fluttering from exhaustion, \"I suggest that you stay for a while. That way, you can rest and heal up before heading home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire reluctantly nodded, getting some food for Blake and gave the bag to the soldiers, instructing them to get them to sickbay and find a way to restore them to their original height. She also ordered them to be extremely careful and gentle with them, as the shrinking made them more fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers nodded and saluted, before carefully bringing the bag to their jeep, leaving for Opal. Sighing in relief, Sapphire and Ashley headed back upstairs to their nice and comfortable suite. After entering, Ashley locked up as Sapphire sat in the chair, clearly still tired.</span></div></div>",

After catching her breath, the military officer looked at her nether regions, asking \"Are you okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm alright!\" Blake said. \"It's a bit slippery, but I'm okay.\" Sapphire sighed in relief and laid down on the bed. \"So, what do we do now?\" She asked. Blake tapped his chin before coming up with a reply...</span></div></div>",

She quickly grabbed a towel and went back into the bedroom. As she did, Blake casted another spell, causing Sapphire to feel a sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" She asked, putting the towel on the bed. \"Just activated another spell.\" Blake smiled, reassuringly. \"It's to make sure that this activity doesn't bite our asses in the future.\" Sapphire chuckled and nodded, knowing full well what Blake was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure that what you're referring to is IMPOSSIBLE to do at your size.\" The elder cousin smirked as she got on the bed above the towel. Blake nodded, \"Well, this is to make ABSOLUTELY sure that it doesn't happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm ready.\" Sapphire said. Blake immediately crawled deeper inside the moist fleshy cave, dragging himself against the wet walls. The military officer bit her lip as the boy crawled further into her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite obvious to both of them that they were experiencing pleasure...and decided to not waste this chance of feeling it. Blake reached a certain point of the cave where he knew Sapphire would be the most sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began rubbing against it and activated another spell that allowed him to vibrate with no problems. Sapphire moaned loudly and hissed as she felt the boy start vibrate within her. \"Have you...do this before?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like...it's the first time for...both of us...!\" Blake said, vibrating intensely. They could feel that they were both getting close. And within only seconds of each other, they emptied their fluids, which caused the military officer to pushed the mage out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy landed on the towel, covered in Sapphire's fluids as the elder cousin used her arms to keep herself from collapsing. \"Holy shit....\" She whispered, tiredly. She hadn't had that much fun in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right...\" She said to her tiny cousin. \"That was fun.\" She smiled at the boy as she waited for a reply, which turned into a concerned frown when no response came. \"Blake?\" She called out, concern rising in her. \"Are you okay?\"</span></div></div>",
