You had to scoff at first, a possession app? What kinda of sci-fi nonsense was that? Still, you were pretty bored lately. Beating the Pokemon League didn't leave a lot to do, and it was a slow day. If you were wrong, then it just did nothing and you'd continue being bored. No harm done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that only left one question... who'd be your first?</span></div></div>",

You press your finger down on the contact that says 'May' in the possession window and get ready for disappointment. But instead, you find yourself temporarily dizzy, and your vision blurs for a moment before you recompose yourself a second later. \"Ughh, what was-\" You freeze, what was wrong with your voice? You clasp your throat, but then notice your hands have gloves on them, and bring them up to your face. \"When did I- how-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't possible, that app... could it be? You look down, and you have two obvious protrusions blocking your view of the ground. Boobs. You had boobs. You'd only seen one pair of tits that were this exact size and shape (you'd spent plenty of time discreetly staring at them after all), and it was unmistakable. \"I'm... I'm MAY! This thing WORKS?!\" You exclaim, hands meeting tits with no hesitation. You push and squeeze and caress, and it's no mistaking it. These were the real deal. Your back meets a wall, and you slide down to the ground in disbelief. \"...I'm... May...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to observe whatever is around you. This seemed to be May's room back in Littleroot, you'd been in here once or twice before. This was unbelievable, that app actually worked? \"Oh no, the APP!\" You realize in a flash that you didn't have your PokeNav with you, so you frantically pull out May's from her bag and check it. The screen reads 'Active Session' with a 'Cancel' button bellow May's name. So the app travels with you? That was convenient. \"Wow.\" That's all you could muster to say, you thought this whole thing was going to be some big prank, but it worked! You were in the body of somebody you spent hours mentally undressing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what now?</span></div></div>",

The only other difference you could see was that instead of your treasure chest, May had a green case with a darker green bow on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I hadn't seen May's room before we got to know each other, I'd be worried that she was an obsessive stalker or something right now.\" You muse, caressing \"your\" left breast with your left hand, as you walk over to her desk, in order to place the PokeNav down to free up your right hand. Instead of having it join your left hand in its task, however, you decide to explore the room, reluctantly taking your left hand off as well for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around the room, you go over to her wardrobe, and open it up, seeing multiple outfits in it, some looking exactly like the clothes you are currently wearing, but also seeing some different ones, with shirts that are colored red, orange, and blue, with red, green, and blue bandanas with similar designs to the ones you are wearing and some white skirts (her outfits from the GBA games and Adventures manga in the case of the blue version), and swimsuits, both one piece and bikinis. You decide to give yourself own private fashion show, and take off your shirt and bra, leaving you topless, and go for the shorts, but stop when you remember something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... I was going to go visit May today...\" You mutter to yourself, realizing that it is all to possible for your body to walk in on you while you're not decent, not even sure whether you are ready for that, despite the fact that you could use that to get May and yourself together as a couple.</span></div></div>",

Maybe this would be fun after all. \"Hey May.\" Your body answered, clearly already trying not to check you out. You gave an innocent smile, pretending you didn't notice. \"Come on in, I wanna show you something anyway!\" You beckon your body inside, and he follows you as you head up the stairs to May's room. Now you were just playing this by ear, but since you had your body here anyway... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what exactly did you want to show me?\" Your body asks, confused. Clearly he wasn't all that interested in these plans, like you really weren't when you agreed to them. You figured you could try and access May's memories to see what she wanted, but screw that! You had your own ideas in mind now! \"I dunno, I've just... been really fascinated by myself lately, y'know?\" You ask with innocence, running your hands down your body's curves and grabbing your ass. Your body immediately takes notice. \"Uh-huh...\" He mumbles, shocked. You knead at your ass through your white shorts, turning slightly so that he sees this better. \"I mean look at me, I'm pretty damn hot! You ever notice that before, Ian?\" You ask innocently, to which your body stammers out some garbled nonsense in shock. You giggle in response. \"Such a kidder! Anyways, I've really just never appreciated my own body before, it's like I'm discovering it for the very first time today!\" You say as you give your ass a hard smack, something you KNOW you'd always wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is practically salivating, unsure how to react beyond stammering out some agreements to everything you say. It was almost pathetic how easily you broke in this situation, and on some level found that embarrassing. On every other level though, you loved how in control you felt, how hot and in command you were now that you were May. You were realizing just how much power women held over people, and you were beginning to actually enjoy how that felt. \"And my boobs! Look at these babies!\" You say, shaking your arms and torso with a wide smile as you looked down at your breasts as they jiggled and shook with your movements. The feeling of them bouncing and swaying on your chest was too surreal and awesome to really describe. You bunny hopped up and down a couple times, still staring at them with a big in character smile. \"Woo! What a rush! Like, I HAVE these, they're mine to play with wheeeeneeeeever I want! Girls sure do have it made, huh?\" You prod, elbowing your body in the arm, who only rubs the spot and mumbles in response. \"Uhuh... Yeah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A poor boy like you will never know how awesome it is to have alllll this to yourself~\" You taunt, chuckling as you lean over and shoot your body a smug look. You were having way too much fun taunting... yourself, you supposed. Which was ironic, since you were the one making fun of yourself for things you now had. Strange how these things worked out.</span></div></div>",

You lick your lips as you use your leg to kick apart his, making him spread them nice and wide for you. Looking down, you make a note of the noticeable bulge in his jeans. With an almost mocking giggle, you bend over nice and low, placing your face less than an inch away from his rock-hard bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey little Iaaaaan!\" You repeat with a small smirk, now not even trying to act like May as you gotten into the role so we- no... You were May. You had her hair, her body, her mind, her smell, her Pok\u00e9mon... You had everything. Maybe you weren't the May who'd been born into the body you now had but certainly her successor and the body's inheritor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you raise your head back up, now finished with teasing your former self\u2019s crotch. Yet you\u2019re not quite done with teasing anymore. Not at all. So you spin around and, with an almost childish bounce, you launch yourself back and into a sitting position on Ian\u2019s knee. You can feel the spandex of your cycling shorts creak slightly underneath your white jean ones as it stretches over your phenomenal ass. With a soft coo, you turn to face your former body and smile sweetly to it. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Ian? Don\u2019t you\u2026 enjoy this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting for a reply, you suddenly grab his crotch and roughly squeeze, making him moan slightly in surprise, pain and, above all else, arousal. Kneeding it, you enjoy the moment for a few seconds before you open up your pink lips and speak again. \u201cWho am I kidding\u2026 Of course you do!\u201d You purr in a soft and learing tone. \"After all...

I can tell you\u2019re just dyyying for release~\u201d you say rolling every other word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn\u2019t expect was for your body to immediately get his pants off and RAM that cock right up Mays asshole, causing you to squeal in ecstasy. \u201cOooooh~oooooooooh Ian keep going~ah~!\u201d Dear god this was better than your fantasies of plowing Mays ass yourself! Ian just kept pumping it in, stretching Mays asshole further. Causing a bit of pain, but oooooh so much pleasure~. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh...Ian....I can\u2019t take much more...ah...I\u2019m gonna cum!!!\u201d You say to your old body. He just grunts and keeps going further. Eventually you feel your cock twitch within Mays asshole. \u201cIt\u2019s ok Ian! Hah...just let it all out!\u201d You gasp under then intense pleasure. Eventually it just became too much for both of you to handle, and you two exploded on each other. You fall on top of your body as your dick slides out of Mays butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was fun wasn\u2019t it Ian?\u201d You say in Mays usual cheery tone. Catching your body off guard. Immediately standing up (and relishing in Mays bouncy bits jiggling), you pick your body up and help him get his pants back on. After getting your own clothes on (While showing yourself Mays plump rump), you immediately guide him out of the house with Mays mother being oblivious to the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was nice~ see you next time Iaaan~\u201d you say, giving your body a little kiss on the neck, causing him to blush to much he\u2019d be mistakable for a Groudon. \u201cO-o-of course May!\u201d your body said cheerfully, wow you really broke yourself didn\u2019t you~? As he left, you immediately walk back into Mays house, swinging her now cum stained ass as you did so. Laying down on the bed and taking a good couple  handfuls of her wonderful tits, you sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh May, we might not have seen eye to eye before, but I have the feeling we\u2019ll be closer than ever~hehehehe.....\u201d you say basking in the pleasure provided by Mays tits.

Your eyes widen with fear as you see the \"Engaged\" displayed on the screen. Quickly, you start hitting the close menu button in hopes of stopping this before it goes through to Arceus only knows... Probably a bug trainer or someone like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stop the call, you feel something tugging at your soul before tearing it out completely and hurling it through the air. Your entire form is encased in a feeling of weightlessness as you're thrown over land, trees and towns passing by in an instant, turning them into nothing more than but beige, green and grey blurs occasionally pockmarked by flashes of blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel yourself come to a stop. Air fills your lungs as you gasp in shock at the abrupt ending to the journey. You can feel an odd draft creeping up your legs, a strange weight on your head that is pulling it back but most prominently of all; everything feels cool. The air around you is a luxuriously low temperature that pleases your whole being as you finally open your eyes to look around. You're standing in an office. The floor is a perfectly smooth marble tiled one that connects to rough, slate walls that look like they've been mined into to create the room. Glass cabinets willed with small and beautiful stones of all kinds line the walls and form an island in the center of the office. Oddly enough, as you look at all these stones you recognize them and with each one comes a volley of thoughts; where they came from, what properties they hold, how rare they are... It's like you've dedicated years of our life to memorizing the vast number of geology books that sit in the dark stone shelves around the room, easily numbering in the hundreds and ranging from small leaflets about pebbles to huge tomes about the properties of magma rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you turn down to look at who you've become and see a dark grey dress and red, spiky neckerchief that hands down about half way down your petite body. You see a pair of bulges coming out of your chest. Your hands creep up the granite grey skirt and reach for the mounds only to stop suddenly as you hear a loud rapping on the door...

Then you spot a plaque that was given to you by the League to commemorate your victory over their existing champion. It shows beautiful, small watercolor panels six Pokemon that you used to defeat the legendary Steven Stone in two lines of three with their names, capture dates and locations, and the kind of poke-ball used to capture them below each one. As you smile, your eyes drift down to your famous Infernape that delivered the defeating blow to Steven's Metagross. Your eyes drift down and you see that the 'capture' engraving is different from the others. Instead of a date followed by a route, it says \"A Gift from Gym Leader Flannery.\" Your thoughts then drift to the young leader making you smile as you're reminded of her hilarious levels of incompetence at her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you realize what you can now do. \"Well... I mean... As the Champion it is my duty to understand what my leaders go through and how they run their gyms...\" You speak whilst you type in Flannery's number on your PokeNav. \"With this I can act like an invisible boss or whatever that show was called...\" You finish typing in the number and your smirk widens greatly as your finger hovers over the 'call' button. \"I'd say it's just me doing my job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the button. There is a sudden flash and then it all hits you like a train; the heat, the strange weight of your new body, a massive mass hanging off the back of your head... It's all so strange. You open your eyes and look around. You can see that you're now in a training area with what looks like a poke-ball in your hand. It seems that you've just finished up as Flannery was seemingly putting the ball back into her belt when you took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn... I forgot how hot this place is!\" You moan as the heat crushes down on you. You can feel how sweaty your body is under the crop-top and bell-bottom jeans and you feel the need to get the hell out of there as soon as possible! But where to go?</span></div></div>",

You stroll over to a changing room and lock the door, only then realizing that you'd left your bathing suit... or Flannery's... at her house.

You couldn't tell, since you were so disoriented from the attack on your private area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah couldn't just watch this sight take place. One hand rubbed at the lips of her vagina and one tweaked and played with her right breasts. Her breathing was heavy as she dove her lips to yours, causing you to lose yourself even deeper into the rabbit hole of pleasure you found yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy obviously enjoyed the sight, seeing as he increased the speed of his thrusts. You felt an immense pressure building up inside of you, ready to release, glancing as best as you could, you could tell Randy was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randy, I'm-Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am too!\" Even though you couldn't finish your sentence, he understood what you meant. He let his member exit your snatch, ready to let it out on Shelly's back. That was when Hannah practically inhaled his entire member. She swallowed every last drop of his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all rested for a moment, but only a moment, as everyone got ready for round two. In this event, a thought occurred that maybe you would like to take Randy's place for this.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are an experienced Trainer from the Hoenn Region. You've lived here for about a year now since moving from the Johto Region, and have made a decent name for yourself. Now you've received a call about a new experimental app for your PokeNav that was downloaded to your phone, and are curious to check it out. Turns out this app lets you 'navigate' your way into the bodies of any woman you have the number of! Now your new journey is ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan - \"Insert A Name,\" aka you. You're an average guy who's interested in seeing how this new app plays out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay - Your \"rival.\" She's more concerned about being your friend then offering to battle, but damn if she isn't pretty hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman - Your Father and leader of the Petalburg Gym. He spends a lot of time at the Gym and you don't see him very often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice - Your stay at home Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym Leaders and Elite Four - Roxanne, Flannery, Winona, Liza, Phoebe, Glacia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrontier Brains - Greta, Lucy, Anabel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua and Magma - Shelly and Courtney<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basic rules of this story are as follows;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No killing off the Main Character<br>\r\n2. No possessing Pokemon or Male Trainers<br>\r\n3. Anything goes sex wise<br>\r\n4. Everyone in this story is at least 18.<br>\r\n5. For the most part, this story uses the designs of the ORAS remakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't be afraid to add new chapters!</td>",
