Gather what little money that could find in any nook and cranny. Sure, they feel bad about doing these burglaries, but they really need the money. Your family can't pay the bills and the measly pay from flipping burgers ain't enough.  Airi only wipes their brow tiredly as they rummage through the shelves in what had to be in someone's living room. But they came to a sudden stop at the sound of the front door being opened. Almost instantly their blood ran cold and heart almost as they came face to face with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor Note: For future references and context, Airi's quirk is <b><i>Jurassic</i></b>.

She was more than...adequately toned with lean, dense muscles moist from sweat. Her upper body was a testament to that with her impressive biceps that bulged as they were folded under an ample bosom that was half hidden by a beige-colored crop-trop. Below was washboard abs that had to be formed after what has to be countless years of back breaking hard labor and activity. But her legs and such was on a whole another level, the things were like thick tree trunks who grew into rather feminine curves. Frankly, it amazed them that the dark fabric of her yoga pants can handle all of bulk and mass! And even more fitting of a frog. Her slide wearing feet were more than large in a length sense opposed to girth. They can only imagine how weary and hardened the dusty underside must be if they carried her all these years. More long opposed to being wide with her clear polished toes being more long and her rough nut cracking heels looking round and doughy.  The top skin of those digits were hidden under a two thin red stripes attached to each individual sandal. Both her second toes were slightly longer than the big ones. The sight made Airi cheeks morphed to glowed crimson as they darted to nearby framed pictures. An attempt to not have sexual misconduct along with breaking and entering and theft as their crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why I'm not surprised <i>ribbit</i>. Teenagers will be teenagers.\"  The woman once again sighed as she slinks forward to the intruder. Her impressive height of six feet and ten inches became apparent. Making them cower down in fear. \"But still...I can't let a burglar just go now can't I? I'm still a hero, even in my off days. Ribbit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can explain...I..I..\"They try to do just that until the veteran hero sharply cut them off. The authority she had was just impressive...scarily so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk Tsk, you can 'explain' everything while you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An sour musk ripe with hard-earned sweat and fresh water, with a vague hint of lilac. An undoubted remnant of a lotion or...maybe perfume. Or although he has heard that there body-wash that can last up a full day. He didn\u2019t dwell on that honestly idle tidbit of thought as she sat down on a big brown recliner in the right corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ribbiitt!~\"</i> The woman squealed to herself as the cushions of the chair did its job swimmingly. Easing her overworked flesh and it; the coolness of the surface was the icing on the cake-thing was worth every single bit of individual yen of her pay. Her fingers crawled down to the lever and pulled it up-causing the mechanism for the recliner's once vacant footstool to be sprang into action. Lifting those rock busting gumshoes to the midair. The weary things slowly crossed with the long toes of her left foot to slowly dangles the corresponding sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and pull up a foot-stool and come to my feet 'Ribbit! They need to be rubbed like now!\" The woman gasped hurriedly. The fast acting comfort of her recliner made her only want a pair of hands to knead her tired, overworked feet more than ever. The boy did what he was told, soon coming face to face with the sizable things. The feet's muggy warmth made his cheeks red while the sight of wrinkly thick folds of dusty skin, partially hidden by well worn rubber, caused his cock slowly to grow. He never had much intimate experience with girls, never mind a fully fledged woman. His legs quickly crossed to hide his shame. The boy's yellow eyes stared at the things-much too shy to massage another person, much less a member of the opposite sex. But the woman is undoubtedly waiting on it and he <b>DEFINITELY</b> doesn't want to get on her bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whether he likes it or not. So with that thought lingering in his mind, the boy quickly dons the frontal part of both his tee and over shirts collar as a protective mask. A flimsy line of defense against the almost guaranteed malignant malodor these broad things have brewed in the hot summer heat and heavy-duty activity. He is gonna take maximum precautionary efforts in this task! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know that you are just rubbing some feet right? And not handling something hazardous like asbestos ribbit.\" The woman couldn't help but bluntly pointed it out with an audible snort. Her flippant manner of speaking made Airi's eyes dart away from her face in mild unease, His fingers grasped the near the heel area of the dangling footwear that was to the left of him. Slowly sliding it upwards and revealing a long pink-tinged fleshy expanse littered with dust and small debris. The general shape of the lengthy thing is peculiarly curvaceous due to the high arch they possess. Visibly they other appeared to be shiny due to being quite...moist. So moist that...were some type of slimy <i>stuff</i> just glistening in the adjacent sunlight coming from the windows. There were translucent trails of it still connected to the top-side of the now vacant slide exactly on the deep imprint of where her foot once rested at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what the hell is that!!?\" Airi hissed in utter alarm and disgust as he tosses the shoe aside like it was a fire. His face contorted as he felts his insides twist and turns like it's nobody's business. Should've brought those gloves. They would have been in handy, and not just for hiding fingerprints he can tell that much! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My quirk gives me the most of the abilities and aspects of an <i>frog</i>, and that concludes the ability to produces two additional types of sweat. Which is what you are seeing right now. One of them at least.\" The woman informs the young criminal as his face gets even greener and nose visibly scrunch disgusted at what he heard. She used to be quite embarrassed about this fact along with her more than ample feet when she was just a little girl. Only letting them be bare when necessary like a class assignment. But she eventually stopped giving damn about it in her senior year of high school and even finding some <b>great</b> amusement at certain people's reactions to the less than savory things her quirks allow her to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, no not Airi but <b>you</b>, see what is she getting at here right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what is the matter? Don't tell me that my <i>little</i> old feet were enough to make the neighborhood thief shake in his boots? <i>Ribbt</i>\" The shift in her voice's tone were quite subtle, Airi can tell that she was very much mocking him, hell even the way she <i><u>ribbited</u></i> sounded like a taunt. Turning his pale green skin into a burning red. Briefly, he can see her face from the space of the long first toes of and right and the semi-clear gunk in the crevices. There he can see what had to be a small but definite smirk before the toes suddenly scrunched together. Making <b>*definite*</b> squelching sounds that made him flinched in great horror.\"If you gonna be staring at me with those oh so <i>scary </i> eyes of yours, I will be afraid I would have to do something more forceful like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Like what you going to do huh? Nasty amphibian <i><u><b>bitch</b></u></i>.\" Airi is normally quite nice and passive, but even he has his limits. As shown as his feathered yet scaly tail became prickly and while his pupils quietly morph into thin slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...like you'll be scraping the filth out of <b>ALL</b> my shoes and make them spotless with those diminutive toothpicks you call fangs. And then I will see if frog's mucus does have healing properties if you <b><i>ever</i></b> decide to talk to me like that again.\" Just like that, Her's tone became glacial as she slips off her right sandal and uses just the first two toes to quite literally lift him mid-air like he weights like <b>nothing</b> by grabbing the back of his neck, a mere <u>hint</u>of her strength and he can tell she wasn't trying the slightest. All of his fiery anger died down to mere smoke at the sight of those abyssal black pools look back at his terrified yellow ones. \"Now. Do. We. Have. An. Understanding. <b><i><u>Little Boy</u></i></b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every single syllable oozing cold dead anger, the boy could only quietly nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes <i>Ma'am</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy, maybe you learn yet.\" With that ordeal squashed, the woman quietly lowers her leg back down to the footrest. Gently placing him back on the footstool. Her right foot returning to its twin, \"Now then <b>rub</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich that he did, hurriedly clasping his hands at her instep which made them look kinda dwarf-like in comparison. Carefully. pressing his both of his thumbs up against smooth calluses and tensed overworked muscles coated with various liquids and dirt. The action causes the once intimidating woman to throw her head back against the chair and soft moan. Surprising the boy greatly, but he didn't dwell on it as his hands were kneading away like there no tomorrow. The muscles in his arms were hard at work as hands did their massage. Were each hand pull and stretch on the massive ball of each foot. Before he began lightly pounding at the much rougher yellowish heels, almost like he had a full-on brawl with the piece of foot flesh. The woman didn't wince in pain but instead, she bit her bottom lip feverishly as her long fingers began to squeeze the armrests tightly. All the while Airi began to do the fourth act of the massage where he grasps the long wet toes. Three of the lesser toes were so big that he can fully wrap a single hand around a singular digit. While the pinkie toe covers roughly a quarter of his palm. While with both of the big toes he can <i>hardly</i> wrap his fingers around it. The sound of joints popping and something wet squashing he carefully pulls the extremities. The woman quickly sucking her breath in as she felt her eye getting heavy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of repeating this arduous task. The boy rests his weary body and removes his now incredibly sore forelimbs from the now more tender walls of flesh. Hands all dirty with dust, sweat, and <i>weird</i> sweat. Feeling all gross and exhausted to continue it. His eyes lay upon the hero, and there she lays sprawled all out on his recliner with her hair looking slightly frazzled. In the process of going to sleep with a blush on her face. At that moment he realizes that A. She must have been like <i>extremely</i> exhausted and stressed from her job as a hero. Which made him feel pretty ashamed for not only breaking in her home but going so far as to insult her. And B....he is rock hard. He just realizing this now as his dick slowly throbs and aches as he stared at her weary form. Hormones were a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>' And it's not that she isn't sex-I-I mean <u>pretty</u>. Just kinda strange looking...but DEFINITELY not ugly looking. Her feet aren't either despite been so...imposing'</i> Airi's mind muses as he places a finger between her big and second toes. Tentatively rubbing against the wettest area of her right foot in an up and down matter until quickly returning the hand to his side as she mumbled out a giggle. Making his cheeks went from pink to red and dick forming a notable tent in his trousers causing his legs quickly cross. Making a growing desire to kiss her feet becomes readily apparent in his psyche which combats the need to keep his \"mask\" up to prevent whatever aroma these feet have from wafting to his otherwise defenseless nose and mouth. He has been breathing through his mouth the entire massage. An impressive feat yes, but his reluctance to her feet was honestly lighting it up despite his shock. But he doesn't want to add sexual misconduct to r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of illegal activities either as mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two minutes of internal debating and conflict, he...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The device's cover was styled, surprise surprise, after rather cute cartoon frog on a lily pad. If the situation wasn't so dire Airi would have chuckled. The woman wordlessly pointed at a chair. Her circular eyes just narrowed ever slightly, showing that she was not joking or asking.  Making the girl take a beeline for it. Nearly toppling it over in her rush. Earning an unimpressed glance from the woman and a shake of her head as she walked out the living room through the front door. From the curtain-covered windows, Airi could see the faint black silhouette of the woman. Faintly she can hear words- the conversation between the hero and whoever she is calling. She can't what exactly they are saying, but definitely wasn't good for her. Even though she agrees that what she did what was a serious crime, but she could help but some anger directed towards the older female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't dwell as the frog like woman returned with the faintest hint of a smile. Making Airi squirm in the sight, now she felt her heart threatening to burst out her chest. The woman...is a hero <i>right</i> and heroes...don't torture criminals <i><b>right</b></i>? The sight of the girl made the hero's smile faltered. A younger, more emotional part of herself can't help but pity Airi's state. But it not moved the larger, more stern part of herself-one that had to deal with countless trials and terrible acts of evil. In fact, she was adamant on punishing her. What she is doing is not only illegal but highly dangerous. She could've gotten herself killed if she entered the <b>wrong</b> person's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sit in silence for an unknown amount of minutes...until the door vibrated as someone knocked on it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hello, Froppy! So, where's the criminal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiri looked at the owner of that voice. A woman in her late forties just like the frog hero. Even if she was smaller, she was still quite tall ( roughly around the 6 feet range), but she looked somewhat like a stereotypical deception of a villain ... perhaps because of her punk look. The new female who arrived was mainly dressed in black: black boots, black pants, a black coat, and even a black t-shirt under it. She also had black fingerless gloves that allowed Airi to see she had painted her nails in black too. Her short hair however was dark purple, and she had black lipstick on her lips. She was looking back at Airi with a completely neutral expression, which made Airi shiver. Was from it due to terror or pesky hormones. The warmth she felt on her face made it more questionable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>' She seems so ... cold! I doubt I'll get out of this without facing a terrible punishment '</i> Quickly thought Airi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's her, Earphone Jack, You're better than me to find fitting punishment for problem children like her ribbit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you called me ... I have an idea ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarphone Jack then whispered something in Froppy's ears. Froppy then looked at her and sighed yet she seemed to agree to her partner's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha ... what do you intend to do to me?\" asked a worried Airi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll know that soon enough\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punk woman then took her boots and socks, sat on a sofa and put her feet on a small table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look at my feet and describe them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ... your feet ... why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't yelling at Airi, yet she used a sinister tone reeked of \"<b><i>Do it or else something worse will happen to you. Much worse.</i></b>\". Airi quickly obeyed and knelt not very far from her feet. Airi was kinda jealous: that hero's feet looked so beautiful despite the fact she was almost 50 years old. Her feet were quite small and thin (probably a size eight or nine), very pale just like the rest of her revealed skin, her toenails were painted in black. her toes seemed beautiful and average-sized, somewhat even if Airi didn't think she has a thing for feet...the dino-girl kinda wanted to do <i>things</i> to them..and things to the two women. The base of her toes was perfect and the same goes for her pales soles who looked very soft ....though her feet were sweaty and somewhat carried a smell since they were trapped during several hours in boots. Also, the heels had some callosity ... but the general aspect of her feet was enjoyable to Airi's eyes even if she didn't have any known fetish and it was hard to believe they belonged to an almost fifty years old woman ... if Airi was perfectly honest, that the woman's feet were a lot more beautiful than her own clawed feet. Airi gave her an honest reply and described how those feet looked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look..very <i>beauti</i>-I mean <i>cut</i>-no wh-what I really meant they are very taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well thank you, naughty little thief. Do you like them then? Do you have a foot fetish by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no I don't, I just told you how I saw th-them that's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroppy and Earphone Jack both smiled not so heroically: it was funny to tease a teenager like her. The punk hero then connected her strange lobes to the girl's ears in a similar manner one would do with earbuds, she was about to use her quirk. When she was still a student she mainly used that to amplify the sound of her own heart but now she can use stocked audio files from her headphones. She has thousands of different sounds and music that can be used in any situation, using her own heart as the music speaker so to speak. Here she was about to release a very powerful suggestive sound with some pronounced words recorded with her own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me that you are lying, little girl.~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh ... what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after she asked that question, Airi's ears were filled with a very relaxing sound, it was almost hypnotic. In addition to the sound, there was a voice ... a dark and sensuous voice ... it was penetrating her very psyche... \"<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">You are clearly lying to yourself-you poor thing.</span>\" ...<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"> \"Who doesn't look at feet like that and NOT have a kink~\"</span> ... <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">\"You are a growing girl after all, what you feeling is natural\"</span> ... <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">\"Just admit it...you like me and my friend here.\"</span>... for some reason the sweet sound was getting the poor dinosaur girl more and more comfortable with what the voice is saying and ... the voice was not only telling her truth but planting the seeds of making her less afraid on acting on those desires. Making her more malleable to commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet are <i>soooo</i>  sore, wanna rub them for me <i>clever girl</i>?\" Jirou's naughty smirk was infectious as her toes traced the outline of Airi's face. Which was pinkening rapidly as the elder female did her teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No I don't! \" Airi was surprisedly much more resistant to Earphone jack's siren call to both women's surprise. The feathers of the thief's tail puffed up as the older punk's moved to her developing breasts-yelping in surprise as the toes squeeze her nipples gently. Earning a bemused smirk from the rocker. Who then earned a blank if not disapproving look from her life long friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that's not the first time I have seen you do that but that part of your quirk is both frightening and disgusting. What was really necessary to hypnotize her like that, ribbit? \" The Amazonian frog was usually the first one to scold her friends' more peculiar habits. This being one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the other woman only shrugged in response, her now trademark devil may care smirk now apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hypnotize</i>? Me? Oh Froppy, you think so little of me! All I did is tease some parts of the little dinosaur's psyche out in the open. Nothing as serious as full-on hypnosis, even I am not that cruel. The effects would wear off in a day. Which gives us plenty of time.\" Jirou chimed, a little bit offended that the frog implies she would go that far on a stupid kid. Tsuyu only blankly stared at the rocker, it was clear she disapproved of her methods but was pleased that she didn't go <i>that</i> far in it. And she didn't want to admit it...Airi was cute like this. <i>Very</i> cute in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what you talking. I don't like fe-feet that at all! You are lying! Your quirk is <i>lying</i>!\" Airi rawly squeaked in a way that reminded both heroes of how they used to be when they that age. The dino girl's eyes were watery as these conflicting feelings became readily apparent. Earphone jack's face was rather neutral, but she did shiver at the dread coming off of Froppy's darkening features. Maybe she went a little overboard with it, but the girl needs to be punished for her crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less teenage angst, more pampering kid. Should have thought of about that before causing such a terror spree. I am pretty sure all the folks you robbed must be feeling a <i><b>tiny</b></i> bit worse then you do.\" Jirou harshly scolded the teenage girl as her pale soles scrunched slightly, causing her to feel an acute moistness in her lower regions. This only increased as the rocker remove her shirt and coat-revealing her highly muscular but lean torso and perky bosom held up by a lacy white bra. The other hero would sit beside her friend. giving the same blank look. Emboldened by the hero's meddling in her mind, the shamed Airi's flushed face was getting closer and closer to the incredibly well-taken care of pair of mature feet that was in front of her, ready to pay her debt to her society...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As these disturbing events continued to unfurl for the unfortunate delinquent, Airi looked at the bare feet. The girl never thought she would do such an intimate activity with someone. Hell, she didn't even have her first kiss, unlike other fifteen-year-olds. But the words that the strange earred woman uttered eariler cut through her heart...she was right. It was selfish and wrong for her to act like she is the victim here, regardless of her reasons for committing the robberies. It still doesn't change the fact she did something wrong and need to own it. Like a big girl. And besides, licking some feet is nothing compared to jail time, and ruining her life forever-plus it would be terrible for her dad since he is just a simple police officer. Despite her disgusting task laying before her, Airi willed herself into doing this. Her shivering face made the heroes' softer and more compassionate sides and made their frowns deepen as their hearts ache at the sight of the younger girl's conflicted expression. They were really are messing with a child's feelings. But they were determined to see her do this punishment. Briefly wondering if this is how their homeroom teacher felt when dealing with countless students seeing their dreams shatter right before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After three shallows of air, Airi was now ready to disgrace her tongue by licking the tired dogs belonged to women two to three times her own age. It was beyond humiliating for her and yet in a small buried area of her mind, it wasn't going to be as bad as she thought it would be ... though even Airi herself couldn't tell why ... was it because of Earphone Jack's quirk's questionable administration of her subconscious mind? Was it because the pair of feet in front of her was not only incredibly elegant in shape, but is also well taken care of? Was it because she really <i>likes</i> this....let not dwell on <i>that</i> shall we? The young girl closed her eyes tightly and applied her long pink tongue on the rocker soles-mashing her face against the thin foot's ball. Giving her poor nostrils a load of the dull sour and fruity odor wafting off of the appendage-her higher sense of smell made the aroma stronger than it is initially is, The presence of the tongue caused the warm creamy skin to contour--making numerous wrinkles to shape with every slight movement she made,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'GROSSGROSSGROS-'</i> Airi's mind screamed as her tongue gather the salty secretions off the sand-paper textured heels. Grimacing at the rough grainy texture, motivating her tongue to move upward. Sending waves of electricity down as her skin became akin to a goose's very own. The girl felt her cheeks flared up an unexplained warmth she as her tongue cradled the much softer instep like. Wiggling against the silky skin in slithering pattern-the rocker had to clench her teeth in muffled the waves of laughter coming out of her throat. Airi slides it up to the base of toes, leaving only a translucent trail of saliva in its wake. Causing the woman's own face to flush embarrassingly- like she was back in high school. Which only got worse as the younger female then wrapped her tongue between her toes' crevices and spaces. Causing the rock and roll themed heroine to bit her bottom lip. Her pale skin gotten moist and tingly as the not so heroically thought of what else that long tongue is also good for suddenly flashed her mind as well as countless others,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Shit</i>...kid tha-that is <i>enough</i>!\" The elder female gasped just as her second lips started to moisten with the burning  <i>craving</i> to touch it slowly showed it's ugly perverse head. She needs to get a grip, she is better than is. Quickly crossing her arms to hide the shameful display her buxom is doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh okay!\" The guilt feeling girl instantaneously ceased, trying to ignore her own confused mind and stranger bodily habits. Her yellow eyes widen in alarm at the sight of the formerly coolheaded hero before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earphone jack, are you alright?! I didn't hurt you di-did I?\" Airi asked, worried that she caused the woman to be sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just..hot flashes. Don't you worry your head.\" Jirou smiled a little bit, kinda pleased that Airi wasn't some punk and did try to verbally attack her when she is low.  if anything she seems more and more like some good kid that did something stupid...really stupid. Tsuyu shared her statements as she made a cover story for her close friend's sudden \"condition\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using her subliminal messaging takes a toll on her body. Resulting in hot flashes and bouts of exhaustion for her. It's nothing to be worried\" Tsuyu told Airi, who nodded and looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since you did...such a good job. I think you deserve a small break.\" Jirou said with a huff, she trying to ignore tingle ebbed throughout her crotch. Unbecoming images of the girl emerged her mind. She quietly flashes the girl a smile that seemed to lift her spirits a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tsuyu was quick to rectify that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't get too happy, you still have to tend to my own feet.\" Tsuyu coyly added as she slapped her sandals against her <i>gagruntan</i> feet. Which wet sloshing sounds like caused both her fellow hero and young thief to visibly grimaced and cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THOSE MEAN LOOKING THINGS! One big toe is bigger than my whole hand, maybe even both.'</i> Airi paled at the sight of them if Jirou's feet were considered to be beauty then Froppy's feet were easily the beast. Completely the opposite of her compatriot. the tall frog woman's feet were more than sizable and much tougher looking. Fitting given her amazonian like figure and impressive musculature. But yet...they weren't ugly or anything. In fact, Airi could say that they were beautiful in their own untraditional way...such a thing made Airi lower her head. Deeply embarrassed that she would even think...and <b><i>feel</i></b> such a thing, the change in her body language causes both women's maternal instincts to flare up. The softer <i>young</i> parts of themselves want nothing more to console Airi about everything she is feeling. But unlike before, these feelings were starting to overcome the hardened mature components of their being that they developed through years of saving people and witnessing tragedy and evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs five minutes of uncomfortably tense silence, Airi...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Airi could do anything with Froppy's feet the trio heard a BIG noise and when the three of them turned around to see what it was ... the door was destroyed and a VERY tall figure approached them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" snarled Froppy with a worried voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! It's Himiko Toga!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard that name, Airi started to shiver: Toga was currently one of the most powerful villainesses out in japan and was knows for being a HUGE psychopath but in addition to her reputation ... her form is never truly consistent ... but currently, she was really huge! Airi estimated Toga to be around more than eight feet tall! She looked even more muscular and impressive than Froppy! Toga was wearing an exotic kind of dress that allowed others to see half of her thick legs and hips from the side. The dress was similar to what female jazz singers used to wear long before quirks were developed: A silky monochromatic satin dress with an exposed midsection that showed her chiseled torso to the whole world. It's v-shaped collar that showed her bare shoulders and impressive cleavage. It was her pride, this outfit was to her. But more importantly, this form allowed her to show others how exactly beautiful and loving she was. Her wild ash-blond hair was free and lose-reaching and covering her otherwise exposed back. The villain appears to be wearing a large overly lush white fur coat over her shoulders. Finally, she was also wearing grey throng type sandals that exposed her enormous pale feet a lot- the thick heels of the shoes just make her even taller! As she advanced, heroes went back by one step ... even if Airi was new to all this, she could feel Froppy and Earphone Jack had a great fear of Toga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,  I saw that you know ... I saw what you did to that poor girl! How <i>heroic</i> treating her like that!~\" Despite the seemingly carefree tone this crazy lady had. Airi could have sworn that the almost god-like woman was furious and disgusted underneath all the sick joy...but she is a villain, right? Won't she enjoy seeing someone like her degraded? \"Maybe the two of you need to be taught a lesson,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shu ... shut up!\" replied an ashamed Jirou<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no desire to learn a lesson from a psychotic hag like you!\" Tsuyu, beyond furious at what the crazed killer is suggesting...even if it's true<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about one point: I'm even more enthusiastic about loads of fun stuff than you. So yeah, I can't really lecture you ... though ... I'm not in the mood of being a witch, I'm more like a berserker or a tank at the moment!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToga removed her sandals, revealing her feet and they were massive. Like the rest of her, they were pale and sweaty. And they looked very strong! In a <i>fraction </i> of a second, she appeared near Earphone Jack and spartan kicked her in the face before she could react. It allowed Airi to notice Toga's feet were extremely doughy and thick looking, incredibly soft-looking too. Jirou was knocked out by that attack due to not build for pure physical combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Damnit, she became even stronger than last time, this isn't good.'</i> thought Tsuyu, knowing full well that Toga must have a bountiful feast of blood before she got here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Your friend is lame, she's already knocked out by one single kick!\" Toga teased Froppy and was even showing her soles to her to mock her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, kid, you go run, meanwhile I ...\" But before she could act Toga was already on her trying to kick her in the face, Thanks to her mutation, Tsuyu was many times physically stronger than her friend but still inferior to Toga's current form's raw power who had the upper hand. Meanwhile, Airi wasn't moving at all: she was paralyzed by fear ... also for some reason she couldn't help but look at the massive villainess and thought she was beautiful. After some seconds of an intense physical battle between Froppy and Toga, Froppy received several brutal stomps the face,  she was about to faint when Toga humiliated her by squeezing her toes on the hero's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it, little kero? Not good tasting your own medicine huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S ... stop it!\" Airi cried out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToga was surprised by Airi's reaction and Froppy finally just fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop? But why? Those heroes are freedom killers! If they continue to lecture to you, you'll never be free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I did something really bad and they just tried to ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know what kiddo! I'll take you with me and I'll show you something very fun!\" Toga's voice sounded sweet...almost motherly as she places a massive hand on the young girl's face. Then, Airi's world became black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[a few hours later ...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiri was in a dark room and she just woke up. There was some light but the place was really dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you, woke up,\" said a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiri turned around and recognized Toga. The giant blond villainess was smiling to the dinosaur girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my lovely underground lair. It used to be a subway but I and my lovely little students transformed the place and the surrounding sewers in a sort of villain academy, and right now it's time for an <i>exam</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo-you means Froppy and Earphone Jack is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they're here, take a look by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToga pointed at a screen on the wall and it was showing pics of Tsuyu and Jirou who barely woke up: a security camera was filming everything and transmitting images to the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you plan to do to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll know it very soon.\" This time it was an unknown voice who talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiri noticed the voiced belonged to a girl around her age with a gothic lolita style of clothing....and she has a larger mouth than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you're monster queen! Do the usual!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure mistress, Toga\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden \"monster queen\"' mouth ooze out a kind of black gummy liquid on the ground and it took a physical form in barely a few seconds. In fact, it'd be more precise to say \"physical forms\". Two beings were created from this: a kind of giant zombie bride that was probably 8 feet and a half tall. The other was in the shape of a female humanoid lizard. Both were pitch black and seemingly made out of the sticky stuff. All of a sudden \"monster queen\" rubbed a kind of potion on the zombie and on the lizard's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My student can ooze a special gum from her mouth that can be used to create monsters and other freaky creatures, They aren't smart in any regard, but they will follow the spunky little sweetie's orders perfectly. And what she is using is a  pheromone potion made by another one of my other students that will make them release pheromones that will make anyone quite aroused ... and guess what? All monsters who're patrolling in the maze. are also covered in this potion! If they find our heroes they'll become like a bunch of horny college kids on a weekend!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go you two. Patrol in the maze and greet our guests.\" Monster queen's monotone order was quickly received as the creations moved into the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms.T-Toga...why are yo-you doing all of this?\" asked a beyond scared Airi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple\" replied Toga with a sadistic smile \"All of my students need to have the first-hand experience when it comes to those pesky party-poopers known as heroes. And let me tell you those two will face tons of humiliations and punishments in that giant maze ... besides, since I have you by my side they'll have no choice but to participate in my little exam! And you know what, you should be quite pleased. After what they did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last two sentences made Airi quite quiet. Toga voice shifted into sick gleefulness into cold bitter disgust and sympathy in a fraction of seconds. Like she is genuinely was disgusted at how they treated a girl like that. Not something you expect from a cold-blooded killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Tsuyu and Jirou woke up, they were noticed they were in a dark room with at least four possible paths to choose from! Before they could discuss, they heard Toga's voice who used a loudspeaker system to talk to heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations heroes! you're allowed to participate in a special lesson for all my adorable cuties to learn from! Go through all my ordeals and I <i>might</i> release that girl. Fail or refuse to participate and Dino-chan will never leave this place! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch...she is crazy as ever right Froppy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ribbit, but you better be careful, she's clever ... who knows what kind of traps await for us in thi ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tsuyu finished her sentence she heard loud footfalls, like something, mean coming their way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Fuckin' original as a ninja hidin' in the shadows..\"  A gruff female voice dully commented as a meaty bronze-skinned hand clasped the frail lolita dressed girl's head, severely ruffling the small girl's soft golden hair into a messy birdnest. Earning a rather undignified snarl from the once expressionless big-mouthed girl. The hand's owner was a beast of a girl-reaching just below the imposing Toga's own buxom.  She had a very brawny and strong body like the older woman's current state-like having highly developed and muscularly defined arms and legs. But she appears to be rather bulky in figure and having fat that made her plusher opposed to being chiseled like the blood-drinking goliath before her. She was wearing a very baggy crimson-colored hakama styled pants that went down to her ankles. On her, notably large broad plump feet were two dark brown wooden geta sandals with dark blue straps with sunflowers etched on it. Her ample cleavage was wrapped up in a white cloth, Leaving otherwise her thick upper body and mildly paunchy gut exposed to the whole world to see. Her heavily layered fluffy hair was purple in color while her nails were painted in emerald green, The giant girl's own eyes are orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is more creative than what you think up in that empty skull, you draft sow!\"  The little goth harshly snarled as she struggled to even lift the massive appendage off of her. While the larger girl only snickered as she petted her as one would do to a toy dog. Curiously, the goth was beginning to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Waka-chan, please stop bullying I-Iku-chan.\" A more average-sized girl quickly stuttered out, She was wearing a pink blouse, and a blue skirt. Yellow-colored and orange laced sneakers and red short socks. Her soft green hair was styled into a bob cut. Like a panda bear, Her green colored eyes are in the very middle of two perfectly circular spots like markings. The right being white while the left being black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them fight, Iwa. We need some humor considering we are dealing with top heroes.\" Another averaged sized girl worriedly chimed as she stared at the screen showing Froppy creating a massive hole on the floor as she performed ax kick at the gummy zombie from eariler. She was wearing a red tracksuit and white simple sneakers that were underneath a white lab coat that is a little big for her. Her medium-length spiky artic blue hair was styled into pigtails while her pink eyes were half-lidded. Making her little sleepy and lazy looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see my star freshmen unit, <i>The Onna</i>, are here and ready to have some fun in some hands-on education!\" The mad diva freely pronounced with a twinkle in her yellow eyes, instantly all the girls' attention was directly on her. Airi was amazed at the authority she had over the band of  misfits.\"Well...half of you made it at least. I may ask, where are the other five at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, M-ms.Toga, the others are coming here shortly. Riho and Aeko are with their family. Joruri is on her way, just got done with some shopping. Nahoko is stuck doing club activities at Isamu Academy High School. And Moto....is asleep in the dorms.\" Iwa informed the massive elder, who only sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for telling me Iwa-chan. I will go wake our little puddl-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your \"school\" have dorms?\" Airi finally spoke after absorbing so much information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your filthy fanged maw, you extinct harlot!\" Iku's largemouth spat out verbal venom at the other girl for interrupting their teacher. But the dinosaur girl only bared her fangs and hissed sharply in response, taking a few good steps forward towards the shorter girl, Jirou's mental meddling has also made her quicker to anger and thus more influenced by her and her quirk's more primal nature. This little outburst was due to Airi finally started to snap, she wasn't going to be mocked by someone her own damn age, all of the stress from what she went through all day finally start to hit a boiling point.  This causes the smaller goth's grey eyes to widen in both great alarm and fear from the fearsome display the seemingly passive pink-haired saurian teen is showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I didn't think you had in ya, lizard. And I know the little edgelord can be an annoying little shit.\" The fearsome giant girl, Waka, was more than a little impressed by their \"guest\"'s balls and loudly laughed...as she protectively steps in front of the big-mouthed girl. Her once joyful grin perked down into a tense frown.\"If you think, we going to let you harm her...well ya fucking stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plea-Please don't make us do this.\" Ima's spots glowed as she summoned dozens upon dozens of floating polka dots of different colors around. She really doesn't want to do this to the girl after what those <i>fake</i> heroes have done to her...but she will if means protecting her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her lazy apathetic facade, Ayuri does care for her teammates' wellbeing and do think of them as friends. So the blue-haired whiz kid pulled out what seems to be a support gear-a clockwork glove. She put it on her right hand and pointed it at the angry girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this tense moment unfurled, Toga would stare on blankly. Her eyes on her students and her \"volunteer\". Interested to see where they do next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<b>Author's note</b>: Here is a list of the known Onna's full names and a very short description of their quirks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIwa Uchiyama Aka Trypophobia's quirk is Polka-Dots. Iwa can generate dots and spots of varying sizes. These can be used to be warp to different locations and can store and releases many things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyuri Yamamura Aka Wonka's quirk is Choconut. By eating chocolate, Ayuri's neural and cerebral functions like intelligence and perception increase steadily. The side effect of the quirk is that Ayuri already has abnormal intelligence.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIku Nakahara aka Monster Queen's quirk is Gummy Bear, Her larger than normal mouth can ooze out a strange gum that can be molded into mindless gummy monsters of various appearances and sizes. The gum making drains large amounts of nutrients from her body. Making her quite weak and frail normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaka Tabata aka Diaster's quirk is Fieldwork.

Many of which like some members of the ralts, togepi and happiny families has seen many...<i>adaptions</i> because of this different social climate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sawyer is utterly blind to these dark troubling times, clinging on to an innocent desire to befriend pokemon and became the very best in the world. On their side is a plucky bidoof named Huckster and sassy rattatta named Finks as their only pokemon. Sawyer is determined to make their dream a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next in the story</span></div></div>",

Can you see that I am walking here.\" A cold mature voice cuts through the air like a greatsword through softened butter. Sending a chill down their spine as they found themself staring at a tall curvaceous woman with a half-eaten lemon in her right hand. She was wearing a haphazardly put together black business dress with no tie in sight and unbuttoned- revealing her ample pale bosom to the world. Black hair was long and messy-looking extremely unprofessional even you ignore the odd red streak in her hair. A woman of her age dying her hair like that? Talk about a mid-life crisis but you digress. Her strange grey eyes had slight bags underneath, just making her even more haggard-looking if that even possible. What is even weirder, is the large heavy looking metallic guitar case slung over her back as she walked. Which even impressive that she is wearing heels. Walking perfectly fine too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sorry miss.\" Makoto awkwardly said to her, she didn't dignify the teenager with a proper verbal response. Just her eyes darting towards them with less emotion than a dead fish as a half-ass sign of acknowledgment. Before moving away as she walked off. Just left them in the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was friendly of her.\" Makoto bitterly sighed as they continue their trek to school. Briefly wondering just who the hell was that woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Now that I'm thinking about it, didn't the home economics teacher nearly died due to an accident with the baking club? Could she be the replacement?'</i> The idea of that picture of idealism and professionalism being the teacher of that class was a joke. But everything lined up with her appearance much to  Makoto's dread.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the school's gates draw near, Makoto finds that...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">What's up gamers, it's ya' favorite degenerative <b><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">P O S T  B O Y</span></b> here. Giving ya' yet other interactive where you live out your perverted fantasies through an overpowered self insert and go on adventures with your waifu from both animation and video games! But with one little twist... your waifu ain't a little girl with daddy issues with hopes and dreams anymore. No, in these tales, your favorite character is now a fully grown older lady, disillusioned by the world at large and probably won't put with half of the bullshit they put up with when they were younger.  This story also goes for characters who are already that age. Like Adult Sakura and Bulma<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun! ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No short chapters! Keep a minimum of two to four paragraphs at a minimum. I will give leniency to some chapters but don't continuously make them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Unlike the rest of other my interactives, Sexual content is more heavily referenced and will mostly happen depending on the things. And actual super \"lewd\" stuff may or not transpire in later chapters. But being constantly naked is which is a no-no.<br>\r\n3.2. Full-blown sex and actual romance will be something will you have to develop a relationship with another character. Crushes can be formed easily, however, on the protagonist end of things, and can act as a starting point for it.<br>\r\n3.3, Things like \"hands-on\" teasing, handjobs, and etc are fine though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Feet are the main kink of the story. So No toilet stuff, Major Weight gain, major limb expansion or inflation, super-hardcore femdom, or vore of any kind. That goes for any kink that goes against the flow of the story. But to nature of the stuff and themes of the story, shrinking/growing will be very much allowed, and encouraged! That goes for a minor to medium muscle growth and such too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. My eternal rule: Not every foot have to smell like a cheese factory, nor do they smell like a field of daisies. The same goes for the feet's size and texture. Not every person is tall or is short. Not every girl has watermelon for tits. Or an ass that claps away thunderstorms. Variety is the spice of life, get what I'm saying. All to make feel a little more realistic and \"human\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Your choices matter in the long run and shape the main character's personality and also develop the others. And remember while you are free to do whatever you want. But remember, you aren't free from the consequences of said actions.<br>\r\n6.1. The protagonist can be a boy or girl. and their general personality is up to you<br>\r\n6.2. Their age would...be vague. All I would say that they will be somewhere between being fifteen to eighteen years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please keep the influx of choice chapters on the relatively low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Keep it, first person or second person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. No sudden abrupt endings and deaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Remember all the chosen characters and such are fully grown adults that are in their mid to late thirties, forties, or even early fifties! Make them act their age and true to their personalities to a certain degree. But interpretations and exploration of them and how they react to things are not only allowed but are ENCOURAGED since a lot of time has passed since their younger days. Not to mention\u2026it's kinda one of the main themes of the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n11.  The protag isn't blind to a character's other \"assets\" *eyebrow wiggle*. But be warned, this isn't pure smut(and it can be kinda close). But playful mocking, outright bullying, and teasing is very much allowed and is encouraged. ;D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. You can only play, confront, and interact with female characters. No chapters with the character having a lewd interaction with males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. Most of the characters the protag will encounter would have trained above and beyond their capabilities in canon, Making them leagues above their young counterparts. Meaning if the protag tries to fight them...well good luck to them lol. They would need all they can get,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. The most important rule\u2026is to have fun, and get creative with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. Second most important rule; no crossovers! Keep it in the show.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>.-<br>\r\nTo bring some life in the story, I will give out two to three thousand gift points for quality chapters!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Not only that, I would be giving out four thousand gift points for good chapters for the Pokemon, Sonic, Avatar. and My hero academia series!</font></td>",
