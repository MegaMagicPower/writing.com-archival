All week, they went from house to house with help from their quirk.Gather what little money that could find in any nook and cranny. Sure, they feel bad for doing these burglaries, but they really need the money. Your family can't pay the bills and the measely pay from flipping burgers ain't enough.  Airi only wipe their brow tiredly as they rummage through the shelves in what had to be in someone's living room. But they came to a sudden stop at the sound of the front door being opened.

She was more than...adequately toned with lean, dense muscles moist from sweat. Her upper body was a testament to that with her impressive biceps that bulged as they were folded under an ample bosom a partially hid by a beige-colored crop-trop. Below was washboard abs that had to be formed after what had to be countless years of back breaking hard labor and activity. But her legs and such was on a whole another level, the things were like thick tree trunks who grew into rather feminine curves. Frankly, it was amazing that the dark fabric of her yoga pants can handle all of bulk and mass! And fitting of a frog. Her slide wearing feet were more than large in a length sense opposed to girth. They can only imagine how weary and hardened the dusty underside must be if they carried her all these years. More long opposed to being wide with her clear polished toes being more long and her rough nut cracking heels looking more rotund and doughy.  The top skin of those digits were hidden under a two thin red stripes attached to each individual sandal. Both her second toes were slightly longer than the big ones. The sight made Airi cheeks morphed to glowed crimson as they darted to nearby pictures. An attempt to not have sexual misconduct along with breaking and entering and theft as their crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why I'm not surprised <i>ribbit</i>. Teenagers will be teenagers.\"  The woman once again sighed as she slinks forward to the intruder. Her impressive height of six feet and ten inches became apparent. Making them cower down in fear. \"But still...I can't let a burglar just go now can't I? I'm still a hero, even in my off days. Ribbit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can explain...I..I..\"They try to do just that until the veteran hero sharply cut them off. The authority she had was just impressive...scarily so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk Tsk, you can 'explain' everything while you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An sour musk ripe with hard-earned sweat and fresh water, with a vague hint of lilac. An undoubted remnant of a lotion or...maybe perfume. Or although he has heard that there body-wash that can last up a full day. He didn\u2019t dwell on that honestly idle tidbit of thought as she sat down on a big brown recliner in the right corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ribbiitt!~\"</i> The woman squealed to herself as the cushions of the chair did its job swimmingly. Easing her overworked flesh and it; the coolness of the surface was the icing on the cake-thing was worth every single bit of individual yen of her pay. Her fingers crawled down to the lever and pulled it up-causing the mechanism for the recliner's once vacant footstool to be sprang into action. Lifting those rock busting gumshoes to the midair. The weary things slowly crossed with the long toes of her left foot to slowly dangles the corresponding sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and pull up a foot-stool and come to my feet 'Ribbit! They need to be rubbed like now!\" The woman gasped hurriedly. The fast acting comfort of her recliner made her only want a pair of hands to knead her tired, overworked feet more than ever. The boy did what he was told, soon coming face to face with the sizable things. The feet's muggy warmth made his cheeks red while the sight of wrinkly thick folds of dusty skin, partially hidden by well worn rubber, caused his cock slowly to grow. He never had much intimate experience with girls, never mind a fully fledged woman. His legs quickly crossed to hide his shame. The boy's yellow eyes stared at the things-much too shy to massage another person, much less a member of the opposite sex. But the woman is undoubtedly waiting on it and he <b>DEFINITELY</b> doesn't want to get on her bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whether he likes it or not. So with that thought lingering in his mind, the boy quickly dons the frontal part of both his tee and over shirts collar as a protective mask. A flimsy line of defense against the almost guaranteed malignant malodor these broad things have brewed in the hot summer heat and heavy-duty activity. He is gonna take maximum precautionary efforts in this task! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know that you are just rubbing some feet right? And not handling something hazardous like asbestos ribbit.\" The woman couldn't help but bluntly pointed it out with an audible snort. Her flippant manner of speaking made Airi's eyes dart away from her face in mild unease, His fingers grasped the near the heel area of the dangling footwear that was to the left of him. Slowly sliding it upwards and revealing a long pink-tinged fleshy expanse littered with dust and small debris. The general shape of the lengthy thing is peculiarly curvaceous due to the high arch they possess. Visibly they other appeared to be shiny due to being quite...moist. So moist that...were some type of slimy <i>stuff</i> just glistening in the adjacent sunlight coming from the windows. There were translucent trails of it still connected to the top-side of the now vacant slide exactly on the deep imprint of where her foot once rested at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what the hell is that!!?\" Airi hissed in utter alarm and disgust as he tosses the shoe aside like it was a fire. His face contorted as he felts his insides twist and turns like it's nobody's business. Should've brought those gloves. They would have been in handy, and not just for hiding fingerprints he can tell that much! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My quirk gives me the most of the abilities and aspects of an <i>frog</i>, and that concludes the ability to produces two additional types of sweat. Which is what you are seeing right now. One of them at least.\" The woman informs the young criminal as his face gets even greener and nose visibly scrunch disgusted at what he heard. She used to be quite embarrassed about this fact along with her more than ample feet when she was just a little girl. Only letting them be bare when necessary like a class assignment. But she eventually stopped giving damn about it in her senior year of high school and even finding some <b>great</b> amusement at certain people's reactions to the less than savory things her quirks allow her to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, no not Airi but <b>you</b>, see what is she getting at here right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what is the matter? Don't tell me that my <i>little</i> old feet were enough to make the neighborhood thief shake in his boots? <i>Ribbt</i>\" The shift in her voice's tone were quite subtle, Airi can tell that she was very much mocking him, hell even the way she <i><u>ribbited</u></i> sounded like a taunt. Turning his pale green skin into a burning red. Briefly, he can see her face from the space of the long first toes of and right and the semi-clear gunk in the crevices. There he can see what had to be small but definite smirk before the toes suddenly scrunched together. Making small <b>*definite*</b> squelching sound that made him flinched in great horror.\"If you gonna be staring at me with those oh so <i>scary </i> eyes of yours, I will be afraid I would have to do something more forceful like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Like what you going to do huh? Amphibian <i><u><b>bitch</b></u></i>.\" Airi is normally quite nice and passive, but even he has his limits. As shown as his feathered yet scaly tail became prickly and while his pupils quietly morph into thin slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...like you'll be scraping the filth out of <b>ALL</b> my shoes and make them spotless with those diminutive toothpicks you call fangs. And then I will see if frog's mucus does have healing properties if you <b><i>ever</i></b> decide to talk to me like that again.\" Just like that, Her's tone became glacial as she slips off her right sandal and uses just the first two toes to quite literally lift him mid-air like he weights like <b>nothing</b> by grabbing the back of his neck, a mere <u>hint</u>of her strength and he can tell she wasn't trying the slightest. All of his fiery anger died down to mere smoke at the sight of those abyssal black pools look back at his terrified yellow ones. \"Now. Do. We. Have An. Understanding. <b><i><u>Little Boy</u></i></b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every single syllable oozing cold dead anger, the boy could only quietly nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes <i>Ma'am</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy, maybe you learn yet.\" With that ordeal squashed, the woman quietly lowers her leg back down to the footrest. Gently placing him back on the footstool. Her right foot returning to its twin, \"Now then <b>rub</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich that he did, hurriedly clasping his hands at her instep which made them look kinda dwarf-like in comparison. Carefully. pressing his both of his thumbs up against smooth calluses and tensed overworked muscles coated with various liquids and dirt. The action causes the once intimidating woman to throw her head back against the chair and soft moan. Surprising the boy greatly, but he didn't dwell on it as his hands were kneading away like there no tomorrow. The muscles in his arms were hard at work as hands did their massage. Were each hand pull and stretch on the massive ball of each foot. Before he began lightly pounding at the much rougher yellowish heels, almost like he having a full-on brawl with the piece of foot flesh. The woman didn't wince in pain but instead, she bit her bottom lip feverishly as her long fingers began to squeeze the armrests tightly. All the while Airi began to do the fourth act of the massage where he grasps the long wet toes. Three of the lesser toes were so big that he can fully wrap a single hand around a singular digit. While the pinkie toe covers roughly a quarter of his palm. While with both of the big toes he can <i>hardly</i> wrap his fingers around it. The sound of joints popping and something wet squashing he carefully pulls the extremities. The woman quickly sucking her breath in as she felt her eye getting heavy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of repeating this arduous task. The boy rests his weary body and removes his now incredibly sore forelimbs from the now more tender walls of flesh. Hands all dirty with dust, sweat, and <i>weird</i> sweat. Feeling all gross and exhausted to continue it. His eyes lay upon the hero, and there she lays sprawled all out on his recliner with her hair looking slightly frazzled. In the process of going to sleep with a blush on her face. At that moment he realizes that A. She must have been like <i>extremely</i> exhausted and stressed from her job as a hero. Which made him feel pretty ashamed for not only breaking in her home but going so far as to insult her. And B....he is rock hard. He just realizing this now as his dick slowly throbs and aches as he stared at her weary form. Hormones were a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>' And it's not that she isn't sex-I-I mean <u>pretty</u>. Just kinda strange looking...but DEFINITELY not ugly looking. Her feet aren't either despite been so...imposing'</i> Airi's mind muses as he places a finger between her big and second toes. Tentatively rubbing against the wettest area of her right foot in an up and down matter until quickly returning the hand to his side as she mumbled out a giggle. Making his cheek went from red to pink and dick making a notable tent in his trousers causing his legs quickly cross. Making a growing desire to kiss her feet becomes readily apparent in his psyche which combats the need to keep his \"mask\" up to prevent whatever aroma these feet have from wafting to his otherwise defenseless nose and mouth. He has been breathing through his mouth the entire massage. An impressive feat yes, but his reluctance to her feet was honestly lighting it up despite his shock. But he doesn't want to add sexual misconduct to r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of illegal activities either as mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two minutes of internal debating and conflict, he...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The device's cover was styled, surprise surprise, after rather cute cartoon frog on a lily pad. If the situation wasn't so dire Airi would have chuckled. The woman wordlessly pointed at a chair. Her circular eyes just narrowed ever slightly, indicating that she was not joking or asking.  Making the girl take a beeline for it. Nearly toppling it over in her rush. Earning an unimpressed glance from the woman and a shake of her head as she walked out the living room through the front door. From the curtain-covered windows, Airi could see the faint black silhouette of the woman. Faintly she can hear words- the conversation between the hero and whoever she is calling. She can't what exactly they are saying, but definitely wasn't good for her.Even though she agrees that what she did what was a serious crime, but she could help but some anger directed towards the older female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't dwell as the frog like woman returned with the faintest hint of a smile. Making Airi squirm in the sight, now she felt her heart threatening to burst out her chest. The woman...is a hero <i>right</i> and heroes,..don't torture criminals <i><b>right</b></i>? The sight of the girl made the hero's smile faltered. A younger, more emotional part of herself can't help but pity Airi's state. But the larger, more stern part of herself-one that had to deal with countless trials and terrible acts of evil-was not moved. In fact, she was adamant on punishing her. What she is doing is not only illegal but highly dangerous. She could've gotten herself killed if she entered the <b>wrong</b> person's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sit in silence for an unknown amount of minutes...until the door vibrated as someone knocked on it.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">What's up gamers, it's ya' favorite degenerative weeboo, Weeb lord here. Giving ya' yet other interactive where you live out your perverted fantasies through an overpowered self insert and go on adventures with your waifu from both animation and video games! But with one little twist... your waifu ain't a little girl with daddy issues with hopes and dreams anymore. No, in these tales, your favorite character are now fully grown ladies, disillusioned by the world at large and probably won't put with half of the bullshit they put up with when they were younger.  This story also goes for characters who are already that age. Like Adult Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun! ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No short chapters! Keep a minimum of two to four paragraphs at a minimum. I will give leniency on some chapters but don't continuously make them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Unlike the rest of other my interactives, Sexual content is more heavily referenced and will mostly happen depending on the things. And actual super \"lewd\" stuff may or not transpire in later chapters. But being constantly naked is which is a no-no.<br>\r\n3.2. Full-blown sex and actual romance will be something will you have to develop a relationship with an another character. Crushes can be formed easily, however, on the protagonist end of things , and can act as a starting point for it.<br>\r\n3.3, Things like \"hands-on\" teasing, hand jobs, and etc are fine though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Feet are the main kink of the story. So No toilet stuff, Major Weight gain, major limb expansion or inflation, super-hardcore femdom, or vore of any kind. That goes for any kink that goes against the flow of the story. But to nature of the stuff and themes of the story , shrinking/growing will be very much allowed, and encouraged! That goes for a minor to medium muscle growth and such too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. My eternal rule: Not every foot have to smell like a cheese factory, nor do they smell like a field of daisies. Same goes for the feet's size and texture. Not every person is tall or is short. Not every girl has watermelon for tits. Or an ass that claps away thunderstorms. Variety is the spice of life, get what I'm saying. All to make feel a little more realistic and \"human\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Your choices matter in the long run and shape the main character's personality and also develop the others. And remember while you are free to do whatever you want. But remember, you aren't free from the consequences of said actions.<br>\r\n6.1. The protagonist can be a boy or girl. and their general personality is up to you<br>\r\n6.2. Their age would...be vague. All I would say that they will be in somewhere in between of being fifteen to eighteen years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please keep the influx of choice chapters on the relatively low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Keep it, first person or second person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. No sudden abrupt endings and deaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Remember all the chosen characters and such are fully grown adults that are in their mid to late thirties,forties,or even early fifties! Make them act their age and true to their personalities to a certain degree. But interpretations and exploration on them and how they react to things are not only allowed but is ENCOURAGED since alot of time has pass since their younger days. Not to mention\u2026it's kinda one of the main themes of the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n11.  The protag isn't blind to a characters other \"assets\" *eyebrow wiggle*. But be warned, this isn't pure smut(and it can be kinda close). But playful mocking, outright bullying, and teasing is very much allowed and is encouraged. ;D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. You can only play, confront, and interact with female characters. No chapters with the character having a lewd interaction with males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. Most of the characters the protag will encounter would have trained above and beyond their capabilities in canon, Making them leagues above their young counterparts. Meaning if the protag tries to fight them...well good luck to them lol. They would need all they can get,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. The most important rule\u2026is to have fun, and get creative with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. Second most important rule; no crossovers! Keep it in the show.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>.-<br>\r\nTo bring some life in the story, I will give out two to three thousand gift points for quality chapters!</b></font></td>",
