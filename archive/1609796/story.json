They were to meet in front of the Parsons household before heading to the mall, to be exact, but with an hour to kill the parties were divided up and attending to other matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdentical twins Katlyn and Suzanne were tasked with cleaning up the attic, as instructed to them by their parents through their older sister Hannah.  Of course, they entered the attic much against their will due to the bout of regression (in Katlyn's case) and diapering (in Suzanne's) that had accompanied their last visit to the place with the blowing of a mighty wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel, the girl tall enough she often was described to others as a tree, found herself standing on a bridge near her home watching for trains to pass nearby.  It was a decent little use of time, so long as it did not go on for hours, and given the girl's studious nature she could easily get lost in observing the local birds or something of that nature instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Wendy.  Given the way the blond was prone to walking everywhere, barefoot, and checking out anything that caught her attention, the huge Pokemon fan with blue-tipped bangs and blue-streaked hair often had to leave early for her destinations.  As it stood, she basically slumped through the streets taking up as much time as possible in getting to the twins' home.</span></div></div>",

And after a mysterious wind blew through the area, that had had some very embarrassing consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy and Katlyn wound up reduced to infants, with no apparent knowledge of their former selves.  The worst part of that, Katlyn personally thought looking back (as she could remember now that she was her normal, teenage self), was when things returned to normal and resulted in her being seen in nothing but a pair of panties by the short little Pokemon fanatic with a great big crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzanne, though, had wound up with the mind and continence of an infant without losing any years off her body with the move.  Then there was Mel, who made it through most of the affair unharmed and babysitting then was eventually hit. . . only to become nothing but more maternal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group consensus was that she got off both the easiest and the hardest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You don't think, um. . .\" Suzanne bashfully crossed her arms behind her back, before asking, \"I-It'll happen again, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right about at that moment that. . .</span></div></div>",

Dust and papers flew up and flutterred when the wind hit, blowing through the twin's hair and billowing around their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK!\" Hopping to her sister's side, Suzanne let out a terrified shiver, only calming down when her twin put an arm around her. \"K-Katie, did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... Yeah, it's okay...\" While Katlyn gripped her sister's arm tightly with one hand, her free one reached back to touch her own bottom, \"Whew... Okay, good news is I'm not wearing a diaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did a little to take the edge off.... Tittering, Suzanne checked for that herself before glancing around the room. Everything seemed to be the same, at least as far as she could tell... \"Do... Do you think we imagined it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we could've both imagined the same thing at the same time...\" Katlyn began to walk slowly, cautiously through the attic, hands spread out wide... \"I don't feel a draft or anything, do you? There's no window...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" That was true... following close behind her twin, Suzanne remarked, \"So... You don't think there's a ghost or something in here, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatlyn was about to open her mouth to say no when she shut it again. Squirming, she replied, unsure, \"Not my first guess, no.\"</span></div></div>",

Huh.\" So it was. Almost unable to distinguish due to all the dust covering it, jamming up its cracks from the wall.

She looked up and blushed. \"Um, y-yeah. Just inspecting the floor here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave a small sneeze and then she scrambled to her feet, scattering diapers across the floor. Katlyn snickered a little and asked, \"You sure?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzanne rubbed the back of her neck. \"Yeah. The, uh. . . the diapers broke my fall. What were those doing there, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatlyn shrugged. \"Who knows? Let's search. Oh, and. . .\" Katlyn stopped for a second to giggle almost childishly, \"Watch your step!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzanne brushed some dust off her skirt and frowned, \"Um. . .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatlyn reached a small dresser next to one of the cribs and opened the top drawer. \"Hey, look at this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside it were pacifiers of all sizes, shapes and colors, all dust free and gleaming. Katlyn grabbed a black, heart-shaped one and admired it as though she was thinking of buying it. \"Now that's pretty cool, I guess. For a pacifier.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzanne, meanwhile, stumbled over to a closet on the far end of the room. She threw open the door, and got covered in a puff of dust. \"Aw, really?\" She coughed and fanned the dust away. Inside the closet were teen sized onesies, dresses, and jumpers. A small rack on the side displayed multicolored rows of bonnets. She pulled a green one off and looked at it, tossing it towards Katlyn. \"L-Look at this. . .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatlyn snatched it out of midair. \"Hm. Weird.\" She fitted it on her head and tied it loosely, glancing at a mirror near the changing table.

We should go. . .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatlyn laughed. \"Are you kidding? This is pretty cool!\" She leaned down and picked up one of the diapers. \"Heh.

Wendy wouldn't be home at this time of day, she'd more likely be walking around the town or visiting her favorite video game store or something. She might have her cell-phone on her, but the diapered girl would have to go back inside to use the phone and now that she was out she didn't want to risk getting caught and made to go back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough that would likely get her diaper changed, thought Suzanne bitterly, shuddering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, wishing she wasn't wearing a poopy diaper wouldn't fix this, she told herself quietly. No, she had to go find either Wendy or Mel. Just walk to Wendy's and she'd probably find her on the way. The Play N Game store she usually went to was on the way to her house, so maybe she'd find her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she set out though, she found walking in her diaper was a gross affair. Every step awkwardly shifted and squished the poo awkwardly against her bottom, sending shivers up and down her spine as she went down the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie's upstairs,\" she murmured under her voice. \"Sh-She's stuck there, gotta get help...\" She couldn't leave her sister like this.</span></div></div>",

The onesie did a good bit to obscure it, but even then she could tell that her new, plastic underwear had become quite misshapen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was just due to a lack of company around or a need to keep her mind on track as she slowly waddled her way down the stairs, but Suzanne began to talk to herself as her eyes drifted forward. Unfortunately, though, her one-girl dialogue did not consist of ideas for her escape or where to go but rather the contemplation, \"Wow, d-doing doody in a d-diaper feels so w-weird. . . Hopef'ly soon I learn how to doody in my big-girl pants. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, that's not right. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the living room, Suzanne mulled over the various things wrong with that thought. Feeling just a bit worried, she pondered it over first by saying to herself, \"I know howta do that already. . . An' ya don't do them in your big-girl pants but the potty. . .\" Wait, wasn't she really supposed to go in something called the toilet? No, that didn't sound right, maybe it was the potty then. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, whatever. She could figure all of that out later. For now, Suzanne turned her focus back to the subject of leaving the house and going for help, as she reached the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, when she gave it a push, it didn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. . . Th-This is the door, right?\" Not that there was anyone around to answer her, but Suzanne was confused. Why wasn't it opening? \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when her eye caught something unfamiliar. It was a little object sticking out from the door; it looked like a round shape and shiny color that Suzanne didn't quite recognize - maybe a blue triangle? Was it a button? Should Suzanne push it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Best option I've got. . .\" the girl mumbled, before - very hesitantly - moving one finger forward and lightly poking the door knob. Only for nothing to happen. \"Um. . . N-Now what?\"</span></div></div>",

Something about seeing herself as normally having a clean diaper struck the girl as quite strange and out of place. \"B-But that's weird too. . . Why wouldn't it be clean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, whatever. Suzanne had bigger things to worry about, specifically if she could find a door that she could exit through. And upon reaching the kitchen, she quickly found herself confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a doorway, with two doors in place - one was open, revealing another, much smaller one behind it that the girl could see through. And no confusing button seemed to be in place on it - instead, there was only a handle that looked like it was obviously meant to be pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that settled that. At once, Suzanne moved toward the screen door, waddling toward it the best she could manage.

They were no longer in the mysterious attic nursery - now they found themselves surrounded by a pair of beds and a shelf full of many, many collectible toys, both tell-tale signs that they had somehow been relocated to their bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. . . It's a step-up from many of the things that could have been waiting for us when the lights came on, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzanne wasn't quite as positive about things.

That was easy enough to get out of her sister's hands in her present screaming state, and soon Miss Milly was thrown across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. . .\" That got rid of the stupid doll. Now Katlyn had something else to handle. Turning immediately, the older twin grabbed her sister by the arm, and pulled her out of the crib and into a super-tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sissy. . .\" Maybe it was the way Suzanne was acting, or maybe it was how the sound she was making genuinely sounded like an infant's crying, but Katlyn slipped back into her childhood nickname for her sister, \"I'm sorry. . . It's okay now. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm..\" Definately upset, Suzanne at least hugged her sister back, putting her mouth onto her shoulder gently. \"W-Were bein' muh-mean, Katey. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm sorry. . .\" Petting her twin's hair, Katlyn began walking her gently to the door, \"Hey, let's go back downstairs, and then we can get you something to drink okay?\"</span></div></div>",

While all Katlyn could do was debate whether or not to rush forward and kick the little demon, ultimately deciding that doing so for whatever reason felt like a very bad idea, Suzanne was silent for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did speak, though, it was to ask, \"K-Katey? What's goin' on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to make Katlyn turn to her sister, and sure enough she saw recognition. \"Oh... Wow...\" That got her smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it also got her distracted, which Miss Milly took as a cue to move in. Katlyn noticed the doll rushing at her only an instant before she felt her pants leg grabbed by it, and both the girl and the doll seemed to go still at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... K-Katey?\" Suzanne was instantly concerned. \"Katey, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply came only after Katlyn suddenly started to move once more, bending for a moment and then saying, \"Sissy, d-doed da doodies...\"</span></div></div>",

And while Suzanne knew it wasn't exactly right, it didn't feel totally wrong either. \"Hehe... Don't worry, Katey! It'll be our secret.\" Suzanne felt something on her shin, and glanced down to see Miss Milly hugging her leg, apparently wanting some love too. Kissing her sister on the cheek, Suzanne bent down and picked up her precious doll, \"Wanna hold Miss Millie while I changeya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-NOOO!\" Katlyn attempted to back away from the doll the moment it was offered, soon tripping over her own feet and landing with a loud \"splat.\" Two seconds later she let out a baby's wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Katey!\" Looking a little frantic, Suzanne's first reaction was to bend down and hug her sister.

I'll keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" He winked at her. \"See ya around, Mel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, David jogged off. Mel smiled after him, then groaned.

They're perfectly normal girls with nothing special about them, but they have a strange habit of stumbling into situations not of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brenda Nancy \"Wendy\" Flowers:</b> Wendy's tiny, but the oldest member of the group by a small margin. She's the hyper one, and truth be told has probably been mistaken more than once for being an eleven or twelve year old the other girls let hang out with them. She has known the twins since they were in sixth grade, and is head over heels for Katlyn - that doesn't stop her from teasing her constantly, though. She's quite the Pokemon fangirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Katlyn Ruby Parsons:</b> The older of the two twins. Katlyn's the Tsundere of the group, especially in regards to Wendy - she can be very snappy at her at times and gets annoyed with her quickly, but truth be told is rather fond of the girl and has been friends with her for so long for a reason. The main way Katlyn's softer side shows is through her relation with her younger sister, though - Katlyn can be very loving to her, and is also willing to snap someone's head off if they do anything to Suzanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Suzanne Vanessa Parsons:</b> The younger of the twins. Suzanne's a cheerful but easily startled girl, shy and slightly cowardly but one not many people could find real fault in. As the baby of the Parsons family (even if by only a few minutes), both Katlyn and the twins' older sister Hannah are pretty protective of her - which doesn't gel well with the fact that Wendy gets a kick out of spooking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Melanie Su \"Mel\" Nonez:</b> Mel's the smart one. She's the youngest of the group by about six months, but one wouldn't know it from looking at how tall she is compared to the twins at average height and the tiny Wendy. She wears contacts and is generally a very composed individual, but she does have a certain dry wit that doesn't come out much (though not to the degree of Katlyn).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Notice</b><br>\r\nOppur Town is intended to be a family-friendly affair, and so there is to be no profanity, and nothing overtly sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things involving gender changing are perfectly acceptable. So long as things don't lead into talking about new genitalia or what have you, that is an accepted and welcome possibility.</div></td>",
