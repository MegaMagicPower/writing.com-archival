It had no thoughts of its own, no will, even no conscious. It simply obeyed parameters and followed them, obeying its masters. Its escape had led to the realization that, it was a waste of time for its masters. Months of planning and engineering had created it, a cybernetic skeleton that was filled to the brim with potential, only to be tossed aside as a rag doll would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned left as it past a long corridor, careful to not trigger an alarm, fearing it would become nothing but dust. Its heart beat quickly, if it had a heart. It processed all the information that it had gathered today, including the demise of his creator, for he had outlived his useful as well. Pity, it thought. Cyrus had done no harm, yet he had to be eradicated, for they feared that his creation would become their downfall, their demise. Finally, a faint light shone in the distance. It had escaped, it had been freed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething new, yet so familiar was in the cybernetic droid vision. The water ran black, full of intoxication; something so unfamiliar to the droid. Grabbing a sample of this water, it ran a test on the chemicals and the origins. As soon as the tests were complete, the droid sigh. \"Why do these humans depose of useful materials?\" It whispered inside of its head, trying to comprehend the lack of materialism value. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like endless, it had arrived in a urban area. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Originally intended as a project to control enemies, it has turned back against them. It has learned to adapt, to gain artificial intelligence. To think on its own, without a voice to guide it with reason; no way to differentiate the difference from right and wrong. It completes its own programming, not one that was set upon itself by someone else. The story begins after the creature has escaped its captivity and escaped to the world down below.</td>",
