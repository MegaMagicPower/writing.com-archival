After a short walk I entered the place to find gray walls and a low-key d\u00e9cor. There\u2019s no one else around, I thought. That\u2019s odd.<br>\r\nAs I walked in a man with dark hair came into the room. \u201cAh, you must be Miss. Danvers,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for accepting our invitation.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d<br>\r\nThe man extended his hand which I accepted. \u201cI\u2019m Quinn,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m the host here. Welcome to Dolcett; the hottest new restaurant in National City.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but why is this place empty,\u201d I asked. \u201cI know that this restaurant is new, but I heard that some of the city\u2019s most notable figures eat here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh well, it\u2019s a bit early for us,\u201d answered Quinn. \u201cWe wanted you to have a special experience, so we arranged for you to come in before the dinner crowd. Anyway, we\u2019re having a private party tomorrow for Thanksgiving. It should be something.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d I said.<br>\r\nQuinn led me to a table that an attractive blond woman was standing by. \u201cThis is Barbara,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cShe will be your waitress for the evening. If there\u2019s anything that you would like she will get it for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you like to start with,\u201d asked Barbara as Quinn pulled out the chair for me. \u201cAnything to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust a beer, please,\u201d I answered.<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Barbara.<br>\r\n\u201cI have to go but I\u2019ll see you again soon,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cEnjoy the meal.\u201d He turned and left as Barbara went through a door in the back of the room.<br>\r\nBarbara returned with a glass of beer on a tray. \u201cHere you go,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you need anything else don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d She placed the glass on the table.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said bringing the glass to my lips.<br>\r\nBarbara turned around and went back to the door in the back.<br>\r\nTime passed and I sat there waiting. I took out my phone. I should call James and ask how those pictures turned out. I looked at the screen. Weird. I can\u2019t get a signal.</span></div></div>",

Oh well, it\u2019s probably rude to make a call now even if I\u2019m the only one in the restaurant.<br>\r\nSoon, Barbara came back into the dining room. She had another beer on her tray.<br>\r\nI looked down at my glass which was basically empty. The waitress exchanged it for the fresh one on the tray.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t order another beer,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s on the house,\u201d said Barbara. She turned and walked away.<br>\r\nThat\u2019s odd, I thought. They\u2019re certainly making a big fuss over me. I started drinking the beer.<br>\r\nA few minutes later, I was starting to get impatient. They haven\u2019t even asked me what I want to eat. I looked around. It can\u2019t be because they\u2019re busy. I\u2019m the only one here.<br>\r\nI sipped my beer as I continued to wait. I thought about using my x-ray vision to see what was keeping them in the kitchen but decided against it. They deserve their privacy.<br>\r\nI checked my phone then I held it up in the air again. As I did so I started to feel woozy. What was that? I looked at the beer in front of me. It can\u2019t be because of the beer. I can\u2019t get drunk.<br>\r\nI sat there looking at the doors in the back that probably led to the kitchen. I finished my drink and checked my phone to find that I still couldn\u2019t get a signal.</span></div></div>",

The meat\u2019s ready.\u201d<br>\r\nThe doors to the kitchen opened and Bruce and Dimitri; two of my coworkers rolled a cart in to the dining room.<br>\r\nKara was rolled into the kitchen. A woman named Claire removed her shoes. Ivan took off her glasses and pulled her shirt up over her head. The S of her Supergirl costume was revealed but no one was surprised.<br>\r\nDimitri pulled the red/blue top off her along with her cape. He dropped them on to the floor. Kara was wearing a plain white bra. Ivan grabbed it and tore it off her revealing her breasts.<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful with that,\u201d said Ivan; Dolcett\u2019s owner and my boss. He reached down to pick up the clothes off the floor. \u201cMr. Luther wants these saved.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that the Sleep Kryptonite worked,\u201d I said. I was standing off to the side watching everyone work. Claire was pulling down Kara\u2019s pants.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mr. Luther has a number of surprises for tomorrow night,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cSpeaking of which, we need to get moving to get things ready.\u201d<br>\r\nClaire removed Kara\u2019s red boots and quickly pulled down her red skirt. The only thing remaining on her was her white panties which Dimitri quickly ripped off.<br>\r\nI went back to the stockroom. There were some special spices that the chief wanted if we were going to serve a world-famous superhero for dinner.</span></div></div>",

As they did, I noticed two figures moving above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s starting to wake up,\u201d said a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes opened and I saw a young woman with brown hair standing over me. She looked like an ordinary girl who you might see on a college campus. I then noticed an older man standing next to her. He didn\u2019t have any gray hair, but his features were a little worn making him look a bit distinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man leaned over and before I could stop him, he inserted a syringe into my left arm. I felt a stinging sensation. Is it actually going in, I wondered. That\u2019s impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strange, warm feeling coursing through me body. I then closed and opened my eyes again as I was still feeling drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood back. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Ivan,\u201d said the man. \u201cI\u2019m the owner of Dolcett and you\u2019re the main course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, I wondered again. I realized just then that I couldn\u2019t feel my clothes on me. I spotted myself out of the edge of my vision. I was naked on a cold surface. I tried to sit up in shock, but I couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Claire,\u201d Ivan said to the woman. \u201cThe injection should keep her still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart started to race. \u201cWhat the hell is going on,\u201d I demanded. I hoped that I sounded more forceful that I felt.</span></div></div>",

He walked out of sight. Claire began brushing my leg with the glaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d I cried. I desperately tried to move but my body wouldn\u2019t respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, you\u2019re going to be eaten no matter what you do,\u201d said Claire. She worked her way down to my foot. The bristles of her brushes went between my toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not meat,\u201d I cried desperately. \u201cI am not to be eaten! I am a human being!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not a human. You are an alien also known as animal, an space animal. Therefore, you are meat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to breath more rapidly as I put more force in trying to move. My arms, my legs wouldn\u2019t listen to me. They just laid there as if I wasn\u2019t being prepared to be cooked alive. Claire went to work on my other leg. She applied the glaze on to me with gentle strokes in an almost loving manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ivan sent me to help you with the glaze,\u201d said a woman with short brown hair who strolled into my view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are more brushes in the drawer,\u201d said Claire. \u201cYou can take her left side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d said the woman. I heard the sound of a drawer being opened as Claire neared my private area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re actually going to go there,\u201d I asked mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we need to get the glaze everywhere,\u201d said Claire. \u201cIn fact, Sophie, while don\u2019t you help me do her legs. They could use another coat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Sophie applied large amounts of the glaze on to my legs. Eventually they put down their brushes and rubbed it in with their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle bursts of pleasure coursed through me as they worked. I started to breath rapidly again as they stroked my thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire\u2019s hands started to touch my vagina followed by Sophie\u2019s. I tried desperately not to show how good it felt as they rubbed the glaze in to my private area. They kneaded and pounded the spot. Eventually I couldn\u2019t help but pant and desperately hope that they didn\u2019t hear me.</span></div></div>",

I took some more glaze from the bowl and applied it to the area. I made the effort to get some inside her. I continued applying it as Sophie did the areas that connected her torso with her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued working for a few more minutes. \u201cThis is taking forever,\u201d said Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got to get her in to the oven soon,\u201d I said. I looked over at the doors that led to the back. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d I called. \u201cWe could use some help. Bruce, Cassandra, Kate, all you guys. Give us a hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce entered the kitchen followed by Kate and Cassandra. \u201cYou called,\u201d Bruce asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, can you take the top half,\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Bruce dipping his hands in to the bowl. He was followed by the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Kara was being rubbed by all our hands. Bruce immediately took her breasts, really working the glaze in. He was focusing so much on the two mounds that I was sure that he was doing it for his pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands were rubbing her stomach, shoulders, arms, and chest. Her body was really beginning to shine. I looked down at Kara\u2019s whore hole and they seemed to shine the brightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan entered the room with Barbara, Quinn, and Dimitri behind him. \u201cI heard you,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cWe need her in the oven by 2 so everyone join in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour more pairs of hands were added, and it seemed like that no place on Kara\u2019s body that wasn\u2019t being touched. I could\u2019ve sworn that I saw her blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a few more minutes. \u201cHow are you going to do it,\u201d Kara said suddenly. Her voice was flat and there was a look on her face that made it seem like she accepted what was going to happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will be roasted like a pig,\u201d answered Ivan. He grabbed one of her breasts and shook it. \u201cYou practically baste yourself. You will be a dish unlike any other, an oven roasted alien for humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to rub the glaze in to her flesh. My hand seemed to slide along her skin. I checked the bowl and we were starting to run low. \u201cShould I make more,\u201d I asked Ivan as I showed it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think there\u2019s plenty on her,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe will cook well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara was silent, staring up at the ceiling. Soon the alien will be on the table for the Luthor\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce rubbed some glaze on Kara\u2019s face. She closed her eyes and coughed a little as some got in her nose. \u201cCareful,\u201d warned Ivan. \u201cI want the gaze to go on evenly. She needs to be perfect. The Luthors are paying for the best dining experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan looked over everyone as they worked. \u201cGet every crevice,\u201d he said. \u201cMake sure the glaze goes on evenly. Don\u2019t waste any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie started rubbing Kara vagina again. I could\u2019ve sworn that I saw it reacting to her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI joined her and together we apply yet another coat to her sex. My fingers went into her folds, almost slipping in because the area was so covered by the glaze. Making sure that no one was looking I took a breath of the glaze covered vagina. It smelled like a family cookout, but it also had something else mixed in, something I couldn\u2019t identified. I played a little with the outside of it. It seemed to respond to the teasing. I looked over at Sophie, but she was working on a thigh. I decided to go back inside Kara. I stoke my finger in and out a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Bruce and I noticed that he was back at Kara\u2019s breasts. He squeezed them a little and then pushed them around. He then pinched her nipples. After a bit he slide a hand between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate lifted an arm and started applying glaze to Kara\u2019s underarm. She was then running her hand down her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra was doing most of the same things to Kara\u2019s other side. She reached over to Kara\u2019s thigh and took some glaze from it and applied it to her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the glaze to be spread evenly,\u201d said Ivan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was running low,\u201d said Cassandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone continued working.

It\u2019s especially design to neutralize your powers and prevent you from escaping.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI looked into the oven and thought about what it represented; my fate. The weight of what was going to happen seemed to press down on me. I was moved closer to the oven and began to feel the heat from it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nClaire leaned over to me. \u201cEven without taking a bite I can tell that you\u2019re delicious,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are this delicious space animal to be eaten as food.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBut before that you have to be cooked alive like an oven roasted pig,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cSo let us begin.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nClaire grabbed my shoulders while Ivan grabbed my feet. Together they lifted me off the table and swung me over to a large tray that was already in the oven. Ivan then shut the door which gave a thud that announced the beginning of my end.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrom the start, the heat of the oven pressed down on me. I once again tried to move but I knew that it was pointless. I was still paralyzed by the Gold Kryptonite.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTime passed as sweat ran along my entire body mixing with the glaze. The red light of the bulbs was almost blinding. All I could do was looked straight up at the dull metal ceiling of the oven.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA few minutes later I felt sweat run in to my private area. I desperately wanted to wipe it off because it was not only ticking me but generating pleasure like before when they were rubbing me. My breathing quicken as thoughts that I didn\u2019t want ran through my head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe heat started to make it difficult to think. Despite that thoughts of my family, my mom, my sister; Alex, went through my head. I also thought of my friends, my coworkers at Catco. Of course, I also thought of Kal-El; my cousin, who was going to be alone when I was gone. I think tears joined my sweat in running down my face. I wished that I could wipe them away to.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMinutes passed and I started to notice something. There was a smell. It reminded me of pork, and it was delicious. My heart sank as I realized it was me that I was smelling. RAO, I thought. I smell delicious and I Taste delicious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI tried to think of something else, to focus on my memories of my time on Earth but my senses were assaulted. I tried to calm down, but it was no use. The horror of what was happening to me threaten to overwhelm my mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLike the heat, the smell was always present. As the time continued to pass, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how I smelled like a delicious ham. How can I think such a thing? The smell of my cooking flesh is delicious?</span></div></div>",

For all intents and purposes, I really was just a slab of meat being cooked for dinner. I could actually feel my juices, including the glaze covering me, sizzling, helping to cook my whole body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy private area was becoming more soaked with sweat. I so wanted to dry it. I felt heat from it that didn\u2019t come from the oven. Little beads of sweat ran in to it teasing me with small jolts of pleasure. I could only lay there helpless as I was torment by this assault.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI looked up at the ceiling. The metal was made red by the bulbs. I smell delicious. I\u2019m being cooked alive and I smell delicious. People are going to eat me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe heat made me moan softly. I somehow felt what little strength I had leave me. For a moment it felt like I wasn\u2019t even connected to my body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI laid there, a piece of meat getting golden brown. Strange thoughts went my head. I wonder if I taste like I smell. Do all kryptonians taste like pork? Does Kal-El? Where is he? When will I be eaten? I smell delicious. Do I taste like that?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMore time passed and I continued to stare at the ceiling. It didn\u2019t look the same as it did before. Briefly I thought I could see patterns in the metal but when I focused on it there weren\u2019t any. Where did those weird lines go? I tried to turn my head to look elsewhere but couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s right, I can\u2019t move. A bead of sweat ran down my leg and fell to the bottom of the oven. I heard a little sizzle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSometime later, my eyes started to blink rapidly. Must be drying out. Every part is dry really. Will it affect the way I taste? I still smell good. I smell like pork. Do all kryptonians smell like pork? I smell so good.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI felt a bead of sweat run down my cheek. It\u2019s so hot. Hot. I\u2019m being cooked alive. I\u2019m being cooked but I smell delicious. It was kind of funny. I just laid there, and it got hotter and hotter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI tried to think about my time on Earth, but it was hard. The only thing that I could think about was the heat and that delicious smell. I smell good. I\u2019m going to be dinner. Those people are going to eat me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSweat ran all along my body. It was like a shower. I still smelled delicious. I tried to move but I couldn\u2019t. It tickled in between my legs. It also felt hot, but I felt hot everywhere. I looked out of the corners of my eyes and saw the red bulbs. They were like suns. On Krypton the sun is red. I thought about Krypton, but I could only remember a few things. More sweat ran down my face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI lost track of time. Sometime later the door to the oven opened. Ivan looked in. \u201cIt\u2019s time for another coat,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe rack that I was on was pulled out. Ivan stroked along my body with a brush. I felt the glaze dripped down me. He went along my leg and then did my foot. He gave my toes a few strokes and then went to my other leg. He then started putting glaze on my chest.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming along quite nicely,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cYou\u2019ll taste delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe then did my arms and finally my face. He put the brush and glaze on a shelf and then I was pushed back into the oven. The door was closed and there was only the heat and the smell again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI . . . taste delicious,\u201d I said. \u201cI taste delicious.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve shown promise here as an employee and this new duty could be your way up in this restaurant.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Sir,\u201d I said. It\u2019s actually happening. I put in the time and now I\u2019ve getting noticed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThe Luthors will be here in a few hours,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cI going to see how the dining room is coming along you check to make sure that the floral arraignments are done. We need to make sure all the details of the dinner are perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get on it right away,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI left Ivan\u2019s office and took a right. After going through the double doors, I was in the kitchen. I went through it casting a glance at the oven where the alien meat was being cooked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n(Kara Danvers\u2019s POV)<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was still so hot. It felt like I was wrapped in a heavy sweater only worst. I so desperately wanted to move.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy sweat was mixing with the glaze coating me. I felt my skin being burned but knew that my healing ability would restore it. There would be no easy end for me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI looked at the ceiling. I thought about Alex and images of her face went through my mind. I thought about her doing different things. Suddenly the images in my mind lost their shape and they started to swirl around. My thoughts were strange. I just laid there as these strange thoughts went through my head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI thought I could see those patterns in the ceiling again but then they were gone. Where did they go? It\u2019s metal but I could\u2019ve sworn I saw patterns there. I thought about a book that I read but the words seemed to run together. Every thought seemed strange. I laid there becoming confused.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTime passed, I don\u2019t know how long, and some sweat got into my eye. It stunned and I really wanted to wipe it away, but I couldn\u2019t. I just laid there feeling the stinging feeling. It won\u2019t stop. None of it will stop, the stinging, the heat, and the smell! The smell was still always there even when I was feeling the stinging in my eye, I couldn\u2019t ignore the delicious smell.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI smell delicious, so delicious. I smell like a pig that\u2019s going to be eaten. I can smell that delicious aroma.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy breathing quicken. A new wave of heat struck me. It just kept going on and on. There was no end.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI looked up at the ceiling again. I suddenly imagined myself out of the oven. I was floating in space, but I wasn\u2019t really flying. It was as if I was weightless. I floated there as I saw these strange shapes and colors. Everything seemed to lose its form. Confusing thoughts and images went through my mind. Some part of me wondered what they were about but I mostly just let them go without thinking about them too much.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI blinked and I was back in the oven. I saw the ceiling above me. How long? It seems like it was a long time ago but how long? How long have I been in here?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI laid there just looking up at the ceiling as the heat kept pressing down, it and that smell. I tried to ignore it, but it was so delicious. I smell delicious. I smell so very delicious. The aroma kept assaulting and tempting me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI tried to breathe through my mouth, but the apple was still in it. I had forgotten about it. The only thing that I could focused on was the heat and the smell.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI gave a quiet groan and continued to breath through my nose. The smell reached my nostrils again. It was still so delicious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI looked around as best I could. The red from the bulbs seemed to blur everything making it all just the color red. I laid there with nothing but red around me. I was in an ocean of heat, red, and that delicious smell.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSometime later, the door to the oven opened. Ivan pulled me out. \u201cTime for another coating,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe stroked my leg with the brush. \u201cYou\u2019re turning a nice brown,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is going well.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI smell delicious,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIvan looked at me.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI smell delicious,\u201d I said. \u201cI smell delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh, how sad,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cYou mind is starting to go. Oh well, it\u2019s not like what an alien thinks is of any great importance. You are meat and you are to be eaten, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI smell delicious,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYes, you do,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cYou are a delicious pig to be eaten by humans on Thanksgiving.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe finished moving the brush around on me. There was more of that sweet-smelling stuff on my body. He spent a lot of time between my legs. It felt nice but a little strange. I made some noises as he kept putting that stuff on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan stopped and looked at me. \u201cBack you go, Meat,\u201d he said. He then pushed me back into the oven with the red, the heat, and the smell.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe door closed and I was back inside. \u201cI am a delicious pig to be eaten by humans on Thanksgiving,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTime passed but I stopped watching it. I just laid there. Hot. It\u2019s hot. So hot. Those red lights are making it hot.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI looked around with my eyes, but it was hard because I couldn\u2019t move. There was metal everywhere. It\u2019s a big metal box, like a refrigerator. Refrigerators are supposed to be cold. This is hot. This is not right. It\u2019s so hot. It\u2019s like a reverse refrigerator. I\u2019m the alien meat in the reverse refrigerator. Hot. Hot. Hot. In a metal box like the ship I came to Earth in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThese strange thoughts went through my mind as I tried to move again. Can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t because of the Gold Kryptonite. I just lie here. I just lie here being cooked. I\u2019m the alien meat being cooked for Thanksgiving. I\u2019ll just lie here, be cooked, and then I\u2019ll be eaten.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI tired to think of Alex, my friends, and my family but all I could think about was the heat, the smell, and that I was meat. I\u2019m an alien roasted pig that is going to be eaten. It\u2019s so hot. It\u2019s hot to cook me. I\u2019m being cooked. I\u2019m in this big metal box and I\u2019m being cooked alive! I\u2019m being cooked alive and I smell delicious! I smell so delicious!</span></div></div>",

They sound like snakes. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a bunch of snakes below me. Snakes that want to eat me but it\u2019s the Luthors that will eat me, Luthor snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the ceiling and I tried to find the patterns, but I couldn\u2019t. All I saw was red, red, red. It was like there was blood everywhere. The walls looked like they were paint with blood or barbecue sauce. Was it barbecue sauce that they put on me? No, it was chili glaze. What color was it? I<br>\r\n <br>\r\ndidn\u2019t notice. All I noticed was that they were all touching me, and it made me felt strange. Did I like it? I don\u2019t know. It felt good but weird. I didn\u2019t like it when they touched me, did I?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI wondered about it as I felt my skin burned. It healed but I knew that it would be burned again. It would just keep on burning then healing then burning. Over and over again. It\u2019ll never end. Over and over again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe door opened and Ivan pulled me out. \u201cIt\u2019s time for another coating,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIvan took out the brush and began stroking me on the thigh. He made long, smooth trails of the glaze. He went down me leg slowly. Eventually he got to my foot and brushed it like he did before. After a little bit he started on my other leg.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThe meat is coming along,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cSoon the pig will be ready to be eaten.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI am delicious,\u201d I said. For a moment it sounded strange to hear me say that. I laid there wondering why.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYes, you are,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cYou are a delicious pig to be eaten for Thanksgiving.\u201d He finished with my leg and then did my foot.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSoon Ivan was done with the foot and leaned in towards the spot between my legs. \u201cThis area is coming along very nicely,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to take special care of it.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIvan stroked the spot with the brush. I felt a jolt of pleasure shoot up in me. He painted the spot with a lot of glaze. He made sure to get every inch of the spot.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter getting the outside of it covered, he put down the brush. He then reached over with his hands. He rubbed the spot, working the glaze in like Claire and Sophie did. I felt things that I did not feel often. This feels good, right, I wondered. The feelings shot through me from the spot.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEventually Ivan worked his fingers in to my hole. He stroked in and out like Claire did. My heart started to race. I then started to pant. Something in me felt strange like I shouldn\u2019t do that, but I couldn\u2019t think of why. All that I could think of was the heat, that I was to be eaten, and that smell.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIvan pulled out his finger and then opened my hole. He reached in and started to rub the glaze inside me. I couldn\u2019t help but pant loudly then. After a moment he stopped and let my hole close.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIvan leaned back and looked me over. \u201cYou are coming along,\u201d he said. \u201cSoon the meal will begin.\u201d He reached into the bowl and got some glaze.
