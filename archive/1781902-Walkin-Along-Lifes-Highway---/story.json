A tiny woman but a powerful influence in my life. She always wears dresses or skirt. I have never seen her in a pair of jeans. I remember that there was a time that she wore shorts in the summer but no more. Years and years and years ago. she might have donned a pair of slacks now and then but you would never know it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe likes things to match but has no fashion sense. She doesn't care. She wears what she likes and what is comfortable. She wears sweaters year round. She hates air conditioning. She only uses it in her apartment when she absolutely needs to so when she walks out into the buildings hallway, it is like stepping into a fridge. She does not go out without her sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crochets. In the winter, she wears an assortment of crochet hats that she has made herself. Folks like them. She made some for other folks when they have asked her to. She has made a couple for me.Again, they are not the latest fashion but they do have a uniqueness that makes up for that to some degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a little dog. She talks to him and she will tell you what he is thinking. She knows you know. They definitely have developed a relationship . . . responsive to each others moods. Sometimes they both want to be left alone. He will go under the bed. She might put him in the bedroom so she can have some private time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also has a budgy. She has almost always had a dog and a bird. This one is new to replace one that died.She talks to it and makes kissy noises. Most of her budgies have learned to say a few words here and there. And to do tricks that she has taught them. Give her time and she'll have this one doing it, too.</span></font></span></div></div>",

He walked with a slow gait and limped on his left leg which was mildly supported by a long, bright, wooden cane. He slowly crept toward the bench and sat next to me. He wore a dark brown button up shirt covered by an overcoat which was falling apart at the seams and seemed to provide no warmth or comfort so it must have simply been worn for emotional comfort or out of habit. He wore black slacks, which at one point may have fit him, but now the pant legs drearily hung below the ankles, partially covering the deep mahogany colored slip-ons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was frigid, with every deep breath his whole body shook; at the raise of a hand it shook with such ferocity that after a mere few seconds it must be returned to its nesting spot. His voice was gruff and deep and was filled with an underlying of kindness. His eyes were aged, just as the wrinkly skin upon his face, but still kept a hint of the youthful blue which had ruled there at one time. He spoke so quietly that I scarcely heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I asked him to repeat himself and he asked me with a gentleness that I have never heard repeated, \"How are you?\" To this day day i can not remember what I said, but I remember the words he spoke. How are you. I hear it repeated in my mind every time I sit on a bench and I sit and wait for the man with a gentle voice. I know deep in my heart I will never see him again but I wish more than anything to hear that kindness once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Her hair was beautiful and perfectly arranged, except on windy days. She did not seem to mind the wind blowing her hair. In fact, she enjoyed the wind and anything else that had to do with nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time she wore short or slacks. The only times she wore a dress was to Sunday services and funerals. She did not wear much makeup either. She wore lipstick on a daily basis, but the only time she wore anything more was Sunday services, funerals, and eating out with her husband or friends. Once a week her husband took her to her favorite restaurant and sometimes they invited me along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember the first time I went to her house, it was to help her with her computer. Her husband had bought her a computer and since she was the treasurer for her club, she wanted the books sit up in a spreadsheet. At the time she must have been about 70. I never did know precisely how old she was because she never said and never looked her age, but I do know that she met her husband somewhere around or before World War II.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enjoyed all outdoor activities, but she was especially fond of golf. She loved golf so much that she played alone. One day, after a game she fell as she returned to her car and broke her leg. Instead, of calling an ambulance or asking for help she drove herself to the hospital. That was what she told anyone who ask her how she broke the leg. Knowing her that was probably how it happened because refused to request help if she felt she could do something herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was an amazing woman. She was married to the same man for fifty years. She raised two children a boy and a girl. Then after her son and his wife divorced she raised her granddaughters. I still miss going to her house once a week to help her with her computer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My husband had first met this wonderful lady at his business. He is a sign maker and she had recently been in a fender bender where her back bumper had a small dent. It was a new car and she wanted something to cover it up for the time being. Thinking he could match the color of her car she went in to see what he could do.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I just happened to be there that day when she came in and had a talk with her. She was selling her house because her husband was in the veterans hospital close by and she was moving a couple towns over to be closer to him. At the time, my husband and I were searching for a house. She had offered us to go see it sometime which we promised we would. <br>\r\nAfter much debate the color of the car could not be matched perfectly so Dee came up with another idea, she is originally from New Zealand so she thought about putting a map of her county over the dent instead. My husband printed off a picture and placed it over the dent. She loved it! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I had seen Dee over the years coming into my place of work and getting coffee.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI like my coffee like I like my men, white and sweet.\u201d She would say then worry if she had offended anyone.

He wore his uniform with pride and it showed in his every action. He devoted his life to defending his country and protecting the ones he loves. I watched him sacrifice for the benefit of others time and time again. He served with integrity and honor. He gave willingly, with no thought of himself. He is the finest young man I have ever met.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the man is 50 years young. His name is Tom and he is still a handsome devil.

The wisest man who ever lived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told me he must go, his father was calling. I asked him when we could speak again. I told him I feared I would forget the things he had said.

I called for him but he was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke with a cry on my lips. I sat up in bed as the dream fell away. I grieved its loss. I looked at my hands but it was not there.

They don't always tell the truth anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is five foot four inches tall or about 163 centimetres if you are into metric.  Please note however that this is in bare feet.  Ella is seldom in bare feet because she likes to wear high heels. I'm not talking about those great big platform things but she usually wears a conservative three or four inch heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as to weight.  Asking a woman her weight is worse that asking her age.  I have the finger nail indentions on my arm to prove it.  Let us just say she is slender but does perhaps carry a few pounds on her backside.  Now I am not unhappy about that because I think its gives the perfect shape for a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is a fanatic about her skin.  I think she has every type of lotion ever made.  She also wears makeup but never looks like she has pasted it on.  A sort of natural look.  The lipstick is usually a pale pink unless she is dressing for a date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she is very much a woman of today she does have a few piercing in which she wears some interesting jewelry.  Three holes in each ear with a small little ring, a larger one inch ring and then a hanging four inch ring.  Her tongue is pierced and she has a red and white ball which seems to dance in her mouth as she talks.  The final piercing  is in her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I did not know her very well, I had seen her play the piano for the church choir and smiled at her a few times,but that's all I knew about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard about my situation, she came up to me and offered for me to stay at her house for no costs for as long as needed. I was shocked and surprised and very scared about her. I had no where else to go, so I shifted to her house. At first, I was shy and scared to talk or ask her anything, but soon we had become like two friends who had known each other for years together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spoke about various things, about life, her experiences and her days at my age now. She had not married and still lives as a single woman in that house, taking care of everything by herself. I asked her how does she manage life and reached so many years without anyone to be by her side. She said when God is there with her ,she does not want anyone else, He takes care of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of two weeks, when it was time to leave, neither of us wanted to go our separate ways but I had to leave, so she invited me to her friends house where we had dinner and a lovely time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis experience with her, has lifted my spirit to live a life with God as priority and also to make it a habit to talk and get to know elderly women..</span></div></div>",

I am asking for genuine interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says she wants to reconcile. She says she wants to connect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan she? Is she capable of coming out from behind the safety of that false identity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan she be real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></font></div></span></div></div>",

Her smile shines so bright it warms me like the sun on a winter's day. Her sandy colored hair is long, straight and hangs to her waist in waves of gold. Her tiny hand in mine feels soft and light as an angel feather. She is seven years old and calls me, 'Grammy.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy grand daughter saved my life. Let me explain, she saved my life by giving me a reason to live again. My world had become nothing but depression and pain. I was on the verge of giving up so often. Dakota was born and with her came a joy like I have never known. I wept at her birth. She brought pure love and happiness to my desolate world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I cherish each and every day because I share them with her. More than that, I crave them. I am greedy for life. I want to live forever. I want to witness her life, watch her grow up, have a family of her own, and watch them grow up simply because they are a part of her. I want to be here to help her, teach her and protect her. I want to be whatever she has most need of. I would give my life for this child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know regardless of what I may do for Dakota she has done far more for me. She has taught me to treasure my life and the world around me. She makes me want to be better than I am and gives me reason to endure any hardship. She holds my hand and calls me, Grammy. She keeps me on the path. </span></div></div>",
