She had been taken in her sleep, a spell cast upon her by the goblins' sinister witchdoctor, and carried to their cave dwelling in the nearby hills. Determined to save their friend from a fate worse than death, Kara and Raven bravely set out into the treacherous hills, armed to the teeth, and ready for adventure! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a determined mindset Kara continued to hike onwards, her trusty bo warstaff over her back. She glanced around, observing the land and nodding slightly to herself. \"Hmm...we should be here there soon, you keeping up?\" She asked, turning to her companion.  Raven was right behind her, and rolled her eyes as she scanned the rocky landscape for any sign of their friend. As expected, however, she was nowhere in sight. However, she did spot fresh tracks on the ground beside them. Tapping Kara on the back, Raven said quietly, \"Look... goblin tracks! They lead this way...\" The nightelf gestured toward a particularly steep side of the hill, in an increasingly rocky area.   Kara trusted her companion's intuition, but also noticed some tracks nearby -- no doubt made by goblin raiders -- heading in several other directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the tracks that led into the hills, there were tracks that led into a forest, and into a nearby swamp.<br>\r\nKara and Raven talked it over, and both decided it would be best to...</span></div></div>",

We'll find her in no time!\" Kara let her rogue friend lead the way, careful to make sure they were following the tracks and not veering off the path. As the two traveled, they found themselves soon approaching a rather steep hill, the area becoming far rockier. Kara glanced around warily, a little unsure as to where they were. \"You uh...sure we're heading the right way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven took a moment to scan the area.  It seemed they had reached a fork in the tracks' path.  One set snaked around and continued up the hill, into the adjacent mountains. There were larger footprints alongside the goblins in this path, perhaps those of orcs.  Raven shuddered at the mental image of the horrifyingly grotesque creatures, and from the sheer volume of the larger prints, concluded that this path must lead to some orc stronghold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second set of tracks, which veered slightly right, were less dense, and appeared more fresh.  Additionally, there were dragging marks, as if the goblins may have been carrying something very large.  These tracks lead to the face of a nearby cliff.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Raven decided to follow the tracks leading...</span></div></div>",

Not that she did it intentionally, but as she bent forward, her buns strained against the material of her extremely short shorts. A rubbery stretching-like sound could be heard as she did so, looking down and noting a circular stone, unusually placed into the rock about two feet from the ground. \"Hmmm.. that's odd...\" She reached down and removed it, revealing a small circular entrance in the side of the cliff!<br>\r\nKara bit her lip slightly as she stared at the rogue's generous ass. The sight of it in those tight little shorts and that sound... Shaking off the distracting thoughts, Kara tore her gaze away from the sight, inspecting the hole in the cliff she had found. \"Oh...u-uh...nice work! I'll bet they took her in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven nodded, and scratched her head. \"Yeah, they went this way all right. I wonder how they got her in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara peered past Raven at the hole, frowning. It was very small, really only designed for small goblins to crawl in, and she wasn't exactly sure the two of them could fit either. \"Hrrrm...it does look rather small. Maybe there were a lot of goblins, and they just squeezed her in slowly...or there was another entrance?\" She shrugged.  \"I don't know.  We can try to look for another entrance, but I don't see another way in. What should we do?\"</span></div></div>",

Taking a moment to look behind her, Raven caught Kara 'checking her out' this time like she did before, and raised an eyebrow with a smirk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uhm.\" Kara blushed, giving a rather guilty smile. \"I was just uhh...sizing you up to the hole thats all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she didn't really mind, Raven's expression didn't change. \"Right...\" She chuckled to herself for a moment before taking a deep breath, and placing her hands inside the hole. As she inched forward, her hips tilted and her back arched, causing her shorts to make that rubbery straining sound as it fought to contain her backside. Her chest caught on the threshold somewhat, but after some maneuvering, was able to coax it through.  The rogue was quite lithe otherwise, and was able to easily negotiate her ribs through, and then her chest, and then her stomach. Raven had made it halfway through when...</span></div></div>",

Pressing on the wall and digging her feet into the ground, the tried her hardest to force them through, without success. The normally composed elf began to panic a little, as her efforts to squeeze through did little aside from causing her face and thighs to glisten a little with sweat from the exertion. Her shorts again made straining sounds as she struggled in the hole. \"Nnng... Hrrrph! Curses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gasped, staring at the sight that lay before her. There, sticking from the hole, was the elf's generous buns and hips, glistening slightly and clad in far too tight shorts. Her posterior wiggled and squirmed back and forth,clearly too large for the small opening. Kara simply stared at the rogues ass, taking a step forwards. \"Uhhh...ah...uhm Raven? Are you ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven kicked a few times, a sort of nonverbal obvious answer to Kara's question. \"Uuun! Well... oooph... I'm stuck....Otherwise, I'm just great.\" She stopped struggling, her legs now limp as she caught a breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...I can see that.\" Kara bent over, inspecting the nightelf's stuck backside.

They quickly realised that Raven's bottom had the hole tightly plugged, and was putting up a good fight to stay put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... isn't... working!\" Kara groaned.

Kara knelt in front of Raven's backside, and lightly placed her hand against it. She shuddered slightly at the feeling of her soft warm skin against her hand. Raven was expecting Kara to grab her legs and try to shove her in, or something. However, when she felt Kara's hand graze against the skin of her ass, her eyes widened. She shivered as goosebumps appeared immediately on her skin, clearly visible to Kara. It was an unexpected reaction given her situation, but she soon began to realize what the view must be like back there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven...I'm gonna have to push you ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, she called back, \"O-okay..\", biting her lip as she braced her hands against the inside wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara closed her eyes, enjoying the feeling of her ample backside beneath her. She raised her eyebrows as the nightelf's ass perked up a little, goosebumps clearly visible. \"Was she...enjoying this?\" Her heart began pounding in her chest now as Kara placed both hands on Raven's round buns, and gave them a firm squeeze. She had been wanting to do that for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven briefly gasped as she felt Kara's hands grasp her ass.  Trying her best not to think about how it felt, she took a breath and pushed against the wall. Her torso stretched out, but she still didn't budge. *Hold on..*, she thought, *Kara isn't pushing yet, she's still just squeezing..* Kara blushed even more, but managed to tilt her hips forward so her butt rolled up very slightly, unintentionally presenting more surface of her ass to Kara. Her shorts made a slight rubbery straining noise as she did.  With Raven's fate literally in her hands, Kara decides to...</span></div></div>",

Keeping her tight grip, Kara pressed down upon the wedged ass, leaning forwards slightly. \"..Uhhnph!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kara began to palm her ass, Raven's heart began to pound heavily as she felt the exquisite pressure from behind. Her warm, soft cheeks rolled forward with the force, and spread out to the sides. She didn't budge, but this was definitely the right idea. Raven could tell that Kara was genuinely trying to free her now, and though the pressure on her ass actually felt even better now than before, she tried her best to focus on the situation at hand, and pressed against the rock wall pointing her nose to the ceiling and gritting her teeth. Her torso stretched out a little, and the tried to dig her toes into the ground behind her, without interfereing with Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara continued to push against her bottom, pressing in harder against the blockage. Trying to remain composed she pushed harder and firmer, leaning closer to her backside as the elfs bottom simply spread around the hole. By now her face was pretty much pressed against her ass, groaning and straining. \"Hhrrrrnf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shorts creaked and groaned as Kara's face smashed against it. Raven pushed harder, and harder, as did Kara, but for all their efforts she just seemed to get jammed more tightly into the small hole. Raven palmed the walls one last time, and rocked her torso from side to side, her elven nose pointed skyward. She did inch forward alright, but was now wedged even more tightly than before. \"HNNNGG!! OW! Ow... wait... wait, this isn't working...\" Raven paused to catch her breath. Looking behind at the hole, she called back, \"Those blasted goblins got the other girls though...K-Kara? Can you see if there is anything catching on the edges of the hole, from back there?\" She asked, her voice quivering, as this was the first time she had directly addressed her companion since she had gotten stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara relented as the wedged rogue stopped, panting as she loosed her grip. The warrior listened as Raven spoke, blushing a little.  \"Well...o-ok.\" She inspected the ass sticking out of the rock face once again, biting her lip slightly. The slight budge had left the elf even more stuck, her round bottom spreading out around the edges.  Kara realized...</span></div></div>",

Her friend in the cave needed to be rescued, so she was willing to do anything. In fact, the more she thought about it, the more she realized Kara might be right. \"Y-yeah... I think you're right..\" She finally resigned. \"Let me know when you've got them off, and I...er...we...can try again.\" She blushed heavily at the last part, but lay still for Kara to help her out of her shorts.

Kara smiled impishly as she agreed, giving her a soft pat. \"Well ok, lets get these off...\" She gripped the edges of them, grunting as she tugged. Kara could tell they were tight, and her shorts simply squeaked and strained not coming off the large hipped rogue easily. Grumbling slightly she tugged harder, giving a firm yank as they finally slid off. \"Oh!\" Kara gasped, not quite expecting the sight before her. There, protruding from the hole, was the nightelf's naked backside, her now fully visible curves accentuated by the light of the setting sun. \"O-oh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven could sense the awkward silence, even from inside the cave. Her entire back end, in all its glory, was now presented before Kara.

When she was ready, Kara pushed, tighting her grip and shoving forward hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Raven's bubble butt yielded under her palms, causing Kara's hands and fingers to sink inwards, and her flesh to spread outwards.

Thanks to you!\" It was then that she suddenly realized she was still half naked. The elf tried to cover her front with her hands, but it soon seemed rather silly, seeing as how Kara had been in very intimate contact with her for quite awhile as she bared her assets. Dropping her hands, and scratching her head nervously, she said \"Heh...heh... umm... could you...possibly...pass me my..shorts?\" She asked, turning as red as ever.  \"Oh right yes of course!\" She blushed furiously as she fished them off the floor before passing them through the hole to Raven.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her companion dressed herself, Kara looked at the newly enlarged hole.  She wondered if she could slip through now like Raven, after the piece of the wall had broken off, or if she would get caught too...</span></div></div>",

Due to not needing to evade attacks, rather just blocking them, Kara had developed stronger arms to compensate, but this had left her with both thighs and a middle which was notably thicker than Raven's. Now, she was by no means fat, but she was hardly small either, and this was proving to be the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven stared as Kara kicked and pushed, her skirt swaying teasingly towards the rogue as her friend tried to squeeze inside, but she could tell it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...

However, it was clear to her that they could be using the only way in, in which case pulling her out just to stick her back in would be pointless.

That plump little rear of yours always makes me smile.\u201d Kara replied with a smile as she did her best to hug Raven. \u201cNow please help me out of here, this really hurts.\u201d Kara instructed as she tried again to wiggle her enormous chest through the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Kara, give me your hands again.\u201d Kara instructed as she wiped her tears away. Kara held out her hands again and Serenity grabbed one while Raven grabbed the other. \u201cPull!\u201d Raven yelled as she pulled with all her strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working, it hurts too much!\u201d Kara yelled in pain as her breasts dug into the inside of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea, but it\u2019s a little weird.\u201d Raven said as she stopped pulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how weird it is, just get me out of here!\u201d Kara yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Raven replied as she started sliding her small hands into the hole, placing one under each of Karas large breasts. \u201cI\u2019m gonna try and pull your breasts out one at a time.\u201d Raven said as she cupped her hand around Karas first breast and gently started wiggling it back and forth until it started sliding forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d Kara yelled in joy as her first breast began moving forward out of the hole. \u201cCould you turn away please your majesty, I\u2019d prefer you not see this?\u201d Kara asked as her breast reached the end of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Serenity replied as she quickly turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, thank you so much Raven.\u201d Kara said with a smile as her bare breast fell from her shirt and hung outside the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, now let\u2019s get the other one out.\u201d Raven replied as she did the same thing with Karas other breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, I can finally breath! Thank you so much Raven!\u201d Kara yelled as she hugged Raven. \u201cNow help me the rest of the way please, my butt\u2019s still stuck pretty good.\u201d Kara said with a smile as she held out her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Kara.\u201d Raven replied as she grabbed Karas hands and pulled with all her strength. Raven couldn\u2019t help but watch Karas bare breasts bounce back and forth with every tug she gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarder, I can feel myself moving!\u201d Kara yelled as Raven continued pulling.

My butt and breasts hurt so bad right now.\u201d Kara whined as she continued lying on top of Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were laying on them for really long time, and your butt was squished in that hole pretty tight. Maybe I can help you a bit.\u201d Raven replied as she placed her hands on Karas butt and gently kneaded her fingers into the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing Raven?\u201d Kara asked in a surprised tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were in pain, so I wanted to try and help you. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m making you uncomfortable Kara. I\u2019ll stop if you want.\u201d Raven quietly answered as she stopped massaging Karas butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Raven, I actually don\u2019t mind.\u201d Kara replied with a smile and a light blush. Raven nodded her head yes and continued massaging Karas aching muscles.

After what felt like an eternity of walking the tunnel came to what appeared to be a dead end. \u201cDarn, it\u2019s a dead end.\u201d Raven said as she looked sourly at the large rock wall in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not.\u201d Kara replied as she eyed a small part of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, did you find something?\u201d Raven asked as she walked up next to Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might be a bit of a squeeze, but there\u2019s a large crack in the wall over here.\u201d Kara answered as she pointed out a large narrow crack in the side of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Kara, it looks tight.\u201d Raven replied as she looked doubtfully at the narrow crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see any other way out?\u201d Kara asked with a small frown. Raven and Serenity looked around a little bit, but we\u2019re sad to see there was no other way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s give it a try. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Raven answered as she walked up to the gap, turned sideways, and started trying to push herself in it. After a few good shoves Ravens breasts squeezed through the gap, but her butt was another story. \u201cI need some help Kara, my butt won\u2019t fit!\u201d Kara yelled as she pulled against the inside of the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on Raven, I\u2019ll give you a hand.\u201d Kara replied as she kneeled down and started pushing Ravens butt into the crack. It was a slow process, but Ravens butt began squishing into the narrow crack. \u201cYou\u2019re almost in, push Raven!\u201d Kara yelled as she pushed even harder, after a few more hard shoves Kara squeezed the rest of the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Kara.\u201d Raven said as she tried squeezing farther down the tunnel like crack.

After a few more minutes Raven reached the end of the crack, but was disappointed to find it was even tighter than the entrance. \u201cThis is not going to be easy.\u201d Raven said to herself as she placed her hand on the outer wall and pushed. \u201cIt\u2019s...so...tight.\u201d Raven groaned as she struggled to fit through the narrow opening. \u201cI could use some help!\u201d Raven yelled as she continued struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo could I! I can\u2019t even get through the entrance!\u201d Kara yelled from the other end of the tunnel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on Kara, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Serenity replied as she pressed her hands into Karas thick bottom and pushed as hard as she could. \u201cCome on Kara, you can do it!\u201d Serenity yelled as she pushed and shoved against Karas large butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way, I can\u2019t even get my stupid boobs through, let alone my butt.\u201d Kara replied as she pushed and struggled to fit through the narrow crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if we start with your breasts then work on your butt you could squeeze through.\u201d Serenity suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Idea Serenity. Let\u2019s get to work, Raven needs us.\u201d Kara replied as she tried to pull her first breast through the opening. \u201cCome on boob, work with me.\u201d Kara grumped as she tried kneading her first breast into the hole. \u201cI can\u2019t get it through, my angle\u2019s to weird. This is a little awkward Serenity, but could you help me get my breast through please?\u201d Kara asked with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Kara, I\u2019ll try to be gentle.\u201d Serenity answered as she took Karas breast in her hand and gently kneaded it through the opening. \u201cThat\u2019s one, now for the other one.\u201d Serenity said as she repeated the process with Karas second breast. \u201cThere you go Kara, you\u2019re halfway there.\u201d Serenity informed with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Serenity, but now we have a much bigger problem. How in the world are we gonna get my butt through here if I could barely get my breasts through?\u201d Kara asked with a small frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same way we got your chest through, slow and steady.\u201d Serenity calmly answered as she placed both her hands on Karas first butt cheek and tried kneading it through the crack. \u201cOh wow, you\u2019re butt\u2019s a lot thicker than your breasts. Brace yourself Kara, this is probably gonna hurt.\u201d Serenity informed as she dug her shoulder into Karas first butt cheek and shoved with all her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is ridiculous, I knew my butt wasn\u2019t small, but I didn\u2019t think it was huge either!\u201d Kara yelled in frustration as she pulled and jerked herself around in a hopeless attempt to move forward. \u201cIt\u2019s no use, there\u2019s no way my butts getting through here.\u201d Kara said in defeat as she stopped pulling and tried to push herself back out. \u201cOh no.\u201d Kara said to herself as she tried to back out of the crack. \u201cNo! No! No! I\u2019m stuck! I can\u2019t get out, I can\u2019t move at all!\u201d Kara yelled in a slight panic as she thrashed around trying to squeeze back out of the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic Kara, I\u2019m coming to help you!\u201d Raven yelled as she slowly pushed herself back towards Kara. \u201cOkay Kara, I\u2019m here, just calm down and let me help you.\u201d Raven calmly instructed as she took Karas hand in her own. \u201cWe have to go forward because it\u2019s the only way out, so we\u2019ll help each other just like always. Sound good Kara?\u201d Raven asked with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just like always.\u201d Kara answered as she started pulling on Ravens hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do it Kara, push, push, push!\u201d Serenity yelled as she pushed against Karas butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Kara! You\u2019re almost there.\u201d Raven said as she gave Kara one last hard pull, sending her shooting forward the rest of the way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, thank you so much you two! I thought I was never gonna get out of there!\u201d Kara yelled with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome Kara, now let\u2019s keep moving, the tunnels not that long.\u201d Raven replied with a smile as she slowly started squeezing her way to the other end of the crack. \u201cOkay Kara, this is gonna be tough, I\u2019m pretty sure this side is even tighter than the first.\u201d Raven informed with a small frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me, I\u2019m never gonna make it through then.\u201d Kara replied in a slightly agitated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Kara, you\u2019ll make.\u201d Serenity encouraged with a smile as she placed her hand on Karas shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Serenity, I wish I was as confident as you are.\u201d Kara replied with a small frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Kara, as long as we stick together we can do anything.\u201d Raven encouraged as she started sliding her way through the opening. \u201cOh, darn it! I can\u2019t get my boobs through, give me a hand Kara.\u201d Raven said with a small grunt as she pressed herself against the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Raven, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Kara replied as she started pushing against Raven. \u201cIt\u2019s not working, is there any thing you can do to slim yourself down even a little bit?\u201d Kara asked as she stopped pushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I can do, but it\u2019ll be awkward.\u201d Raven quietly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how awkward it is, just do it.\u201d Kara firmly instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Kara, I need you to help me take my top and bottoms off please.\u201d Raven instructed with a light blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right?\u201d Kara asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. The opening is so tight that I need every centimeter I can get, so help me get my top and bottoms off.\u201d Raven firmly instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Raven, if you think it\u2019ll help.\u201d Kara replied as she started pulling Ravens shorts down. \u201cGeez Raven, these things are so tight, were you poured into them?\u201d Kara jokingly asked as she slid Ravens shorts past her butt then pulled her top off. \u201cOkay, hopefully this will work.\u201d Kara said with a smile as she started pushing Raven through the narrow gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely working, it hurts a little, but I\u2019m squeezing...agh!\u201d Raven yelled mid sentence as she popped out of the hole. \u201cThanks Kara, now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Raven said as she squeezed back into her shorts and slipped her top back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, just nobody look please, I\u2019m not wearing anything underneath this.\u201d Kara quietly said with a small blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe promise not to look.\u201d Serenity replied as she closed her eyes. Kara slowly took her top off then tried to pull her shorts down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on you stupid shorts, get off of my butt.\u201d Kara quietly grumped as she tugged at her shorts. \u201cUm. Raven?\u201d Kara quietly and nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Kara?\u201d Raven asked in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is really embarrassing, but do you think you could help me get my shorts off please, they\u2019re stuck on my butt?\u201d Kara quietly asked as her face flushed red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Kara, no problem.\u201d Raven answered with just as much embarrassment, as she grabbed Karas shorts and started pulling them down. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding, and you said I was poured into mine.\u201d Raven said with a grin as she gave Karas shorts one last good tug, pulling them all the way down. \u201cThere off, now give me your hand and we\u2019ll have you out of there in no time.\u201d Raven instructed as she grabbed Karas hands and pulled as hard as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help.\u201d Serenity said as she wrapped her arms around Ravens waist and helped her pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost there Kara! Pull Kara! Pull!\u201d Raven yelled as she pulled even harder on Karas hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m about to be...Agh!\u201d Kara yelled as she shot out of the hole, knocking Raven and Serenity to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay Kara?\u201d Raven asked as she looked up to find Kara and all her undressed glory laying on top of her. Ravens whole face flushed red the instant she noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, just sore. Thanks for the help you two, now if you\u2019d excuse me, I need to get dressed.\u201d Kara answered with a dark blush as she quickly rolled off of Raven, squeezed back into her shorts, and slipped her top back on. \u201cThat sucked, but at least we made it through. Now let\u2019s see where we are.\u201d Kara said as she looked around the new room. \u201cNot much here, just that small pond.\u201d Kara informed with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen there may be more here than we think, I read that a lot of the caves around this area are connected by small bodies of water, let\u2019s swim down it and see where it leads.\u201d Serenity suggested as she started walking towards the pond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good to me, what do you think Kara?\u201d Raven asked as she started following Serenity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood idea Serenity. I\u2019ll go take a look, you two stay here.\u201d Kara instructed as she walked over to the pond and dove into it. After a minute or so Kara re-surfaced. \u201cWe\u2019re in luck, it looks like there\u2019s a way through. Follow me every one.\u201d Kara said as she took a deep breath and dove back under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go I guess.\u201d Raven said with a nervous breath, as she filled her lungs with air and dove into the water followed closely by Serenity. The tree young women swam for about a minute before coming to a large rock wall beneath the surface. Kara waved her hand at the group and pointed to a round hole in the middle of the wall. Raven gave a thumbs up and watched Kara start swimming towards the hole. Kara swam up to the hole and noticed it was much smaller up close, but they were out of options. Kara slid her arms through the hole and with a little effort managed to squeeze her breasts through, but when she got to her butt she realized she may have made a terrible mistake. She pushed and wiggled and squirmed as much as she could, but her ample rear wouldn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018Oh no, I\u2019m stuck! I can\u2019t get through!\u2019 Kara thought to herself as she continued to struggle. Raven watched Kara kick for a few seconds before she realized what was going. Raven tugged on Serenitys sleeve to get her attention, Serenity looked at Raven who was gesturing to Kara. Serenity looked at Kara flailing in the small opening then realized what Raven was trying to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Not good, she\u2019s stuck!\u2019 Serenity thought to herself as she quickly swam over to Kara, placed her hands on Karas butt, then looked back at Raven. Raven understood what Serenity was saying and immediately followed her example as she placed her hands on another part of Karas butt. As Kara struggled and pushed against the sides of the hole Raven and Serenity pushed on her butt, after a few seconds Kara slid through the hole. Raven quickly started swimming through the hole, but encountered a problem much earlier than Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh crap, my boobs are too big!\u2019 Raven thought to herself as she squirmed around trying to fit through the opening. Knowing that Raven would most likely have a similar problem, Kara immediately swam to Raven and grabbed her hands. Kara pulled and pulled and pulled, but Ravens large chest just wouldn\u2019t budge. As they each started running low on oxygen, Kara did the only thing she could think to do. She grabbed Ravens top and pulled it off hoping to make it easier for the young elf to fit her ample chest through the hole. Raven pushed and wiggled but was still having problems, so Kara grabbed her hands and pulled as hard as she could. Just when they both thought they wouldn\u2019t make it in time, Raven felt a pair of hands dig into her fleshy bottom as Serenity started pushing on the young elfs large soft rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Come on Raven, move!\u2019 Serenity thought to herself as she continued pressing her hands deep into Ravens soft round bottom. Thankfully after one good shove Raven squeezed through the hole followed closely by Serenity. The three women quickly swam around the new area looking for any kind of air pocket or surface. Serenity pointed upward to what appeared to be light and they all swam to it as fast as they could. All three women surfaced with a loud gasp quickly sucked in oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! That sincerely sucked.\u201d Kara said as she continued breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me, I thought we were gonna drown.\u201d Raven replied as she took a few more breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but we still have to find a way out now.\u201d Serenity chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point, let\u2019s catch our breath then split up and look for a way out. Meet back here in two minutes.\u201d Kara instructed as she prepared to dive under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Serenity and Raven replied simultaneously. All three women nodded to each other, took a deep breath, then dove back under the water. After about two minutes everyone resurfaced. \u201cAnyone find anything?\u201d Raven asked as she took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, closer to the bottom there\u2019re a bunch of crystals like these lined up in a row, to exact to be a naturally formed path.\u201d Kara answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood find Kara, let\u2019s get going.\u201d Serenity said as all three of them took a deep breath and once again submerged themselves. Raven and Serenity followed Kara to the first crystal then followed the path for a few feet until they found a hole in the ceiling leading to the surface. Kara gestured to Serenity then pointed at the hole, Serenity nodded and swam up through the hole, easily fitting through the opening and climbing on to dry land. Kara then looked at Raven then back at the hole, trying to size her up to it. Lastly Kara put her hands on her own hips and rear and sized them up to the opening, she noticed it would be a squeeze for both of them so she quickly devised a plan. She swam part way through the hole, just until her head was above the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Serenity, this isn\u2019t going to be an easy fit for Raven or myself, so I have an idea. I sized both her and myself up to the hole and I think her butt is slightly smaller than mine, so she\u2019s gonna go first. When Raven comes up for air tell her the plan, then have her come back down so I can take a breath before we start, that okay?\u201d Kara explained and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m worried about, Raven May have a smaller butt than you, but it\u2019s also denser than yours, it doesn\u2019t compress as far.\u201d Serenity informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point, talk to Raven and see what she says.\u201d Kara instructed as she took a deep breath and dove back under the water. Raven immediately surfaced and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d Raven asked as she caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara and I are thinking about having you go first, but there\u2019s one thing I need to know first.\u201d Serenity answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Raven asked in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich one of you has a thicker or denser butt?\u201d Serenity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I do, but let me check real quick.\u201d Raven answered as she dove back under the water and swam up behind Kara. Raven placed one hand on her own butt and squeezed it, then placed her other hand on Karas butt and gave her a squeeze. Kara jumped at the sudden squeeze, but quickly realized what Raven was doing. Raven swam back up to Serenity with her new information. \u201cYeah, Karas butt is slightly bigger than mine, but mines thicker.\u201d Raven informed as she took a small breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then take a deep breath and send Kara up, we\u2019ll get her through as quick as we can.\u201d Serenity instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d Raven replied as she took a deep breath and dove back under the water. Raven swam up to Kara and gestured upwards, Kara nodded in reply and quickly swam up to the hole and surfaced. She placed her hands on the sides of the hole and pushed as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerenity quick, help me out, Raven has no way to get air!\u201d Kara yelled as she struggled to get her breasts through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn it!\u201d Serenity yelled as she grabbed Kara under her arms and pulled as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry Serenity, pull!\u201d Kara yelled as she wiggled her breasts through the hole. Meanwhile below the surface, Raven was digging her hands into Karas soft rear as she desperately tried to push Kara through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Come on Kara, budge already! I can\u2019t keep this up!\u2019 Raven thought to herself as she quickly pulled Karas shorts off and continued pushing. After a few good tugs on Serenitys side, Kara started moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re moving! Keep pushing Kara, you\u2019re almost though!\u201d Serenity yelled as she dug her feet into the ground and heaved with all her might. Serenity gave Kara one last hard pull and popped her out of the hole. \u201cThank goodness, now where\u2019s Raven?!\u201d Serenity asked in a panic as she waited for Raven to surface. \u201cShe\u2019s not coming up, I\u2019m going to check on her!\u201d Serenity yelled as she dove back into the water to look for Raven. Serenity immediately found Raven slowly sinking, she rushed over to her, grabbed her and brought her to the hole. Serenity surfaced with a gasp as she held Ravens head above the water. Raven! Raven wake up!\u201d Serenity yelled as she lightly slapped Raven a few times and gave her a few quick breaths. Raven coughed up a little water then gave Serenity a thumbs up. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re okay, now let\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d Serenity said as she released Raven and quickly hopped out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank\u2019s Serenity, I owe you one.\u201d Raven said as she held her hands out to Kara and Serenity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, you would\u2019ve done the same for me.\u201d Serenity replied as her and Kara each grabbed one of Ravens hands and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh, my boobs, I hate these things.\u201d Raven groaned as she wiggled around a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Kara replied as she pulled even harder. After a few minutes Ravens breasts finally squeezed through the hole. \u201cOne obstacle down, one to go.\u201d Kara said as she grabbed Raven under her arms and gave her a few good tugs, after several minutes Raven only got about half her butt through the opening. \u201cThat butt of yours is always a problem, too much sexy in too little hole.\u201d Kara said with a grin as she gave Raven a few more tugs, after the fifth hard pull Raven squeezed out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Kara, now let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Raven said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea, it looks like there are three paths to take. There\u2019s a round tunnel on the left, a crack in the center area, or a hole that looks like it has light coming from it, but it looks really tight. Which way should we go?\u201d Kara informed and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go through the...</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d Raven yelled with joy.

I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Kara replied as she poked her arms through the hole and tried to wiggle forward. \u201cOh jeez, it\u2019s insanely tight. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna fit, I can\u2019t even get my boobs through.\u201d Kara groaned as she tried to wiggle through. \u201cIt\u2019s no use, I\u2019ll never fit like this.\u201d Kara said as she slid back out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea Kara, but it\u2019s more than a little weird.\u201d Serenity said with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it gets us out I don\u2019t care if I have to strip.\u201d Kara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou read my mind.\u201d Serenity replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually joking, but if you think it\u2019ll work.\u201d Kara said as she started stripping down. \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d Kara said with a nervous blush as she threw her clothes out the hole and tried again to squeeze through. \u201cIt\u2019s still too tight, I need help.\u201d Kara said with a grunt as she squirmed around trying to get her boobs through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you Kara!\u201d Raven yelled as she placed her hands on Karas butt and started pushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need help with my breasts Raven, I know it\u2019ll be awkward, but could you try to push them through please?\u201d Kara asked as she continued to struggle against the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, um, sure Kara.\u201d Raven replied somewhat nervously as she grabbed Karas breasts and tried to push them through. \u201cOh wow Kara, your breasts are enormous!\u201d Raven yelled as she started squeezing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, they always get me in trouble!\u201d  Kara yelled as she squirmed against the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey sure do.\u201d Raven replied as she gently kneaded her fingers in Karas soft squishy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou having a good time Raven?\u201d Kara teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! I\u2019m sorry Kara, I didn\u2019t mean to get so touchy feely with you!\u201d Raven yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t  mind.\u201d Kara replied in a mischievous voice, get me out of here and maybe I\u2019ll let you do it again.\u201d Kara said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Raven yelled with joy as she pushed Karas breasts as hard as she could. \u201cThey\u2019re moving, keep pushing Kara!\u201d Raven yelled with joy. Kara pushed with all her strength and finally managed to get her chest through the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, now for my big butt.\u201d Kara said as she jerked herself forward with all her might. \u201cBe honest Raven, my butt\u2019s huge compared to the hole, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kara asked with a frown as her butt slammed into the sides of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s about three times the size, but we\u2019ll get you  through.\u201d Raven answered as she happily sank her hands deep into Karas soft round butt and pushed with everything she had. \u201cCan you give me hand Serenity, she\u2019s really stuck?\u201d Raven groaned as she pushed and shoved against Karas enormous rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Serenity replied as she placed her hands on Karas butt and started pushing. \u201cIt\u2019s no use, she won\u2019t budge!\u201d Serenity yelled as she dug her feet into the dirt and put all her weight behind her shoves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good Kara, your butt\u2019s to big, you need to come back.\u201d Raven said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. I! I can\u2019t!\u201d Kara yelled as she struggled and pushed against the ground. \u201cI can\u2019t move, I\u2019m stuck!\u201d Kara yelled back. \u201cI need help! Is anyone around, I\u2019m stuck!\u201d Kara yelled in a slight panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic Kara, we\u2019ll get you out!\u201d Serenity yelled as she grabbed Ravens hand and led her several feet back. \u201cOn three we\u2019ll charge at Kara and throw all our weight into her butt, hopefully it\u2019ll be enough to get her out.\u201d Serenity instructed as she prepared to run at Karas butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Serenity. One. Two. Charge!\u201d Raven yelled as her and Serenity sprinted at Karas butt and plowed into it as hard as they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh!\u201d Kara yelled as she shot out of the hole. \u201cOw. Thanks guys.\u201d Kara said as she rubbed her sore butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Raven replied as she tried to squeeze out the hole. \u201cA little help Kara.\u201d Raven said as she tried squirming through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Raven.\u201d Kara replied as she started running towards Raven, but before she could reach her, she was tackled to the ground by something she didn\u2019t see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who rescued our hostage! You\u2019ll pay!\u201d An orc yelled as he started beating on Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara!\u201d Raven yelled in horror as she helplessly watched the orc attack Kara. \u201cGet me out of here Serenity! Kara\u2019s in trouble!\u201d Raven yelled as she squirmed and pushed against the hole as much as she could, but it was no use. Her enormous rear wouldn\u2019t budge, all she could do was helplessly watch as Kara was mercilessly beaten by the orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off of me you filthy orc!\u201d Kara yelled as she pulled a knife off the orcs belt and repeatedly stuck it into his side. \u201cGet..off!\u201d Kara screamed as she delivered the final blow and rolled the dead orc off of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god Kara, are you alright?!\u201d Raven yelled in a panic as she struggled to get through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, now let\u2019s get you and Serenity out of there before more show up.\u201d Kara answered with a  groan as she sat in front of Raven, placed her feet against the wall, and grabbed Ravens hands. \u201cOn three. One, two, three!\u201d Kara yelled as she pushed her feet against the wall and pulled with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I can\u2019t move. My butt\u2019s to big.\u201d Raven groaned as she twisted, squirmed and kicked around trying to free herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo bad Serenity doesn\u2019t have anymore of that oil.\u201d Kara said as she pulled harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he does, check his body for anything that could make this easier.\u201d Raven suggested as she let go of Karas hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea.\u201d Kara replied as she slowly crawled over to the orcs body and searched it. \u201cGood news, he has a big thing of oil.\u201d Kara replied as she dragged herself back over to Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I\u2019ll go back in and strip like you did, hopefully between that and the oil I can get through.\u201d Raven said as she tried to wiggle back into the hole. \u201cUgh, my boobs are caught.\u201d Raven said as she grabbed her boobs and tried to push them back in. Serenity watched Ravens butt wiggle around for a moment before she caught on and helped pull Raven back inside. \u201cThanks Serenity, I\u2019m gonna strip down like Kara did and use the oil she found on that orc to get through.\u201d Raven informed as she started stripping down and throwing her clothes out the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrc?! What orc, is she okay?!\u201d Serenity asked with some concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s okay for the most part, we\u2019ll know more when we get out of here.\u201d Raven answered as she tossed her clothes out the hole and rubbed the oil over her body. \u201cOkay, her goes nothing.\u201d Raven said as she ran at the hole and tried to dive through it. \u201cAgh! That hurt, but at least my boobs made it through.\u201d Raven said as her butt was wedged into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, now give me your hands.\u201d Kara ordered as she sat down by Raven. Raven took Karas hands and started pulling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so awkward.\u201d Raven said as Kara kept pulling on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kara groaned as she pulled even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re both naked right now, and you\u2019re just sitting in front of me and I can see pretty much everything.\u201d Raven answered with a dark red blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Raven, you know you love it.\u201d Kara replied with a wink as she gave Raven one last hard pull to get her out. Raven shot out of the hole and landed right on top of Kara, pressing her lips into Karas as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god Kara, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t mean...\u201d Kara cut her off as she grabbed Ravens head and pressed their lips together for a long and deep kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you Raven.\u201d Kara whispered as she Kissed Raven again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too Kara.\u201d Raven replied as she hugged Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s get dressed and get Serenity back to her village.\u201d Kara said as she slipped on her clothes and tried to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on Kara, let me get Serenity then I\u2019ll come back and help you.\u201d Raven said as she went back to the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere are your clothes Raven, is Kara okay?\u201d Serenity asked as she handed Raven her clothes and wiggled out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay, but she might need someone to lean on for a while.\u201d Raven answered as she got dressed and walked back over by Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least she\u2019s okay.\u201d Serenity replied as she walked over by Kara and helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Serenity, now let\u2019s get you home.\u201d Kara said as Raven walked up next to her so Kara could lean on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s go, my village is only a few miles from here.\u201d Serenity informed as she started leading Kara and Raven to her village. After a few miles Kara and Raven noticed that Serenity had led them into a forest. \u201cWe\u2019re her.\u201d Serenity said as she stopped in the middle of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Raven asked as she looked around the empty forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp there.\u201d Serenity answered as she pointed up. Kara and Raven looked up and saw several large treehouses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool! How do we get up there?\u201d Kara asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can either...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not working, my boobs are just bunching up! They\u2019re just to big to fit back out!\u201d Kara yelled as she wiggled her wedged chest around as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can they get in but not out?!\u201d Serenity asked with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but they\u2019re completely stuck! If only there was a way to make them smaller.\u201d Kara replied as she laid her head down in her massive cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably not an option, so instead I\u2019m gonna go up top and drop a vial of oil down to you, maybe if you grease them up a little you\u2019ll be able to squeeze out.\u201d Serenity informed as she ran over to the ladder and started climbing it. \u201cOkay Kara, here it comes!\u201d Serenity yelled as she dropped the vile of oil down the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it, thanks Serenity!\u201d Kara yelled back as she opened the vile, and dumped the oil on her breasts. \u201cNow I just have to try and spread it over my massive assets.\u201d Kara said to herself as she started rubbing the oil over the parts of her breasts she could reach. \u201cOkay Raven, try again, pull as hard as you can!\u201d Kara yelled as she started pushing against the inside of the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Kara, here we go!\u201d Raven yelled as she started pulling on Karas waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe oils leaking down the sides of the tube, see if you can turn me on my back!\u201d Kara instructed as she tried to roll over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright hold on Kara!\u201d Raven yelled as she slowly turned Kara onto her back. \u201cOh jeez!\u201d Raven yelled in shock of what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?! What\u2019s wrong Raven?!\u201d Kara yelled with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, I just forgot you were totally naked, the view just caught me by surprise!\u201d Raven answered with a deep crimson blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you love it Raven!\u201d Kara yelled back as she continued to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure do, because I love you!\u201d Raven replied as she continued pulling on Karas legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sweet, I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s you helping me instead of some weirdo, who knows what they would do if they caught me like this.\u201d Kara said with a grunt as she jerked her legs forward trying to free herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019d probably do what I\u2019ve wanted to do since I met you.\u201d Raven quietly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you wanna do with me Raven?\u201d Kara quietly asked as she stopped struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just...I wanna...\u201d Raven tried to explain, but couldn\u2019t find the words to express her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Raven, you can tell me anything. I completely trust you.\u201d Kara replied with a smile, even known Raven couldn\u2019t see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna be with you Kara, in every sense of the word. I just want you, but only if that\u2019s what you want. I love you Kara, and I want to show you just how much I love you.\u201d Raven answered with a few tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet me out of here, and I promise to grant your wish a million times over. I love you Raven, and I want you in the same way.\u201d Kara replied with a few tears of her own. Ravens eyes glistened with joy as she nodded her head, pressed herself against Kara, pulled Karas thick thighs to her sides, then pulled with more strength than she\u2019d ever used before. She pulled, shifted, and wiggled Kara every way imaginable; she heaved and yanked, pulled and jerked, and finally Kara started moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m moving, keep going Raven!\u201d Kara yelled as she squirmed a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Kara, you can do it!\u201d Raven yelled as she thrusted herself forward, slamming her thigh into Karas nether regions as she did. Kara let out a loud gasp of surprise as Ravens thigh teased at her most vulnerable area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-easy Raven, I know you wanna celebrate, but at least wait till I\u2019m out.\u201d Kara said with a light moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, that was an accident.\u201d Raven replied with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just get me out of here!\u201d Kara yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Kara, here we go!\u201d Raven yelled as she gave Kara one last hard yank, sending her flying out of the tube and crashing into her, knocking them both to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you, thank you, thank you! I thought I was never gonna get out of there, I love you Raven!\u201d Kara yelled as she grabbed Raven and kissed her with more passion than the goddess of Mars herself could\u2019ve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you to Kara, now let\u2019s go home and have a little fun.\u201d Raven said as she gave Karas firm round butt a good hard slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou read my mind.\u201d Kara replied with a grin as she gave Ravens soft breast a squeeze then got off of her and helped her to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you Kara.\u201d Raven said as she gave Kara another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you to Raven.\u201d Kara replied as she pulled Ravens head closer and deepened their kiss. \u201cNow let\u2019s go home and have some real fun.\u201d Kara said with a devious grin as she reached her hand around Raven and gave her butt a good firm squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d Raven replied as she slapped Karas butt and started walking back home with Kara on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                      The End</span></div></div>",

The man, James, turned to the direction and looked taken aback too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, are you okay there, miss?\" he asked as the two of them approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sort of,\" Kara murmured bashfully. \"I got... a bit stuck here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, are you... Kara?\" James asked. Kara looked shocked, and regarded the duo curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was tall and slender with strong arms. His brown hair was well kept, if a little long, but accompanied his green eyes well. On his body lay a medium armour; a combination of a thick leather chest piece, chain arms and legs, leather boots and a metal gauntlet on his right arm. On his back sat a shield, and at his left hip a double-edged sword in its scabbard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis companion was much different, however; she was petite and fairly short in every way except her lower body, which flared out into a well-accentuated pear shape. She was not as well armoured, sporting only a leather gauntlet and spaulder on her right arm, a brace over her upper arm binding the two together, and a pair of leather boots which also ran up her shins with shin guards. The woman wore a light lilac body suit which covered her middle, upper body and her nethers, though her buttocks were not contained by it, and a duo of brown belts around her waist, holding various pouches and vials. She had no discernible weapons on her being. She looked to Kara, her silver back-length hair and bright green irises, along with her pointed ears, telling Kara she was an elfin species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a knave, my name is James,\" James introduced. \"And this is Felicity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a healer,\" she informed Kara. \"We're...</span></div></div>",

Well, then, I suppose we really should be going.\" She turned to the hole that made up the small front door, and began on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand, arms, head and shoulders cleared the opening with ease, but she slowed at her chest, which, though not as much as her belly or bottom, had grown a bit from her indulgence. However, her breasts were very easy to squash in the hole, so it only took some wriggling and exhaling to fit them through. However, it soon became even tighter for the poor, oblivious warrior, as her stomach began on its way inside the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph!\" Kara grumbled as she pushed forward. \"This is... tighter... *ngh* than I... *oomph* remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven watched, knowing there was no stopping Kara as she squeezed her way back out, and could not help but blush as Kara began to wriggle and squirm as she tried to free herself; her skirt was already short, but she was now bent over and displaying her entire underside to the rogue within the small home. She knew that Kara would need her help, but she wondered whether pulling her back in would be better, or if she should just bite the bullet and push her friend's rotund bottom, which, she realised, she enjoyed very much, perhaps too much, seeing as how Kara was her close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the door, Kara had hit a roadblock in the form of her plump middle as it corked the hole like a cork in a too-small bottle neck. She heaved and pushed, using her legs to try and inspire movement from behind while she used her arms to budge her top, but it was doing nothing but stretching the poor woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNNGH!\" she groaned as she tried to free herself. \"Oof! What the... *mmmmph!* ...heck is... *UUNNNNGH!* ...Ow, maybe I should... *HMPH!* ...no, that's...\" She tried backwards briefly, but held firm.

But...but...\"  She stammered  as she searched her mind frantically for an counter-argument for the request. Unfortunately, Raven was right, and she knew it.  Left with no sound reason to object, the redheaded warrior sighed in defeat, once egain remembering that this was all due to her body's new plumpened proportions from eating so many sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"  Kara said with a sigh, before beginning to unbuckle her leather armor.  Raven and Gregor turned their backs for the time being, so that Kara would feel that she momentarily had some privacy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlatching the buckles was much more challening than Kara had expected, for they had shut tightly under the stress of their wearer's chubbier body shape.  Exhaling all of the air from her lungs, however, she maneged to open them with a grunt, and removed her leightweight armor.  Her full, exposed breasts momentarily bounced as she stoof back up, coming to rest where they finally stood fast in the cool air of the gnome's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was her skirt, which was not as much of a challenge, for it was doing precious little anyway to cover her lower half.  Finally undoing her skirt, and not wearing anything underneith, the last articles were her boots, which she removed and placed gently next to the pile of the rest of her clothes.  Kara covered her chest with her hands, and with a soft sigh, managed to squeak.  \"O-okay...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven turned to face her friend, as did the gnome.  Both did their best to avert their eyes, but Raven couldn't help but catch a glimpse of the barenaked warrior's pale, voluptuousness, and how the fattening sweets had further grown the plentitude of her hips and rear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to subject Kara to this state any longer than was necessary, Raven thought first about how to apply the butter...</span></div></div>",

If her assessment was correct, the gnome tricked the pair with the enchanted pastries on purpose, to make sure they couldn't escape while he summoned the goblins.  Their only hope was to get out of there, and Raven knew it.<br>\r\nWith a clueless smile, Kara placed her hands through the hole, followed by her arms, head, and shoulders.  The outside of the gnome's front door was close to ground level, but there was a single step and a drop on the inside of the mound, which caused the inside of the opening to be just above hip height.  This made it much easier for Kara to duck through... in theory at least.  She had already reached her chest, and was wriggling from side to side in an attempt to coax her ample chest through. Her boobs were quite malleable, however, and she was able to work them in with a combination of wriggling and exhaling the air from her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nightelf rogue was currently fighting an internal struggle of her own.  On the one hand, she wanted desperately to stop Kara from advancing, given how much trouble it was to force her body through the first time compared with how much more plump she was now.  On the other hand, this appeared to be the only exit, so she knew the two had to try and escape, even if Kara couldn't get through without Raven's help.  Raven didn't think she would actually mind this, and realized she enjoyed palming her companion's bare backside a lot...probably much more than she should have, and was trying to fight off the erotic thoughts that flooded her mind.  As she watched the torchlight cast dancing shadows across the now-voluptuous curves of the girls completely exposed ass, that fight became more and more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara had reached her midsection, which was still encased in her ready-to-burst light armor, and had completely filled the opening. She wasn't moving, but the warrior was determined, shoving against the outer wall and wriggling back and forth.  \"...I don't..remember..*uurrf*.. it being.. this....*nnnh*..tight!\"  She said to nobody in particular as she kicked her legs behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes could barely touch the floor, so she was unable to get any leverage from her legs.  Finally, with one final heave, her tummy burst free from the threshold.  \"Whew.  There, that wasn't so ba..*Oof.*\"  Kara progress was abruptly halted halfway through as her hips began to press against the inside wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering her strength, she took a deeph breath and pushed her hands against the mound, pointing her nose to the sky grimacing through gritted teeth.  Wriggling her behind and kicking her legs, she pushed...and pushed...and pushed.  For several moments she pushed, her torso stretching out from the straining, but to no avail.  She hadn't managed to budge even the smallest fraction of a centimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*HNNNNG!*..Ohh!..*NNNRRPH!*..Oh no!..*HUUURR!*..stuck..*UURRPH!*...oh help!\"  She stopped and her torso snapped back into the hole. \"OOF! Raven! Raven help! I'm stuck!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfectly obvious that the volume of Kara's swollen ass was too great for the tiny hole.  Raven was suddenly faced with a very difficult decision, which she debated in her mind...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She shoved herself back, hard, thinking <i>please budge, please budge, please just a budge</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had no luck: and Raven's was running out as well, as the back wall opened up to reveal a second, hidden door: and Gregor walked in, followed by four goblins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What 'ave we here?\" the gnome laughed. \"Did someone's chubby bottom not make it through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven unsheathed her weapon and stood between her trapped friend and their captors. \"Undo the spell, and I won't kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that enchantment wears off...in a few days,\" he cackled. \"My green friends 'ere will come back for you then, lassie,\" he called to Kara. \"In the mean'time, they'll be taking you wi' them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gasped in panic. Raven was about to be attacked....and she was helpless! And if Raven was taken, that would her here, alone with Gregor...and no way to defend her bare bum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kara went wild with panic inside the cave walls, Raven launched into warrior mode, kicking, punching, and slicing at the goblins left and right. They were slow and stupid, but also strong and unfazed by her blows. She decided to target one at a time and went for the largest, aiming straight for his eye and landing a brutal kick that sent him groaning to the ground. A second grabbed her around the waist and a third seized her weapon, and she landed another carefully aimed kick at the one closest to the door, before elbowing the one holding her in the eye. He dropped her, startled, and she raced for her weapon, bending low to the ground....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...which proved to be her big mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her crouch, the goblin she'd half-blinded surged forward and hit her dead on, knocking out her breath. He seized her around the waist and surged upward, so she hung down his back, legs kicking wildly down his front, and her own butt now bared and tilted upward...beside the monster's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo!\" she wailed, as two other goblins least forward, one seizing and clamping her kicking legs together, and the other getting a firm grip on her beating fists. The fourth approached with two bares of metal shackles and, as Raven screamed \"get off me, put me down, don't touch me!\" and Kara howled \"Raveeeeeen!\" her hands and feet were clamped firmly together, and she hung in a squirming, captive mess over the monster's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, lads!\" Gregor clapped, laughing. He'd made his way over to Kara and was seated on a stool, watching the action. \"Seems we have two ladies in rather helpless straits!\" He reached out and ran his fingers along Kara's trembling cheeks and clucked. \"Been in to me butter, lassies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Kara wailed, as the gnome removed all of Raven's attempted efforts, and thereby ensured she was stuck until the enchantment wore off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your kind chased me out of me mines, and them kind chased out you. I just want to be left alone and so do they.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better let us go,\" Raven snapped. \"Because there's a lot more of us, and they'll wonder where we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No there aren't--or you'da brought 'em along,\" he smiled and gave Kara a good hard smack on her rear. \"Gives a whole new meaning to 'butter buns,' eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch her!\" Raven roared, as Kara screamed and tried to wiggle out of the sting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd worry more about meself if I was you,\" he said, and nodded to the goblin, who gave a deep laugh, turned, and sank his teeth into her upturned cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....oooow!\" Raven wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven!\" Kara screamed, as the gnome began rubbing up and down her shaking butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara...I'm sorry, I'll--\" she gasped as another smacked a thick hand across her own struggling cheeks, and then a third lay his sticky, cold palm over her bare bottom...and squeezed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor waved. \"Goodbye, night-elf...your friend and I have several days together...I wonder how we should spend them? Lads, you've earned it...give 'er a good taste of what this 'ere lass is feeling, having her poor bottom all touched when she don't want it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven fought desperately to get free, but her bound limbs and prone position made it impossible. The goblins chuckled as they carried her toward the back door, where she twisted to see her friend's pale legs frantically kicking. \"Kara...I'll come back!\" she wailed as the gnome gave her friend's butt a good hard pinch and her friend wailed. She'd promised she'd get her out...and now she was being carried off into the darkness, leaving her vulnerable, helpless....and so, so stuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara heard the back door shut and her friend's cries fade away. Outside, the gnome pinched the fattest part of her cheek, than gave her a few fake pats: nothing like the reassurance her friend had offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me girl...your bum seems to be taking up my front door and a good portion of my wall...what shall we do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeelp!\" Kara wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Make me thinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Gregor laughed. \"The spell didn't fatten ye up, your gorginn' did 'at, ye' emptyheaded girl -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Emptyheaded' isn't even a real insul -- \" Kara mouthed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer big fat butt is yours to keep, ye dummy. That's not magic, 'at's overeating.\" Kara gasped as Gregor continued, \"The desserts were enchanted to make it so's ye can never stop eatin' 'em -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha -- \" Kara was taken aback by this news...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -- Like this!\" Gregor placed a tray of the sweets before trapped Kara, and she was stuffing her face before he had set the tray down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Gregor stood transfixed at her gluttony for a moment. She was pushing the fattening food into her face at an alarming rate. she tried to chew, but consumption was her priority, and her glazed expression made her single-mindedness even more apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, her munching and moaning sounded like she was saying \"More,\" which animated Gregor. He had to make sure she stayed trapped and fed! He ran inside to get more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's gluttony was overpowering, and her brain shut down while she was stuffing herself. Gregor was not prepared for her ability to binge. He had to keep up with her capacity and baked and cooked as fast as he could. Always, he added his secret enchanting butter, which kept Kara mindless and gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd gain she did. By the end of the second day, Kara would have been able to notice her upper body overflowing her leather armor. Seams were straining and jiggling flesh bulged wherever it could. Her arms fattened, and her breasts grew beyond what her armor was made for, overflowing her cups. Her belly was constrained within the hole to the mound, but it overflowed above the tight restriction, just under Kara's breasts and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's gain was centered, as always, on her lower body: her thighs thickened into unwieldy trunks, widening smoothly as they curved into her hips, flaring out obscenely to either side. Her hips curved into her giant butt, fattening rounder and bigger and wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor's gnome-sized house was not that large. Kara's booty was prominently on display, completely unable to be covered by her ineffectual skirt which had long since torn away. It jiggled and bounced as she stuffed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor was not happy. This was hard work! There, in his house, was his creation: the fattest butt he had ever seen, asking to be pinched and spanked. But no! He had to slave over the stove to sate his prisoner! The most he could fit in was a quick grab and squeeze on his way back in from setting another mound of food in front of Kara's glazed, round face. This was supposed to be fun! He was supposed to get to play with her! By the end of the day, he was so exhausted, that he fell asleep in his chair, only to be woken by her stomach growling out of hunger in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kara wasn't stuck, Gregor would not even get the little sleep he got. The spell was so strong that Kara would gladly have eaten till she burst, ten times over. But she her belly was so tightly trapped that she could only fill it so much, giving Gregor his respite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second night, Kara finally began drifting off into a food coma with her mouth clotted with pastries that she was unable to swallow because her body was literally filled to the brim. \"Oh you best finish this,\" Gregor said wearily. He took the remaining pieces of pastry and pushed them into Kara's face. Her cheeks were bulging with food, but she wanted to swallow it. She was in a daze, but slowly, as Gregor forced the last food between her full lips. Once she swallowed, with great effort, Gregor was done for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor took a moment to admire his handiwork. There it was: her enormous booty stretching out into wide hips, weighing down her thick, blubbery thighs. He came up and poked into it, and his hand just kept sinking into its soft fat. He jiggled it, and waves rippled back and forth, and up and down Kara's legs. Her butt cheeks lightly slapped against each other as the jiggling slowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a moment that he heard a creaking. A very slight sound. The last seams of her armor, maybe? But he wrote it off as exhaustion, yawned, gave a good night spank, and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before she ate them, she had a moment of lucidity, and she yelped and demanded that he release her from the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance, dearie,\" Gregor said, as he put a fresh, hot, pile of food in front of Kara's face. \"Why on eart' would I say th' magic words,\" he taunted her, \"that only I know! When I can make ye fat an' give ye' t' th' goblins? Then ev'ryone'll leave ol' Gregor alone!\" he got angry and happy as he yelled, and took a big, fattening treat from the pile and shoved it forcefully into Kara's mouth. He enjoyed silencing her protests with more fattening food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reverse the spell -- *urf* *gulp*\" Kara yelled, but was drowned out by Gregor stuffing her face. There was no hope. She began swallowing as fast as possible, but it was much more difficult than the day before. The hole wasn't growing at all, but she certainly was. Kara's gulped and chomped loudly, and in between swallowing, moaned with little, pleased grunts. She was working hard, breathing heavily, and her gluttonous sounds enticed and annoyed Gregor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to torture her, and made sure he was shoving more into her full lips than she could hold, and making sure that she was swallowing uncomfortably overflowing mouthfuls. After several pastries, as her belly filled up, held tightly in her constricting trap, her swallowing slowed down. That was his chance to really make her gorge herself, and Gregor piled food into her mouth faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor, in focusing on forcefeeding Kara, wasn't paying attention to a consistent creaking and groaning sound coming from her midsection. She was so full that it hurt, but the spell overwhelmed any actual thoughts about her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor continued to feed Kara pastries, with an energized mixture of anger and pleasure. \"Take that!\" he grunted, \"An' that!\" Kara, gluttonous and spellbound, tried very hard to gulp as much as Gregor pushed into her. The creaking became ever louder as she consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the pile, Gregor realized that he had better go make more. Kara would steadily feed herself the rest, anyway. Gregor stepped back and brushed sugar and icing off his hands, while Kara choked down her mouthful. Dutifully, she reached for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed that her movements were slower. Her face and arms were rounder, but her overfed belly was bulging out around the edges of the hole she was trapped in. She was a big muffin top with a face, arms, and swollen boobs. He thought he was wrong, but it looked like she was sinking deeper into her own fat, like she was pulling back into the hole. It must be her fat swelling up because it had nowhere else to go, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor went back inside, and Kara ate. Neither paid attention to the loud creaking, groaning, and snapping sounds coming from Kara's midsection.</span></div></div>",

The hole she was stuck through was squeezing her middle tighter and tighter as she filled up and out. Her body was full of fat everywhere, making it harder to move and flex. Even feeding herself was exhausting. She couldn't do it fast enough; it was like the food was getting farther and farther away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Kara, she was actually getting farther from the food: her butt was weighing her down so much that it was actually pulling her backwards into the gnome's house. As her body added pounds of jiggling jello fat to her butt, it pulled her back inch by inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's weight was more than the gnome's simple entrance could take. The wood around her was buckling and creaking, and each crack that split the doorframe a little further allowed a little more of Kara's upper body to ooze backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flab was not fitting through the hole, though, so Kara's round face and arms were sinking backwards into her ample, jiggling boobs and belly. Her belly was overflowing the hole in a ring of blubber. Her boobs were being pushed farther up by her belly fat, and her chin was nestled deep in her cleavage. Her fat arms stuck beside her face, squishing her cheeks. She strained desperately to push one more lard-drenched pastry up to her face, but she couldn't flex her arms far enough. Exhausted, she dropped it onto her breasts as her arms reeled, pawing at the air to try to get to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt landed just in front of her chin, and after swallowing her mouthful with a gulp, she tried to reach that enticing pastry with her lips and tongue. When she stuck her jaw out, she just barely touched the powdered sugar coating with her lower lip. She licked off that amazing sweetness and it drove her crazier that she couldn't just fill her face with it and guzzle it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted and moaned, but with each wooden creak from the doorway, her enormous butt pulled her backwards into her blubber a tiny bit more. She was trapped, but this time by her own flab!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached her tongue out and brushed against the pastry, and this time, disaster struck! Her attempts sent jiggling ripples across her boobs, and the pastry fell forward from the shelf of her bosom, completely out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still for a moment. There was still food around her, but she couldn't get to it! She thrashed, but all that did as make her jiggle, and each movement caused a loud crack to emanate from the frame, hidden under inches of flab, and she slipped ever so slowly away from her treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strained like that for quite some time. She had barely gone this long without stuffing her face in three days, and her brain was addled by her food-addicting enchantment as well as her terribly uncomfortable immobility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kara heard a loud snapping sound and suddenly jolted back about a whole foot. She was momentarily startled out of her gluttonous need...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did Kara actually burst from fullness?! instead, he found Kara's mouth empty and the rest of the pile of treats uneaten. She was squirming and straining but couldn't get to the food. He was pleased, thinking that she was immobilized only by being so fat, and not because she was being slowly pulled backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned for more, but he didn't feed her right away. She watched him roll up that little message to the goblins and stick it into a tube on the leg of a large bat, and let the bat fly off. Kara's food-addled brain noticed, even as she licked her lips in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Gregor began to feed Kara the rest of the treats. And he didn't hold back. She couldn't keep up, but he pushed more and more into her mouth. She gurgled and sucked down the desserts even though her body was so constrained that she was at her limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere from her midsection, Gregor heard a loud groan, like the sound of a wooden ship in a storm. His mean little gnome heart would not have regretted it if she had burst apart, even though the goblins wanted her alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell wouldn't let her stop swallowing, even though, as Gregor neared the end of the pile, Kara's body was at its limits. Another deep creaking resounded from her flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGurgling and moaning, Kara couldn't even close her mouth around the last few pasties, which Gregor had violently jammed into her face. Gregor pushed and shoved in order to fit every last bit between Kara's lips. Her cheeks were bulging and red as Gregor made sure each crumb entered her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother terrible, cracking vibration resounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Kara swallowed the mouthful. Her brow was beaded with sweat. She was so painfully stuffed that she was in tears, but nothing could stop her from desperately wanting to keep eating. So, despite her drum-tight belly and the loud creaking, she gulped. She couldn't even close her lips all the way, and small bits of gooey filling sprayed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally finished overeating, a terribly loud crack shuddered through her body. Another followed it, leaving her confused and wedged within her own tight flab.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor thought of the turgid size of her rump, and realized that if she exploded, she would destroy his home.

The air still smelled of Gregor's baking, and with even a tiny whiff, Kara's thoughts went straight to food. Her belly was still stuffed but growled slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted it softly, \"Sorry, there's no room for more,\" she said to her stomach, \"and I can't risk getting any fatter.\" She patted a hip as she said that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the spell addling her rain helped keep her anxiety about her fatness in control. If she has really understood how big her butt and hips were, she would have given up on the spot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to find Raven to help with the spell, so Kara decided on the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wobbled forward, taking her first steps gingerly. Her hip was wider than she accounted for, and as she shuffled forward, it bumped the table away from her. She no longer had any support to lean on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her arms out to the sides to keep her balance as she relearned to walk with this new weight. She took another step, and her other hip flared out and knocked into a shelf. Books and candles crashed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wobbling step. The floor creaked ominously under her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lower lip in nervousness, but slowly waddled the short distance to the back door. The floor creaked louder with each step, and as her hips and butt swayed side to side, she bumped and jostled the furniture in the tight space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so frustrated, but she was going to escape! She had trained in heavy armor in the past and was force to carry bucketloads of water when she learned her fighting skills, so she could adjust to carrying her immense new weight. If only the room weren't so darn small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lurched forward to the doorway. It was only a few feet away, but it felt like it took forever. This entrance was also round, but it was a vertical oval, so a human like her could step through. She was kind of short; she guessed absentmindedly that Raven would have had to duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung outwards and was still left open from Gregor's last use. Kara hoped he wouldn't find her out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wobbled and leaned her bulk forward to take a step. Her round belly led the way, followed by her breasts. As her shoulders passed the doorway, her forward motion stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to see that she was blocked by her...</span></div></div>",

She couldn't help but remember how intense it felt was when Gregor fed her so forcefully, and she unconsciously pressed more and more into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor creaked ominously but Kara didn't notice.

Her puffy cheeks and pouty lips were covered in sugar, and she was so tightly squeezed against her own blubber that it was exhausting to reach forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the last few pastries on the tray. She tried to reach for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer angry belly groaned. The floorboards groaned in response.

She fell further in but was wedged even more tightly against her flab.

You see, we're looking for a friend who was taken from us, and we thought she had been taken through here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that explains all the racket,\" the Elf nodded. \"I take it you mean the goblins are up to their old tricks.\" Kara nodded. \"Well, I may have some information which could help you.

I can't move--and you can't move me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara bit her lip and gave the night-elf's bottom several reassuring pats. Raven twitched her hips and let out a sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did we go this way? What made me think I could fit in here? What will I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there,\" Kara soothed, and added a second hand to her friend's butt. \"There, there. Everything will be alright. I'll go for help; there's a village nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No--don't leave me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't take long, I promise! I'll bring tools and men and we'll have you out and back to rescuing in a jiffy! We've been in tight spots before,\" she said, trying to lighten the mood, but it was lost on the helpless bottom writhing against her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise you'll come back?\" she whimpered, twisting around to once more view her embedded hips and smushed, overblown bottom. On the other side of the rock, Kara's hands moved steady and warm over her exposed and vulnerable cheeks, petting and patting in an effort to sooth her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise. Just hang on. Nothing will stop me from freeing you!\" Kara gave her friend's right cheek a light squeeze, several more reassuring pats, and then turned and ran back the way they'd come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven waited, breathing hard, listening for some sign of life...but she was alone. She hung there in silence, the fight draining out of her, exhausted and embarrassed and trapped in the most vulnerable position of her life. Outside, her butt refused to give up the fight, and continued to half-heartedly twitch and wiggle, as if refusing to accept that it couldn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help will be here soon,\" Raven told herself, wiping tears from her eyes. \"Kara will be back, I'll be out, and this will just be part of another adventure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rear finally gave up the fight and hung there, idle and helpless. The warm sun shone on the smooth, blue skin of her legs and gluten, causing her to stand out against the bitter rocky stone. To the forest around her, she seemed at ease, confident and comfortable while waiting for help she trusted was already enroute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never occurred to her that she wasn't alone!</span></div></div>",

The food had been drying up since the orcs moved in--they enjoyed hunting and killing just about anything, even the small creatures that normally wandered into her web. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her search for a hearty breakfast, she started down the steep cliff-face, intrigued by an oddly blue, bright, smooth surface jutting outward from the barren rock. She made her way tentatively toward it, pausing to see if it moved or resembled her normal prey. There was the occasional twitch, but other than that, the thick new resident was still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she made her way over, testing one leg, than two, than four before crawling up over the newcomer. It was surprisingly smooth, warm, and soft, and the surface sank slightly along her feet without the danger of her sinking completely inward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then--it erupted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Raven's tranquility was shattered as she hung there, taking deep breaths and telling herself to stay calm. \"Help's on the way,\" she reminded herself, twisting around to view her entombed hips. \"Help's on the way,\" she repeated to them. \"We're going to get out of here.\" On the other side of the wall, her bottom twitched once more. \"I've just got to keep calm and wait for them to get here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished Kara could have stayed: as embarrassing as it was, her friend's hands on her trapped rump had done a lot to reassure her. She wanted, NEEDED, comfort and calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then something brushed over her left butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she thought it was just the wind, or perhaps a leaf, but the slight tickle became firmer and harder. Something large, hairy, and prickly was crawling along her upper thigh and over the crest of her bottom, something with far too many legs, eyes, and teeth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SPIDER!\" Raven screamed, and erupted into panic. She squirmed, twisted, and bucked against the rock face in a desperate effort to dislodge it, but all it did was dig in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider clung to the gyrating creature with all her might! She wasn't sure how far the fall would be if she lost her grip, and she didn't want to let go to find out! The awful screeching noises from earlier were back with vengeance, and she realized she'd located the creature who had disrupted her morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was tasty or not---it was pay back time! She let down her fangs and sunk them into the soft, supple surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEEEEEELP MEEEEE!\" Raven screamed, but no one but the cheeky spider heard her cry.</span></div></div>",

Come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara trudged warily behind him. The village was quiet, many of its occupants clearly deep in their work or out in the woods. They passed several small shops, wagons filled with grain, and a group of women carrying water from the river, before they came upon a small cottage with a cheerful vegetable garden and a dozing dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, Buckeye!\" the man called. \"We gots someone in need of ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and an imposingly tall, muscled, weathered-looking man with gray hair and a wild beard stepped out and nodded to them. \"Aye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pointed to the flushed warrior. \"Lass here says she's got a friend lodged up in the cliffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best come in, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man allowed Kara to pass as Buckeye made his way over to a set of wooden table and chairs and had a seat, gesturing for her to join him. The other man stood inside the door with the rifle, obviously slightly suspicious of the young warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were ye doin' up on the cliffs?\" Buckeye demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara quickly explained--their friend, the orcs, their mission, their discovery of the entrance, and her friend's poor, trapped predicament! The elder man nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ye've come to the right place if ye want her out of there. I've made a bit of a livin' gettin' ladies out of tight spots. Not for free, mind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can offer you treasure from the orc hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ye can free your friend and GET to it. There's many a tight spot going through there, believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pay you! But you have to help us, please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuckeye sighed and got to his feet, pulling a leather satchel packed with tools down from a shelf and beginning to fill it with bottles of oil and ointments. \"What's stuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man glared at her. \"What part of her be stuck? How far in is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Um...she made it up to her hips and...backside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her arse didn't fit, eh?\" he smirked. Kara blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter! She's my friend, and a warrior, and she needs help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does so matter, for my work,\" he snapped. \"When you're caught by the belly or the bottom, there's lots of give.

The elder man was gruff but determined, and his brisk pace and long legs meant Kara had to double her efforts to keep pace with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was glad, because it was getting her all the faster back to Raven!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a minute or two away when Kara thought she heard something: a shriek? Or a bird call? The pair doubled their efforts as the cliff face appeared, and Raven's shapely, meaty, hapless bottom came into a view. The night-elf was in a state of pure panic, her wedged butt bouncing and jiggling as her legs flailed. It didn't take long to realize why--he humongous wolf spider was digging into her butt cheek!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off!\" Kara screamed, and ran toward her wailing friend. She scanned the area until she found a solid branch, than ran toward her, took careful aim, and brought the wood fast and firm over her friend's lodged backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO!\" Raven howled. The spider fell to the ground, dead, but the Night-elf continued to struggle. \"Please--that hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven, it's me!\" Kara cried, dropping the branch and putting her hands over her friend's trembling cheeks. \"I'm sorry,\" she soothed, rubbing gently along the angry red line the branch had made. \"But I'm here...I've brought help, just like I said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Kara,\" Raven sobbed and went limp with a final twitch of her aching hips. \"Thank God you're here! Everything hurts...I think I may be stuck worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there,\" Kara murmured, patting her friend on the thick, meaty crest of each cheek. Despite the terrible situation, Raven's bottom was beautiful: thick, meaty, soft, and perfectly shaped around the hole. Though she told herself she only wanted to comfort her friend, Kara couldn't help but enjoy smoothing her hand's over the beautiful warrior's posterior, pausing only to place reassuring pats along her quivering cheeks. \"I'm here now, and I've brought help. This is Buckeye,\" she said, turning to the villager. \"Buckeye, this is Raven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, I see that.\" He said, eyeing her critically. \"In a tight spot, aren't ya miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven twitched her hips. \"I...I couldn't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye both were foolish. I can see from the trail that yer arse won't budge in a hole that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's face burned with shame. \"Just help me, please! I don't want to be in here anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuckeye placed his bag on the ground and began rummaging through it. Kara gave her friend a light squeeze and let go. \"What do we do now?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two jus' hold yer horses while I examine that hole,\" he said, than called to Raven, \"Right, lassie. I'll need to have a good long look at your bum. No kickin', understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara patted her friend's wedged rump once more. \"It's okay, Raven. Trust him.\"</span></div></div>",
