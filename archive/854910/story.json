            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(This is after Tommy has regained his Green Ranger powers.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's another bad day in Rita's moon base, as the Rangers have defeated one of her giant monsters yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have such a headache!\" Rita whined. \"And I'm so tired of this! I send a monster, they beat it up, I make it grow, they blow it up! Argh, what should I do?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My emperess, why not use your staff to make one of the Rangers grow?\" Goldar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that you monkey-brain?!?\" Rita yelled at him. \"So they can crush my monsters even EASIER?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my emperess, your evil energy of the staff will surely turn the Ranger you choose evil as well. They'll become a giant, evil Ranger on a rampage, and do you think the Rangers will want to kill one of their own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is brilliant!\" Rita yelled. \"I'm glad I thought of it! Let's see who I can make grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kimberly left the Youth Center after a long day of gymnastics. She had a towel wrapped around her waist to hide her leotard, which exposed her incredible butt to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly wasn't exactly happy. She had fallen off the beam while practicing and Bulk and Skull had mocked her. Sometimes, she thought, it would be nice to not be so tiny. Sure, she had Tommy and Jason yelling at them for her, but it would be nice to push those two around for once, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, her wish was about to be answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" Rita yelled as she looked through her telescope. \"Here's little Kimberly, all by herself, with none of the other Rangers in sight. Well, Kimberly, you aren't going to be little anymore. Grow, my Kimberly, grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed her wand down to the Earth below, as she always does, and waited for the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kimberly walked through the parking lot, she thought she must have been a little tired, as she could have sworn she saw Rita's wand land into the concrete in front of her! She soon realized she wasn't sleepy, and there it was. As Kimberly walked towards it with curiousity, she realized she had left her communicator back inside. Before she could turn to go get it, however, the wand glowed red and blasted her with its energy. She began to feel dizzy as the wand disappeared in front of her- and then, suddenly, she felt powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredibly powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sly smile, she watched as she began to grow bigger. Her bare feet spread across the parking lot, her legs became longer, and her body reached higher and higher into the air. The leotard grew with her, but the towel was long gone, leaving Kimberly in nothing but the leotard. It's not like she cared at this point, though- the power was filling her mind with evil thoughts, and she began to get caught up in the moment. She closed her eyes as her body became larger and larger, and she began to draw attention from everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the Youth Center was abuzz as people began piling out of it to see what the commotion was about. The five other Rangers inside turned to each other, shrugged, and walked outside as well, and Bulk and Skull soon followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they saw when they were outside shocked them, as Kimberly was still growing. She finally stopped as she reached the same size as all of Rita's monsters. Finally, she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIMBERLY!\" Tommy tried to yell up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recieved no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she can hear you up there, Tommy.\" Jason said as he stared at Kimberly's huge toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this have happened?\" Trini wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, human beings do not just expand at such a ratio.\" Billy remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked at her face, which had a sly smile at the sight of all these little people gathered below her incredible body, and then watched as her eyes glowed red. Having been under Rita's control as well, he knew what the signs were, and glowing eyes were certainly one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Rita, you guys.\" Tommy said. \"Her eyes are glowing, that's what mine were like too when Rita had me under her control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others looked upwards as Kimberly continued to smile down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evil thoughts continued to fill Kimberly's head, her mind suddenly turned back to what she had wanted to do even before Rita's energy had corrupted her. With another smile, she began to reach downwards with one of her mighty hands. Everyone parted ways as Kimberly reached and grabbed....Bulk and Skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help uss!\" Skull whined as they were brought upwards towards Kimberly's huge face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommmy!\" Bulk yelled as Kimberly looked down at them in her incredible hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Kimberly, put them down!\" Jason yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she heard them, she ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, looks like the tables have turned.\" Kimberly taunted them as she poked both of them with her other hand's index finger. \"I'm the big one now, and I'm the one who's going to pick on the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, we're sorry, just let us go!\" Bulk begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's not an option.\" Kimberly taunted them. \"You're going to come with me as I destroy this city, then I'll decide what I'm going to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her words far below, the other Rangers once again yelled at Kimberly to stop. However, the incredible giantess ignored them as she turned and began walking further into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Rangers knew they had to do something, but what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Rangers watched, helpless, as Kimberly began to stomp down the road deeper into the city. Her huge feet crushed cars and people desperatley trying to escape the pale white flesh, but weren't lucky enough to avoid them. Her feet were incredibly huge, and Kimberly loved the feeling of power as she crushed person after person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have any choice, guys.\" Jason said, turning to the others. \"We have to get the Megazord and try and stop her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't hurt Kimberly, man!\" Zach spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one wants to, Zach.\" Jason replied. \"But we have to stop her somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded as they morphed into their Ranger forms. Tommy, meanwhile, left to find his own way to stop her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulk and Skull clinged for dear life on the gigantic fingers of Kimberly's right hand as the giantess continued to stomp her way through the city. She stopped as she reached the middle of a city where the tallest building only reached her chin, and most of them were chest-level. She smiled as she raised one foot and crushed an elevated train track like she had seen so many movie monsters do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know why all these monsters are always attacking Angel Grove.\" she smiled. \"It's so much fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This part isn't fun for the monsters, Kimberly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly turned around to spot the fully-formed Megazord standing across her. She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the Rangers come to stop the big bad Kimberly?\" she teased. \"Do you really think you can hurt your precious friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimberly's friends with the Power Rangers?\" Skull asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly heard him and turned her eyes down towards the two tiny bullies clinging to her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, I still have you two.\" she grinned. \"Here, catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw Bulk and Skull into the air, and they screamed as they plummeted towards the ground. The Megazord managed to outstretch its hand and catch them in time, but this gave Kimberly the opprotunity to rear back and kick at its head with one of her massive bare feet. However, all that did was hurt her foot, which she pulled back and sent crashing to the ground with a massive boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just a normal human fighting a Megazord at this scale.\" Billy called from inside the Megazord. \"It's pointless to try and fight us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly gritted her teeth and tried to grab the Megazord and pick it up, but she strained and held her back in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how big you are you can't pick this Megazord up.\" Jason said. \"Give it up, Kimberly, we'll get you some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want your help!\" she spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the Megazord angrily. Was she really going to lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita herself was none too pleased in her moon base, watching her giantess lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh, she's doing even worse against the Megazord than one of my overgrown monsters!\" Rita said. \"Isn't there anything I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my emperess, I may have your answer.\" came Finster's reply as he walked out from his monster-making area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, spit it out dog-breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, humans are more stable than our monsters. You couldn't use your staff to make a monster grow any bigger because it would overload the monster's energies and destroy them. But a human.....a human should be able to grow even bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Rita boomed. \"I'll make her grow even more! Magic wand, make my giantess GROW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita threw the wand down towards the city, and both the Megazord and Kimberly watched as it landed in front of her big toe. The wand glowed red, and then what did it do?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, it glowed red and zapped Kimberly, just as it did before. Kimberly laughed as she quickly became even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?\" Trini asked Billy. \"We've never seen Rita make her monsters this big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human DNA must be more stable than her monsters.\" Billy realized as he watched Kimberly tower over the Megazord more and more. \"Thus, she can use more power on a human and make a human grow bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly kept on laughing until she had expanded to twice the Megazord's size. She looked down at the Megazord as her growth slowed, then stopped completely. It was once the same size as her, but now it barely came up to her waist! She looked down at the Megazord, smiled, then reached underneath the Megazord's armpits and lifted it up to her face like it was a small child!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that you said, Jason, about not being able to pick up the Megazord....no matter how big I get?\" Kimberly taunted him inside the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly watched as the Megazord lowered its hand to allow Bulk and Skull to climb off onto a tall building's rooftop. They cowered from the incredible giantess in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always thinking of others.\" Kimberly said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Kimberly, let us go!\" Trini yelled from inside the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Kimberly simply let go of the Megazord, sending it crashing down to the ground below. The Rangers inside the Megazord's head tried to recollect themselves following the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we move?\" Jason finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative.\" Billy replied. \"The Megazord's never taken that kind of drop, its parts are severely damaged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smirked down at the Megazord, stuck laying on its back, before walking over towards it. The Rangers watched as one of her incredible feet crashed into the ground next to the head, causing a minor earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rangers, it looks like your lives are in my hands.\" Kimberly taunted them. \"I wonder, should I spare you or finish you off right here?\"</span></div></div>",

They were literally fearing for their lives as Kimberly prepared to finish them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how should I destroy you?\" she wondered aloud. \"Maybe I should just rise one of these huge feet of mine up and crush your cockpit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly rose her huge foot upwards, smirking down at them, before the Rangers' entire view was taken by the middle of the bare sole. They looked up at the sole covering their cockpit in fear as Kimberly continued to press down on it with greater and greater pressure.

But things were looking bleak as the gigantic Kimberly continued to exert great preasure on the downed zord.<br>\r\n\"You can't hold for much longer, rangers! Why don't you escape so that you can live for just a little longer?\" Kimberly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, we don't know how much longer this thing will hold together!\" Billy shouted.<br>\r\n\"We gotta hang in. Kimberly's life depends on it!\" Jason said. Just then, an explosion ensued behind Kimberly as she felt something strike her. She ended up falling back, crushing a few buildings underneath her weight. She got up and looked to see the Dragonzord out in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Tommy!\" the rangers shouted in unison.<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! I heard you were having some big problems with Kimberly, but this is serious stuff!\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n\"Tell us about it. But did you really just shoot Kimberly with your missiles?\" Zack said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, guys. It wasn't a direct hit. Just enough to throw her off balance.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly soon got back up, towering over both zords once more.<br>\r\n\"So... my one and only Tommy decides to put up a fight now. Oh, I'm sooooo excited.\" Kimberly said in a sarcastic manner. Tommy looked over to the downed Megazord.<br>\r\n\"You guys get back to the command center. I'll try to hold off Kimberly for as long as I can.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n\"Right. And Tommy... be careful. Both yourself and Kim.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Tommy said. Soon, the other rangers disappeared from sight, as did the Megazord as it teleported back to wherever it was that it was stored. It was now the giant Kimberly and the Dragonzord standing tall in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I may not have been able to get rid of the other rangers, but I'll be just as satisfied when I've defeated you!\" Kimberly said. Tommy, by this point, had leapt out of the cockpit of his Dragonzord and was standing to the side where Kimberly wasn't paying any attention to.<br>\r\n\"Now to think of a way I can save Kimberly without harming her too much.\" Tommy said to himself.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunatley for him, his playing of the flute attracted Kimberly to his position. Tommy's view was soon taken up by her gigantic mid-section, as the skyscraper he was standing on didn't even reach the top of her waist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are my Tommy!\" Kimberly boomed high above him. \"What do you say we go on a little.....well, for you little anyway.....date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Tommy's protests, Kimberly reached down with her huge hand and grabbed the bug-sized Ranger with one of her fingers. She moved her hand up to her face, marveling at how tiny he looked, like a little ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you'll have a front row seat to see me crush that little Dragonzord of you....hey, where's it going?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly watched as the Dragonzord turned it's tail and started running as fast as it could out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here!\" she roared, and began to give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatley for the Rangers, however, what they forgot was that she was even bigger than she was before, and the people still trying to escape had no chance now. Her gigantic soles covered both lanes and even the sidewalks, stomping on sometimes up to fifty people at once, sometimes several cars! Tommy watched in horror as her face turned to one of girlish delight at the feeling of the people meeting their end at her incredible feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm having some fun on the way out, isn't that right Tommy dear?\" she teased him as she saw his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the child-sized (to her) Dragonzord lead her out of the city and into that famous abandoned rock query where almost all of the Rangers' zord battles seem to take place. Looking around, she quickly stomped on a relativley small mountain for fun, crushing it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the Dinozord!\" she boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could attack, however, suddenly Trini (now demorphed) teleported directly in front of her. She looked up and realized Kimberly's TOES- her TOES!- were towering over her, bigger than she was! She had to stop herself from teleporting out as she looked up at the gigantic big toe above her, threteaning to crush her at anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what is teeny tiny Trini doing down there?\" Kimberly boomed from so far above. \"You're not even morphed?! Well, now I'm insulted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait and see, Kim!\" Tommy yelled from her hand. \"She won't be teeny tiny for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Command Center, Zordon ordered the growth ray to be fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai yi yi yi, right away Zordon!\" Alpha yelled as he pressed one of the buttons on the control panel. The ray of energy fired out of the top of the Command Center towards the battle's location.....the question was, did it hit its intended target....or did it strike Kimberly?!</span></div></div>",

He played his Dragon Flute again, trying to get the Dragonzord back into action. It got back to its feet and again slashed Kimberly in the back of her knee with her tail. This soft, sensitive spot was hurt and Kimberly cried out in pain, causing her to once again drop Trini. With a glare, she turned to Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough of you!\" she screamed in rage as she held the back of her leg in pain. \"Who needs a boyfriend the size of a speck anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove her point, Kimberly stepped forward with one of her enormous feet, and even though she had been quite far away, Tommy still had to roll backwards to narrowly avoid being crushed by her right big toe. The toe that had towered over Trini before when she was normal-sized now absolutely dwarfed Tommy. It was the size of a small building, Tommy would have needed a very tall ladder just to reach the top of her toenail. He was nothing compared to her, he realized, a speck that she could barely see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an evil grin, Kimberly began to wiggle her toes. This very simple act on the part of Kimberly had huge repercussions for the tiny Tommy, as he had to roll backwards again to narrowly avoid being crushed by her humongous too. And even once he was out of its range, he couldn't stand up from the earthquakes that resulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wiggling her toes makes the ground shake more than your biggest earthquake.\" Tommy muttered. \"She's almost godlike now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demorph, now.\" Kimberly boomed from the heavens. \"If you want to live another second you'll do what I say, otherwise I'll crush you out of existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy slowly realized he had no other choice but to do as his giant girlfriend said, and quickly demorphed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy. Now, walk forward and kiss my big toe. Show me that you love me and worship me and maybe I'll let you live a little longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was sickened by this request but he realized Rita's power had her on a major headtrip, so he did as he was asked. With little hesitation he walked forward and began  rubbing and kissing a spot on the building-sized toe. Kimberly could barely feel it, but she focused on the tiny speck and could see that he was doing as she had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Tommy. Too bad I still have to obey my Empress and end your puny little existence, because I'm having fun with this. Oh well. Goodbye, lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly raised her impossibly huge foot up, but just before she could lower it down she was again stopped....this time by Trini! The smaller giantess had recovered from her fall from Kimberly's arms just in time to grab the much bigger, evil giantess by her foot and push backwards. With only one leg to support her balance, the enormous Kimberly yelled out in surprise as she fell backwards, crushing another small mountain under her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Kim, I'm shocked, for a gymnast I thought you'd have more balance than that!\" Trini teased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly only growled in response as she held her back in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini turned to look down at the tiny Tommy, and Tommy in turn stared up at the more friendly giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to get out of here, Tommy, at your size you won't last another second against Kim. She might crush you without even knowing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!\" Tommy yelled up at her. \"I tried to teleport out before but she must have damaged my communicator with the earthquakes she caused with her toes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Command Center, Zordon and the others were watching on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that, Zordon?\" Zach asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately I did, Zach. Tommy can't get back here, and we can't bring him back because Kimberly being so huge is jamming our teleporters, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't let him stay there at that size, though!\" Jason said. \"Trini's right, she's going to crush him for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the only logical thing to do is enlarge Tommy to Trini's height.\" Billy said. \"The growth ray is recharged now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if the ray hits Kimberly, again?!\" Zach yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a chance we'll have to take.\" Jason said, agreeing with Billy. \"Alpha, do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha looked up at Zordon for confirmation, and he slowly nodded. Alpha fired the ray, and all five of them hoped that it would hit its target...or at the very least, Trini again and not Kimberly!</span></div></div>",

Tommy felt an intense wave of power (and pleasure) as he began to grow. Both Kimberly and Trini looked on in surprise as Tommy grew until he was the same size as Trini &amp; the Dragonzord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hey there.\" Tommy said as he looked into Trini's eyes. Trini hugged her giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might want to save the reunion.\" came that same godlike voice from high above. Both Tommy and Trini turned back around and looked up....way up. There she was, still towering over both of them. They each stood barely as tall as each of her knees. \"So Tommy grew too, big deal. You're still just little children to me. And bad little children get spankings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and with a colossal hand, smacked them both with a single blow. They both fell to the ground in pain, the ground shaking from their combined weight hitting the earth below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right, Tommy.\" Trini said between gasps as the blow had knocked the wind out of her. \"Even with you here as big as me, we're still no match for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not. But maybe, with some equally big help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy pulled out the Dragon Flute and began to play it. The Dragonzord quickly reacted and walked over to where they were. Tommy was thrown by staring face-to-face with his own Zord; sure, he had been this big before when Rita had enlarged her Evil Green Ranger, but that was before she had given him the Dragonzord, so this was still a new rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there buddy, we need your help.\" Tommy said, scratching his Dragonzord behind the ears like it was some kind of pet. The Dragonzord turned and slashed for Kimberly's inner leg again, but this time Kimberly dodged out of the way. As she did that, however, both Tommy and Trini lunged for her legs, and the two giants managed to take her down, Kimberly again screaming as her huge body fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we've got her down, let's keep her there!\" Trini yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they could do anything else, Rita had taken notice of them from her castle. With an evil smirk she had come up with another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two more huge Rangers, huh?\" Rita said. \"Well well, Zordon, thanks for delivering two more giant servants to me! Magic wand, make those giants grow- and make them evil!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw down her wand and waited for her magic to kick in.</span></div></div>",

Both their eyes glowed that same red color, and then the wand vanished just as Kimberly was standing back up to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean what I think it means?\" Kimberly boomed, biting her lower lip in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as she said it, Kimberly got her answer. Both Tommy &amp; Trini began to grow bigger and bigger, until they had each doubled in size. Now both were twice as big as the Dragonzord, and both were just past Kimberly's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're bigger.\" Kimberly said. \"The more important question is, are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the colossus couldn't even finish her question before she got her answer, as Tommy reached down and grabbed his own Dragonzord, lifting it up to his face like it was a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you anymore.\" Tommy sneered at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, who needs a zord half their size?\" Trini snorted in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy threw the Dragonzord to the ground below, where it hit, hard. Sparks flew and smoke momentarily came out of it before it vanished back to the zord bay with the equally damaged Megazord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you two have come around!\" Kimberly boomed as they both craned their necks up to look at her. \"After all, what's the point in being all-powerful if you don't know how to use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't agree more, Kim.\" Trini nodded with an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We belong on the same side.\" said Tommy as he hugged one of her huge legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly reached down and picked Tommy up, lifting him to her face, before she began to kiss him ravenously. Tommy felt her much larger tongue force its way into his mouth, and he kissed back, feeling the rush of making out with someone twice his size. Kimberly then slowly and gently lowered him back to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you two, there's plenty of time for that.\" Trini said. \"Let's go crush Angel Grove before everyone's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Kim, let's do it....together.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smirked evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you.\" she boomed. The two smaller giants nodded and began to walk back towards the city, their footsteps shaking the ground violently, and then Kimberly too began to walk making the ground shake even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nightmare.\" Zach said with despair in his voice as he watched the scene unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, there's still people left in that city. We have to get back there and try and stop them.\" said Jason slowly, as even he really didn't want to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?! We couldn't stop Kimberly when she was a regular 'ol giant, now she's four times her size, and oh yeah Tommy and Trini are twice as big as she was!\" Zach yelled. \"How can we do anything to even slow them down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can distract them, that's all we can really hope to do.\" Jason said. \"But we had to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And clearly the experiment on Trini &amp; Tommy showed that we cannot try to use the growth ray on one of us, because Rita will only make us even bigger- and, more importantly, evil.\" Billy pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid both of you are right.\" Zordon said. \"Growing one of you is out, but you do have to go there and at least try to slow them down and give the people enough time to escape. Go there, now, before Kimberly arrives and we aren't able to teleport you there anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three slowly nodded as Jason yelled \"Back to action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments they were on top of one of the remaining buildings in Angel Grove. Just as they teleported in, however, everything began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?!\" Zach yelled. \"I don't see any of the three of them, did Rita send Goldar here or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Zach...I believe that the three of them are now so big, even though we can't even see them yet their footsteps are still able to make the ground shake. They are, after all, quite humongous.\" Billy slowly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy.\" said Zach simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, since Kimberly was twice as big she could see farther into the distance than Tommy or Trini, and the colossus saw three different colored flashes head down towards a building in Angel Grove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have even more good news, guys.\" she said as she looked down at the two smaller giants below her. \"Our little 'friends' just teleported onto a building in Angel Grove.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now we can crush the Power Rangers AND wipe out Angel Grove all at once.\" Trini smirked evilly. \"I like it, I like it alot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason's mine.\" Tommy grinned. \"After all, I'm his 'bro', it's only fitting I crush him to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want Billy, payback for having to translate his stupid nerdtalk all this time.\" Trini said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that leaves me with Mr. Token himself, little Zach.\" Kimberly boomed. \"Oh well, can't win them all. I'm still the biggest after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tommy and Trini nodded as they continued to approach the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earthquakes back in Angel Grove grew more and more strong until the three Rangers could make out their three humongous friends in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god....I knew they'd be big but look at them!\" Zach stammered. \"We don't stand a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to hold our ground, Zach, and do what we can.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't do ANYTHING, that's the whole point!\" Zach yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and Trini were in front, and they both stepped into the city and crushed the sidewalks and roads with their huge bare feet. Both maneuvered so they were each on one side of the building, Billy closest to Trini's side and Jason closest to Tommy's, with Zach stuck in the middle. They each looked up at one of their friends' crotches, as the building didn't even make it up to their mid-sections. Zach, meanwhile, stood straight ahead at the even more colossal Kimberly, who was still further away on the outskirts of the city but was so big that the buildings in front of her didn't even reach her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, look who it is.\" Trini grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our little friends!\" Tommy said. \"People always say before you get to the top that you won't forget all the little people, but we actually didn't. Isn't that right Trini?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, absolutely Tommy.\" Trini said with mock sweetness. \"You're all we've been thinking about this whole walk back. Well, thinking about crushing, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, Zach watched as the titanic Kimberly simply watched with a look of amusement on her face, not moving a muscle. Suddenly, she began to raise one of her monolithic feet upwards, and put it down towards a crowded highway in front of her. Hundreds of people who had ended up stuck in traffic trying to escape the doomed Angel Grove ran from their cars, trying to somehow escape this foot. But her foot was so big now, she covered so much ground that they would have had to run for miles just to get out of its range. In another words, they didn't have a chance, even though she was lowering her foot very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three tiny Rangers on the building and their two much bigger friends all stood and watched, transfixed by what they were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Kimberly, don't!\" Jason finally screamed out, but she was so high above and far away that there's no way she could have heard him. The foot came crashing to the ground, crushing all the fleeing people and their little cars right out of existence. The resulting earthquake from Kimberly bringing her foot down so hard shook the building they were standing on to its very foundations, and the building began to collapse. All three jumped forward and down, landing hard on the ground and narrowly avoiding being crushed under the building's ruins....and then they realized just where they had landed. They had landed in front of Kimberly's building-sized toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you again, Rangers.\"</span></div></div>",

The Rangers attempted to fight off the Putties while still keeping one eye on the giantess to see what she was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Rita's words had some effect on her, she still seemed hesitant to attack her friends. Rita was quickly losing patience with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimberly!\" she roared up at her. \"If you don't squash those tiny little Rangers right this instant, I'll shrink you down myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly gritted her teeth angrily. She didn't want to step on her friends, not really....but she sure didn't want to be small again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason punched a Putty aside and then just barely caught Kimberly's gigantic foot coming down out of the corner of his eye! He rolled forward and came within inches of her right big toe, so close to being stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimberly don't do this!\" Jason yelled up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to!\" she boomed. \"There's no other way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she stepped forward and again Jason narrowly dodged her gigantic foot. A Putty Patroller, however, was not so lucky, and he was crused underneath the enormous extremity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was enjoying the sight of the Pink Ranger forced to turn on her own comrades, when suddenly, she felt the presence of someone else teleport in behind her on that rooftop.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lord Zedd had been planning this all along; he'd just been waiting for the right time. <br>\r\nUnlike Rita's ridiculous monster-making machine that did nothing more than poorly mimic his magicks, Zedd's staff was the genuine article- an item that had the power to transform any item of his choosing into a fiendish monster, so long as it was either alive, had some emotional attachment, or both. <br>\r\nHis next design had both: Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Lord Zedd had always had every intention of transforming at least one of the Rangers into his monsterous slave; not only would it cut down on their numbers, but the resulting abomination would be far more powerful than the ordinary cut, with all the magical energy already coursing through their veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had Lord Zedd waited so long to inact this plan? He'd just needed one of the Rangers to slip up and feel darkness within their heart. Kimberly now felt such darkness...anger, envy, and a lust for size, power, and recognition. Kimberly was vulnerable, and Zedd knew the perfect form to grant her, one that would give her everything she desired, thus enabling him to affect her with his evil magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing standing in his way was the morpher. As long as she had that, there wasn't anything he could do to her. His signiture red rays of transformation would simply rickochet off her, and it would be clear to the entire ranger squad that Zedd was targeting her. In the midst of the feelings of fear and paranoia that those events would cause, the petty gymnastic rivalry would all but be forgotten, and so would Zedd's chances of making her his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZedd knew that he must act quickly, while the poker was still hot. The darkness in Kimberly's heart would only stay so potent for so long. Zedd needed to rid the girl of her weapon, so he eyed the park she was walking in for any potential candidates. He spotted a stray female dog and a bouque of crushed flowers in a trash bin... someone had been dumped recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dumb animal and an item with a negative emotional attachment...almost too perfect, except such a plan would come with a high cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three transformations, all almost at once... it will cost me nearly all of my energy, and then some... but it will be all worth it...GOLDAR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my liege.\" Said the lumbering fiend, walking up from behind Zedd's throne. Suddenly, Zedd wrenched his clawed hand around Goldar's throat, and began sucking energy he had previously instilled in him for just such an occasion. Goldar had no knowledge of this energy; Zedd had simply used his body as an energy bank. When the quick transference was through, Zedd left Goldar wheezing on the floor and turned his attention back to Earth- there was no time for an explaination. Zedd held up his staff and sent beams of red lightening crashing down to Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so fast, Kimberly had no time to react. One moment, a large collie was sniffing her heels as she walked by a trash bin, then suddenly, a flash of red blinded her. The next thing she knew, her arms were being firmly grasped by two huge, inhuman hands, while the dog was gone and the bin tipped over and in their place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful...BEAUTIFUL!\" screamed Zedd, and not just because his plan was going off without a hitch...he was being quite litteral. Both the dog and the flowers had been transformed into undoubtably his most attractive breed of monsters ever: Amazons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, his new Amazon-monster theme was quite ingenious. While the pre-transformation ingredients had to consist of either a living female creature or something linked to the female gender (such as roses), they came with many new advantages. For one thing, they were incredibly strong and durable; the Rangers would be splintering their fists just trying to get a punch in.  But at the same time, they were not just huge and strong; they were also beautiful. Gorgeous. Their breasts, huge. Their hair, long and luxurious. Their butts, bubble-shaped and firm. Their hips, wide; their waists, hourglass-shaped. And with this beauty came a siren-like ability to command males who felt attracted to their goddess-like bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first two test subjects had blossomed beautifully; Werezon and Rozon. Werezon had formed from the stray collie into a giant werewolf amazon, with a humanoid body, but the head and hair of a Collie. Her mane had become like long human hair, and she had hair on her dog-like tail. The rest of her body had short, human hair, but her voluptuous body was wrapped in a brown dog-skin dress (think Giganta's outfit from Challenge of the superfriends- all amazons have the same type of dress in this story).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRozon had come from the roses, of course. (To save a long explaination, she looks almost exactly like Lilymon did in the first Digimon season, except she's got the Amazon figure and is dressed in an Amazon dress with red rose prints all over it. She also had two rose buds jutting outward from either shoulder blade).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kimberly had a chance to realize what was going on, Rozon and Wereon, both a gigantic 8 feet tall, grabbed her from either side while Rozon snagged her Morpher from her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sugar\" Rozon said with a heavy southern belle accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have it back...as soon as you're our QUEEN.\" barked Wereon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the signal that Zedd needed. He sent down the beams that would change Kimberly's life forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awaken, AMAZONIA, THE PINK AMAZON RANGER!!! MAKE THIS WORLD MINE!!!\"<br>\r\n***********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the red lightening bolts hit Kimberly, Rozon thrust the morpher onto Kimberly, allowing the Power Ranger magic to mix with Zedd's. Since Kimberly was already being transformed, the morpher's magic would now only add to Zedd's own, creating the most powerful creature Zedd had ever produced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRozon and Wereon were both blown back by a sphere of pink light that enveloped Kimberly's tiny form like a cocoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bubble, Kimberly was experiencing a power that tempted her with all the power she desired, and in her moment of weakness, she welcomed it, and it flooded into her, transforming her. She transformed into the pink ranger, and then back to her normal form, as if saying goodbye to both. Then she appeared in her ranger outfit, but without the helmet, and that's when the change began. The pink and red lightening bolts danced all over her form, changing every cell in her body from human to the same maleable substance that composed all of Zedd's monsters. Kimberly was no longer human; she was a monster now. But the changes were far from done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brunette hair grew tumbling down below her waist, her body became an exact copy of the two other amazon monsters' bodies, and then doubled in every aspect (her muscles, breasts, and butt became twice as big) She became a whopping 9 feet tall, and her Pink Ranger uniform began to change as well. her gloves, shoulder sleeves, belt, and pant legs disappeared, leaving only the dress and miniskirt, which became an all-pink amazon dress like the other monsters'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the change had completed, Rozon and Werezon looked on in awe at their new Queen. Kimberly the human was gone; before them stood Amazonia, the most powerful and beautiful of the Amazon monster trio. With the powers of both the Pink Ranger and the Amazon-monsters at her command, she was truly a sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth to speak... </span></div></div>",

She could feel the delightful power coursing through her transformed flesh, and it made her just want to purr in delight.  The transformation from human to monster had left her senses on hyperdrive, making her new form oh so much sweeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered exactly what this new body could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she went exploring, she realized that she must first take care of some business with her creator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod to Rozon and Werezon, the former Pink Ranger beamed herself and her fellow amazons to the moon, arriving instantly in Lord Zedd's palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...Amazonia!\"  Zedd cackled in glee.  \"you are more breath-taking then I could have imagined.\"  the evil lord rubbed his hands together.  \"With you under my command, the rangers will be brought to ruin and the Earth at last under my control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazonia nodded.  \"Yes...\"  She said, even her voice altered.  Where once it had been light and bubbly, it was now smooth and sensual.  \"There is but one thing you missed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what might that be?\"  Zedd asked in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazonia laughed too...right before she grasped Zedd by the throat, lifting him into the air so she could look him dead in the eye, her face twisted in dark humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be I that conquers the earth...not you.\"  Zedd's panic grew as he found he had not the strength to stop his newest monster.  Amazonia marched over to the balcony, and with a heave, threw Lord Zedd into space.  \"Much better.\"  She laughed, marching back to the throne.  She picked up Zedd's staff, and focusing, transformed it into a wooden war-staff, better fitting of an Amazon Queen. Testing it, she could already feel its power flowing through her.  There was no need for Zedd\u2026she could do fine by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Seating herself down, she turned to Werezon and Rozon.  \"Find that golden baboon Goldar and the rest of Rita's former lackies.  I want them dead and gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two amazons nodded, journeying deep into the palace.  There would be no stopping them, and in minutes the palace was empty save the 3 amazons and the dead bodies of its former owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...the era of Zedd is over...now we may begin our rebuilding of the Earth in MY image.  An Amazon paradise!\"  Looking down at the earth, the monster forming known as Kimberly thought.  Currently, her tribe was small.  That would need to be fixed. But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could find more women to...liberate.  She remembered well her past life, and began making a list of all her fellow sisters she would want to induct into her tribe. Namely, her friend Trini.  The fellow ranger would definitely add power to her tribe, and weaken the rangers with her loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, did she run the risk of Trini trying to overthrow her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, there was a slower way but funner way to build her tribe.  The Amazons may hate men, but that race did serve one purpose.  What better way to build her tribe then to have daughters, not sisters, utterly loyal to their Queen and Mother?  Her new monster form was designed to aid this, and she knew that her children would grow strong quickly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as an added benefit, she could use her former 'love' for the task.  She smiled as she thought of Tommy.  It would be a simple matter to make him a monster like her, only weaker and slower...a creature made only to bred.  And the children of two former rangers would be much stronger then that of herself and a mere human. She would even be willing to share her slave with Rozon and Werezon...more torture for the man that suppressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut could she wait for her tribe to grow so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen, the rest are dead, as you commanded.\" Werezon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right...what be your next command?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking up her mind, Amazonia spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Easy to bring into the tribe.  And I will bring her into the tribe...\" The Amazon Queen smirked.   \"But what better way to confuse my former friends then by sending another one of their own against them.  That is the great failing of the Rangers: They are warriors, yet they are unwilling to do what they must do.  When confronted with the former yellow ranger...it will leave them in disorder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazonia did not reveal her real reason for wanting Trini:  She knew the girl had been loyal to her former self.  And when Trini was one of them, she would be loyal to her queen even more.  Before Amazonia could risk bringing in powerful warriors, should would need a loyal inner circle to keep the rest of their sisters in place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini was just that girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, go my sisters...find Trini and bring her home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini sighed as she stepped into her hotel room.  While the work she was doing may have been interesting to most people, after her days as a power ranger little could be done that would excite her the way being a ranger had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndropping her bag to the ground, she moved towards the bathroom, needing to splash some water on her face.  Bending down, she turned on the taps and gave her checks a good scrubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she stood up that she saw the dog-woman and rose-woman standing behind her.  She didn't even have a chance to scream before the two grabbed her and warped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Trini awoke, she found herself in a darkened room, strapped down to a table.  Shifting around in a panic, she found that the bindings held her tight, preventing her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the most of her clothing had been removed.  She was now only wearing the short skirt and undershirt she'd been wearing before the two monsters had grabbed her. Trini's bare toes curled as she shivered against the hard metal table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax.\"  A smooth voice called out.  \"Everything is going to be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who..who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazonia stepped out from the shadows, Werezon and Rozon joining her.  \"The being that is going to change your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute for Trini to realize just who she was looking up.  \"Kimberly?\"   She whispered, looking at the 9-foot tall woman. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazonia's frowned. \"Kimberly is dead.  In her place is a much stronger being...Amazonia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimberly...this has to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dream?\"  Amazonia laughed.  \"Oh no...Lord Zedd was kind enough to free me from my weak mortal form before I tossed him into space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God Kim...\" Trini whimpered, tears in her eyes. \"He turned you into a monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRozon raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow.  \"The new breasts and ass don't give it away,  hun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazonia nodded. \"Yes Trini, he did.  I am not immortal, perfect and powerful...and I plan to give you the same gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?\"  Trini shouted, struggling against her bonds once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving over to one of Zedd's special potion shelves, Amazonia picked up a vial.  Trini couldn't help but notice how her monstrous friend's ass rocked back and forth playfully as she moved about the room, Kim's bare feet slapping against the cold floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...because you do not have your power coin, I must use something else to bond the magic to your form.\"  Amazonia held up the vial.  \"I think it will be most ironic to use the dna of a sabertooth tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim...please don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\"  Amazonia shouted,  summoning her war staff.  \"Soon you will be on your knees before me, my loyal subject.\"  She lifted her staff, chanting softly as she poured the essence of the tiger onto Trini's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim....\"  Trini whispered, a tear running down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark Magic, transform this girl!  AWAKEN TIGAZON!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast of magic hit Trini full force, causing the former ranger to buck in agony.  Unlike Zedd\u2019s spell, Amazonia\u2019s did not need for the subject to have darkness already on their mind.  Instead, it would seek out the dark corner of their mind and bring all their evil thoughts to the surface, changing everything good about them to wicked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini let out a wild scream as her body began to grow, the bonds holding her down snapping.  Her legs elongated, her hair grew down to her ass, muscles filled out her limbs.  Her breast, ass and hips all expanded rapidly and to pornstar proportions. Trini\u2019s very DNA changed instantly, now that of a monster, no longer even close to being a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed six feet, Trini\u2019s body underwent its second change.  All along her skin, dark strips began to appear, the inner most tips almost touching her nipples.  On her hands and feet, her nails turned into razor sharp claws.  Mouth thrown open, she let out a roar as her canines became long, like some vampire\u2019s  fangs.  Finally, as she reached 8 feet, her eyes snapped open, revealing green feline eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazonia grinned as she looked down at her beautiful creation.  With her new amazon, it would be so easy to round up more of her sisters for transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwaken, my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ranger known as Trini opened her mouth and spoke\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zed rested back in his common throne and looked down to the ones standing below him. It was always the same thing every plan he had. The rangers would find some new and improved way to stop him, no matter how powerful his monsters were. Holding his Z topped staff at a slight angle and running his free hand over it he thought deeply. Think of a new twisted way to strike down on Angel Grove and the rangers. Then as his state of mind was begging to dwell deeper into the evil resides, his train was broken. By a loud, high-pitched, annoying crackle of a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed turned his head ever so slightly and watched as Rita entered into the room. The mist looming just above the floor spreading out and whisking off in another direction as she walked in a hustle. Her long heavy robes making a hard swish sound with each stride she took. Just being in the room for mere seconds she started to complain the second her gaze rested on Zed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you just sitting there for!? We have to think of a way to destroy the Power Rangers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woman, Will you quiet down and let me think!!! I'm bound to come up with a new plan sooner or later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so far, the only thing I've seen from you Zed. Is nothing but failure!!! I'm about ready to go down to Angle Grove and take care of it all myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...Rita why don't you go do that! While you're down there why don't you rid us of their Zords as well, Heck you could even destroy Zordon. Because we all know Rita your plans are just so grand and they always work out! Oh wait...The Power Rangers are still here!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita fed up with Zed's taunts turned away and lifted her robe slightly. Enough for her to walk away faster than normal. However before taking her leave from the room she obtained her staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Rita was on the outskirts of Angle Grove, resting in a rocky area as she paced back and forth. Taking a second to bite her nail idly as she thought of how she could get back at Zed. Then it hit her, She had the power to do it, she would just have to destroy the Ranger's source of power before she did any damage to Angel Grove. Why hadn\u2019t she thought of this before? With an sinister laugh and a quick whip of her wand, Rita was off. Not only to destroy the command center of the power rangers, but to finish off Angle grove as well. That would show Zed who could come up with a better plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in their common area of their hang out, The power rangers were having a laid back conversation about how things had been so calm in Angel grove lately. Tommy looked down to his watch and then smiled before standing up and nodding to everyone before taking his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll catch you guys later, With how quiet it's been I think I'm going to go and check on Zordon and Alpha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone said their good-byes and Tommy quickly made his way outside, then making sure the coast was clear, Tommy teleported to the command center. As his line of sight became less of a blur and Tommy felt his feet on the hard metal of the command center hall way, he began walking towards the main core of the center. The door looked blasted ad charred and Tommy's eyes opened wide in shock. Grabbing of the slightly gapped door, Tommy pulled away the left panel of the door and made his way inside the core. Everything was destroyed, everything. It was as if a tornado hit and made sure to stick around to add insult to injury. Zordon was nowhere to be found and Alpha was in bits and pieces all over the room. Rushing over to the head of Alpha, Tommy poked it a few times before it buzzed half to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Tommy...Thank goodness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alpha! What happened here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R--Rita came, I don't know how she found us...But it was like nothing we've ever seen before, She had new found anger...She sent us to Ruin Tommy. I..I...Don't know how you are going to stop her. Zordon was taken away after Rita did the dirty work...And without him. You won't be able to active your powers...or the zords Tommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alpha, There has to be some way to stop Rita! Something, C'mon Alpha stay with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T--T--Tommy...There might be a way...you need to use whatever power is left in the control board and summon another...Maybe whoever you can get...will be able to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Alpha...Who do I pick, How do I pick?! How do I know it will be someone who can help!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Tommy...You may not have your powers...but you still have the heart of a ranger and you will know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the flashing buzz of Alpha's head censors clicked off and Alpha was silent. Without wasting another moment, Tommy rushed over to the somewhat ruined control panel and felt out which buttons to press. Then hitting a large red button near the middle of the panel, the entire area exploded in a hail of sparks. Tommy dived away, covering his head as the sparks hit his bare arms. Lifting his head after the burning in his arms died down, Tommy lifted up to a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On no...It didn't work...And now it's only a Matter of time before Rita attacks Angel Grove and we won't be able to---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was cut off as the tube in which Zordon would normally be in lit up with a new found light. Then the light grew bigger as it filled the entire room. Tommy had to turn his eyes to slits as a figure walked down from the steps to Zordon's tube. Then light dimmed and Tommy could make out the figure. It was male and seemed to be rather tall. He looked to be a normal human...only his ears seemed long and sharper than most. His eyes were a mixing blue color and his attire wasn't uncommon for someone in Angel Grove. Tommy stood up and walked a few feet closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...Are you here to help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... ... ...That I am... Tommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other rangers were just leaving their hang out, When the ground began to tremble lightly. Then as the small earthquakes grew in power, The rangers could see some of the cars in the parking lot lifting from the ground from the quakes. There was a loud pitched scream and the Rangers looked up into the sky. There...Was Rita, Only now she was 500 times her normal size. She must have used her staff on herself again, only this time it had a much greater effect. Rita's large foot slammed down onto a near by van, The van was lost in an instance and the only thing left was a flat piece of scarp metal in a rather large ditch in the middle of the road. People were running all over trying to escape the walking feet of Rita, but it was useless, they just couldn't avoid their doom. With another loud and hard quake Rita was upon the rangers. Looking down at them with a menacing grin. Jason took a step forward and looking back at the others, They took the stance as if there were about to transform, but nothing happened...Then they were all over took in a shadow as Rita lifted her foot...</span></div></div>",

That could only mean a giant monster was in town, right? Actually, things were different this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a giant girl walking slowly through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, in her street clothes (shorts, yellow tank top, and tennis shoes), flashed a smile as she watched the little people of Angel Grove run for safety. She had no intentions of harming them as careful as she was.<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's amazing. The kind of view you get from being this big. It's easy to see why Astronema doesn't hesitate in enlarging her own creatures.\" Ashley thought to herself. She walked around a corner, actually touching a building with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Ashley heard a familiar call in the background.<br>\r\n\"Ashley!\" Andros shouted. Ashley gasped at hearing the voice.<br>\r\n\"Stop simulation!\" Ashley shouted. Just then, everything, including the people and the city, vanished as the view returned to the main cockpit of the Astro Megaship. It turns out Ashley was using the simulator device to pretend she was a GTS. Just as the room returned to normal, Andros walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Andros, also in street clothes, said.<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah. I was just practicing my moves in case any quantrons show up on our week off.\" Ashley said, smiling to convince Andros that she was doing just that and not stomping all over a virtual Angel Grove as big as Astronema's monsters would.<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. I just wanted to let you know we're a few minutes away from landing on Earth.\" Andros said.<br>\r\n\"Great, thanks!\" Ashley said as she left the main room and Andros walked in to land the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the Angel Grove Juice Bar, Andros and the other rangers were about to head inside for a short break from their fun activities on Earth.<br>\r\n\"Well, we're here. Might as well go inside.\" Andros said.<br>\r\n\"You guys go ahead. There's this real cool shoe sale down by the mall I want to check out!\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n\"Now since has Ashley been into shoe sales?\" Carlos said, laughing with TJ.<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay, Carlos! Go ahead, Ashley. We'll be here.\" Cassie said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Ashley said as she ran off while the others went inside the juice bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn space, up in the Dark Fortress, Astronema and Ecliptor were busy thinking of a plan to stop the rangers.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Ecliptor, think! There must be some way we can stop those rangers!\" Astronema said.<br>\r\n\"I know, my queen. I am thinking as hard as I can think.\" Ecliptor said. Suddenly, Darkonda and a group of quantrons entered the room, with Darkonda holding a small device.<br>\r\n\"Astronema, my queen, the Simulator Data Thief device you gave us worked like a charm! We got some interesting footage to show you!\" Darkonda shouted.<br>\r\n\"Well, don't just stand there you idiot! Play it for me!\" Astronema said. Darkonda quickly pressed a series of buttons on the device, and a holographic image was projected on the nearby walls of the fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked on with astonishment as they saw the footage of the giant Ashley stomping around a made-up virtual version of Angel Grove. After the video played for a minute or so, Astronema walked around in a circle, thinking.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... it seems the little yellow ranger dreams of not being so little anymore.\" Astronema said.<br>\r\n\"You have a plan, my queen?\" Ecliptor asked.<br>\r\n\"Better than a plan... it's the plan that will help me destroy those cursed Power Rangers! Darkonda? Where is that girl now?\" Astronema said. Darkonda looked on the visual radar to lock onto Ashley a football field's length away from entering the Angel Grove Shopping Mall.<br>\r\n\"Why... it looks like she's heading for that shopping mall place. And she's all alone to boot!\" Darkonda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Ecliptor, lock the satellasers on her!\" Astronema said.<br>\r\n\"Huh? Are you sure, my queen? The evil energy of the satellasers haven't been fully energized. It's a 50-50 chance she'll either be big and work for us, or be big and be our undoing.\" Ecliptor said.<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to take that chance. And no matter which way it goes, there will be widespread panic all over Angel Grove. Now do as I say!!!\" Astronema shouted.<br>\r\n\"At once, my queen.\" Ecliptor said. He pressed some buttons and soon the satellasers fired down onto Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was several yards away from entering the mall when she saw a green light coming down towards her.<br>\r\n\"What the...? That can't be Astronema's satellaser beams!\" Ashley thought to herself. She held her head from pain and found herself growing in size. She would eventually wind up to be the same height as any of Astronema's monsters would grow to, but how did it affect her mind?</span></div></div>",

Please can you help me understand what's going on?\" the people started running and screaming as usual Ashley repeatedly tried to calm them down \"Please! Please! Don't be scared I won't..\" but as she took a giant step forward she slipped and fell down on the cold hard ground sending several people in the air screaming and sending shockwaves and a earth quake enough to sink half of California in the sea Ashley's big butt crashed into a few stores in the way including the shopping mall she was headed to \"Oh no! Owww! That hurt!\" she moaned but then it gore several times worse as some of the people descending towards the ground actually fell into parts of Ashley's body including her tank top cleavage, her flat stomach,into her belly button and unfortunately her shorts Ashley felt extremely uncomfortable at the sudden squirming and screams of the tiny Angel Grovers wiggling around in her breasts,belly and front part of her shorts and starting to giggle as some of the squirming around tickled her \"Ohhhhh Haaaaaa! Stoooopp! Heeeeeethathaaaaticklesss!

All from memory so if I got anything wrong, I apologize.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, the guarding Quantrons moved out of the way as Astronema entered the room. She looked at Ecliptor by the Satelaser panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was so important that you needed me for, Ecliptor?\" Astronema asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted you to see my new invention in action, my princess.\" Ecliptor said with an evil glare. \"Remember the Evilizer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, it failed! What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have combined the technology of the Evilizer with the Satelasers to create the Evilaser! Now we can make something not only evil, but big as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on....\" Astronema said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to zap one of those meddlesome Rangers with the Evilaser and watch as they grow into an evil monalith capable of taking down the other Rangers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't attack their own.....it's brilliant, Ecliptor.\" Astronema said with an evil grin. \"Make with it then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcliptor watched as he saw Cassie on her way out of the mall, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the Pink Ranger.\" Ecliptor said. \"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed a button on the panel, firing the laser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie stopped on the sidewalk to take her sandals off, which were bothering her, and adjust the heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr, stupid things.\" she said as she set them down next to her with her bags. She wiped her forehead- it was HOT. She had on her normal pink sweater and black jeans, probably not the best wear for the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she looked up at the sky and, for a split-second, spotted the green ray coming down towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that....can't be....UGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was zapped by the ray and held her chest in pain, collapsing onto her knees. Everything started getting blurry, and then she felt very different. She felt.....strange. Almost as if she had lost a part of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and saw some kid walk into her bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! That's my stuff!\" she screamed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid ran away, but she wasn't having it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here you little brat!\" she yelled as she chased him down the sidewalk. However, in chasing him, she bumped into TJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Cassie, calm down, where's the fire?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little brat stepped on my stuff!\" she yelled, pointing back at her bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they WERE in the middle of the sidewalk, Cassie, I'm sure he didn't mean it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?! I'm gonna kill him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't like Cassie, TJ thought. What was going on? And wait....was it just him, or did she look bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't she getting big and stomping things?\" Astronema asked him. \"This isn't working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's working.\" Ecliptor explained. \"Look at her, she's already up to the Blue Ranger's height and growing bigger, and she was going to kill that small child, which isn't exactly a 'good' thing to do. My calculations must have just been off- because the Evilaser is trying to make her both grow in size and become evil, it's going to be a much slower process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....this could be interesting.\" Astronema said as she continued to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTJ followed Cassie as she stomped her way back to her stuff, angrily putting her stuff back into her bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you stopped me from giving that little brat what he deserves!\" Cassie said in a rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you just chill out?\" TJ asked her. \"What's up with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, Cassie thought, what IS up with me? This isn't like me....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she blew it off as she leaned down to put her sandals on....and found that her feet wouldn't fit in them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with THIS, is my question....\" Cassie said as she frusturatingly tried to squeeze her feet into the now too-small sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fidgeted with them and pulled on them as hard as she could, but her feet were now far too wide to get in, and even if they could they were probably far too long to fit there anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" TJ muttered....and then watched as Cassie stood up to her full height. \"Geez, Cassie, look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the span of a few moments, Cassie had grown to 7'2, now towering over TJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" Cassie said as she looked down at the now-tiny TJ. He only came up to her chest, as the amazon towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotten bigger.\" TJ said in disbelief. \"And I think you're still growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That laser!\" Cassie exclaimed. \"It was a Satelaser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they zap you with a Satelaser?\" TJ asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T KNOW!\" Cassie screamed at him. \"How should I know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, we just need to get you back to the ship.\" TJ said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Cassie agree?</span></div></div>",

Her huge bare feet echoed on the steel as they came down, her body stuffed into her now too-small Ranger uniform. The gray pants were doing a bad job of stretching out and covering her backside and full reaches of her legs, her pink shirt was stretched over her bust tightly, and her gray jacket looked like it was about to tear right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Andros and Carlos were speechless. Cassie, in her newly uninhibited state, was growing annoyed with their awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know I'm a freak, cut it out, okay?!\" she yelled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mouths remained unhinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thinks she got zapped with a Satelaser when she was at the mall and, well, this was the result.\" TJ said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would Astronema zap her with a Satelaser?\" Carlos wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how come she's only around eight feet tall instead of 50 feet tall?\" Andros added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's stil growing, she looked about a foot smaller before and she's grown since then.\" TJ added. He left out the part about her going crazy and chasing after a kid for knocking over her bags, but he didn't want to get into that in front of her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Andros said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you think it's interesting, do you?\" Cassie asked him, then raised one huge bare foot and sent it smashing into the steel floor below. \"I don't call this 'interesting', Andros, I call this a problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm sorry....\" Andros said, trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, relax Cassie, he was just...\" Carlos began, but was cut off by her booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your own business, Carlos!\" she yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm just going to collect some data and then run some tests.\" Andros spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a pocket detector off of a console and walked towards the amazon female, moving it around her body and picking up readings. She looked annoyed by this, tapping her huge foot as Andros continued to scan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm done.\" Andros said, getting nervous around her. \"I'll go do those tests now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come with you!\" Carlos added quickly, and the two of them scurried out of the room, leaving Cassie....and TJ, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at the now-tiny form of TJ, a guy she had always had a crush on way back in the day when he was her Red Turbo Ranger. Suddenly, she felt herself begin to grow, and TJ noticed, walking over towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, are you alright?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded as she stopped growing at 9'7. Her head was dangerously approaching the roof of even the bridge. She looked down, way down, and now saw the tiny TJ well underneath her now-heaving breasts (barely contained by the pink shirt), staring into her stomach. She moved her arms and felt the restricting jacket tear into shreads, and then smiled at the power she just felt. Then, she looked down at TJ.....and felt something come over her. Her inhibitions were gone. She was in control. She smiled sexily as she leaned over and placed one huge hand on his chest, covering all of it with her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie?\" TJ asked, looking down at her hand and then back up at the amazon. \"W-W-What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I want to, little TJ.\" Cassie grinned as she walked forwards, causing TJ to back up into a control console. She smiled as she leaned over him, putting her huge boobs right in his face, smothering him, and then ran her finger down his chest and to his waist, before bringing it back up to her mouth. \"Kiss me.\" she said as she leaned her mouth in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTJ had no idea what to do....sure, he had always had a little flirting going on with Cassie, but this was just too weird! He struggled, but couldn't get out of her gigantic form pressing him against the console, and rather than cause an incident, he allowed her lips to touch his, and cover them completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie smiled as she stood back up to her full height, hands on her hips, reveling in the fact that his head was well below her boobs, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun.\" she boomed. \"Now, little TJ, I think I'm going to have you give me a foot rub. They hurt from when they were on the concrete before and I can't fit them into any socks or shoes, so you're going to have to help me out. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTJ meekly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Cassie grinned. She sat down on the ground, the steel causing a loud boom as her butt   hit it, and then motioned for TJ to come down as well. He leaned over, and was completely taken away by the size of her feet. Even with his in shoes, her bare feet were almost twice as big as his! That was a lot for one man. But he didn't want to make her mad, so he leaned over and began rubbing the gigantic soles with all the strength he could muster. As he ran his hands across the soles slowly, she moaned with pleasure from her pleasure points enlarged and enhanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm....keep going.\" she asid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, TJ watched as she, with her eyes closed, began to grow! This was a larger growth spurt than any of them so far, as she kept on growing, her bare feet getting bigger and bigger, until she was 12'1- more than twice TJ's size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez....\" TJ said as he looked up at the gigantic Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled down at him as she realized her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then.....I think it's time for you to give my feet some love. Kiss them.\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Are you kidding me!\" TJ exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's sexy smile suddenly turned to an angry glare. She slammed one of her gigantic fists down onto the ground next to TJ, causing him to jump up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know what's good for you, you'll kiss my feet and thank me for not hurting you.\" Cassie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight look of shame, TJ began leaning down, returning the sexy smile to Cassie's face, and began kissing her right foot. She closed her eyes and felt him kiss slowly down her right foot, then switch over to her left foot, kissing it slowly as she moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was doing this, however, something hit TJ. Was he.....starting to enjoy this? No. Couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, from aboard their base, Astronema and Ecliptor looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted her to smash them, not seduce them!\" Astronema said, more than a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is interesting, my princess.\" Ecliptor said. \"My readings show she is seducing him very well. The Evilaser energies are affecting him as well, and making him become loyal to her and, slowly, evil, as he stays around there while she's growing and giving off the energies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it make him big too?\" Astronema wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Ecliptor admitted. \"Anyway, I finished the adjustments to the Evilaser, it should work in full capacity now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the Pink Ranger is inside that ship, we can't zap her there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, my princess, there's another ranger, the Yellow one, alone in the mall, look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcliptor and Astronema watched on their screen as Ashley exited the mall with her bags, ready to go back to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting....\" Astronema said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do, my princess?\" Ecliptor asked her. \"Blast the Yellow one and make her a full-sized evil giantess, or wait for the Pink one to leave the ship and blast her instead?\"</span></div></div>",

Fire them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom high above in Astronema's base, Ecliptor nodded and pressed the button to fire the Satelasers. Suddenly, it began emitting sparks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong this piece of junk?!?\" Ecliptor yelled, banging on it with his metallic fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the Satelasers missed their target, having malfunctioned due to the increase of energy, and instead struck Astronema! She was surprised at first, but then filled with the overwhelming power as she began to grow at an incredible rate! The shocked Rangers teleported out while her monster was crushed underneath her monstorous bare foot (her feet inexpliciably grew right their her boots). She kept her eyes closed as the power continued to fill her body and she grew bigger and bigger. Soon, she was so tall that all of Angel Grove could see her expanding form, and they began to quiver in fear of the rapdily growing evildoer. Still, they stood in the streets, transfixed by the sight of the rapidly growing goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was over, Astronema was by far the biggest thing anyone had ever seen. The townspeople had to strain their necks just to take in the full reaches of her legs- in fact, the entire city was now much smaller than her right big toe. The monolithic toe rose over the city, threatening to crush them at anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstronema opened her eyes, and was delighted to see the world that laid before her. Her trademark evil grin appeared on her face as she looked down at Angel Grove, looking so tiny compared to her big toe. She looked up at the sky, knowing the Power Rangers were watching her, and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how easy it is now for me to destroy your precious city.\" her boooming voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, the people below in Angel Grove began to run, but it wasn't going to do them any good. When she rose that incredible toe upwards, the people below began praying, saying their goobyes, and begging for mercy. She hung it up above their heads for an instant, long enough to smile slowly, before bringing down her toe with incredible force. In that moment, an entire city was wiped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstronema smirked as she turned her head up towards the Astro Megaship. By just moving her big toe forward, she had wiped out an entire city. The power was incredible. And there was nothing the Rangers could do to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rangers were indeed watching from the Astro Megaship, horrified, and knowing they could do nothing as Astronema destroyed their city with one move of her toe. Ashley began to weep as Cassie tried to comfort her, while Andros felt tears welling up in his eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe my sister is doing this.\" Andros finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your sister, man, that's Astronema.\" T.J. replied. \"Dark Specter's Astronema.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, we've got to find a way to stop her.\" Carlos spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndros nodded meekly, trying to think of what their options were.</span></div></div>",

Enough!\" screamed the teacher waving his hands in the air \"You're ruining...oh never mind one of these days something bad is going to happen to all your constant eating!

The leader of the Overdrive rangers, Mac Hartford, the red ranger, asked Kamdor and Miratrix \"I guess you two aren't thinking of getting day jobs?\" as Kamdor mockingly chuckled before saying in his gruff voice \"Very funny rangers, well, I think you know that we have big hopes of finding the Corona Aroura and Miratrix will show you that bigger is indeed better!\" as Miratrix shot a confused look at Kamdor and cocked an eyebrow while the rangers looked at each-other as Kamdor put his hands together and did the motion that he usually made to summon monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he had a very different idea for Miratrix as the young woman suddenly felt herself grow as she felt a surge of power wash over her as she grew to be the size of a skyscraper, exactly the same as the megazord, as she laughed and towered over the rangers as she bellowed out \"Now <i>that's</i> what I call power!\" as Kamdor chuckled and disappeared in a puff of smoke and left the rangers to look up at the megazord sized Miratrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?...</span></div></div>",

Its time to poison this world's water supply completely go transform one of the Rangers into a monstrous giant once they're under our control we will flush the others out of hiding...\" but the Nighlok looked confused for a minute \"Turn one of the Rangers into a giant my Lord? Are you sure this is safe or wise to do?\" Xandred screamed \"Just do it fool with any luck they will destroy the rest of those pitiful humans providing their willpower isn't that strong I will send you a escort of Moogers to keep the others busy now go!\" he commands sharply \"As you wish my Lord\" the warrior Nighlok said and disappeared...meanwhile it was spring break for the local high school and Emily by herself was thinking over the Rangers' previous adventures including the time that Nighlok used powerful magical insults to terminate  her and her friends only Emily was immune and wishing she wasn't so weak and helpless she never saw the Nighlok appear by the entrance to the local park he cried out \"Feeling a little down Yellow Ranger? This will raise your spirits UP!\" as Emily spun around to activate her special cell phone he fired a energy blast straight at her torso \"Hey what are you doin...\" she screamed but stopped as her whole body felt funny then quickly like a rocket she started growing larger and larger reaching Godzilla size in less than five minutes Emily was beyond horrid at her now tiny surroundings \"Oh my- What have you done to me? I'm a giant!\" the now tiny Nighlok chuckled evilly \"Yep! you sure are Little Whoops I mean Big Yellow Ranger and its only going to get worse for you and the rest of the world from here on out well see ya later!\" as he vanished and the now Fifty Foot Emily pondered what to do</span></div></div>",
