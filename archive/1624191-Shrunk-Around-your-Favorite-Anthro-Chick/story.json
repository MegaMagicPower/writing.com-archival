You were a little nervous and everything had to be set up perfect, you cleaned your house, bought tickets to see a movie and booked a table at a fancy restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt being a blind date you had no idea what the girl would look like, but you hoped she was pretty and curvy. Soon you found out and you weren\u2019t disappointed but then again you weren\u2019t overjoyed that the dating department had set you up with a toon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door and you rushed to open it, you hesitated for a second, then turned the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed were the size of her boobs as they were pretty hard to miss. The second thing you noticed was that she wasn\u2019t even human. It was an anthropomorphic, female bear with brown fur. She had a narrow waist with a good pair of hips and large breasts. Her hair was shoulder length and red, had you mentioned the breasts? She was wearing an attractive green dress which showed off her figure and revealed a lot of her legs, black gloves and high heels, and she had big breasts. You kept remembering the breasts because whenever she moved she seemed to be able to make them bounce a little like they were trying to escape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! I\u2019m Julie Bruin!\u201d she said in high pitched, energetic voice. You introduced yourself, you were a little stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d she asked, and you nodded so she stepped over the threshold. It was then that you noticed she had a very small handbag with her around her shoulder. \u201cNice place!\u201d she turned to you \u201cso you\u2019re my blind date, you\u2019re kind of cute.\u201d She clasped her hands in front of her at her stomach and tightly squeezed her breasts with her arms so they ballooned out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting a toon\u201d you said closing the door. \u201cOh don\u2019t worry, I wasn\u2019t expecting a human\u201d you notice she was slightly shorter then you were, even in those high heels. She came close to you so you could see her face, but your attention kept getting distracted by her breasts and you fought to maintain eye contact. She looked at you like you were a prize she intended to claim as her own.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lead Julie to the kitchen where she sits down. \u201cI thought we\u2019d go to a restaurant and then go see a movie\u201d you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore we do that can we sit here for a while?\u201d she asked, even just by talking her boobs bounced. From her handbag she pulled out two milk shakes, both were pink and she set them down on the table. \u201cLets talk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually carry them in your handbag?\u201d you asked. \u201cI\u2019m a toon\u201d she said as if this was explanation enough. \u201cPlease sit and drink\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat at your table with Julie opposite as you just talked to each other. She kept prompting you to drink your milk shake yet never touched her own. Once you\u2019d finished yours she offered you hers saying she wasn\u2019t thirsty so you drank that one too. All the while Julie stared at you and smiled like she was a predator in a hunt about to catch her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done you said \u201cThese were good\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made them from a special recipe\u201d Julie said mysteriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhats so special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe milk I used\u201d she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind is it?\u201d Julie pushed her chest out so her boobs were over the table top. \u201cMy own\u201d she said, her boobs looked like they could spare a little. \u201cPlus I added a little something extra. Stand up\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust stand up\u201d you did so and then Julie walked towards you so you were face to face. Then you realised that not long ago your eyes looked over her head, now they were level. You looked down at her shoes to see if she had slipped on different high heels earlier, but they looked the same. You looked back up at her face and instead came face to face with her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Julie wrapped her arms around you and held you in a bear hug, your head was forced between the two breast that appeared to be rapidly growing on either side. \u201cDon\u2019t struggle and this will be quick. Actually\u201d and she stopped bear hugging you but instead slammed herself and you against a wall, again trapping you \u201cStruggle all you like, I enjoy this part.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your feet leave the floor as your body shrank. The valley between Julie\u2019s breasts was becoming deeper and more detailed the more you shrank. Then you disappeared into darkness as your body became trapped between her dress and the wall. Once you felt yourself stop shrinking Julie stepped back and caught you in her hand as you fell. She cupped her hands over you like she\u2019d caught a lady bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards the table and set you down. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it\u201d Julie said pushing her breasts out as if they were the benchmark which she used to judge height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d you shouted up at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMade things more interesting for both of us.\u201d Julie smiled. You tried to back away from her giantess form but she reached out and stopped you and began pushing you towards her bosom, which from your size now could kill you. She moved you so you were just under her right breast, then she did something that shocked you, she lowered it towards you. You reached up and tried to take its weight, but you sank to your knees. You felt like Atlas holding the world up and that\u2019s what you probably looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still\u201d Julie said and you saw her cell phone take a picture of you.  Julie showed it to you and it was of Julie looking down at her right breast while you tried to hold it up. Slowly she began to lower her breast more and you were forced down onto your front. You turned around onto your back to try to catch the boob and push it back but the weight was just too much. Then you gave up and the breast dropped down on top of you and you were totally covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggled under her boob Julie was just casually doing her nails with a file, her right breast bobbed around every now and again as you struggled but otherwise you were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had gotten bored of this game she lifted herself up off of you so you could scurry out from under her. You realized this was to show how weak you were compared with her and her breasts. She reached out, grabbed you and lifted you off the table. \u201cHow about that date huh?\u201d she said smiling at you, then she move you over to her cleavage and you wanted to scream as her breasts parted a little so she could place you between them. She deposited you in her cleavage and left you to settle, then her index finger hovered over your head. You looked up at her face and she winked at you \u201cI\u2019ll drive\u201d she proclaimed, and then with one push you disappeared from sight and became trapped between her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and began to move, her boobs bouncing and jiggling around you. It was bearable, slightly irritating and yet at the same time sexually pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens after your \u2018date\u2019?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julie's date with you was interesting for two reasons. For the first thing, you were in Julie's soft breasts. no matter how hard they bounced, no matter how hard you tried, her bra prevented you from escaping from the bottom of her bosom. Trying to escape from the top merely had her fingerpoke you back into her twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second thing, Julie met up with Minerva Mink and some duck dressed like Jessica Rabbit. At dinner, the trio talked about stuff like clothes, TV shows, and the like. The topic of guys didn't seem to come up, except when Minvera asked about the guy who Julie was supposed to go on a date with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's answer? Telling them your name and how you are close to her heart, just as she hugged herself to squeeze her breasts together, further squeezing you in your tomb of boobflesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then watched a movie, but Julie's bosom prevented you from watching or hearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Julie left the two women, she told them that she'd see them again. On the drive away, she pulled you out a little, so she could hear you talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had fun! How about you?!\" Julie asked with her infectious smile while concentrating on driving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... Dunno...\" you muttered. \"i enjoyed being near you, but I didn't like being ignored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie frowned in a sad manner. \"Well, little guy, I know how to cheer you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By making your home into my home away from home!\" Julie answered with a smile As your jaw dropped, she said, \"I'm sure you'll enjoy me lounging about in a tanktop and underwear. I know I'll enjoy you crawling all over my body as I watch TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mental image was pretty arousing, but you said, \"I'll think about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded The rest of the drive was in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking her car in your garage, Julie sauntered into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room is too bland! Let's make it more exciting!\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Wait! This is my-\" you uttered before Julie poked you back in her boobs. You heard a lot of noises. Smashes, crashes, dishes breaking, saws sawing, and drills whirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Julie plucked you out of her bosom and asked, \"How is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chairs were replaced with egg chairs, your couch was switched out with a plushy red version, there were pictures of either Julie in sexual poses or bizarre triangles in odd shapes, There was a glass coffee table in the center of the room, and the TV was replaced with a Jumbo flatscreen. There was also a dollhouse on the coffee table, giving you the feeling that Julie might put you in there as a punishment or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you said....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sighed as you got home, placing your bag down on the counter, you sat down on the couch and flipped the TV on. Scrolling through the channels you came across your favorite group of channels, the cartoon channels. Many people would probably scoff or laugh if they knew that you were still interested in cartoons, but they had been a major part of your childhood and you weren't about to stop watching them just because they weren't \"cool\" or they were \"kiddy\". Surfing around you were found an old favorite Tiny Toon Adventures, each of the characters had their own quirks and charms and it was as much the interaction of the characters, that drew you to the show as it was the comedy. Watching for a few minutes something seemed slightly off about the show, it seemed more colorful than it normally was and you swear whenever Gogo was in the shot he was looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing this fact you were able to watch the whole episode uninterrupted, and just as it happens sometimes Gogo appeared at the end of the episode to perform the outro. Yet instead of pulling out a remote, the little dodo reached forward, you barely had time to let out a cry of surprise as the logic defying dodo reached out of the TV, grabbed you by the shirt and yanked you inside. All you knew after that was the crazy little dodo was nowhere to be seen as you were falling through what could easily be known as a druggie's kaleidoscope, you saw all sorts of shapes and colors but none of them seemed to make sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, nor rhyme or reason you were suddenly spat out of...whatever it was you had just been in and you found yourself face down on something made of glass, the only reason you can say that is you can see something underneath the glass, it looked like carpet but it also looked strangely far away. Groaning while sitting up you take a couple seconds to take stock of what just happened, Gogo from Tiny Toons had just snatched you from your living room and had you deposited, where? Taking a few seconds to look around, you found that you were still in a living room, except something was very wrong. The living room wasn't that strange, a couch, a love seat, and a coffee table all facing a large flat screen television. These things weren't that strange, the strange thing was you, or rather how big everything seemed to be in comparison to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had only a few seconds to make these observations before you heard something, it sounded like a soft clicking, that quickly increased in volume to a loud clacking. The problem wasn't the sound, the problem was the pattern of the sounds, as the clacking was happening in the same rhythm as footstep. Looking around you were kind of shit out of luck as the only furniture that had anywhere to hide was more than far enough that you knew you couldn't reach it by jumping. So you did the only thing you could do and watched the couch, as that was the direction the sound was coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about half a minute the clacking stopped as something made a little hop over the couch and landed, sideways upon it. What you saw made your jaw drop, it was Fifi Le Fume, at least, you think it was her. Same hairstyle that covered one eye, same pink bow in her hair, same purple and white fur design, but there were a few notable differences from the normal FiFi. For starters her tail had...shrunk, it was still a very large bushy tail, but it wasn't twice the skunette's size. Fifi herself seemed different, she looked much more like a woman as compared to a skunk. She wasn't overly busty, but there was more than enough for the skunkette to have cleavage. She also had as shown by the revealing nature of her outfit, a quite nice pair of hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing of note was that the skunkette was clothed, equally interesting was what she was wearing. Fifi was adorned in a french maid outfit, that was quite tight on her body, it had everything, including garters and a little frilly black collar for her neck. Fifi also had what looked to be black high-heels on, and she was holding a black feather duster in her hand. With a sigh, the skunkette reached forward and dropped the feather duster onto the table, she seemed completely oblivious of your presence, which at the moment you were not sure was a good or bad thing. \"Mon dieu\" she sighed, her body visibly relaxing as she laid out across the couch. \"Zhis spring cleaning it iz so difficult, still I cannot appear as ze slob for when I bring somebody home.\" You watched as she searched around with one hand, presumably for the remote to her television, before pulling it out of the seats, again looking right over you she focused her attention on the TV and with a flick of her wrist turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got comfy in the couch, strangely enough she didn't take off the maid outfit, this leading you to wonder if she wore the thing because she was cleaning or because she thought it would actually make a good outfit. Not sure if you wanted to make contact with her just yet you sat perfectly still and tried to piece together what had happened to you in the last minute. You had just been at home watching TV, when Gogo popped out of the TV and pulled you in, you then found yourself shrunken in what you assume to be Fifi's home as she seemed pretty comfortable on that couch. Now you've run into Fifi herself, looking quite different from the show, and quite good you had to admit, in a French maid outfit. You couldn't help but groan as the weight of everything settled upon your mind, \"god I need a drink right now, or some semblance of reality, the latter more than the former\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you weren't expecting was your sigh to apparently be of normal volume, as you raised your head you saw Fifi looking around the room confusedly \"I swear I just heard somebody sigh, but I cannot see anyone\" she said after a few second of looking around. What you weren't expecting was for her to suddenly throw herself over the back of the couch giving you a quite good view of her backside \"Ello, is somebody playing ze trick on me?\" she says, her voice somehow slightly muffled even though it shouldn't have. She pulled herself back onto the couch and with a shrug sat back down and returned to watching TV. With a loud internal sigh you aren't sure if you just dodged a bullet or not. However this cemented one thing, you either needed to stay under Fifi's radar or you needed to make contact with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifi always seemed like a nice character so you were sure if you just talked out what happened to you she'd be understanding. Although at the same time, there was that small angry rant she went on in \"Prom-ise her anything.\" Anyway, you really would rather not have that fury directed at you. You just stared up at the oblivious skunkette, you had to make a choice soon as the longer the longer you stayed hidden, the harder it would be to get her help. You thought for a few seconds, weighing the pros and cons of each idea, you decided that the best course of action would be to.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were some definite pros to staying under Fifi's radar, but being accidentally or purposely squished because she thought you were a bug was more than enough to convince you that getting her attention was a good idea. Taking a few seconds and a few deep breaths to cam yourself you prepared to make contact with Fifi. Walking to the center of the coffee table you took one final deep breath and cleared your throat. The effect was instantaneous, Fifi's head turning and looking for the sound, \"down on the coffee table\" you called. Admittedly you should have expected what happened next as Fifi was a cartoon but you didn't, and you couldn't help but jump a little as her eyes locked onto you as soon as that sentence left your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward so her elbows were rested on the coffee table Fifi seemed to study you for a few seconds before asking \"you are ze little man, no?\" You were confused as to what exactly she mean so the only answer you could give was a hesitant \"yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a second to just examine Fifi \"up close\" as she hadn't pulled back yet, her fur seeming much finer and silkier than it appeared in the cartoon. Clearing your throat again you continue \"I apologize for, intruding on your home, I was just watching TV at home when this weird green dodo popped out of my TV and pulled me in, next thing I knew I was here\" you emphasize the end of your statement with a sweep of your arms. Sitting back up, Fifi seemed to think before coming to a conclusion \"you are talking about monsieur Gogo, no?\" she ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" You reply hesitantly, you knew it was Gogo but she didn't need to know that. Nodding Fifi continued \"so if you were grabbed by monsieur Gogo you could have ended up anywhere in ze Acme Acres, but you ended up with me, do you know what zhis means?\" She says seeming to grow more and more excited as she continued. Before you could come up with an answer, Fifi swept you up so you were now sitting in her open palms, Fifi smiled down at you her eyes half-lidded her voice almost a whisper as she continued \"zhis is destiny, mon petite amour, zhere is no other way to explain why vous ended up with moi.\" You had a few other ways you could explain it, but Fifi seemed happy and that was more than likely good for you, so you weren't going to question it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nodded and Fifi seemed elated that you were agreeing with her, however in a second you saw her visibly deflate as she seemed to make some sort of horrible, earth-shattering realization, whatever it was nearly bringing the skunkette to tears. Taking a second to compose herself she stared at you again but compared to earlier she was much more reserved and you swear there was a hint of fear in her expression and voice \"mon petite, how do you feel about...skunks?\" Fifi asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was not exactly out of left-field, you knew Fifi had been burned more than enough times to be a bit doubtful about any romantic conquests she wished to attempt. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with skunks\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you do not think they are horrible creatures not worthy of being loved?\" she asked. \"No\" you replied honestly, a little pissed that the rejections had deflated Fifi's self-esteem so much. You saw a relieved smile slowly spread across Fifi's face before she took in a large breath of air \"mon petite I have, ze confession to make\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a skunk\" you reply in the most deadpan voice you can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifi seemed to freeze for a second \"how did you know?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tail and your purple and white fur pattern\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a second to look herself over Fifi sighed, \"I am sorry about zhis mon petite, it is just that no boy will come near me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but let out a soft sigh, \"I'm sorry miss but I haven't gotten your name\" you reply hoping to distract her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifi simply stared at you like a deer in the headlights before letting out a small laugh \"I apologize mon petite, I am Fifi, Fifi le Fume\" she replied slowly returning back to her usual happy and slightly bubbly self. Smiling you couldn't help but give Fifi's confidence a bit of a boost after what you just heard. \"Fifi I don't know about all those other guys, but I don't see any reason why any intelligent guy wouldn't want to be near you, you're sweet, gentle and beautiful\" you felt your cheeks redden as you said the last bit. You gave Fifi your best smile hoping she'd see the sincerity in your words. The effect was a lot more pronounced that what you were expecting as suddenly you were barraged by kisses for a good half minute, when Fifi finally let up you swear her tail was wagging happily behind her like a dog. You were a little caught off guard as you felt one of Fifi's fingers stroke over your back and she once again stared down at you her eyes half-lidded and a small smile on her lips. \"So, mon petite how about we go upstairs and I can get into something a leetle more...comfortable\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't really do anything else but nod at this suggestion and Fifi let out a simple giggle before pressing you to her bosom and starting to walk. You had to admit, the soft fur underneath you felt heavenly and you could hear Fifi happily humming a tune above you. It only took about half a minute for Fifi to reach her bedroom and you were gently lifted off her bosom and placed down upon a quite large bed, shaped like a heart. Looking around you noticed a few features of the room, the wall opposite the bedroom door was the closet, the bed had matching nightstands on either side of it, and across from the bed was a makeup table. Looking back towards Fifi you saw something that made your heart stop, while you had been looking around Fifi had managed to strip out of her maid outfit and was now standing there in all her furred glory. Fifi's fur seemed much more fluffy and pronounced without the maid outfit on, this feature being most pronounced upon her breasts. The round well-sized orbs being covered by a thick layer of fluffy fur that made them very inviting, Fifi seemed to notice your gaze and rather than be offended by it she seemed to be very much enjoying the attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Fifi sauntered over to the bed and with a little hop landed upon it, you were quickly scooped up as Fifi moved up to the top of her bed and you were gently deposited back upon her bosom, Fifi seeming more than content to keep you very close as you felt one of her hands wrap around your back and gently press you against her furred orbs. \"Mon petite, would you like to be my....boyfriend?\" Fifi asks. You had to admit that you were a little confused about this; you had kind of thought with all the talk about destiny that Fifi already considered you her boyfriend, or at least some sort of star-crossed lover. Taking a moment you really couldn't see anything wrong with agreeing, you had been living alone when Gogo grabbed you, and it wasn't exactly every day you got a proposition like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing happily you buried yourself in the furred bosom beneath you \"I would love to be your boyfriend Fifi\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zhat is wonderful\" she replies in almost a whisper, \"now...</span></div></div>",

A gorgeous, and I mean drop dead gorgeous...mink? At least that's what you thought she was. With long blond hair, gorgeous black eyes accentuated by blue eye shadow, and a red dress that hugged tight at her curves. Suffice to say, you were intrigued and were sure she hadn't noticed you yet, she had been reading a book in a clearing not too far from you, when she put the book away she looked straight ahead at you and winked, instantly causing you to blush and look away. A few seconds later you heard a close voice say. \"Well you're a new face, what are you doing out here.\" You turned back to see her face inches from yours and you stumbled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just getting away from the city for a bit ma'am.\" You said as you regained your composure. \"You know, clearing my head and all that.\" She was smiling at you and seemed to raise an eyebrow at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I see, well you don't need to be so nervous you know, I won't bite. Looking closer at you, you are kinda cute...in your own awkward way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure if she was trying to flirt or mock, but it only helped to make you feel more awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...thank you for that, but I really should be going.\" You turned to walk away but felt her tug at your arm a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't go just yet...it's been so long since anyone worth talking to came into my forest.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is getting late an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush, at least sit and have a quick drink with me, you hiked out here and you're about to hike back, you must be thirsty.\" She said as she produced a bottle of...something. \"Well...I guess it can't hurt.\" You muttered and she handed you the drink. You gulped it down, surprised at how refreshing it felt, though you couldn't place the taste. The girl's face took a turn for the mischievous once you were finished though. \"There we go little guy, all gone, and now you and I will be spending plenty of time together.\" She said, in almost a sing song type of voice, not exactly sure what she was talking about. She looked to be getting taller...was she growing, is that why she called you little guy. Soon your cloths started to feel baggy though and you put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did I drink lady!?\" But the damage was done and soon your shirt and pants wouldn't fit you and you quickly discarded them, the mink lady giggled at that. \"Not lady, Minerva. And it was a shrinking potion, I wasn't about to let you get away. Though I must say you look even cuter when you're natural.\" Soon you were knee height, going down down down until you were...</span></div></div>",

From what you remember you were watching your favorite Cartoon on Netflix. Bojack Horseman. You don't know why you find this show so amazing, maybe it's the story or maybe it's the comedy. Regardless it's your favorite Cartoon on today. Last night you were watching a marathon of it when all of a sudden your television starting making a weird sound and then a light came out of it. You got blinded and you assumed you passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see what happened but you were completly shocked by what you saw. You were In a giant apartment!, no....it's more like you've shrunken! You look around and notice that the walls, the furniture everything looked a bit different. They looked more cartoonish? You also note that the room looks a bit familiar, it just feels that you've seen this giant apartment before. However all your questions get answered when the door opens and your jaw drops at the sight. In the door entering her apartment, was the forty year old pink Persian cat herself. Princess Carolyn! Your in her apartment and you recognized it because you saw it on the show. But how did you get in a cartoon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see the cat Anthro on a phone talking to a client. You were stunned at the shear size of Carolyn. Her body was as big as the biggest skyscraper you've ever seem and you didn't even came up to the top of her heel. She seems to be wearing her usual outfit in the show, a yellow jacket with a green dress underneath and high heels. Her dress was short as to show off her fur covered legs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn closes the door and stepped Inside. She walks over you scaring the crap out of you when she almost steps on you. You also looked up to see the colored panties underneath her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks into her bedroom and you have to decide what your going to do now?</span></div></div>",

You run towards the giant couch and using all your upper body strength, you pull yourself up and start climbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about fifteen minutes to reach up to the top of the couch. Once you finally reached the top you fell on to your back. Tired and exhausted. Carolyn was still in her bedroom which makes you curious at to what she is doing in there. Regardless of what she's doing you've just got to wait up here for her to come. You just hope she sees you before she sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another fifteen minutes Princess Carolyn finally left her room. You see her dressed in a pink bathrobe. Her fur was bit wet so you assume she was just taking a shower. She grabs the remote and turns on the television. She steps in front of the couch and you see your chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Miss down here!\" you shout with all your might hoping she would see you. Luck however wasn't on your side as she didn't see you. And to make matter worst she turns around to sit on the couch, more specifically the cushion you were on. You panic and try to get away but you don't get the chance as the ass of the Persian Cat Anthro landed on you and pushed you into the cushion. You get pushed down by the unbelievable pressure of her soft ass. And too make matters worse Carolyn started moving in her spot trying to get comfortable and unconsciously rubbing her ass across you. Once she's found her spot she stops and puts all her attention onto the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's weird. Normally the pressure should be crushing you right now, but your not popping. Maybe because your so small, your density has changed. Regardless you need to get her attention. You start moving and wiggling trying to get her attention on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it work, or are you stuck under her ass?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The weight lifted off of you and you took a sigh of relief. Its not the worse place you could have been stuck under but that doesn't mean you you'd want to be stuck under it all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see the curious face of princess Carolyn. She leaned forwards giving you a good view into her furry cleavage. You averts your eyes and looked up, seeing the once curious face now in complete shock as she seemed to recognize who and what you truly were. She goes to open her mouth but is left speechless. You would of said something too but you were left speechless staring at her face too. This is the first time youve been relatively close to her face. For a Forty Year old anthropomorphic cartoon cat she's surprisingly beautiful. While you two are left staring at each other you decide to speak and be the first one to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, Hi\" real smooth move you think to yourself. You go to speak again but your got cut off as both of her pink hand come towards you. Cupping around you and lifting you off the couch. She stand up and you start to get a little scared, normally you wouldn't be scared of being on 'normal people height' but considering that you'd probably die if you fell, your a little frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How..... are you..... so small? She asks you still in the shocked stage. Watching her mouth open you saw some of her cat teeth showing, you can just imagine what it's like to be trapped in there \"I don't know, I just kinda woke up in your apartment, and saw that I was shrunken. But I really need your help to get big Miss....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you can just call me Carolyn\" she corrects you trying to be kind. You played dumb hoping that she wouldn't catch on to the fact that you know more than your letting on. It's good to see she's gotten over the initial shock of seeing a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will you help me, Carolyn\" you ask trying to be as smooth as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Princess Carolyn's answer?</span></div></div>",

I think I might of misheard you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I said is that I would much rather Play with you rather then help you grow big\" Carolyn said completely nonchalantly. Like she doesn't have a problem enslaving a person. She wasn't like this in the show, was she?. \"But.... But.... But you need to help me. I don't wanna be small forever!!!\" you say freaking out. Carolyn decided to give you some guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, after we play. I might help you find a way to grow big. But first we need to play some games.\" After Carolyn said this you gained some relief. Thinking reasonably you assume your quite lucky. Of course she would want to play with you, she's single and your the size of a mouse. The fact that she's even considering to help you makes you extremely lucky. She gentle dropped you onto the ground and sits back down on the couch. Her bare feet hovering just above you. It's obvious she wants you to rub her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but how is this playing games?\" you ask looking up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got to be in the right mood. Otherwise the games we play might be a bit 'Dangerous' for you.\" Princess Carolyn said intimidating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and start rubbing the bottom of her pink feet. Her feet is about halfway between a Cat's and a Human. Having characteristics of both. If you had a foot fetish you would of been really happy with rubbing this woman's feet, but considering that you don't, It's just Manuel labour and disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally rubbing every inch of her two feet. She pulls them away, being satisfied. She leans down and looks down, giving you a good view into her bathrobe top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work little guy, I think I'm in the mood to play a game now. And since I'm nice, I'll let you pick the first game\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you pick?</span></div></div>",

I give you free range to do whatever you want. and you pick Hide And Seek?\" it's like she was expecting you too pick something more lewd and disgusting. Should You feel kind of bad your not up to her perverted perception? The reason you picked Hide And Seek was you could hide and spend your time. Also that when she finds you, you'll be able to give her a little chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you count to Fifty and I'll hide. If you catch me you win, if I hide from you for about ten minutes, then I win. You can't peak and I can't leave this room\" she seems not enthusiastic about it but she wants to play for your sake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops you onto the floor next to her pink feet and she tells you to go and hide.

You look around trying to see the best spot to hide, that's when you saw two options welcoming you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was her open red heels, it wouldn't smell nice in there but you would be invisible from her gazing eye. The other option was her laundry basket. You could slip through the openings and hide within them.

Behind here!\" she says as she lifted a plant. She puts it down afterwards and looks around even more. That's when she spotted you within her heel, trying to hide. Little were you aware that she saw you. Deciding to play a little game with you. Carolyn stomped over, acting like she didn't know you were there, looking around the floor pretending to look for your small body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was over you and the heel, you ran to the toe section of the heel not wanting to be seen. You hide in there, but little did you know that Carolyn was just about to have some fun with you. You watch as the pink foot which you were just massaging not five minutes ago enter the heel. The toes start approaching you and you try to back up even more, but you were already at the tip and you couldn't back up anymore. The toes come up to you and you feel yourself getting pinned to the heel, her giant toes all up onto your face. The bad smell from the heel was terrifying but adding her toes made it a bit worse. Her toes pulled back and you drop onto the ground of the heel. Your then pinned down by her pink toes onto the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn giggled to herself, having fun with throwing you around and pinning you using her toes but What does she do next.

In front of you were her giant pink bare feet. The body part that you were just smothered and attacked by. Honestly you didn't really mind it. It's not like you have a foot fetish or anything, but......

However it was doing something for Carolyn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt an ecstasy shot as she felt your pitiful attempts to get out from under her foot. She wasn't even trying to keep you there but you couldn't escape. It took her this long but she finally realized what she has in front of her. A small man, she could treat however she wants. However she pleases. All the guys leave her eventually, even Bojack. But this one. He doesn't get a choice. Sure it would be seen weird if she walked around showing off her small friend, but no one else has to know. He could just be her little secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn raises her foot off of you and you flip around to face her. \"Ok you got me, but don't think you'll get me next time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn didn't reply at first, first she walked over towards her couch and sat down. Leaning against the back as she smiled down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say why don't you come over here\" she says smiling. Her face looking more seductive then before. Not seeing why you wouldn't. You walk over towards the two pink feet that just tried getting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Carolyn?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing really just a little tired from the games.

She let her fingers go of your ribs and you fall down in her soft furry palm. You lay on your back as you start taking big breaths and rub your ribs. Good thing she didn't squeeze hard enough to actual crack them. While your breathing you see the looming face of the Cat, still having that shocked look on her face, which is completely reasonable giving what she just found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You Cant be real?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time I checked I was\" you say within your breaths. You sit up and reach a hand up to her \"My name is (Your Name). Nice to meet you.\" although it was weird to greet her this way, what after climbing her and her nearly breaking your ribs, but you were raised to have respect. The Cat lowers one of her fingers down towards your hand, letting you shake it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Name Is Sawyer\" the Cat says finally giving you a name \"And I'm sorry if I seem startled, it's just I've never seen a human so....... Small\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, so at least you know it's not all anthropormic animals. There are humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wish I could tell you why I'm this small it just kinda happened\" you say up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour response seemed to have gained a look from Sawyer. \"You were on my face, that means you were climbing me right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only to get your attention\" you reply quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't take any detours did you\" Sawyer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not, I don't want to make you angry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer sat down on the couch properly and dropped you off at the table next to it. She leans back as she gets ready. \"Ok, tell me everything about what happened to you. How you got shrunk? Why your in my apartment? And how you climbed me?\" she seems convinced that you did something inappropriate to her while she was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway time to tell your story</span></div></div>",

You were upfront about her sitting on you and how you climbed over her chest, but swore up and down nothing had happened. You looked up at her face, which was unreadable right now, slowly she sighed as she closed her eyes for a bit and said \"Alright.\" In a matter of fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, alright, I guess I can somewhat believe that, at least as much as finding a tiny guy in my house.\" You silently breathed a sigh of relief as a hand connected to the table next to you, startling you and causing you to jump. \"Jeez, calm down kid...go ahead and get on, i'm sure you're probably pretty hungry, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, I wouldn't want to impose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer rolled her eyes. \"As if you really could eat me out of house and home at that size, and besides, i'm hungry too and it's been a long day. You say you've been on my couch all day? Well that means you need to eat something, i'm sure you're starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer wasn't wrong. Ever since she had got home you weren't really thinking about it, but you had been hungry for hours and it was something that was getting more and more obvious as time went on. Her bringing it up just made your stomach rumble. You felt yourself go red in the cheeks as Sawyer gave you a knowing smirk. You silently clambered on to her furry hand and sat in it. \"Okay, let's go whip up some grub.\" Sawyer said, lifting you up and letting you down on her shoulder. As she got up from the couch and started walking you grabbed onto her neck just to keep your balance, though tried to be careful not to grab too tight or pinch her. You couldn't see if she reacted to it or not from this angle but she didn't stop or say anything so you assumed it was fine. When she got to her kitchen she set you on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm making myself a bacon and pickle sandwich. That sound good to you?\" Bacon and pickle sandwich? \"Um...how about a BLT?\" You said, though Sawyer just looked at you confused. \"What's a BLT?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich...\" You said, unsure of how she didn't know what that was, though it probably had to do with the world you were in. Sawyer just shrugged. \"Sure, never heard of it but i'll give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fried the bacon you felt your mouth start to water. Her back was to you so you were thankful she couldn't see it. \"So, where exactly are you from then?\" She said, back still turned. You quickly wiped your sleeve and told her the city you lived in. \"Huh...that close to here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we exactly?\" You said, responding with a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hollywood.\" Wow. You hadn't expected to hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hollywood huh? I'm not close to home at all...\" You chuckled, then thought of how she hadn't heard of a BLT but lived in Hollywood. Questions upon questions entered your mind, but you kept them to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a shame, though I doubt i'd want to send you on your own on a bus if it were close...hmm, we'll work something out.\" Sawyer said as she finished up the bacon and started to cut up the veggies and bread. She had made herself a nice sandwich and you...got some bits of bacon, crumbs, lettuce, and tomato, though at this point you weren't complaining. Any food was good. You started to tear into the food as Sawyer brought you a small thimble of water, she looked bemused at the sight of you cramming it all in your mouth. \"Jeez, don't choke.\" She set the thimble down in front of you and sat in a chair next to you. Good lord it was hard to get it out of your mind how big she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for now I guess you can sleep here, isn't like I can throw you out.\" Sawyer said after she had taken a few bites. \"This ain't bad. What'd you say it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A BLT...\" The words were automated as you were still processing that Sawyer was going to put you up. \"Um...thanks for all this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem really, if anything you've been the better part of my day...\" Sawyer's mind drifted back to work and that damned orange cat, a scowl started to set in on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...if you say so.\" You weren't going to press any harder seeing the look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner was done she left you a few minutes in her sink with the water running to wash up before she set you on her vanity in her room so she could do the same. After about 20 minutes she came in, changed into some sleepwear and opened a drawer with some silk shirts in it. \"Alright, this is where you're sleeping.\" She plucked you up, much gentler than the first time, and set you down in there and closed it until it was only a crack. \"Don't do anything stupid, okay? And have a good night, i'll see you in the morning.\" At that she gave you a genuine smile and walked away. A few seconds later the lights flicked off and you laid back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell of a day...\" You muttered to yourself as you fell quickly asleep.</span></div></div>",

Your awaken by a bright light and once that light faded away you saw the giant cat from last night glaring down at you. Memories of what happened yesterday flooded back as you remember exactly where you were. Sawyer was dressed in a sophisticated attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a good sleep? Mine was pretty good all things supposed.\" Sawyer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got a little cold in the middle of the night, but besides that I think I've slept pretty well\" you reply modestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer begins to look away while thinking \"I'm gonna have to get some stuff for you, small things you can sleep in, something you could use as a toilet, etc...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaker of which Sawyer, I kind of need to go\" you say as you can't ignore your morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer put a hand to her head and frowned \"You have to be kidding me. Fine just hop on and I'll carry you to the toilet\" she lowered her hand towards the ground and you climbed on. Once you were in the middle, she lifted you up from the drawer and started walking towards the bathroom. She arrived inside and brought you to the toilet sit, she put you down on the lid and ripped some toilet paper, she then put it next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it quickly, I've got a tight schedule and I don't want to miss work or show up late\" Sawyer said as she turned around and started brushing herself up in a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped your pants and started working. You were close to the edge of the toilet bowl so you really had to risk it. However you successfully did it. Once done you wipe yourself with the blanket sized toilet paper and pushed it in to the toilet. You then pulled up your pants and shouted to Sawyer that you were finished</span></div></div>",

She flushed the toilet and started to consider that she needed a better system than that. \"Alright, well, i'd better get going, do you want me to leave you on the couch with the radio on?\" She said as she walked towards her main living room. \"Wait, you're just going to leave me here?\" You didn't want a repeat of yesterday's hunger and endless boredom. \"Well i'm not just going to take you to work with me, that'd be insane. What if someone saw you?\" She said, giving you a look like she wanted to give a lecture. \"All the same, what if I need to go again, what if i'm hungry, what if something happens here? It isn't like i'm impossible to hide, right?\" You said, meeting the silent threat of a lecture with your rebuttal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look kid, I don't really have a system worked out for how we're going to handle your...presence yet, but all the same that doesn't mean i'm going to risk both your safety, and my sanity with endless questions about how I came upon you by you getting discovered by someone, i'm leaving you here, and that's that!\" She said as she walked towards the couch. \"Come on Sawyer, are you that worried that someone will find m-\" You were cut off as she unceremoniously dumped you on the couch instead of setting you down, though luckily it was a soft landing, which she must have known. \"Do you really think something is going to happen here?\" She said, immediately bringing up your previous point with a smug look about her face. You really had no control over your fate at this point and it steamed you off. Sawyer must have noticed because her expression immediately softened and she brought her face down to your level, startling you. \"Look, it really is for your own good to stay here, alright, i'll get a carrot and some water out of the fridge and leave it on the couch for you, and i'll leave the radio on. I promise this isn't a permanent solution to this...okay?\" She said, before you could reply she got up and walked away. She was back in a few moments with said carrot and thimble of water, as well as an empty thimble which you assumed was for...business. Soon you heard the radio going with...some really old sounding music and you saw Sawyer head for the door. She flashed you a smile. \"I'll be back before you know it, and tomorrow is my day off, I promise we'll sort this out then.\" And she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...hours had definitely passed at this point. You had eaten some of the carrot, drank a bit of water and just...sat. To be honest the radio was driving you more nutty than keeping you from boredom. You knew Sawyer was probably right, but that didn't make you any less annoyed at the whole thing. Still, what exactly were you going to do about it? Were you going to do anything about it?</span></div></div>",

Glad to hear it, a foot rub would really be great little guy.\" As she said that her furred feet landed in front of you, causing you to jump a bit. \"Aw jeez, are you sure?\" You said. \"You did say ANY job.\" She said, though you couldn't see her face you just knew she was smirking. You wanted to protest some more but figured that if you got this over with then the day would probably immediately take an upswing. You approached her left foot, got ready to...do what? You weren't exactly used to doing this, but you figured you'd try and massage like normal? Would she feel it? You tried this for about a minute before Sawyer interjected. \"I can barely feel that kid, you're gonna need to put more into it I think.\" She said. Thankful that she probably couldn't see your annoyed look you started to put your shoulder into her foot, planting your feet as much as you could into the couch you pushed and shifted your shoulder hard, hoping this would get results. \"That's more like it...\" She said overhead, thankful that this did it. You continued to do this for a few minutes until she stopped you. \"Alright, can you get the other one next?\" She asked as she shifted her feet once again. \"Yes master...\" You mumbled under your breath, sure that she couldn't hear you as you approached her next foot. You did the same as before, and were honestly starting to get tired yourself. This was sapping what little energy you had just being lethargic all day. Thankfully when you were about ready to call it quits yourself Sawyer let you go. \"Ah...that's what I needed. Thanks for that.\" She said as she leaned up and you could see her smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...no problem...\" You said, obviously winded. \"I suppose I owe you a bit of something huh?\" She said smirking. \"All I ask is that you don't leave me on the loony couch with the radio for a whole day again...\" You said, catching your breath. \"Was it really THAT bad?\" She said, still a bit confused. \"Sawyer I swear I heard the same 5 songs 50 times over and my mind went to darker places than i'd like to ever visit.\" She mused for a second. \"Alright, like I said, i'm off tomorrow, we'll figure out a solution to this. I suppose living most of your life on this couch is not something that you want.\" Wait rest of your life!? Wait what!? \"Rest of my life...?\" You said, testing the words. \"Well...what else can we really do? You don't know what happened to you right, and honestly, if the world found out about you you'd be a sideshow freak at best and a science experiment at worst...you don't want that, and I don't want that for you, so...this is kind of where we're at.\" She said, much gentler than you expected, she probably sensed the weight of what she was saying and it was all you were thinking about for now, she must have sensed how uncomfortable she made you as she gently picked you up in her hand and brought you to her lips, giving you a quick kiss. This knocked you out of your stupor as you wiped the spit and small amount of lipstick that left you with. \"What was THAT for?\" You said. \"The massage, plus you were zoning out there, I figured it'd bring you back to reality, honestly staying with me won't be so bad kid, just try not to get worked up about it, we won't repeat what happened today.\" She said. 'This discussion isn't over...' Was what you wanted to say, but you opted to leave it for now. Wasn't much for it at the moment anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night proceeded with you and Sawyer enjoying a bit of dinner and her telling you a bit about her job. It was the first time you found out what she actually did, she was the secretary for some talent agent for animal movie actors. She had been having some rough times with another cat named Danny who she described as 'blindly optimistic to the point of clinical stupidity' though the bitterness rang through, she also sounded a bit sad about it too. She asked you a bit about where you were from and you answered honestly, about your life and school, your home and your family. The differences of where you came from were starting to be apparent to both of you, you learned that not only were animals anthropomorphic and intelligent in this world, but that it was also the 1930's, and she learned about you coming from the 2010's as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually evening gave way to night and much like the night prior you found yourself in the same drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I have to go?\" She gave you an annoyed look at this and said. \"You have that toilet paper for a reason.\" she explained. \"But...the smell.\" She rubbed at her eyes \"I'll leave it open a crack. Just...don't get it on my cloths.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do ma'am.\" She gave you an exasperated look as she shut it until a sliver of the drawer was open. </span></div></div>",

She doesn't know why, she's always been able to sleep well on her bed, even if it wasn't the best bed in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer layed on her back, eyes open and annoyed. She tries thinking of everything that might let her go to sleep. She got some milk, she tried emptying her mind, nothing was working for her however. That was when Sawyer remembered this article she read in the local newspaper. Of how it's much easier to fall alseep when your cuddling someone. Now she doesn't have a significant other to cuddle, but she does have you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the drawer open as you wake up.

Seeing as your still in a comfortable position and Sawyer's fur wasnt annoying at all, you dose off to sleep. And it turns out that newspaper article was accurate.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had taken you 2 days to do the marathon, only pausing to eat and sleep but you had done it. You had beaten every Sly Cooper game 100% start to finish, damn master thief sprints took you a few hours just by themselves. You yawned a bit as it was getting later, not anything you couldn't handle but it was probably 11:00 at night. You reached for the off switch of your console when suddenly the Cooper gang's logo appeared on the screen with a small message underneath it. \"Congratulations you are the master thief, would you like to continue?\" it reads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow not knowing of any other Sly Cooper games and thinking this must have been programmed in as some sort of extras or lost levels you move the cursor that appeared with your controller and click on the logo, another message popped up \"have fun\" before the screen flared white. You slowly opened your eyes after the light show disappeared and you just stood there stock still stunned at what you saw. You were on a cobblestone street, probably somewhere in London but that wasn't why you were frozen, you were tiny, you could tell that much. Your suspicion was confirmed as a gigantic brown boot landed right next to you. You looked up, and up and up at the figure now standing above you. The figure above you aside from the boots was wearing blue pants, a blue top covered by a brown jacket as well as yellow gloves. She had a very athletic body. although that didn't detract any from her figure as her chest from your position pushed against the top containing it. Her hips were nice and wide while her stomach was slim. Her red bushy tail flicked behind her sometimes flicking up and meeting the shoulder length blue hair that cascaded down her back and ended in a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only creature you knew that looked like this and she confirmed it by yelling \"Cooper stay where you are, I'm here to arrest you.\" You weren't sure how but you were under Inspector Carmelita Montya Fox, and you were only a few inches tall, this was just great (sarcasm). Carmelita made to move and you did the one thing you could think of, you latched yourself onto her boot laces. She ran after Sly and you were tossed around and jostled as she ran but finally she stopped and you looked up shaking a fist \"I'll get you Cooper\" she shouts before lowering the fist and sighing \"can't believe I let him get away again\" she says sounding honestly kind of defeated. You waited a few moments before letting your presence be known since you knew Carmelita wasn't a bad person just very....lawful. \"Excuse me\" you say, Carmelita freezes and spins from side to side almost throwing you off, \"where are you?\" she says looking honestly bewildered. \"Down here, on your boot\" you reply feeling somewhat nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita looks down and almost jumps back as she sees you but thankfully she doesn't jump. You were sure she spotted you as her hand descends over you covering you and you were lifted up in her fist. She opens her fist in front of her face and you were eye to yellow eye with the vixen. \"Who are you? what are you? Are you a spy for Cooper?\" She says suddenly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah, hold on innocent until proven guilty\" you say not sure if that would be enough but it pacified her. \"Well I'm a human, I'm not a spy or anything I just....showed up here\" you say. Every bell and whistle in your body was telling you to run but you knew that was the last thing you do with Carmelita because when you run her she starts using that shock pistol of hers. Carmelita nods and calms down \"well since your not a spy for Cooper your just a law-abiding citizen, how can I help you?\" she says. \"Um.....well I don't really have a place to stay, and well it looks like rain\" you say pointing up at the sky which had quickly become overcast during the chase. Carmelita nods again, \"until we can find you a place to stay, you may stay with me\" she says which honestly suprised you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita drops you into a pocket on that jacket of hers that you never saw before and starts walking, it took her 5 minutes to come upon a small Victorian townhouse. She walks right up to the door, pulls a key out from under her top and unlocks the door and enters, it was a very simple house, that much you knew as she walked around, living room attached to a kitchen, there was an upstairs but that probably only contained Inspector Fox's room and a bathroom. Inspector Fox walks through the hall into the living room and flops down on a large plush armchair finally remembering you as she fishes you out of the pocket. \"Thank you Inspector Fox\" you say as she sets you down on the arm of the chair, she looks at you curious \"how did you know who I was\" she asks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone's heard of you, your almost as famous as Sly Cooper\" you say lying through your teeth. She looks at you for a second before nodding \"probably known as a failure, I've never been able to catch Sly and his team no matter how hard I try\" she says sighing. Trying to change the subject you ask \"not to be a bother, but is there anything to eat and drink around here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspector Fox seems quite happy to have a distraction and she nods \"I'll get you something right now\" she says. She stands up and heads off to the kitchen and you can soon smell tea and \"sniff\" \"sniff\" toast. Carmelita comes back carrying a cup of tea and a buttered piece of toast, she holds the cup of tea over to you and you reach over and take a drink. You had to jump down as she had the plate with toast on it on her lap and you ate a bit of that before heading back to your place on the arm of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so small?\" Carmelita asks after taking a sip of tea. You shrug \"I have no idea, there's was a flash of light in front of me and then I found myself at this size under you, I grabbed onto your boot as you chased Sly and yeah that's about it\" you reply. Carmelita stares at you for a few seconds before sighing, \"well that is one interesting story, but i'll believe you as well I did find you attached to my boot\" she says. You nodded and you sat there together for a bit before Carmelita stands up \"well it is about time we get to bed, you can sleep here\" she says indicating the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Ms. Fox\" you say. Carmelita walks away and despite your better judgment you slowly follow her. Carmelita heads upstairs and given your size it was quite easy to follow her as you gave off no noise and even though she looked over once or twice there was lots of stuff to hide behind. She spent a few minutes in the bathroom and you just waited in a dark corner nearby, although you really weren't sure how good her night vision was so you hid behind a small desk as she exited the bathroom. She walked into the bedroom and you assume she spent a few minutes getting ready for bed, You froze as you heard something, it sounded almost like sniffling, you weren't sure what exactly you could do, I mean Carmelita had been nice enough to let you into her house when you showed up here and you were spying on her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look at the bedroom door still hearing that sniffling sound you look at the space between the door frame and the floor and your just able to fit in underneath. You wiggle your way underneath the floor and now you hear Carmelita muttering \"again, I let him get away again.\" You slowly walk up to the bed and shimmy up the side of the bed, you see Carmelita laying on the bed slightly curled up, she was wearing a blue nightie the same colour of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\" you say and she jumps up, turns the lamp on and points the shock pistol right at where you were standing, you held your hands up \"sorry, it's just I heard something and came to see what it was\" you say only partially lying this time. Carmelita looks at you and sighs \"I'm sorry that I kept you up\" she says looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you muttering, is it really that bad that you haven't caught Sly Cooper yet?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita sighs and looks at you \"everytime he gets away, I get a pay deduction, but that's not what bothers me, everytime I fail it feels like I failed justice, letting Cooper get away\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod \"well there are 3 of them right, and only one of you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods \"yes he has a turtle and a hippo helping him\" she replies. She looks down at you and an idea seems to form in her head \"would you like a way to...return the favour for me helping you?\" she asks. You look at her and nod slowly and she smiles \"good\" she says. She reaches over into a drawer and pulls something out, it looked like a police star and she holds it up \"I name you my deputy\" she says. You were stunned \"I....sure that will work\" you say unable to think of anything else. Carmelita smiles \"good, then get some sleep, we have a lot of work tomorrow\" she says. You nod and climb off the bed and head back downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay down in the chair when you reach it and quickly fall asleep. You were shaken awake and you open your eyes to see Carmelita fully dressed and holding a piece of toast in her hand, \"here you need to eat and then we need to get going\" she says. You eat the part of the toast and she devours the rest before picking you up and dropping you into the jacket pocket. She heads out of the apartment and starts heading towards a car park before you hear a sound and a voice \"Carmelita, Cooper has been spotted at the history museum, go there and apprehend him\" it crackles. Carmelita turns and starts running toward a large domed building you can only assume is the natural history museum. She reaches the inside of the museum and you see the edge of a black and white tail flash around a corner. \"Over there\" you shout pointing towards the corner and she runs off after the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a voice \"Sly hurry it up, Carmelita is right behind you\" the voice says right as he enters your vision. Sly honestly looked like a thief as he was a raccoon and he wore dark blue clothing and carried a cane in the shape of a question mark. Carmelita cornered him in a courtyard and he nodded at Carmelita as he turned and saw her \"Inspector Fox, it's wonderful to see you again\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooper, your not getting away this time\" she says. Sly raises his hands, \"Your right inspector I'm finished\" he says as something falls out of his glove and hits the floor. It explodes in a cloud of smoke and Carmelita shouts \"Cooper\" and fires into the smoke. You were looking around but you couldn't see anything except smoke until you looked up. Running on the roof of the courtyard was Sly, \"Carmelita above us\" you say tapping her on the shoulder. She looks up and shouts \"Cooper\" again before holding onto where you were. \"There's no way she's gonna\" your thought was interrupted as she leaped up spinning in the air and landing behind Sly. \"Freeze\" she shouts and he turns and smiles well slyly \"Inspector Fox your really keeping up\" he says smiling obviously he was stalling for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot him don't talk to him\" you say and she fires, you can see Sly is totally shocked at her firing as his eyes bulge as the electro-bullet speeds towards him and hits him. He crumples forward just as an rc copter with a rope flies behind him and then flies off. Carmelita walks up and pokes Sly's unmoving body \"ringtail?\" she says poking him again with her boot. She lifts him up and realizes he's unconcious \"I.....I did it, I finally caught Cooper\" she says too stunned to really believe anything. You heard that same voice again \"Sly are you there, Sly answer me\" it says. Carmelita hears it too and picks up what you quickly recognized as the binocucom and smiled at it, \"so this is how they relayed all the info\" she says. She picks Sly up over her shoulder and you just sat there as she dragged his body to the precint, walked past 10 stunned policeman and placed Sly down into a cell and shut and locked it herself having the sense to remove Sly's cane from his person before putting him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Carmelita\" comes a voice from behind her. She turns and you see a dog standing there in a pair of slacks and a cream colored shirt with a large badge on his chest. \"Thank you Inspector Barkley\" she says smiling at the dog. He looks at the cage \"Sly Cooper, I never thought i'd see him locked up, Carmelita your full pay has been reinstated and you may have a few weeks vacation you've earned it\" he says. Carmelita just stands there stunned \"thank you sir\" she says. She walks out of the police station with a large sense of pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice you get a vacation\" you say looking up at her from in the pocket. Carmelita freezes obviously forgetting you were even there. She runs home and opens her pocket pulling you out and placing you down on the floor. She looks down at you and smiles \"thank you\" she says the smile growing larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" you reply honestly not thinking you did anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You helped me catch the most wanted criminal in the world, Sly is always able to trick me be it by running away or by sweet-talking me, so this capture is partly because of you\" Carmelita says. You just shrugged honestly not seeing it as big a deal as she was seeing it. Carmelita looked down at you \"is there any way I can repay you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could let me keep living here, but otherwise I really can't think of anything\" you say. Carmelita nods and you spent the rest of the day just really hanging out, as it got later Carmelita smiled, \"I need you to stay here for a bit\" she says pointing to the chair, \"no following me like you did before\" she says. You froze \"she knew, oh crap\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, about following you\" you say. She nods and stares at you \"I'll accept that apology\" she says before heading upstairs. You waited on the chair for a good ten minutes till you heard something and into view walks Carmelita in that same black dress she wore in Sly 2 and her hair pinned up in the same fashion. She smiles at you as you were well somewhat gaping \"I'll take that as my partner approves\" she says and you bashfully nod. She lowers a hand and you step on and she hides you up in the bun in her hair. She walks out and you spend the next half hour at a fancy resturant although you had to stay hidden in her hair so you didn't really get to eat much. When she got back to her house she let you out and sighed \"well I think it's about time for bed\" she says. You nod and she starts walking upstairs \"Carmelita shouldn't you uh, let me down so I can go sleep on the chair\" you say. She doesn't answer instead entering the bedroom she puts you down on a pillow and pushes you forward telling you that you were supposed to keep your face buried. You did so and you heard her undress and then redress herself and you felt a tap on your back. Turning over you see Carmelita's face and body as she's wearing that same blue nightie and she smiles at you \"good night\" she says turning over. You looked at her somewhat stunned but think \"aw screw it this is better then the chair\" curl up and fall asleep. </span></div></div>",

You could notice she looked really flattered by accepting her kind offer. Now you realized what was going on. You decided now it was not the time to ask it you were right. Still you thought to yourself: \"Is she... in love with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally regained her confidence to speak again. \"Well thanks for accepting my offer (your name). I'm sure you would enjoy your stay here\". \"Cause I sure do\" she thought to herself. \"Should I fetch you something to eat. You must be starving now.\" \"Yes Please ms.Acorn.\" \"Let me put you down on the dining table alright? I'll try to cook you something special for us two. Trust me you'll like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Sally walking over to an stove. The stove seemed like it could only be fueled by burning coal in it, she tried to ignite an fire to start cooking that special meal she promised you to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a little higher up and further away. You could notice just how big this strange, human-like, female chipmunk really looked. Not only was the table a few feet away from the stove, the table you got put on roughly we're on the same height as Sally's waist. She was still absolutely TOWERING over you. For you it was like looking up to the tallest skyscraper you could think of from the top of your head! You looked down and you see Sally's legs, making you  think she might actually compare more to a whole MOUNTAIN! being so far away also gave you the chance to look more closely at her \"features\". You couldn't help stopping yourself from staring at her massive, perfectly shaped butt moving around right in front of you. \"Well this ain't so bad after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you a couple more questions (your name)?\" Sally asked politely. \"Sure go for it.\" \"What do humans like mostly about females?\" \"Well umm... If they are very nice to you, I like that.\" \"Maybe making a meal for someone, like you are doing now ms.Acorn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you saying that you like me?\" She replied with great enthusiasm. \"Actually... yes, I think you are really kind and I like how much you care about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I really appreciate that.\" Sally replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for me to ask you a very personal question if I can.\" You urged to asked a little bit, then finally you asked your question you had for a while now. \"Sally. Are you in love with me?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSally was shocked by your very personal question. She turned around, bends over. And got closer to you, standing face to face. \"How did you found out?\"<br>\r\n\"Well you were acting very timid for a while now, you were staring at me, I could see you blushing. And I think you are even showing yourself of to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showing myself of?\" \"What do you mean by that?\" She said in a confused way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were shaking your butt around? You weren't trying to be allure me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Y... You like it when I move around with my butt?\" Sally asked embarrassed. \"Is this what humans like?\" Sally thought to herself. \"Do you want me to keep doing that (your name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to think about your options: just forget you said that embarrassing remark to Sally and eat dinner with her. Or ask if Sally could show off her feminine assets SOME MORE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need to get something called Chaos emeralds, but they've all been put under heavy guard and little old me is having a bit of trouble getting inside.

At the moment polt has her back to you her big bushy tail was just hanging limp not moving at all. Looking up past hear tail you saw she had a hear head phones in so calling out to her would do no good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I gonna get her attention\u201d you asked yourself. You rubbed the back of your head in thought wondering how you could get her attention. While you were in thought you saw something move above you. Looking up you saw it was polts tail moving to the right side of her short clad booty. \u201cOdd she wouldn\u2019t do that unless...\u201d you gasped in realisation that the huge kobold was about to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frantically looked around hoping there was somewhere you could run to for shelter but as it turns out you were out of luck. All you could do was watch as her two plump cheeks stretch the material of her booty shorts and think is this a good way or bad way to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it\u2019s comes.\u201d You closed your eyes not wanting to see the big butt you were about to be crushed underneath. You held your breath and prepared yourself for the bone crushing weight but to your surprise there was no bone crushing weight but a huge earthquake that knocked you on your backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what happened?\u201d You looked around and saw two furry brown thighs on either side of you. \u201cOh thank god I'm between her legs\u201d you said standing up and looking behind you seeing her covered crotch. You blushed a little seeing a faint outline of her vagina also known as camel toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking any others thoughts out of your head you looked around and saw you had a few choices and they were.</span></div></div>",

Then, write what you want to write with them. You're already small enough to fit into their hands once you make your choices. However when writing try to make them stick a bit in character as well as try to be descriptive. Not saying there's anything wrong with OOC, but a bit of effort to keep characters a little in character can go a long way. Also leave options open for others who may not like the route you take with the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also would like to inform that crappy chapters that are way too short or that contain horrid grammar will not be accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll allow everything except:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Fart/scat/pee/toilet<br>\r\n- Bad smells/odor<br>\r\n- Guro<br>\r\n- Male giants obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally try <b>not</b> to give yourself a name when writing as that takes you out of the story. When writing try to use \"You ran for cover\" and such to keep the perspective as rather anonymous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said have fun.</td>",
