Have you just woken up?<br>\r\nSlowly you open an eye, but cannot make anything out, your vision is completely blurred. Right now your head aches more when you open your eyes so you leave that for later and shut your eye for now.<br>\r\nThat doesn't leave much to go with:<br>\r\nTouch. You seem to be laying on sand, cool sand it seems. Are you on a beach? Your muscles ache, but after a little effort you move your hand around and feel the sand up close. It's not smooth, there are a lot of pebbles in it. Not a high quality beach then.<br>\r\nSound. Well, you mostly hear the thrumming of your heart, but there are some odd noises faintly in the background. Not things you can place, but they seem insect like in nature. Maybe you're near a forrest?<br>\r\nSmell. It's actually rather fragrent here, but dry. There certainly seems to be vegetation nearby, and probably flowers, rather sweet smelling from the aroma.<br>\r\nMemory. This is tricky. Are you waking up from a nap and just have terrible recollection of the day before or... wait, some details are coming back. The insitute, some form of accident, klaxons going off, alarms sounding. Yes, there was something wrong with the accelerator in the basement. You were three stories up from that though, what could have affected you?<br>\r\nOK, that hasn't helped much, maybe you'd better wait a little while and try again? After all it's fairly comfortable here you could.... just.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jerk you shake awake, your mouth dry and your eyes seem stuck shut. How long were you asleep? Now what?</span></div></div>",

It feels like glue is sticking your eyelids together, but with a little effort you clear your eyes and take a look around you.<br>\r\nWell, it's night time at least, though brighter than you'd expect. Maybe it's a full moon?<br>\r\nGlancing ahead you can see a rough terrain, stony hillocks breaking into sand dunes. Are you on the edge of a desert? Maybe Scrubland of some sort. The bushes about are unfamiliar.<br>\r\nAs you peer about you see something bright in the sky behind you. Turning, feeling your aching muscles complain, you look over your shoulder and...<br>\r\nThere isn't a full moon... there are TWO full moons next to each other. They appear fairly similar, each a little smaller than the one you've known all your life, but look like asteroids, not circular at all.<br>\r\nNow you are looking you see that the stars are wrong too, nothing familiar. Wait, why can you see stars at all? Usually a combination of bright moon and background light makes your eyes adjust till you can't make out the faint stars.<br>\r\nWell, the terrain is dark, and you can't see any stars right alongside the moon... er, moons, but elsewhere in the sky... You guess there is just no light pollution from cities nearby to blank them out.<br>\r\nJust then some noise catches your attention. It sounded like a cut off scream from behind a hillock nearby.</span></div></div>",

It's furred lightly and it's head more resembles a cat, though no cat you've ever seen.<br>\r\nThe catwoman stumbles, but keeps her tired loping pace. She looks exhausted!<br>\r\n\"Stop!

Maybe you look just as odd to her as she does to you?<br>\r\nAfter a moments indecision she tenses then jumps. From a standing start she just jumped over fifteen feet! You gasp as she lands in a heap beside you and you heave her closer to hide behind the tree. At least like that there aren't any foot prints leading up to the tree!<br>\r\nAs you hide the catwoman two other creatures come out into the light from different directions. From behind the hill comes a weird squid like thing with a distorted face on it's lower body. From the other direction, where the catwoman was running to a few moments before, comes a tall, heavily muscled wolf-man; basically a man with fur and a wolf's head.<br>\r\n\"Well, you got her?\" says the squid.<br>\r\nThe wolf stops, pausing as if trying to understand the question.<br>\r\n\"I thought you had her Mervin?\" he says slowly.<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! You idiot! You let her get away! Frilen's going to be ticked, he hates runners getting out! You go that way,\" Mervin says, waving a tentacle behind a far hillock, \"and I'll head back north. Arnold, we have to get her back!\"<br>\r\nThe two aliens split up and move around the distant hill until they are both gone. You wait a little more, just to be safe, then turn to the catwoman. She seems exhausted. That jump must have taken it out of her.<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" you say to the panting feline.</span></div></div>",

The creature is for all intents and purposes a four foot tall squid. The body is less than two foot tall, the rest is made up of the tentacles it uses to 'walk' on. Although it looks like a squid it has a faintly human face on it's body about a third of the way up it's long length. Two eyes, each with two, jet black ovoid pupils. A lidless rubbery mouth. Above that is a slit or flap that would seem to be a nose... maybe.<br>\r\n\"Got her for ya' Mervin.\" the wolf thing says.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I can see that Arnold. I'm not blind!

How much of your background should you tell these people?<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" the catwoman interrupts your train of thought, \"by the way my name is Yandi Emerett.\"<br>\r\nShe puts her hand out and you smile and shake... paws with her. Her hands are surprisingly human like, but instead of nails she has retractable claws, just poking out from the tips. They are also covered in fine fur on the back with pads on the palms and the inside of the fingers just like paws.<br>\r\n\"Um, hi. I'm Lucy Hendricks. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\nHer shake is rather vigorous, but at least your hand is still attached afterwards... just. Arnold then walks over to you, clutching his belly and burping.<br>\r\n\"You can't eat?\" he says to you. \"That's terrible!\"</span></div></div>",

'Fraid I don't know a lot about other star systems, though I went to Fremmel once a while back. Didn't like it, the Commission is too much in control there. I prefer a place with a bit more freedom.<br>\r\n\"The commission?\" You ask.<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes Yandi explains that The Commision was made up of four great guilds that combined many years ago to form a conglomorate that was more powerful that governments. Now it has taken over many colony worlds (maybe all as far as Yandi knows) but not this world, known as Lan. This is the homeworld of her species... and apparently all the species. You aren't really sure how one world could spawn the three species you've seen so far and as Yandi talks you realize it's not just three but more like fifty or more.<br>\r\nYandi talks about the various independent guilds that work outside of The Commission, still selling their products legally, for the moment, but they are rather inferior to Commission goods now. Soon she suspects The Commission will force all other Life Molders out of the market.<br>\r\n\"Life Molders?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yes, didn't I mention that?\" Yandi says, as she shifts a little. Both she and Arnold sat down as you chatted and you've found it rather comfortable to be rested in her gut, which in turn is resting on her lap. It's also somewhat distracting, especially with the thump of her heart lulling you to sleep.</span></div></div>",

After all you don't have a 'tag'. Although, come to think of it neither does Yandi.<br>\r\nEventually your interest in the town overcomes your trepidation.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yandi? Would you mind if I got out and walked from here? I'm sure you're tired of carrying me.\"<br>\r\nA chuckle resonates around you.<br>\r\n\"Well, I've carried more, but you're right, it's beginning to tire me a little. OK, and while we're at it we'll make camp here for a bit.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly the world heaves around you, pulsing tightly against you.

Gasping for a few seconds against the constriction you feel your body slowly being fed up into the catwoman's neck. You manage to hold your breath until, with a wet plop, your head emerges into fresh air. Panting you bite your lip as Yandi's esophagus works your chest upwards until it too is disgorged from between Yandi's taught lips. You reach down and grasp her knees (she appears to be seated on a rock) and hold yourself up as she ejects the rest of your body from her depths.<br>\r\nAs your hips emerge you gasp at a particular drag of the catwoman's tongue across your sex. At least this time she doesn't attempt to tongue you, but she certainly can taste how into this you are.<br>\r\nFinally she sucks and licks her way down your thighs, calves and finally feet, till you collapse in a wet heap on the rough, stony ground. Looking up you see her smile knowingly, and then wink at you. You wonder if she is really into vore as a sexual thing, despite what she said earlier about not being seriously into it.<br>\r\n\"So, enjoy the trip?\" she says, bending down close to you. You can see your clothes slung over her shoulder and you feel rather naked without them at the moment.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, very nice!\" you manage, panting.<br>\r\n\"So,\" interrupts Arnold, \"we done 'ere yet?\" and he stands up, seemingly ready to leave.</span></div></div>",

You vaguely remember something about 'breeding' for machines, or at least you think that was what she was talking about. Do they have nano technology here? Maybe viewing the spaceport would be a good place to find out.<br>\r\n\"Why not, I've only seen a few space launches before, and I'm sure ours are different from yours.\"<br>\r\nYandi seems to frown at that comment, but shrugs it off, nods, then she leads you off to the hill. Maybe you shouldn't comment too much on your world's technology. Who knows what she'd make of that, though she seems to be quite blase about everything so far, you never quite know what phobias, taboos or other cultural differences can affect things like this.<br>\r\nThe three of you head up the hill and you notice a bit more vegetation around, mostly yellow green bushes. However, all this disappears from your attention as you come to the top of the hill and look down on the town of Lorrem.<br>\r\nThe sight is breathtaking, a sweeping vista of brown, green and blue buildings in a smooth bulbous design. The town has higher buildings nearer the center, as Human buildings do, but here they are also wider, some look like enourmous, smooth domes, while others like elongated, dome topped cylinders, but all seem to be limited to being about three times their width in height. Maybe it's some sort of limit to their building's design?<br>\r\nSuddenly you see a flash to the left side of the city (from what Yandi said about direction earlier you think that is the east side) and you notice a flickering light there, slowly floating upwards, seemingly unsupported. As you squint you see the light is a sort of flame on the back of an odd shaped mass. Is that a space ship? The flame isn't under it though, how can that support it? It looks more like a candle, curling upwards, than an exhaust. That can't...<br>\r\nSuddenly the flame squirts backwards in a tight jet that turns from the golden yellow it was to a deep transparent blue. In response the craft shoots in the opposite direction, not up as it was floating, but away from you, building speed rapidly.<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" you say, watching as it pulls up, looking more like a wingless aircraft as it climbs on the pillar of blue fire, shooting into the distance. There is little noise from it, more like a quiet jet engine than anything else and you have to admit you are impressed as you see it shrink to a dot, then disappear from view.<br>\r\n\"Cool huh?\" Yandi says \"Wait till you see a heavy transport go up, those suckers are huge!\"<br>\r\n\"That wasn't a transport?\" you say, turning to her.<br>\r\n\"Heck no, just a personnel ship, probably some rich kid's toy or a corporate exec's craft.

Did they have some sort of vertol technology like Harrier jump jets?<br>\r\nBefore you can think much further on the subject you notice a huge shape there start to move. You thought that was a building at first! It must be over a hundred foot in length, looking a little mishapen, but overall like a slightly flattened tear drop on it's side. As you watch you see it rise up smoothly off the ground without any dust blown up around it. What kind of propulsion could lift such a craft without kicking up dust? There are even people nearby down there (if those tiny moving dots are people) and they don't seem to feel any wind from the ship.<br>\r\nThen you see the round end of the craft start to flicker, just like the first ship, and soon a flame is licking from the rear. This time though it slowly twists around so the point of the craft is almost straight at you. Once it has floated up to what you estimate as about a thousand feet you see a flash behind it as the engine kicks in and it surges towards you. This one accelerates a little slower than the first one, looking more the way the shuttle does on lift off... although sideways.<br>\r\nYou shake your head in amazement. How do they get something that size to fly like that seemingly so effortlessly? Then you do a double take. As it gets closer you can see details and it is starting to look decidedly odd, almost... organic! It's soon picked up quite a speed and as it swoops high over your head you can make out fish like fins on the side, ribbing, even what looks like many small crab-like legs folded up on the bottom.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god it's alive!\" you whisper as it shoots off into the distance, getting faster and further away.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Yandi says, looking perplexed. \"Of course it is, it's flying isn't it?

It seems as if it's more compact than towns on your homeworld, less sprawl at the edges. It's almost as if the buildings just stop a set distance from the center.<br>\r\nYou, Yandi and Arnold make a ciruitous path towards the buildings, skirting the edge of a low wood nearby, though it looks almost like it is made of bushes than trees it's so low. Finally you step onto a smooth path a few hundred yards from the town's edge. You look down and note the path is still rather crude, it looks like a worn path... then you realise it's unnaturally flat and smooth.<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec.\" you say as you crouch down and examine the surface.<br>\r\nYandi and Arnold seem a little perplexed at your intrest in the path but seem to humor you.<br>\r\nThe surface isn't a normal stone or dirt road, at least not the top. It's been covered in some sort of transparent resin or plastic, a very hard variety too. Curious you go to the edge, get out a penknife and, with some difficulty, cut a slice off.<br>\r\n\"Tough stuff.\" you mutter to yourself.<br>\r\nYandi smiles, you aren't sure if she heard you.<br>\r\n\"Well, shall we get going?\"</span></div></div>",

Still you haven't got a lot of equipment here to examine it with so it's hardly worth spending more time on it right now.<br>\r\nAfter a little walk you reach the edge of the town. It doesn't exactly have a wall, but all the buildings sort of run together around the edge and seem to have... grown into one another. They also don't have windows on this side either. The path leads to a break in the 'wall' and has two eight foot tall canines guarding it. To your surprise they seem to be wearing armor.. then when you get closer you realise even the armour is alive! Is it part of them or a separate creature? Weird. They also are carrying what looks like large organic blades made of some sort of honed bone or horn.<br>\r\nThen the guard on the left points his blade at you (it looks sharper than any bone weapon had any right to!) and you feel an odd sensation in your head. It lasts just a second, then the guard almost smiles before standing up again, blade upright once more.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" you whisper to Yandi as you walk between the unresponsive guards into the town.<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're just checking for illegal items. With the Commission trying to infiltrate themselves, sell their way into the hearts and minds etc etc... well you know the drill. Oh, I guess you don't.\" Yandi smiles a little condescendingly at you. \"Basically they don't want anything let in that can breed, and anything made by The Commission means the holder has to hold a licence while in town, neuter or not. Erm, the item I mean, not the holder!\"<br>\r\nThis is getting weirder and weirder!<br>\r\nThe walk along the street is interesting. The buildings all have shop fronts near the town entrance with gaudy signs over the entrances and shop windows. The windows and doors are all curiously round. It doesn't take long for you to finally prove to yourself that these buildings ARE alive, not just somehow grown mechanically.<br>\r\nUp ahead you see an open area with what looks like a bustling market.<br>\r\n\"So, Yandi, Arnold, shall we take a look at the Market?\"</span></div></div>",

I prefer freedom myself.\"<br>\r\n\"I've been on a world ship.\" Arnold says. After a few moments it seems this is all he wanted to say and the Catwoman rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, they make all the fastest ships and horde the breeding stock. Very few can find a viable ship to own separately without going through them, and the ships you do find tend to be either flawed or from a very old lineage with next to no modern progressions in them at all.\"<br>\r\nYou hold your hand up, making her pause for a second as you try to work out what it was in that last speech that caught your attention.

Are you saying you don't use living tools?\"<br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n\"No, well, not really. We have horses for transport, pets, but nothing really you could call a living tool. We make our tools by shaping metal, wood and artificial materials into complex shapes.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" she says, frowning, \"you put together tools yourself? That's crazy! You'd can't get even half way adequate tools like that! I mean, how would you even make a knife with a decent edge?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I had the same thought. How do YOU get a living knife to get a sharp edge without a grinding wheel?\"<br>\r\nThe next few minutes are spent trying to explain to one another your respective technologies. Your description of Earth's mechanical technology is long winded, but at least detailed. You know a fair bit about engineering after all, even though your main study has been particle physics. explanations the other way are a little simplified as the woman (she says her name is Yandi Emerett) seems to be fairly in the dark about any of the details of her technology.<br>\r\nBasically it seems to boil down to this. As far back as anyone can remember the Life Guilds have worked living creatures into tools. They design alterations to living creatures till they can do any task, even that of spaceship! How that is possible you can't even imagine! For the last few centuries however four of the great guilds have been acting as one under the name of the 'Trade Commission' and have virtually cornered the market on important tools.<br>\r\nThis world is the home world, called 'Lan', but there are over a dozen other worlds around nearby stars that have been lightly colonized in the last century by the Trade Commission. It seems they have a stranglehold on the trade routes as they invented the means of star travel. Most of the creatures they sell are neuters, unable to breed, forcing people to buy new tools from the Commission when their current ones grow old and die. It seems however that this was not always the case, and there are still the remnants of a few of the old Life Guilds around who sell simpler, breeding tools, though they are gradually being pushed out of the market.<br>\r\nRight now there is still a separate government here on Lan, though the Commission rules the colonies in all but name. There is talk, as Yandi tells it, that it is trying to take control here too and word has spread of a rebellion who wishes to fight against them.</span></div></div>",

Maybe that's why all the people you've seen so far have been naked (barring fur).

Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm... Yes Mistress, I am well.\" she says.<br>\r\nNow the others are starting to gaze in your direction too, glazed eyes almost constant as well.

About forty years ago four Guilds got together and formed the Guild Commission, later just shortened the title to The Commission. Since then they'd basically taken over their worlds, then spread, seizing or buying out other worlds. There are very few left unconquered now, this is the only one I know of anyway.

Once she's disappeared from sight Yandi follows then you reach down and push your hands in. The experience of getting out is just as.. tight as going in, though Charley's mouth is wide open so at least that isn't squeezing you. You pull yourself stickily from between the huge lips of the beast and try to get your bearings. Arnold isn't quite here yet, though Mervin is. Marge is grappling him now, while Yandi stands here waiting for Arnold. As Arnold gets closer you feel Oolanti charge past you, her fur all sticky from saliva and the two of them charge Arnold.<br>\r\n\"I could *Ungh!* use some help here!\" Marge says and you shake yourself and run over to help. Tentacles are everywhere as you grapple Mervin.<br>\r\n\"Geaargh! Stop this you.. you slaves! I OWN you! You'll pay for this!\"<br>\r\nAs you and Marge struggle with Mervin you see the other four girl's piled on top of Arnold who is shouting and screaming to be let loose. Charley seems nervous at this, but you ordered him to sit down, so he's staying. The other critter (you think Yandi called it Mikey?) isn't so restrained and the noise has scared him off. He's pounding away in a six legged gait down the pathway at quite a clip. If there is anyone inside him they're going to be tossed around a lot! You don't think there is going to be a way to get him back either!<br>\r\nMeanwhile Marge has just managed to get a handful of writhing tentacles up to her lips and in and...<br>\r\n*GULP!*<br>\r\n\"N.. NOOO!\" Mervin gasps as he watches in vain as he slides into the horse's jaws. Marge gulps and heaves, shoving Mervin down. She has to yawn really wide to fit his body in, but she does and in he goes. Muffled screams come from her throat till she finally closes her lips and swallows one last time, sending the huge lump into her gut.<br>\r\n\"Ungh! Ooh, he's a fighter. Tasted pretty good too.\"<br>\r\n\"B..Boss?\" Arnold says from the pile of girls.</span></div></div>",

You see eyes peering out at you from in there and realize he saw what happened. You look back at Marge, she seems happy with this, though that might just be because you ordered her to go ahead with this plan. Looking down you can still see the struggling bulge in her belly where Mervin sits, apparently still alive in there. \"Would he still be OK if you threw him up now Marge?\" You ask.<br>\r\nShe nods. \"Yup, he'd be fine.\"<br>\r\nYou turn to Arnold, kneeling down infront of the girl pile on him.<br>\r\n\"You understand why we did this, right? He was going to put us back into slavery and we couldn't allow that. You know that he wouldn't have let us get away if we'd just escaped and left him, right?\" A nod comes from in there somewhere. \"So you understand. Well Mervin is still OK right now. Do you want him back up again? If so you'd have to promise to restrain him while we get out of here.\"<br>\r\n\"I... No.. I can't do that. He'd order me to let him go and... He's my boss. I gotta do what he says.\" A deep sigh comes from inside the pile. \"The horsey can keep him. That way he ain't my boss no more.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Arnold?\" He nods again, shaking the pile \"OK, now what about you? Are you going to be OK?\"<br>\r\n\"I... I guess. Are you gonna eat me?\" You blink. He's huge, over seven foot tall and very well built! \"Er, no Arnold. You haven't done anything to me, or at least not without Mervin's orders. I don't blame you for this.\"<br>\r\n\"Um, well... I'm kinda on my own now then... I don't like that. I... I'm not dat smart. I can't go without a boss... would... would you be my boss?\"<br>\r\nOK this is getting weird, but actually seems in character for Arnold. You don't think your slave effect thing is doing this. It's just Arnold.<br>\r\n\"Um, well if you agree not to hurt any of us we can let you go and then we can talk about this, OK?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, OK.\"<br>\r\n\"OK girls you can let him go.\"<br>\r\nSlowly the pile of furry bodies slides off Arnold and pulls back. With a sigh he stands up, looking very dejected. Yandi comes over beside you, huffing a bit, and slings an arm around your shoulder. You glance askance at her for a sec, but she's focussed on Arnold right now. Hmm, well save that talk for later.<br>\r\n\"OK, so Arnold I'm new around here, and these girl's are ex-slaves. You know we don't have any money to pay you with. How could I be your boss?\"<br>\r\nHe sniffs.<br>\r\n\"Dat's no different. Mervin never paid me anyways. He jus' fed me and let me sleep in Mikey. Oh, Mikeys gone!\" he says sadly, looking at the cloud of dust in the distance.<br>\r\n\"That's OK, I'm sure Charley is just as nice inside.\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n\"Um, you'd let me sleep in Charley? A.. and get food once a month?\"<br>\r\nOnce a month? Oh right, they eat person sized meals. You guess that would last them a while.<br>\r\n\"Yes, once we can find food.\" You turn to Yandi. \"How easy do you think it would be to breed these Boduclos? We need enough to live off.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we'd have to get a few breeding pairs first, but not that hard. They'll eat Toopa root or Wide Grass, though they prefer Lem fruit. I think we'd have more trouble finding a place to breed them. I suppose with Charley here we can live on the move, stopping to feed the Boduclos, then head on out again. We'd probably need at least sixteen of them to keep us all fed though, without running out I mean. Might not be enough space in Charley for us and the food.\"<br>\r\n\"Ungh.\" Arnold says sadly \"I guess I could sleep out here if we keep da food in Charley. We got tents.\" And he waved up to Charley's back. Up there are fuzzy lumps that you thought were part of the creature. Now you realize they look like folded versions of what you saw back at the camp, what you thought were tee pees. That's what the girl's must have been kept in.<br>\r\n\"OK, that could work.\" You muse \"But we still have to get the Boduclos. Can we work for someone and accept Boduclos as payment? Without tags?\"<br>\r\nYandi turns to face you, rather disconcerting to have her cute smiling face barely inches from you looking up from your shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Um, probably. Not as tight control here as on Commission worlds. We could find some work somewhere round here from someone who doesn't care for Guild tags. Plus we might be able to get fake tags later, once we earn some cash. But as far as Boduclos go, there are farms around here, I'm sure some would be interested in extra work, though enough to exchange for sixteen Boduclos might take a while!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Comes from Arnold \"Den I work for you. You sound like you know what you is talking about. Your de boss lady now... er, what is your name miss?\"<br>\r\n\"Lucy.\" You say, and shake Arnold's furry hand \"Lucy Hendricks. Pleased to have you onboard Arnold.\"</span></div></div>",
