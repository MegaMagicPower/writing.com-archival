Your brown hair grew out to the length of your shoulders and somehow got some amber highlights on them, not that you were complaining, they looked good. Your stubble had all but disappeared leaving smooth skin and a lovely face with large eyes. You look down and see that while your arms are slimmer, you chest grew quite large, your new breasts stretching out your white tank top. Your jeans felt tighter around your waist and did little to hide your firm and ample but as you used your hand to feel its curviness and how it transitioned into well shaped legs. All in all, Alex was right, you are sexier than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" you finally get out, \"I could get used to this body,\" you say as you feel grope your breasts, which were easily the largest you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, once you're done molesting yourself, can we move on?\" Alex blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move on to what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go out and get some drinks! We can't do this shit sober.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna get drunk, why can't we drink here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause I'm all out of beer. Plus, I'm dating the bartender at the place across the street. She'll give us at least two rounds on the house for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" you think about it for a while. Getting drunk. But maybe that was the point. Plus, you really wanted to give your female body a try and show it off. \"Okay, let's do it,\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" Alex responded. \"Lemme get dressed first. And I'll get you some clothes too.\" She briefly looked down at your chest after that statement, \"Although they might to be your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were both dressed (Alex wearing a miniskirt and a sleeveless crop top and you wearing your jeans and one of Alex's sweaters, which was too small and clung you your breasts and showed quite a bit of midriff) Alex asked about one more thing before you both left for the bar. \"Hey, wanna make another wager before we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at the bar there are two types of uniforms that the female bartenders have to wear: a classic bartender suit or a skimpy dress. Guess which one my girlfriend will be wearing tonight and you can...\" she paused as she thought of a prize before you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take your head,\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" she asks, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask. \"The wager can be about anything right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I guess. That's just kind of weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm into some weird stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, fine then. And to keep with the theme of body part stealing, if you guess wrong, I take your arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My arms? Why not my head?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause A. unlike you, I don't have a fetish for that and B. I think it would be cool to have four arms, something that I do have a fetish for that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fair enough. Pretty sure losing my arms would make me look sexier anyway\" you say smuggly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Then it's a bet\" With that you both head to the bar.</span></div></div>",

His deep, sexy voice answers. \"What the hell do you want?\" You answered, your high pitched, nerdy voice silly next to his masculine one. \"I want to make a bet. If I win, I take everything good about you, and you take everything bad about me. If you win, everything good about you doubles.\" He answered mockingly,\" Sure, whatever. I can beat you in anything. What is the bet. \"I roll this virtual dice, which has a billion billion sides. If it rolls a one, you win. Anything else, I win.\" \" What? No!\" \"Sorry, you already agreed. You can't go back.\" You click roll. You get a massive number. Suddenly, you roll back. You hear a groan on the phone. You can feel a burning sensation all over your body. Suddenly, your feet rip open your shoes, as they quadruple in size, from size six to size twenty four. Chad is blabbering on the phone. \"What the hell?! My feet just shrank! I thought you were messing!\" Suddenly, your legs started to grow out, stretching alongside your torso and arms! You knew for a fact that he was 6' 6\", but you felt as if you were nearing 8 feet! Suddenly, your skinny legs started to flesh out into rock hard pillars of muscle. The diamond shape muscle was just as hard as diamond too. Your quads started to expand too, his shorts riding up. Your glutes bubbled out into a muscle butt.  You felt ectasy as your 3\" dick multiplied many times in size, becoming 24\" long. The feeling ran up your massive torso, giving you 10 ripped, veiny, sweaty abs.  It swelled your pecs out, becoming hard mounds of muscle.  It also swelled your arms to massive proportions. You felt a body wide tingle as your skin became less thick, outlining your muscles even more. It then started on your face. Your jaw became more angular and your brow widened.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story is basically the same premis as another one of mine in Transformation Stories Revamped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day you gain the power to make bets and set challenges that can alter reality depending on the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for example  you can flip a coin were if heads is chosen Person Tails is now a nerd amd if tails wins Person Heads is now 3 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso changes can be made for the sake of a bet, such as evening out physical capacities for a challenge of skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultiple people have this ability, but a person without the ability can be included in such bets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no perk for useing your power with another  with it as the default but feel free to add one. And any other limits you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is considered good form to give penalties an end date though not required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA person must be in a bet to be drastically altered by it, though a change to atleast one participant can have ripple effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters (I'll add more as I see ones worth adding into the story, and updating bios with additions I like) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtagonist:<br>\r\nMatthew Monet one of those bright kids who never wound up achieving anything, works in a big box store. Still lives at home amd always wonders how he messed up his life so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefanie Monet 2 years Matthews Jr. , lives nearby workes in an office. Her maturity fluctuates on a whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah Monet four years Matthews jr a bartender and eternal student, recently moved back home due too necessity as her job has her being sent for events around the country alot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay Monet  the widowed mother of the 3 and a manager in a retail warehouse. Wants nothing more then to live alone, with grandchildren as a distant second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan \"Meg\" Rhay a friend of Matthews, married, cosplayer, professional makeup artist for a thearter troupe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel Rhay Megs husband, works in a different location of the same chain as Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex Burgh Matthews best friend, a hothead, and always up for a good challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Rules:<br>\r\n1) No endless choice branchs, you can leave options open but if it's over 5 deep I reserve the right to close it.<br>\r\n2) Especially while the story is still short please keep most chapters decent size, minimum a paragraph. I don't want substance outnumbered by choice chapters.<br>\r\n3) Sex of any sort is ok (within reason) be as detailed as you want except, please use your digression on when to add detail. I will modify or delete chapters in this set if in too bad a taste.<br>\r\n4) You can change the protagonist inside of story lines.<br>\r\n5) Please don't kill off the main character, unless you have already set up a replacement.<br>\r\n..5a) Set up a new character first, or use an existing one.<br>\r\n..5b) By this I mean write them out, actual killing is ok if the story still follows them (like a possession story, or revival is imminent.) Other characters are ok to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther stuff:<br>\r\n* I will reward good chapters or ones that peak my interest.<br>\r\n* Directions I would appreciate the story taking (And increase chances of reward) include but are not limited to Gender changing, Orientation changing, Age Regression, Race Change, Life Swap, and Partial Body Swaps. Though feel free to go in whatever direction you like.<br>\r\n* I reserve the right to edit your chapters, I won't typically do this beyond maybe spelling/continuity errors and adding additional options when i think necessary.</td>",
