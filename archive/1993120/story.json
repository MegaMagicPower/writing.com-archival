Now here you are, crouched behind the fence of your parents' backyard. It is the middle of the afternoon with most residents of the neighborhood either at work or in school. It's a good thing too, after all, what would they think to see a man dressed in full army battle dress uniform camouflage, green face paint, a worn out machete holstered (your only 'weapon' and due to being worn will not last long) and carrying a large brown rucksack of survival equipment to complete the tools and accessories attached to the uniform? Despite everything, you feel super excited and you cannot back out now. You turned away from everything and went all in. This is going to not only be an adventure but a lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a tiny black box with a red button on the center from your pocket. This would be your final chance if there is any. You can still turn back now and just live at your family's house and get your bearings back until you can have your own job and apartment again. It would be like starting over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool breeze blows, across your face and you realize that this is such a stupid idea. Your thoughts are right, you should turn back. You start to lower the device down to your pocket.... \"Fuck that.\" You say, quickly pressing down the button before you change your mind again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Poof</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash of light blinds you and the world as you know it changes for good. The environment is instantly different. Your eyes start to adjust after the impairing flash blindness and you find yourself surrounded by a dense jungle of grass the size of trees. The air is cooler in temperature despite being a hot summer afternoon, the effects of the shady jungle and your tiny body having a harder time retaining heat in the ultra-sized earth. Weird sounds alien-like groans, buzzing, clicking and cracking fill the air in a constant ambience. The sounds of now gigantic bugs and animals making for an otherworldly jungle. The sap from the grass-like trees also made the air humid as the sun evaporated it but the cool air from the shade refused to let it escape. A true rainforest. Your heart stops for a second as you realize the shrinking device is no longer in your hand, it fell out during your shrinking session. It was designed to shrink along with the user to make it possible to reactivate it and grow again but now the device is lost at a tiny size amongst the grass. You could try to search for it but your survival instincts kick in and you realize every piece of energy you have must be used wisely. The initial experience in this jungle will be  your most crucial and will decide how the rest of your adventure or life shall turn out. If you are desperate enough to grow back you can find this place and search until kingdom come, otherwise, the result is the same. You are shrunk and trying to survive, tired of the world and deciding to live however you choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning your head up, you see a gigantic wooden wall stretching perhaps a thousand feet or two. The backyard fence, but the gap under it is easily big enough to drive a semi stacked on top of each other 3 times through. You walk under the fence and although the grassy jungle shows no change, you realize you are now in the backyard of your family. A place that may as well be its own country or even world in your proportion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that your first goal out in this jungle should be to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shelter is what you decide to prioritize. Nothing is a bad choice in this initial encounter stage but not being decisive while you have the time and energy can be fatal. Your reasoning for building the shelter is to have a temporary base of operations and safety until you can expand and learn how to survive better. Also, more simply, shelters take time and who knows how long it will be before it gets dark by the time you find a place and then actually build the shelter. Most predators are active at night and you are now in the food chain of various creatures out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the dense forests, the blades of grass and vines brushing against you already start to rip apart your uniform which was old and weak to begin with. Soon you may have to make clothing for yourself and when you get proficient who knows what kind of tools, clothing, and shelters you will be making. But for now, you are near defenseless and just hoping you do not run into anything carrying nothing but a busted machete that is barely sharp enough to pierce grass. Between the clicking noises and moans, you are on constant edge of a predatory spider sweeping out the grass and piecing your chest with its fangs. The noises you create do not help either as the ground is littered with brown, dead grass that crumbles under your feet and there are the noises created from your pushing through the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing through more blades you hear particularly loud click and you freeze still. The sounds of grass moving sounds despite you being still and you look to your left to see a black figure the size of a truck through several pieces of grass, you are unable to identify it but it is way bigger than you which is enough to leave you standing still. A few minutes pass when it disappears and you quickly run forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to a small circular clearing with dark soil on the ground instead of dead grass. This is as good a spot as any for now, so you start to get to work. You became good at making tents but you did not pack a portable tent with you due to its weight so you will have to build from scratch. Using your machete, you cut down a blade of grass and cut large chunks out of it and then cut very thin pieces to make a vine or rope. You then make small holes into the large chunks of grass and put the rope through the holes to tie them together. A green, shoddy, makeshift tent is soon standing in the middle of the clearing. It is far from perfect and provides very little protection from any creature that truly wants to reach you but it is way better than sleeping in the open and makes for an OK hiding spot against the low developed brains of the bugs. They may be stronger but at least you are waaay smarter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom making this shelter your crafting and shelter making skills have increased. You also move around the grass jungle a little more efficiently making your traveling skills better. Unfortunately, your machete is ever weaker from using what sharpness it has left to cut the grass and you have not eaten yet so your energy level is significantly lower, especially after traveling and building a shelter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lounge inside your tent away from the sun and decide to...</span></div></div>",

Pulling it up, it's a can of chicken soup. You only have three cans and know you need to use them wisely, this first night is as good a time as any since you need to save energy until you can decide what your next focus will be tomorrow. You now need to make a small fire to heat the contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the tent, you walk away from the clearing into the jungle to grab dead pieces of grass off the ground. You make a pile of the dead grasses and then you go back to your rucksack and grab out a piece of flint. In front of the pile of dead grass you hold your flint to the pile and use your machete to slice into the mineral, producing sparks. It takes several minutes and lots of cursing under your breath but eventually you start up a small campfire. You pull the tab on top of the soup can and then cook it over the open fire. Soon the contents are warm enough and you dig your dirty hands into the can, stuffing the soup and chunks of chicken into your mouth. It feels kind of weird eating chicken as it is now something you could never hope of killing now, in fact, if you somehow stumbled into a farm you would make a very easy snack for such a creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish he can and toss it in the small fire. The flames grow fainter while you stay close to enjoy the comforting warmth. There is no point in keeping the fire going as it may alert predators to your position and with your weak shelter and weaponry such an assault would result in a humiliating early end. Your campfire becomes nothing but an ash pile as the embers fade and the sky is only faintly lit due to the sunset. The noises of grass brushing together, clicking, moaning and even the shrieks of unfortunate bugs start to fill the air as you know it is the time for the nocturnal predators of the backyard. You go to your tent and shut it closed, undressing from your sweaty camouflage and boots. Laying on top of a cut blade of grass is not quite the same as a bed or sleeping bag by any means. Your machete is tightly gripped in your hands, although practically useless as a weapon, it is the only thing you got and it provides some comfort as the sickening sounds of multiple legs moving and the sounds of the bugs and birds of prey only allow you small bursts of sleep throughout the night, waking up in sweats to the constant noises that feel particularly close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up for the umpteenth time but it is not to a noise, it is because you simply cannot sleep anymore. The noises of night have died down and you open the tent slightly to see it is mostly dark but the sky is partially light from the west, dawn is approaching. You get back in the tent; dressing back up and packing. The nocturnal creatures are either full from the hunt or getting drowsy and traveling along now will allow you to maximize the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your fire making skills have increased. The strength of your machete is even weaker along with the blade being dull. The effects of little sleep make take a small toll eventually.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThis time you will...</span></div></div>",

Like food for example, how much did you have again? Taking off the pack you inventory the minimal amount of food you brought. Maybe enough for 2 days. 3 if you stretch it. Sanity grabs hold of you and you realize the series of mistakes that\u2019s led here. You are pretty much the bottom of the food chain, in a hostile and uncertain environment, no real plan and barely enough food or water, and a machete for a weapon, smaller than the tip of a pen. Oh and of course, NO SHRINK RAY! You\u2019ll be luck to last an hour out here with this level of preparation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurriedly put on your pack and begin sprinting away from the rainforest of your family\u2019s backyard. Under the titanic fence again. You must find the dropped ray. You would return to your previous size, beg your parents to live with them for a couple of weeks, and do this right next time. You had a couple of half finished projects in a small lockbox you had stored in the garage before you shrank. A miniature survivalist bunker you had designed, and a suit that gave limited boosts to agility and toughness. You had written them off in your eagerness to start this adventure, your reasoning being that a true survivalist wouldn\u2019t cheat like that. You\u2019re all for cheating now that you realize a human being cam\u2019t survive in this world, evolution hadn\u2019t given you flight, or poisonous fangs, or 6 legs. You\u2019d need both desperately if you want to even have a chance to survive down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve so far not spotted any critters, but no ray either. The former was guaranteed to happen sooner or later. You stumble upon a patch of what appears to be recently dead grass. Perhaps caused by the ray shrinking on the ground? Thinking quickly, you climb the nearest healthy stalk, its like 6 stories tall, but fortunately at a manageable slope. The grooves in the plant act as handholds. Reaching the tip of the stalk, your weight too inconsequential to even cause it to bend, you scan over the several acre sized dead area, desperate for a glimmer of shiny metal.</span></div></div>",

You slide down the stalk, rolling as you reach the bottom and then make your way over the charred stalks the ray had somehow fried. Reaching the center you grasp the ray with eager hands and thank any deity listening for finding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know when something might go wrong, so you resolve to grow immediately. You can make up an excuse on the fly to your parents. Checking your watch, its been roughly 45 minutes since you used the device, which meant you could grow back anytime. The battery allowed about 2 firings a day as long as you gave it a half hour in between to cool down. Switching the knob to grow, you smash the button and a strong sense of vertigo overtakes you as you reacquire your former stature. The two thousand foot tall fence now stands merely a head over you. You glance down to the burn spot, now no bigger than your hand. You think you can even recognize the grass stalk you climbed not 5 minutes ago, put you can\u2019t be sure. Wow, you were small. And almost wishing to return already. You will, you resolve, soon. Just need a couple of weeks to prepare properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby is that you?!\u201d You are startled as your mom rounds the corner of the fence near the sidewalk, a leash in one hand with her Great Dane, Mammoth, in tow. \u201cWhat are you doing here, and why are you dressed like that?\u201d You are bought a second to come up with a lie and Mammoth bounds over to you, happily barking. \u201cHey big guy!\u201d You\u2019d always liked Mammoth, he was eternally a puppy at heart. \u201cUhm well, funny story\u201d you begin cautiously, but then it all falls into place in your head. \u201cMore crazy, actually, I dumped the apartment a bit too soon, my trip doesn\u2019t start for like 2 more weeks, so Im kinda homeless and after my little selling spree these are like the only clothes I have left. Not my best call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother\u2019s suspicions instantly melt away at your sob story. \u201cOh you poor thing.\u201d She moves to hug you, and you instantly feel guilty for lying, and a bit also for what you planned to do. Live in her backyard, under her nose, but never see her or hug her again. You kind of felt like a shitty kid. Youll address your reservations later, for now she hands you a key to the house, telling you to let yourself in while she walks Mammoth real quick. She turns to leave but your eyes linger for a moment as she walks past the patch of burnt grass near the sidewalk that until 5 minutes ago was a huge burnt field to you, she glances at it briefly but shrugs, probably thought some cigarette had caused it. You can\u2019t help but wonder what it would have looked like if you had taken a few more minutes to restore yourself. Would she have noticed her insect son? Doubtful. You certainly would have noticed her. Towering over the grass stalks like a skyscraper. You then think if you\u2019d been in the grass would you have noticed her then? The thick teeming blades seemed to muffle outside sound pretty well. You figure you would have felt it, minor tremors caused by the footfalls of the gods and monsters going about their ordinary days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you will get to experience those things soon enough you reckon. You proceed to your house, unlock the door, then run to the garage, grabbing your lockbox. Fortunately it\u2019s the middle of the day so the family aside from your mom are out of the house. You head upstairs, your old room still there, untouched in years. You sigh, memories good and bad washing over you. You steel yourself, no time for a trip down memory lane. You gotta come up with a little more detail to your lie, not to mention finish the survivalist shelter and the suit in 2 weeks. You set to work immediately, grabbing your old toolkit from under the bed, a door slamming downstairs and call lunch requests signaling the return of your mom. What will happen?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last two weeks had been somewhat fulfilling. Oh sure there were the questions, the subtle criticisms now of your supposed life choices. A couple of barbed conversations. But all in all, meals with the family, movie nights, and your work gave you some sorely needed moral strength. You were still gonna go through with your plan, modified and now with different goals, motivations, and you were certain you were much better prepared. Additionally, if you managed to make it the next 6 months, documenting every day and philosophizing on the larger issues that micro life has on both the individual and possible benefits to society, you would certainly consider publishing your findings and revealing the tech to the wider world. You'd definitely show your family all the pictures and the journal first, justify your decision to quit your job and being absent for 6 months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you survived...you grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that front, the last two weeks had been absolutely essential. You most enjoyed working on the shelter. It was a 2.5 inch tall cylinder, with a diameter of 1.5 inches. To your 1/3 of an inch tall form it would appear about 44 feet tall and 26 feet at its widest. Of course, it would be almost entirely underground, with only a metal hatch and the top of the surprisingly sturdy concrete structure visible to the outside world. You had been working on its amenities throughout the first week, growing it to dollhouse sized in your room and filing the stores, providing tools, a bed, wiring, etc. It was like building a model home, something you had done growing up several times. Two AAA batteries resided in the bottom, to provide emergency power should the solar panels on the roof be damaged. Finally you closed it up, welded the openings and shrunk it down to appropriate size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit had been much more difficult. If super suits were easy, everyone would have one. It wasn't even that super. Despite the shrinking technology, you had to rely almost entirely on existing tech in making it. It wouldn't have even worked at full size. Its design was completely dependent on being small. It provided small boosts to jumping power, speed, and the armor could absorb greater falls than his knees would, the armor provided some protection from impacts. the elements, and even limited protection from some of the creatures he was about to share a world with, but he wasn't Iron Man. The final additions were a small parachute, due to his small size a large one would not be needed in any fall, the air currents sharing a much greater share of the load, and a grappling belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only gotten the day before he was scheduled to leave. The family had a send off dinner, tears were shed, hugs were had, hands shaked. It helped him finalize his altered plan. He couldn't do to them what he had tried two weeks ago. The more he thought about it the worse it made him feel. He was going to live in their backyard, unprepared, lying to them for months, trying to survive not just the elements, but them. His dad had made him mow the lawn just last week. He had hesitated before starting it up, worried, absurdly he knew, that he might be killing some other tiny adventurer. Of course, he knew this was pure nonsense. Only he had the tech, and if by some miracle someone else had managed it, why would they be in HIS backyard. Still, it was not as preposterous as it had been only 2 weeks before. After finishing the mowing, he had noted a couple of places he would have been able to build a shelter out of the way of the mower. Mom's garden, the dirt patch in the corner. But if he was caught out here at any time the mower was used, which was just about every week, he'd be a goner. It wasn't fair to his family, that if he did die that one of them may be the cause, however unknowingly. It wasn't fair that if he did not survive, his last memories of them wouldn't be this meal, but as enemies, terrible forces of destruction that he had to work every day to overcome, or scurry in fear from under them. Plus, practically, any place with high human traffic would necessarily entail hundreds of additional dangers that weren't to be found in the wilds of the nearby forest you used to run and bike in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day he departed, sad but hopeful of the future. He had almost told them of his insane plan, but he couldn't afford to. If they knew their son was bug sized a couple of miles away, fighting for his life, well they'd never let him leave. One last tearful wave and he was gone. He had the Uber driver he'd called drop him off near the trail head. He wondered when or if he'd next see a human being. The glade he had in mind was about a hundred feet off the main trail. He's spent many days in summer eating lunch there, or climbing the large oak tree there. This trail wasn't particularly  well traveled either. No more than a few people a day would use it, and even fewer would leave the path. Maybe he'd journey over to it one day, to catch his first sight of a giant, but for now he made his way down the trail. Recognizing the spot where he'd gone exploring from and found the glade, he made his first steps into the wilderness. A couple of minutes later he entered the glade. The sun shone through a large gap in the canopy, a single large oak tree dominated the higher side of the glade, a small stream bubbled up from the earth not far down the small slope from the tree's base. A small pond lay at the bottom of the slope, with various small bushes and grass populating the rest of the glade. You do some quick surveying of the area and decide the best bet it at the base of the tree, between two large roots, not far up the slope from the brook. Protected from the elements, offering access to the tree and to water, up a slope so away from flooding, its as perfect as it gets. You remove the cylinder that is to be your new home for 6 months from your backpack and gently place it in a small hole you dug. After packing in the dirt around it, you remove the suit from the backpack and begin putting it on. Once finished you take a big gulp of air, \"Tiny Survival: Second Attempt\" you state matter of factually. You hit the red button on the shrinker, and once more sink nearly instantaneously into another world. The world below. </span></div></div>",

Slapping your hand, you rise up in bed. 5 AM, as usual. You jump into your routine swiftly. 50 pushups, 50 situps. Short break, panting, then half the pushups and situps, then half that. Sweating, you head for the bathroom for your shower. Well, it was supposed to be a shower, but in you're haste to construct your shelter, you had apparently forgotten how physics worked (although then how does electricity work you wonder). Water doesn't act the same when you're large ant sized. Since then you had filled the tub with a drop or so of fresh water. Reaching your hands through the resistant surface tension, you pull out a smaller droplet and effectively use it as a sponge, rubbing it on your much fitter body than you'd had 4 months ago. It had taken two weeks to figure that one out, pee yew you had smelled. After your improvised \"shower\" you made your way to your kitchenette, starting the stove, you move to the fridge and remove a piece of berry from the berry bush located across the glade, and a meat like substance with carapace on the bottom. You'd rather not get into the details of that dish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it cooked, you activated your miniaturized phone you had acquired the day before you began this journey, well miniaturized to the size of a large screen to you, and start some music, while starting the morning's standard downloads. Amazingly, again due to physics beyond your understanding but hey the shrink ray worked small or big, you had the weakest of signals, allowing slow, but relatively reliable downloads. You cared nothing for the day's politics, stocks, or entertainment news. No, you had focused purely on reports, scholarly articles, and other memorandum on the state and problems of the Earth's environment, the ultimate goal this project sought to one day solve. It had also been useful for more personal purposes. Sending your parents regular, if falsified, updates, record your daily journal and theories, and, occasionally...philosophical tests...to put it kindly. Let's just say you didn't start this journey without being absolutely fascinated with the massive shift in your relative status in the world, especially compared to other humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you prepare your plate, you glance at the marker board to review today's agenda. Primary: Refill water supplies (5 drops), maintenance check on batteries, Secondary: Berry run or bug hunt, Tertiary: Local mapping and exploration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown a bit. Basic survival was a must in this environment, but you always found your runs and exploration much more enjoyable. You figure that while extremely important, you aren't exactly super low on water and the stream was close, and you could easily check the batteries before your other goals. Any run or local exploration and documentation would have to be preceded by your mandatory Trevorina check. Oh, Trevorina, originally Trevor before discovering that female wolf spiders are much larger than their male counterparts, Trevorina had been a constant antagonist in this jungle. At about an inch and a half long, she dwarfs your 3/8th form. Sometimes you wouldn't see her for many days, other times she'd lurk near your shelter for as long as 48 hours. She had taken a particular interest in you since you'd taken one of her eyes. You hated her and feared her immensely, although you'd be lying if some little part of you didn't find the game of life or death exhilarating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the many things you had experienced and accomplished in your time here far outweighed a grudge with one spider. It was time to decide what to do with your day as you finish your meal, the thick gooey texture of the berry sliding down your throat, texture make everything taste so different down here!. You prepare to put on your suit. Hmmm, what to do....</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For four months you had been responsible, diligent, and committed to surviving at this size. It had worked out, and you had thousands of photographs, pages upon pages of records and observations, amazing memories. You were working on your main thesis, that humanity must embrace this new life for the good of the planet and its own survival. You were really going to risk that because you wanted to indulge some silly desires? No. You're getting the water. You suit up, and then descend a small stairwell from your main living quarters. There, in the base of the cylinder are two AAA batteries. Your emergency backup. Unlike the rest of the structure, they were the only normal sized items in your shelter. At just over a quarter inch, they were head and shoulders above you, even laying down. One of your papers discussed the amazing potential to harness small amounts of energy to power entire miniaturized cities, this one could power your shelter for weeks. It could also power the recharger for your transposer. Your hand tracks down the giant battery as you begin looking at the wiring. Everything seemed in order. The rain storm last week had been torrential and you had worried about leaks. However, you had chosen your location well, the spot between the large roots was sheltered above by the tree and was on a small hill. Well, a hill to you, a mound when you first arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the inspection complete, you head up the stairs and prepare your small survival pack, packing a large receptacle for the water. It would take 5 trips, but was very manageable weight wise. You had learned that even without the suit, your were able to lift larger objects than you ever could at normal size. Perhaps something to do with the compactness of the muscles. You open the metal door that leads to the main staircase. It was a second layer of defense, should some creature penetrate the staircase room, which also was a storage area for supplies and water. You thought about the two times that had almost occurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time was when you had foolishly ignored your own suit's sensors. It was the 3rd week, and you'd yet to come across the mega fauna yet. Well, this mega fauna was something you'd have laughed at 3 weeks before. 50 feet out of your shelter, you noticed a rustling in the grass no more than a football field away, a large heat signature. The giant creature emerged, a chipmunk. It had to be around 100 feet tall, as it sat on it's hind legs and began chewing on some nut. You watched in awe, as the mega creature towered over the surrounding landscape. You didn't think of the danger until the creature's head turned towards you, beady eyes seeming to pierce you. Chipmunks were omnivores...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you took off towards the shelter, desperate to get inside the hatch before it was too late. You felt the ground thundering behind you. How could something so small create such tremors you cried to yourself. You spared one glance back, to see the 100 foot chipmunk bearing down on you. You reached the hatch to your sanctuary, and frantically opened it before it was too late, you dove inside and then reached up, pulling it tight and sealing you off from the outside world. A gigantic collection of fingers crashed down on the outside, trying desperately to gain some kind of angle on the small hatch. You'd sat on your bum, while you watch the chipmunk's paws slam against the outside of the door. The power shook the insides of your structure, and you briefly worried it would dig and uproot it. It was nearly 3 times bigger than your entire shelter after all. However, the creature soon gave up, you were just an insect to it after all, not worth too much effort. One last slam of its paws on the exterior, and it moved off, low thumps accompanying its departure. Such power in such a tiny creature. It wouldn't be the first time you doubted whether humans should try to live at this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time involved Trevorina. She had ambushed you, back before you knew to look for her due to her obsession. You hadn't managed to close the hatch when you dove inside. Her spindly legs reached into the opening, threatening to pull you out to her waiting maw. You had pulled your combat knife, jabbed one of her legs, then her terrifying face appeared over the entrance, staring through your very soul with murderous intent. You'd tossed the knife, it landed in one of her eyes. A horrible squeal and and she had retreated, the knife left behind in a bloody mess. She wasn't anything compared to the chipmunk, but she terrified you far more than it ever could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the hatch and conducted your customary scan. Nothing on visuals, nothing on heat. Time to go gather some water. You exited the hatch...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No visible threats, you exited the hatch, closing it behind you. You made your way to the stream near to your base. It had been a reliable source of water throughout your time here. When you first spotted it it was little more than a trickle of water, now you could be washed away in it if you weren't careful. You took once last glance around, creatures at streams were often prime prey. You dipped your chest sized container into the stream, filling it up quickly. 4 more runs, you figured as you proceeded the 200 yards or so to your shelter. You looked up at the tree canopy so high above the grass canopy that surrounded you, a beautiful day, bathing the ground in sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ascended the small hill, almost to your shelter the wind picked up. The branches in the oak tree swayed, but it mostly remained the same at your level, beneath that force. But the wind carried something with it. A low humming seemed to accompany the wind. Then you began to feel something faint through your feet. Rumbling. Every other second and thump, Thump, THUMP, louder with each iteration. Your mind screamed at you to return to your shelter, but you had never experienced anything like this since your arrival 4 months ago. The humming sound increased, clearly a tune of some kind. You KNEW what this was, but you weren't ready. You hadn't expected this, not unless you went to the human trail. Any why would you? At your size the trail was approximately 5 miles away, through unpredictable, uncharted, and hostile terrain. If like had been a challenge in this area, with all your upgrades, temporary shelters, cameras, and so on. That challenge had always been extremely risky, and what would the payoff be? Maybe you stand there for hours, avoiding predators, so that MAYBE someone might come stomping along for the briefest of glances. Not worth it. So you figured you wouldn't see another human being at this size. Well that was sounding incorrect, as your world thumped hard enough to shake your entire frame. Where was this mystery giant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, above one of the roots that guarded your shelter, a massive figure emerged. She was simply enormous. Strawberry brunette, short hair, fit, tan, and no less than an 8, emerald eyes, blue top, tight khaki hiking shorts, legs that went on forever, large backpack. Beauty to match her absolutely intimidating form. You had run the numbers, at your size, a six foot person would be approximately 1300 feet. Basically the size of the Empire State Building. You had thought that was intellectually astounding, but actually witnessing a moving, living skyscraper was insane. You were in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked out over the glade that had been your home these past four months. No longer humming, she seemed to be assessing the spot. With a smile, her mouth opened and a thundering \"Perfect!\" echoed down into your minuscule ears. Lifting one of her enormous hiking boots well over the root, it planted itself firmly down the hill, well over 400 feet from you and your shelter, shaking you greatly, as the woman strode partially over you. Her other foot followed, and you could feel even from this distance the air displacement she caused. You dropped your water container in shock over this entire experience. The woman proceeded another dozen steps before stopping in the middle of the glade, each step shaking you, each boot crushing down on the grass, pebbles, and likely insects that often outsized you, she didn't even notice. She dominated the landscape you called home, that to you was the size of a county at least. Removing her large backpack and dropping it to the ground, to the displacement of tons of dust you saw her rooting around inside. It seemed like you had a new guest in your home, one who had no idea of your existence, no idea she was being watched by another sentient being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

To travel all that distance, across hostile terrain and beset by unknown horrors, for a mere <i>chance</i> at seeing a human being?  Impractical.  Risky.  Wasteful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you have rolled over the possibility in your head.  Many times, over the months, you've thought over the possible sights...  Clearly, the ability to view such a monster without any risk to yourself is all win-win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo risk, as lesser creatures like chipmunks or spiders dare not get so close to such an alpha predator.  Even you, with your evolved, intelligent brain, have to fight against primal fear to look across at the crouched immensity those vast metres away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rummages in that village-sized backpack of hers, facing away from you as you slowly pace closer.  Simple movements from the being crash across to you like thunder, and that is just the movement of her hands and fingers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could she have come here for?  You, as a child, climbed the worldtree oak even now shading the two of you, and perhaps this being has a similar nostalgic link to this remote glade.  There's certainly little else here, unless she's merely here to take a break from her hiking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the foot of the slope now, you cross onto flatter ground, realising with a shudder the reason for this level field.  Ahead of you for some hundred and seventy feet, nearly a third of that across, the grass that once towered over you like a jungle canopy has been stomped flat, the footprint of one step from the woman's hiking boot having found no resistance there.  You stumble on more timidly, seeing the resilient plantlife already beginning to spring back to shape, only the weakest stalks dead and bleeding sap.  Would that you could bounce back from such an impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you walk closer, watching the back of this colossus, nerves a-tingle at the thrill that she may rise and move at any moment, speed and power beyond you - she could be upon you like she was upon the grass before you knew it, obliterating you, your hopes and your chances of saving the world in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't stop you walking, though.  You need to understand her, to see just what a goliath like this is capable of.  Even your most optimistic predictions of a miniaturised future population admit that a class of 'standard'-sized humans would be useful for protection and labour.  Not too many, but definitely some.  Observing this stranger definitely feels less creepy than watching your only family for such purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves!  You jump back, for all the good those fractions of an inch would do, and watch as her hands emerge from the bag, clasped together.  They grasp a structure, a tower some hundred and fifty feet tall, and one hand twists it at its summit.  It lifts further, her hair falling back as she tilts her head, the bottle meeting her lips and a gurgling cascade of liquid crashing into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thing must have a capacity in excess of a tenth of a ton!  And here you are, having trouble carrying a single droplet of water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, where <i>did</i> you leave that water?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sudden panic, you rush back up the slope, the din of the woman drinking a backing track as you scour the countryside for your container.  Luckily, its rotund form has not rolled too far from where you dropped it.  You should not let your fascinations overcome you!  You'll store this batch away before you properly inspect the giant, and once she's moved on resume your water rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the hatch, descending as the earth quakes around you, the woman clearly on the move.  <i>Don't go!</i> you will.  <i>Not yet!  Wait for me, please!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the barrel down the first opportunity you get, not willing to let this rare sight escape you.  Back to the exit, you re-emerge into open air to see what the woman has done in your absence:</span></div></div>",

Regardless of your tiny life in the world around you, it worked, it made sense. Survival of the fittest, struggle to the top. Now, looking at what you were looking at, there was no way to top that. That body slowly lumbering above and far away from you was the fittest by default. It didn't hurt that she was beautiful, but you were an insect to her, she encompassed your view, your attention, but she had no knowledge of your existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had made your way down the hill, steadily towards the grass edge, and no more than ten or so paces from her and her tent, where she was currently writing some entry in her booklet. Studying something so far away, so beneath her. Maybe you could give her some pointers you mirthed. The not so subtle thuds roiled lightly through your body as she shifted her weight on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustling from the grass to your left would have given your hunter away a dozen times before, but you'd been too enraptured with the goddess before you. Leaping out came Trevorina. Her form was easily 3 times you length wise. Bounding towards you, you fall to your back. She and her 7 legs and 7 eyes are here for blood. You'd been too distracted, but she took the disturbance of the god far away as an opportunity. You had realized long ago that intelligence was not limited to size, but this startled you nonetheless. You pulled your small staff from your back. It wasn't much. but it packed enough of a punch to have take her eye in the first place. Closing the door to your shelter on her leg had taken that. Not a fun memory as she had clawed furiously into your small shelter. Desperate to end your existence, human or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had you. You were hundreds of your yards from your shelter. Running was certain death. Staying and fighting was near near certain death. But what choice did you have? You readied  your spear. You'd make this fucking wolf spider pay goddammit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe charged, straight at you. It was so fast, but at your small size you had learned that the world slowed down, just a bit. Just enough, as you parried her charge and stabbed at her body, causing her to flip away from the spear over your small crouched form and impact the ground on the far side, causing and audible *thump* as she quickly scrambled and recovered, her aggressive posture returning towards  you. The first round went to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou readied to parry her next charge when suddenly you heard, and more importantly FELT the thump, Thump, THUMP of footsteps caused by the giant woman.You spared a glance upward to notice that she now overshadowed your area, God she was enormous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, Trevorina may have been mildly taken aback by this development, but she seemed to be recovering quickly. After all, she was used to being in the shadow of giants, human, or otherwise. You were her focus for now. The struggle was here, not up there. She squared up against you again. God she was big you fretted. At least 2 and half times your length, just about 16 feet wide. Fuck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer glistening fangs seemed to drip the venom of death that she wanted to unleash on you. You locked eyes, 7 to 2, you crouched, ready to strike any assault...THUMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow fell over you and Trevorina...neither of you honestly paid much attention, considering the circumstances. You were in a life or death struggle, what was a couple of earthquakes? You, knowing what the thumps meant, spared a glance upwards, and almost fell back in shock if it wasn't for the ungodly sized murderous spider in front of you. A gigantic eye, easily larger than the spider in front of you, probably distorted by the magnifying glass, seemed to be gazing down upon you and Trevorina. It seems you have an audience for you life or death struggle. Not far beyond the eyes you notice the giant brunettes hair, her kinda stunning edifice of a face, but far below past her mountain of a body, her brown hiking boots, maybe you could flee for those, she'd probably kill a spider chasing towards her feet, but an ant, what would she care? Alternatively you could give up your struggle and wave your arms for help . You don't want to die like this. Finally, you could continue your struggle for survival, after all, what did this bint know about your fight down here, she'd probably move on in moments, easily forgetting about a spider hunting its prey like any human would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't matter that you could lightly feel the shifts in her uncalculable weight, it didn't matter that you had a front row seat to her crotch area hanging overhead, or feel the heat... or even smell her just a bit. NO, NO,  you had to focus on the beast in front of you, not the living mountain that cared nothing for your existence. A spare glance noticed that her expression was plain, slightly curious at the situation unfolding at her feet. She was studying Trevorina, barely giving your form a glance. A small smirk showed bemusement as she watched from the safety of her immensity high above, the struggle of life or death of the insects below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara gazed with mild curiosity at the wolf spider about a foot and a half in front of her. It seemed to be parrying with its prey, some sort of large ant. She didn't pay the ant much heed, but instead studied the surprisingly brave wolf spider with interest. Other than seeing them in bug collections or jarred up, she had not had a chance to see one so close for so long in the wild. She would make note of that. As a botanist and environmentalist in training, she had come to these woods for a paper for her class. A couple of days studying the local fauna and especially flora would net her an easy A if she put the effort in. She had been looking for the perfect spot, and she'd found it not far off the beaten trail. A small glade with a large, somewhat rare for these parts, oak tree overshadowing it. She'd set up camp immediately, grabbed a couple small berries off the nearby berry bush, ate one, and saved the other for later study. Now she looked to the grassy world just outside her tent. Noting dozens of tiny insects scurrying about and taking note of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, she had noticed a bit of movement no more than a few feet away, at the base of a small incline that reached up and ended at the base of the oak tree, between the roots. A tiny stream, a trickle, ran out of the ground at its base and went off to her left, away from her tent. It was at least 4 or 5 feet from the action she was now taking notice of. She ambled over on her haunches and gazed down at a wolf spider, hunters that didn't build webs. True predators of the insect world. It seemed to have cornered an ant. She pulled out her magnifying glass to study the creature, and the incident, further. This would make an interesting note in her paper, she figured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't care, you realized from her face. There was no help from her, she was a goddess watching tiny creatures battle for her amusement. Clearly she hadn't recognized you human form, or you were sure there would be SOME sort of reaction. The immense green eye, little red veins magnified for your spectacle, gazed down upon your little match to the death. From above, it made sense, he didn't look very significant. Still, a part of you had prayed for her intervention. Another part of you was repulsed by the idea. This was your survival after all! You didn't want human intervention, she had butted her 1300 foot ass into your project!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these thoughts are quickly subdued by the immediate fight for your very life. You decided you could not fend off another frontal assault, and moved swiftly to your left then back to your right, spear pointed towards your foe at all times. It worked, as Trevorina seemed taken aback by your swift, unusual movements. Turning to her left and right, parrying your movements, she finally decided enough was enough and darted forward once again, however your sudden jump right caused her to rush past you, and you got a good blow on her side, drawing a bit of blood, you fell to the ground after you lunged for the blow, laying out completely. She pulled her legs in close and began watching you intently again from a few dozen feet away, where she had slightly retreated. You were sure a bug could hate. You quickly got back to your feet, focused completely on your foe, when you heard a huge *GASP* from above. Sparing a look you noticed the green orb focused not on the spider anymore, nor the fight in general. But intensely on YOU. You lost your focus on the fight as you couldn't help but look away from the gigantic eye, now clearly studying your frail form. Below and beyond the magnifying glass, you notice massive 0 shaped cave, the woman's mouth, wide open with shock. Seems she may have noticed what you were after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of your distraction, Trevorina darts forward, closing the gap quickly, she'd be on you in seconds. Your attention returns too late, and you have no tactics but to lower the spear and face the attack head on. What happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It touches down between you and Trevorina, digging into the earth slightly and separating you from your impending doom. Shockingly, Trevorina seems amplified a half dozen times, truly a frightening sight. Noting the intervention of something beyond it, the spider flees into the tall grass opposite of you. The object before you is the side of the magnifying glass. The woman had apparently either tried to crush the spider, or just bar its attack, you couldn't be sure. You laid on your back. There was no running, none that mattered anyway. You were exhausted, and even if you fled into the grass towards the stream, if the giantess followed you, you might end up under her massive tan boots as she searched for you. And you could tell, by her intense gaze towards you, that she intended to inspect you. Oh boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had been shocked by what she saw, from her angle the bug the spider was hunting didn't look all that remarkable. But when it had laid out after its last attack, she'd noticed something remarkable. It appeared human. Even with a few dull blue stripes running down its apparently black body, she could make out teeny legs and, what had to be, arms. It...it looked human. Small as any of her polly pockets from her childhood, but without the giant head, it had to be....but it couldn't, it was impossible. Just a REALLY weird bug. She needed to inspect it. And the spider she had previously focused on was no longer the most interesting thing before her. She didn't want to harm the spider, or any living creature if she could help it, so she gently placed the magnifying glass between the two creatures. She watched the spider scuttle off into the grass off her right. A small smile escaped her, as she had managed to prevent the poor things death. Returning her attention to the fascinating former prey, she looked at the \"ant\". It just sat there, awaiting her actions, she supposed. Curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing but lay here. You awaited the magnificent being above you to decide your fate. Even if you could get back to the shelter, it would take half an hour for the device to charge and restore you to your regular size. Too long for the goddess above you. She stared down at you with a mixture of curiosity and intense interest. You were the subject of her encompassing gaze. You powered on your speakers, they weren't super loud, but they'd help with this process. \"Hey...you...my name is Richard. Umm thank you with the spider.\" You noticed her eyes go wide with recognition at your voice, but you weren't sure what all got through. \"Thank you for your help, umm, thanks.\" You could only stare up at the beauty in a small sweat. She was gazing intently at you. What she decided next would decide your relationship with her... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From her squatting position, Tara continued to study the bug, when suddenly she heard a small sound emanating from it. It was faint, and she couldn't make anything out, something so small clearly incapable of putting out too loud a sound, nonetheless, it sounded alien, and yet familiar. The creature had not made any moves since she had rescued it from the spider, using this apparent calm she placed the magnifying glass to her right, then slowly extended both hands to the ground, desperate not to cause any startling movements. resting on her arms, she shifted her legs out from under her, moved them behind her, and lowered herself to her chest, now her chin rested on the soft cool earth, and her eyes were in a much better place to study the creature. She noticed that it may have moved just a little, but nothing significant. Smiling, maybe it trusted her, she turned her head slightly, pivoting on her chin, as she reached over for where she had left the magnifying glass in the grass, but did not immediately return with it, merely re-securing it for later use. For now, she turned her head back and watched the black bug with little purple lines and human like appendages. Anxious to hear the sound again, and confirm what at least a portion of her brain was beginning to accept, with an indoor voice, \"What was that sound little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo verbal response to your query, but she answers in another way, her body. Her movements were slow, steady, deliberate, even fluid. Clearly intended not to startle you. But nothing that big this close can move in a way that is anything other than intimidating to tiny you. Every time a hand, leg, and finally head made contact with the ground, you felt it through your suit's shoes. Her chest caused quite the THOOM, and a notable displacement of air and dust erupting from underneath her mass. Finally her chin began to lower and for a moment you feared it was going to land on you, and had scrambled back a few feet, like it would matter. But it came down 150 feet or so away, or about 8 inches to her. Two massive green eyes stared holes through you. before the great edifice of the head turned slightly, eyes focusing on something beyond the \"tree line\" of the grass to your left, you don't have her 100 foot bird's eye view...resting on her chin...damn. The arm remains outstretched, the other rests to her left side, far down her body seemingly, not threatening you, but it could reach you in a second or two, no chance to could flee. The chin turns again, grinding the earth beneath it, and the eyes return to your form. She seems a mixture of excited and curious, an enormous soft smile fills your view, and she finally lets you know that your voice must not have registered beyond a faint sound. The smile is replaced by moving lips and a cavernous mouth, topped and bottom with white pearly teeth, she thunders \"WHAT WAS THAT SOUND LITTLE GUY?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was loud. Not deafening, but loud, echoey, and most importantly, clear over all the other sounds of the micro world around you. It rumbled you, and the ground, and you swear you saw a few grains of sand go flying by as the wind produced by such a simple sentence picked them up. Humans had such a massive effect on the environment, even when they didn't notice. You should have figured the speakers wouldn't register earlier. Even crouching her ears had to be at least 600 feet above your head, maybe more. Now that she was lower, though, there was a chance to communicate. Recovering from the effect of her simple question, you slowly rise to your feet and stare straight into those eyes, which are studying you expectantly, down a long bridge of a lightly freckled nose and two dark nostrils likely big enough to suck you in. Gulp. Shaking your head, you gotta get past her enormity for just a second. Now you just gotta think of something to communicate!  You could lie, spin a fantastic story, alien, fairy, sprite who cares. She'd probably believe it. You could tell her the truth too, what good would lying do? Alternatively, you had your spear, your suit was capable of a brief flash that could blind her for a moment, maybe you could distract her with some sort of attack and flee before this goes any further, before your experiment ends. She didn't KNOW yet you were a shrunken human, and may not pursue you too intensely. Although if you caused her any sort of harm she might just crush the offending creature anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you know nothing about this person. You have no idea of her character or her intentions. With the merest of effort she could toss you in a jar and present you to the world for her own fame and fortune, or worse, keep you for herself in some sort of sick collection. She could squish you, intentionally or quite by accident. Either way meant death. You two were on different levels, in different worlds right now, surely her overwhelming size and therefore the power to do all the aforementioned things to you, regardless of what you wanted proved that. She was a human being, what did she have to offer a survivalist scientist like yourself that you didn't already know. If you'd wanted human interaction you'd have shrunk yourself in someone's home, or in a library, or in a potted plant or something, you don't know. Escape was the safest option. But then again, your desire for new experiences and your unquenchable curiosity, coupled with a yearning desire for human interaction after so long in this environment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tara gave the tiny creature a few moments to make another sound. After all, she realized her presence was probably intimidating the poor thing, whatever the thing was, whatever it was thinking, or how it thinks, or IF it thinks. Her mind still needed that last push, that last piece of evidence before she would 100% believe this was something other than a very odd bug. She thought about plucking it into her palm, but that seemed premature as long as it didn't start darting away. She was confident she could stop its progress with her hand if needed. It was definitely between half and a quarter inch tall she reckoned, and from her earlier observations of its battle with the spider, it wasn't particularly fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay on the soft earth, moss, and hundreds if not thousands of blades of grass in the morning glow of a full sun piercing through the forests canvas she felt quite at peace, she always had with the outdoors. After a lovely morning hike, a camp prepared, a truly fantastical situation, one she felt completely in control of, was playing out before her, and the possibilities began to run through her mind. Her eyes remained on the creature as it appeared to rise, but her mind was just a bit lost in thought when she felt a tingling under her right arm. At first she thought little of it, just some of the grass stalks she'd compressed rising back up and tickling her, until it became more pronounced, and seemed to begin moving on top of her wrist...and then movement in her periphery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven a lover of nature like Tara who had earlier tried to avoid harming the creature or the spider could not help basic human reactions. Like seeing a frikin spider crawling across your wrist. With a squeal she reared her head back off the ground and began wildly swinging her arm, dropping the magnifying glass onto the grass forest below and dislodging the spider on the second shake and tossing it 30 or so feet away. Her reaction did not end there though, not realizing fully yet that she'd accomplished her goal she kept wildly waving the hand and balanced on her chest,  her left hand pushing to the ground for added stability as she kept muttering \"Oh God\" with each swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned before, you couldn't make out her right hand beyond the grass forest to your left, and honestly you were far too focused on the part of her in front of you, as well as your upcoming speech about the greatness of your cause, your bravery, and of course intelligence, etc. when you notice the eyes dart to the right, before you can follow their gaze a high pitch overwhelming sound fills your ears and you fall to the ground clutching your ears, as your whole body vibrates from the sound waves being produced. The world is ending, that's what it is, but thank god for the suits protections from intensely loud sounds, or you would have gone deaf in your first lightning storm. Various other thuds fill your ears, but your eyes are clutched tight like your ears, just hoping this goes away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound ends as swiftly as it begins and is followed by the woman's utterances of \"OH GOD OH OH GOD\". Despite the unmistakable power of her voice as always, it is FAR more tolerable and seemingly more removed, than the sound she made prior, right in front of you. You spare a look upwards, and notice the woman has reared back as she shakes a prodigious right hand again and again. You've no idea what has happened, but her attention is 100% not on you. And whether you want to tell her your great tales or not, this is not a safe place to be right now. In the shadow of a panicking skyscraper. As if to emphasize your point, her left hand shoots forward just about even with where her head had been, but a little further off to your right, towards the stream, thicker grass...and the best cover to get back to your shelter is. It's thud quite audible, as what you assume is normally a quite delicate hand is splayed out, crushing grass stalks that individually bear your weight and sinking into the earth that is extremely solid to you with ease. This was chaos, and when things are chaotic, one must rely on their instincts to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is going on instinct now. An instinct you had learned to trust, as it had kept you alive these last several months. Your run ins with the local ant colony, Trevorina, that big black beetle, and dozens of other encounters, not to mention your occasional experiences with the mega fauna. You'd survived them all. That instinct tells you to book it into the grass near the stream, and hide from this careless destroyer of the landscape, before she turned you into a smear. You pump everything you got into this dash, and you cover the 250 feet to the edge of the grass forest in 15 seconds. Not bad! You barely notice she had stopped her panicked muttering, and you make out a despondent \"SHIT!\" You stumble a few dozen more steps into the forest, it growing thicker and thicker towards the stream to guarantee your cover and add a little distance between you and the giantess before stopping behind a stalk to catch your breath. Before you can think about options you hear a strange take on a increasingly familiar sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to reverberate through the grass stalks, like a vibration on an instrument, faint yet seemingly all around you. \"Wait, please come back. I'm sorry!\" You had experienced something like this before, whenever the wind would get up and you'd be in the grass, the swaying of the stalks and the noise of the wind bouncing off the grass, half absorbed, half deflected, would cause a similar all pervasive, soft echo. Now the woman's voice, who you reasoned couldn't before more than two feet away from you caused the same. Even though it felt like she was so far away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have time for these thoughts. Any second now...a reddish shadow casts the tops of the stalks around you in an odd glow as large tan protrusions, covered in a whorls invade the canopy, pushing it aside with ease. You can't make it out from here but her face must not be far from where it was, just staring intently at your area you figure, you haven't felt her move after all. The sound of the stalks being bent and pushed aside is joined by the voice again \"Please come out little thing, I won't hurt you.\" You are way too focused on the prodigious digits as they rake over your position, never quite opening the sky directly above you and revealing you to the world. The fingers push on further away from where the woman is still presumably laid out, searching for you, and you now see the lines in her hand directly above you, when suddenly the air is displaced by the hand's sudden and swift retraction. All is calm for a moment, and you mentally prepare for the next disaster, and how you are going to get back to safety when...</span></div></div>",

The little critter was almost certainly hiding from her, terrified. She felt terrible that she had scared the creature, even more terrible than she felt from missing out on such a unique opportunity.  She held her hands out like she was surrendering. She tried to communicate with the creature, hoping it understood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in your grass forest you notice that everything has been still for several moments. The woman had clearly given up you reason, you are about to set off for the safety of your shelter when the echo starts again around you, reverberating off the grass stalks in an eerie, borderline haunting sound. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you little one.\" It was eerie, she was speaking TO you, yet over you, and around you. You couldn't interact with THAT, she was a force now, well beyond your capabilities to deal with. You had to get back, you had to abandon this foolish quest to interact with a normal person. Still...\"I am sorry I scared you, please come back out.\" God, a part of you wanted to so bad, but your first interaction had been disastrous, what would she do if she had complete control of the situation, who knows, and that's what pushed you to your next act, you began walking along the stream, towards home. She may be genuine, hell, she may be a great person, but you can't hand your entire fate over to a feeling, you had an important role to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you look up, her hand is suspended high above, like she wanted you to know she was no threat. You smirked, her casual acts impacted your world more than you did. You hear her plead a couple more times, before noticing the hand descend from the skies, towards where you had been when she first noticed you, you distinctly hear the sound of earth being ground, likely under her huge digit, another echo pervades through you, \"I will check this spot every hour, I hope you trust me to come back. Sorry, again.\" With that the ground trembles somewhat as the woman rises back to her full height, she stares down on the grass forest you currently are walking through, you could almost swear she was looking right at you, but she takes no action, so she likely only saw the grass. She turns, and you tremble as the earth shudders under her immense walking weight. She had left you alone...she wasn't some crazy person desperate to get you, but seemed to be actually sorry for missing out on this unique encounter. Maybe you should reconsider, maybe you should approach her, or her tent and interact with such a considerate person. It could be valuable to your research you muse.</span></div></div>",

Who knew one person could cause so much disruption to your plans? As you walked along the gently flowing stream, your mind began to wander, to think about the implications. Sure she knew some crazy animal was out here, but it seemed she had no intention of tearing apart the place looking for you. How considerate of her you smirk. You had worried often about an encounter with a human at this size, but it had entered your mind, For example, if you did try to sell shrinking to save the world, there would have to be at least a few normal sized humans left. For protection, transportation, etc. How would that dynamic work had clawed at your mind. The caretaker, for lack of a better word, would essentially be all powerful to the population they tended to. People didn't have a great track record with absolute power, you knew from history. This woman had proven in just a few short minutes how unstoppable she would be, her accidents could easily have been fatal to you. A whole new way of life awaited such a massive shift, but wasn't ending pollution, global warming, hunger, disease, overcrowding, and a laundry list of other ills worth giving away a little power. A little, you laugh, try completely. A hungry bird and an absentee caretaker could end a city. Was such a risk worth it? A part of you had been in awe of the woman, a part of you had actually been angered by that same power. There was a paper in here somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceeded up the slope, still concealed in the grass, the stream running much faster here. You paused, staring into the rushing water, a million thoughts going through your head. Maybe this whole thing had been some crazy endeavor. A mid life crisis that had pushed you into this insane place, not some higher ideals to save humanity. How could it be, when the first human you've seen in 4 months terrifies you to the point of flight. You slowly exit the grass forest, and look down the slope towards the town sized tent, the woman appears to be on the far side, crouched and studying something. You notice she glances back at the dirt circle she had made. Seems she can't get past seeing you. From this distance she seems almost normal, as if there is no difference between you. You reach your shelter, opening the metal hatch with a groan. Taking one last look at your new neighbor, you proceed into your shelter, slamming the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick desuiting and wash later and you sit in your shorts and a t-shirt looking at your wall mounted tv screen sized phone. You had pulled up the cameras, noticing several showed only static, likely a result of the woman's careless crushing of the landscape. You felt a bit guilty, watching her through the remaining cameras, but you reasoned it was to better understand her habits and therefore stay safe. Sure, you could just remain in your shelter until she left, but you knew in the back of your head you weren't capable of such restraint. The woman was true to her word, checking the circle every hour on the hour, you saw her walk to the circle, you even faintly felt it through the earth in your home, humbling, however as the day goes on you notice her enthusiasm wane. She may even be questioning what she saw. You frown, you were the cause of this distress. Maybe you should reward her with an appearance. It's getting later in the afternoon, you usually didn't start adventures near nightfall, as that was asking to be gobbled up by some nocturnal predator. Still, you had a little time...you could make it, make contact, and see what happens then. No doubt, it would be valuable for your studies, and your curiosity. Still, you could end up in a jar on tomorrow's evening news, or worse. Were you crazy for even considering this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Each side to this argument battled for dominance within your mind. Sure... it would be taking a risk that was unnecessary if you were to actually approach this woman consciously, but haven't the past four months been pretty much one big risk? You were 1/3 of an inch tall for heavens sake, surviving on your own against nature that was now about a million times more deadly to you than it would be in normal circumstamces! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much. You groan and stand up out of your makeshift chair in frustration before looking back at the screen showing you the live feed of Tara's actions. She was sitting on a fold up chair outside her tent, peacefully reading a book with one leg crossed over the other. The evening hour was just about here, which meant the temperature was going to drop a little, prompting Tara to have clothed herself in a charming, white, pinstriped buttoned down shirt. Her foot bobbed up and down as if she impatiently waiting for something, which was made clear to you what that was when you caught her passing glances to the circle she made in the dirt for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst impression aside, even though her gargantuan size had terrified you at your first encounter; looking at her now on the screen, at a scale that still dwarfed you but atleast allowed you to see a person instead of a giant. You had a feeling you couldnt shake that this woman would indeed never intentionally harm you. However, it never hurt to be cautious. You couldnt be sure of anything that concerned her right now, but you had finally decided she was worth truly meeting. Perhaps it was the four months of solitude that pushed this decision, but as you retrieved your suit from your wardrobe, you felt a sense of excitement at the thought of possibly befriending a woman of her magnitude. From what you could gather about her, her willingness to allow that fucking wolf spider to live, showed you she had compassion and care for nature. The way she spoke to you and didnt pursue you, showed she was gentle, considerate and not overrun with personal greed at the prospect of nabbing a tiny man. All qualities that kept your mind at relative ease as you slipped on your tactical jacket, equiped your spear, and exited your shelter into the chilled air under a setting sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back to her tent would be taken at a steady pace, for after all, good ol' Trevorina was still out there thanks to the woman and her glorious mercy. You would need to keep your eyes peeled for her. In all the past encounters, it was never you who found her first, but her that would try to corner, ambush, or take you from behind. It would be best to stay out in the open this time. Now that you had a giant looking out for you, you didnt want to engage in a fight with the spider or anything else under the cover of a grass patch where she wouldnt be able to see or help you again. So with that in mind, you descend down the slope and walk along the trunk of the tree before arriving at the threshold of an open plateau of dirt that stretches far out into the direction of her tent. Normally, you would never walk this ground, for it would be easy for any predator to spot, grab and devour you here. It was the no mans land for you. But again, you had her looking out for you. You could see her far in the distance like a  mountain ruling over a landscape, still reading her book and occasionally scanning the area with her eyes for you. At the rate she was searching, it seemed unlikely she wouldnt spot you as long as you got close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy breath, you officially step onto the open plain and begin to walk at a fast pace. Your nerves were sky high as your eyes dart from grass line to grass line for stalking predators. You couldnt prove it, but you knew you were already being watched by something hidden. A feeling of dread sunk into your gut as you got farther and farther, thinking at any moment, a terrifying beast would charge out of cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was growing testy as the hours rolled by. Here she was, waisting precious time on a creature who could have very well been a figment of imagination. It was insanity! How could she have possibly believed that she saw,... well... what she saw? ...It was insane. But there was no doubt no matter how hard she thought back to that moment. She had definitely seen a person out here the size of an insect. And thanks to her blundering, she had frightened the poor thing away! She flipped the next page of her novel over with a sharp flick of her wrist, not even reading the final sentence, just interested in expressing her annoyance with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadnt been able to stand herself for the past few hours. Waves upon waves of self-negative thoughts flooded her brain as she cursed herself for completely ruining the experience of a lifetime. The little man... woman... she wasnt able to tell which it was due to the short amount of time she had eyes on it, but she could only feel terrible for scaring it off. All that could be done now was to wait and hope it would return. Afterall, Tara had only just arrived here. There was still a few days before she would have to go back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Crossing an open patch of dirt, surrounded on all sides by thick grass that could be concealing god knows what, just so you can take the unnecessary risk on approaching a giant woman you really didn't know anything for certain about her character!? So what if she was an academic like you, or that you seemed to share interests in nature, or that whenever you looked at her you felt a sense of warmness and ease, or that she was absolutely stunning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drove your boot into the dirt, sending pebble sized grains of sand exploding out from the ground as they were kicked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! Get your head straight you idiot!\", you shouted to yourself, immediately regretting what you just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment after your little emotional outburst, you took notice of the sound a rustling withing the forest of grass far on your right. Whatever it was, it was fairly large; large enough to trample blades of grass under its weight. The telling sign that Trevorina had come back once again for her mortal enemy. Quickly, blades of grass split from each other as Trevorina breaches from their ranks and repeats the same old song and dance from the many times before; a high chattering sound and a mad dash towards you. It was routine at this point, but that hardly made it any easier to defend yourself against her in a drawn out fight. You had to give it to the beast, she was quite the unpredictable fighter once she got blood thirsty enough in the heat of battle! You unsheathe your spear and ready yourself for her first attack, which always came as a frenzy of gnashing fangs as she attempted to take a bite out of you! A quick duck and roll to her side, leaves her exposed for you to ram your spear into her side, leaving a fresh new scar to join its twins on her body. The proud monster squeals in pain, as it raises its legs into the air and brings them down with enough force to skewer you. You push yourself out of the way of each strike, before quickly transitioning back on your feet and begin batting the attacks aside with your spear! It performs its spider version of rearing in an attempt to intimidate and you answer with a stance that would impress a novice ancient Spartan. You both exchange roars of fury before the next wave of attacks begin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara rolled the sleeves of her shirt up with a sigh, and checked the time on her para-cord watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>8:25 PM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough that sun was going to be heading out for the night and leaving this place in darkness... not to mention chilly. It was getting to the point where Tara would be inclined to follow its lead and head to bed herself. She did have a schedule to keep after all, and that included getting up early in the morning to take photo's of the plant life covered in the glistening morning dew, and get other menial tasks out of the way before conducting more research for her paper. She closed her book and tossed it behind her into her tent. For the next few minutes, her full focus was going to be keeping an eye out for her little friend. She leaned back into her chair, arms crossed over her chest, and a determined look on her face as she squinted her eyes down at the ground ahead of her and slowly scanned for any sign of movement. It didn't take long before a familiar scene came into her view. A barren patch of dirt, devoid of any grass or fauna of any kind, was serving as the battleground for a deathmatch between two shapes that she couldn't discern at this distance, but had detected a hint of familiarity at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's eyes widened with joyful hope as she leaned in closer from her chair, before rising up and taking two gentle steps towards the action below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point in the fight... </span></div></div>",

Upon Trevorina\u2019s last charge she had paused, reared up, and grappled your spear with her remaining appendage.You didn't notice she used her middle right front to add to the effort while her middle front left began basically punching you. This was new, she was learning to hunt tiny humans. Blow upon blow and finally your suit isn't enough as the next one causes your arm to go up at an odd angle, dislocating it. You scream in pain, jumping back. Trevorina does not immediately pursue, reveling in your pain it seems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t have anything left. Your spear would do little with one arm, you were exhausted, and your arm burned in pain. This was it, natural selection had finally caught up to you. Your work, your life, all for nothing. And all you\u2019d end up as is dinner for a hungry spider. Truly nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow, the displacement of air. It was still alien to you, but you understood its significance. Looking up, away from the monster before you, you see what is infinitely more frightening. The woman has an angry sneer on her face and well beneath that is lowering her immense sandal clad foot onto your area. It seems the nature lover is willing to crush the spider to save her unique find, you. Still, you cant help but tremble as the dirt covered sandal falls closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevorina seems to realize the danger, but to late. She darts forward, seems she wants to take you with her. But her frightening visage is replace by a black soled sandal, and the not insignificant big toe upon it. Trevorina was no more. You were safe. Maybe...The toe shifts lightly as the woman adjusts her balance. You felt like kissing your savior, but your exhaustion, and the spider guts, prevent that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall to your back and stare up the woman\u2019s seemingly endless leg, passing over every feature until you reach her face. It looks sad that she had done what she did, but also full of concern and curiosity to you. There was no escaping this time. You had ceded complete control to this woman who you knew nothing about other than she seemed to appreciate nature. What does she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had to give it to ol' Trevorina, she got you good in the end. It almost upset you that after all this time, she would die as insignificant a death as literally being stepped on like a bug. Perhaps, it was the fact that she was the one constant being that you could rely on to provide sheer excitement or that she was just simply always there, but a part of you had grown... attached to the wolf spider. At least enough that you felt her death should have come by your hands in the heat of a fight. You would have to give her the respects she deserved later, because right now, you were having a hard enough time just remaining conscious through the agony that throbbed in your arm. As you lay there on your back, your eyes getting heavy, you watch as Tara, face full of distress and concern, knelt down on one knee before you, her hands hovering high above your puny little broken body, as if she was afraid to touch and hurt you. It was relieving to see if you were being honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the fuzziness in your head, you hear the woman begin to speak in her powerful voice, as she places a massive hand in the dirt beside you and leans in closer down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\", she speaks delicately and urgently at the same time, most likely aware of how intimidating a giant must be to someone like you, and not wanting to cause you any more stress. \"Excuse me, are... are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard not to chuckle. The relief you felt was almost as much as the pain you were in. You flop your undamaged arm onto your chest, and search with it for your suits speaker function, eventually blindly stumbling upon it and switching it on. The speaker hums with static and noise, but aside from a small bit of damage caused by the late Trevorina, it was still in good enough shape to amplify your voice clearly enough to be understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara could hardly believe it, even as she knelt over what was now more clear to her than ever, a tiny man! Or at least she was almost sure it was a man, due to the fact she couldn't make out any telling features due to it being the size of an ant and covered in spider guts. Nonetheless, she knew she didn't just imagine it! But what should have been one of the most exciting moments of her life, became filled with anxiety and fear, when Tara had to rescue him from the poor little wolf spider she was forced to crush beneath her foot. And now, the little person was on his back and hardly moving, was she to late? Just then, the sounds of nature were interrupted by a low sound that sounded... technological? Tara's gaze left the tiny wounded man as she lifted her head and looked around the area for any indication that somebody else was nearby, when it almost immediately occurred to her, the sound was coming from right below her,... from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My arm... please, I... think its broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's breath hitched. He actually answered her, actually confided in the fact that he was completely helpless. Her nerves were wracked, she knew how to treat broken bones, but performing that treatment on someone who's body wasn't even as thick as her pinky finger?... Not so much. There was a med-kit she kept in her bag in her tent that she could use, but she would have to move him there. It was usually taboo to move anyone with broken bones when you didn't have to, but Tara felt uncomfortable working on him out here where other bugs could make a move at him when she left to retrieve the kit. With her mind made up, she once again leaned down closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, um... I need to move you into my tent okay? I have a medical kit. Can you stand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to do what she asked,... after all, your legs were fine as far as you knew, but for some reason, your energy was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\", you replied with an unsteady voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman winced after hearing your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, ... then bear with me, I'm going to have to pick you up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the dirt shift as she lifted her hand from the ground beside you. Carefully, she began to scoop you into her palm, as she did her best to push beneath the dirt with her open hand right next to your uninjured side, and prod you with the tip of her index finger, gently pushing you into her hand. With you now rested right in the center of her palm, she stood to her full height, causing you to belch slightly as a wave of vertigo from the sudden change in altitude dulled your senses. Composing yourself, you pressed  the side of your face against the warm flesh beneath you, feeling the movement and steadiness of her body as she hurried to her tent. For the entirety of your time as a miniature survivor, this was the most surreal moment you have experienced thus far. Your body and mind was used to the bizarre new landscapes, the physically exerting challenges and other experiences that could only be had as a being of diminutive proportions. However, where you were now, would have a place in your memory for the rest of your life. At this moment, you felt safe. more than you had ever felt before. As you laid there on your back, looking up at the woman whose only concern is you, seeing the worry in her face, feeling the warmth of her body,... you couldn't help but almost forget the anguish pulsing through your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the tent, she gently slipped you off her hand, placing you on top of her pillow. She then rushed over to her bag, pulled out her med-kit and started rummaging through for gauze, and disinfectant, then from a pocket in her bag, she pulled out cuticle scissors. Firstly, she approached you with the tiny pair of scissors, which despite your confidence in her best intentions... did jack your heart rate up a bit. However, with calm and steady hands like a surgeon, she carefully cut up the length of your sleeve to expose your injured arm. Thankfully, there was no protrusion from bones, so the break was clean. You watched as she inspected your arm with her magnifying glass, then the stress leave her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,.. okay, your fine. The bone isn't puncturing your arm at all. I see some deep bruising but nothing that points to damaged blood vessels. I think you'll be fine after some ice and rest.\", she then turned once again, this time to her cooler, where she took out an ice cube and smashed bits off it with the blunt end of her pocket knife. With another small piece of ripped gauze, she fashioned a small sling, deposited a couple of tiny ice pieces into the pouch of the sling, tied it off, and placed it under your arm and over your shoulder as accurately as she could. The sting of the ice washed away your drowsiness enough that you could move without feeling like your limbs were dead weight. With the job done, the woman relaxed, sitting cross legged next to her pillow where you were currently resting. She reached over for her water bottle, dabbed the rolled up edge of a tissue in the clear liquid, then began to softly dab at your face and body, cleaning it of dirt and spider gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\", she said with an exhale. \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm better. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tara by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause for about five seconds, before Tara began with her line of questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I mean... are you human or... something else? I wasn't sure before but  now that I can see you, you look like a regular man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am a regular man... its a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as you I think... to an extent. Studying nature, testing myself, y`know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, sure... you're pretty good at giving answers close to the chest huh?\", she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \"Yeah, heh, I'm sorry I guess I'm just a little exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.... Listen, I don't want to be forward but, do you need a place to rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though realistically, how much could a bug sized man be a burden to such a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not. Its no trouble. It'd be my pleasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her. It didn't go unnoticed by you how lucky you were to have such a kind hearted person as your temporary neighbor. Even though the only reason you entered into no mans land in the first place was to get to her, you held no resentment. You made the choice to go out there, so there was no one to blame but yourself. Now that you were thinking of that place though, you were reminded of the unfinished business that was left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll stay the night, but there's something you could help me with first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, okay. What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt at first, seemed like a strange request, but upon hearing Richards story and the connection he had felt with arachnid, Tars's guilt over crushing the little girl into pulp doubled in her heart. Being an animal lover, Tara had never killed another living creature before... of course she couldn't blame herself if she unknowingly stepped on herds of ants, or slapped away mosquitoes or fly's here and there, but she didn't have the malice inside her to go out of her way to end the life of a living thing. Her only solace was the fact that her intervening saved someones life, and for that, she could forgive herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tara, don't forget about whats under your sandal too.\", Richard called up from her hand, which was clothed in a lime green rubber gardening glove of a set she had brought with her in case she needed to handle poisonous plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been busy looking down at the mess of corpse she left in the dirt. A gooey puddle of crushed body parts and protruding limbs, when Richard reminded her that the rest may have been plastered to the sole of her sandal this whole time. She slowly knelt down, and allowed Richard to step off her hand onto the dirt, as she removed her sandal. She balanced on one foot as she flipped the sandal over and inspected the bottom, instantly seeing the dried remains of an organ or two lodged between the treads. She carefully picked them away with her gloved hand over top Trevorina's body, until the organs dropped down to be reunited with their host with two soft thuds. Tara then slipped her sandal back on her foot, making a mental note to wash it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at Richard, who was standing still as a statue next to the wolf spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard.\", Tara spoke with deep sincerity. \"I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked way up at her face, seeing the hint of empathy in her expression. \"No,... no, don't be sorry Tara. Its okay. You saved my life! Dont worry. Its not as if I loved Trevorina, I just feel she deserves some respect. She was out here surviving same as me.\", he said in an attempt to console the gentle giantess. Relief washed over his face as he watched a sweet smile shape her lips. \"Well, lets not delay this any more. Tara? If you please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft giggle, Tara got to work digging a small hole with her covered hand. It only took about two scoops into the dirt before the hole was deep enough to fit two wolf spiders. He gave a final look into Trevorinas eyes, which miraculously, were all still attached to a head that was in good enough shape. Most likely due to the fact that most of Tara's weight was closer to her heel rather than her toes. With a departing mock salute of respect, Tara cupped her hand around the dead spider, and pushed it along the dirt and into the hole, before finally burying it. The two of them stayed still in silence for a moment, Tara back on her knee and Richard standing with his arm in a sling, reminiscing about all the 'good' times he and that spider had together,... trying to kill each other and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the moment was finished, he caught Tara looking down at him with a soft expression of admiration on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard. That was very kind of you.\", she said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks flushed. Richard was thankful he was to small for her to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I like to think she would have done the same for me.\", he joked, prompting a laugh from Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting dark now. Tara checked her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9:30. What do you say we get you that rest now, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a day filled with bad decisions, that was the best one he heard. He agreed, and Tara scooped him back up into her hand before going back into her tent and setting him on top of the cooler next to her sleeping bag. She asked him to wait there and she returned with a folded piece of cloth along with a smaller separate piece, which you assumed correctly was to be your bed and blanket for the night. A significant downgrade from what you had at home but it would suffice. She set the sleeping space up next to you and excused herself, telling you she would just be outside changing. It didn't take long after you settled into your bed, for her to re-enter the tent, day clothes bundled under her arm, and her now dressed in grey cotton shorts and a black long sleeved top. She carried about her business, settling herself into her sleeping bag as you watched her. She truly was a beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara?\", she stopped in a sitting position, and looked at you. \"I just wanted to say... I'm glad we met each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled a gentle smile. \"Me too, Richard. Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tara switched off the lamp, and darkness filled the tent.</span></div></div>",

You almost felt bad, she'd done so much for you. \"I...I have tools there to make sure I'm healed...not that you haven't done a great job!\" You briefly hug your arm, it hurts but the giantess has done a remarkable job for something so small, you return your attention upwards, towards her great face, she could easily refuse your request. Her green eyes seem to stare holes through you. You can tell even with this level of difference, she doesn't want to lose sight of you again, she wants to learn more, and she more than has the power to do so. But you also judged something else correctly, shes kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown crosses her mouth. She clearly wanted to learn more about you. \"Look, I've been having fits since this afternoon, I thought you were a figment of my imagination. Like I literally thought I was going crazy.\" You can't help but hear her words, they thunder down on you after all. Despite the clear difference, you do feel a bit bad that she's felt crazy all day. But this has to happen. \"I need to go back to my shelter. Its the only way I can heal properly.\" You pause for a second, looking up at eyes filled with curiosity, but also concern. This is the ultimate test. \"Please...\" You are so entranced by the face above you, you almost miss the frown, but it's several car lengths long and impossible to miss. \"okay\" how could something so immense whisper? \"I just...would you please come out tomorrow? I want to know you, if you're ok with that?\" You nod, you'd like to know her better, then realizing there's no way she sees your simple head movements, \"Yes, I'd love to talk tomorrow.\" Her smile eclipses the sky and you are happy just because she is. \"ummm, where is your home by the way?\" You point in the direction of the tree, she looks up and begins pacing that way, your furniture is probably all askew you fear, as her footfalls approach the base of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Here?\" She states, as you crawl to the edge of her hand. she has located the small cylinder that is your home. \"Yes!\" you wave your good arm, she saw that. As delicately as a 1300 foot person can, she set her hand down next to your home for the last 4 months. This was surreal, you'd never expected this scenario. You climb down her middle finger, just next to the entrance. Her hand retracts, and you stare up at the titanic beauty you now knew as Tara. She was crouched over your form, over your world... but as past experience noted that was not enough. You were overwhelmed by her presence, and hell you wanted to tell her. But you couldn't and a part of you felt stupid to do so anyway. You waved your good arm again. She understood as you opened the door, all under her watchful eye. You turn and look up at her one least time. You couldn't leave it here. She gazes down at you as you use your boot to carve a message into the ground. It took several moments, the whole time you felt her intense gaze, not her fault you were so small, you figured. You finished the message, and she peered in closer, bringing her face uncomfortably close to the ground. You almost ran for the shelter. But it retracted, a huge smile on her face. \"Tomorrow then!\" She proclaimed. You had written tomorrow, Now you were committed to it. After all, she knew exactly where you lived...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising back to her full terrifying height, the giantess smiles down at you. Then turning, she proceeds back to her tent. The journey only seconds for her, her massive hips swaying...NO You gotta heal. Hell, maybe you should return to normal size. What to do?</span></div></div>",

You almost wave, but you know there\u2019s no way she can see you at this distance. She\u2019s just looking in your area. You sigh and enter the shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour is fairly taxing. You open the medical bag up, filled with all kinds of tools and drugs you hoped you'd never need. You find an arm sling and force you injured arm in. It burns like a mother-. You then pop a couple of pills. You'll be feeling much happier in a couple of hours. Finishing the last bandages you finally sit in your chair and lean back. Dozens of scattered thoughts flicker through your head. You finally settle on the loudest. What the hell had happened today? You had met this person, whose pinkie finger was wider than you were tall, completely unprepared, made a hell of alot of bad decisions, and nearly been eaten then crushed like poor big Trevorina. And tomorrow, man what would that hold? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far Tara had been nothing but kind and gentle, but once you spilled your secrets, who knows? Living out here, you made all the decisions, took all the risks, now she\u2019d be the one in charge. Hopefully she\u2019d understand the value of your work, and not recognize this for what you worried, a well organized mid life crisis. You were already worried what she thought of you! You begin to think back to those beautiful green eyes bigger than cars. You cant help but smile as the drugs you took start to take control. Few intelligent thoughts linger before exhaustion overtakes you and you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\nTara probably wished she had something similar to put her to sleep. But the today had been the kind of day you cant just fall asleep after. Her mind was wracked with thoughts over the tiny man. What did he mean regular man? He was the size of an ant! What was that cylinder? He called it his shelter. Was he lying, was he a little alien and that was his ship? No, she\u2019d seen his bruised skin, he looked human, at least as best she could tell with a magnifying glass. She wondered if she\u2019d need something more powerful for other parts of his anatomy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind screamed! Tara Reed James what exactly are you thinking of! She turned her head sideways onto to pillow, this day was driving her insane. But she couldn\u2019t wait for tomorrow. She could just go over there, dig out his little box and demand answers,. Once again she screamed at herself internally. That wasn\u2019t right! He wasn\u2019t some insect to be studied, he was a thinking feeling human being, and she had no right to steal his freedom like that. She pushed the thought to the back of her head. Her eyes focused on the spot in the pillow where he had been just a couple of hours ago. Already it was starting to seem like a fantasy. She thought back to his brave stand against the spider, her relief in saving him, the joy she got out of being able to heal him. With those thoughts she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\nTara awoke with a start, checking her watch, it was 10:48! They hadn\u2019t set a time she realized, but surely he had been waiting on her. Shit, shit, shit! She had slept in her t-shirt and undies from the day before. She probably didn't look great. Or smell great. She couldn't go like this. Slipping on her brown shorts she did what she could to make herself presentable. Cautiously she peeked her head out of the tent towards the nearly invisible cylinder., as if she would see him. Shaking her head, she realizes if he was there he'd see her but not vice versa. Darting out she bounds quickly over to the stream to dash her face and turns back to the tent before gasping. What was she doing! She hadn\u2019t once watched where she was stepping. She could have crushed him! Use your head! Now with infinite caution she examines every step. Announcing to her unknown audience below how sorry she was and how careful she\u2019d be. She carefully and agonizingly slowly makes her way back to the tent. Finally reaching it she sighs. Ok they would have to work out some kind of system here. Idly shifting her right foot before entering the tent feels a little pop under her heel. In terror she checks to see if she crushed the little man. She exhales upon seeing a tiny acorn. Whew. Finally she finished her last preparations, brushes her teeth, slips on the spider killing sandals, and cautiously and ultra carefully approached the small cylinder between the roots of the massive oak tree. What does she find?</span></div></div>",

You're waking form realizes there's a reason to be aware, you just don't quite remember what. It was the first time this had happened since your last close brush of death with Trevorina, when you took her leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping awake, you look around. Ok, everything is where it should be, more or less, your bed's a mess, when is it not,  the screen in front of you is displaying the remaining cameras...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you recognize, and feel, the thuds echoing within your shelter. The cameras only caught glimpses, but the feeling, that's something you'd only felt in previous encounters twice before. You smack your head, get it together! You stare down at the floor, extremely perturbed by the increasing thuds that echo through your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stood before the cylinder. It was nestled between the tree roots of the big oak above, and now her feet stood somewhat close to it. She didn't want to intrude per se, but she wanted answers. Her kindness was being tested by...whatever it was living in that cylinder. She'd saved his life, gotten his name, taken him home. And now? She could just uproot the thing, demand she answer her questions. As she stood above the cylinder she began to become worried. \"Richard, are you ok? Please, let me know you are ok?\" The long pause worried her. What if that damn spider had nicked him, what if the trauma overcame him, and now he was dead? She hated to think of that, but it was possible. Slowly as she could she crunched down onto her heels. Staring down at the cylinder, she carefully brought up her right pointer finger. With as much delicacy as she could manage, she banged on the metal door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG* BANG* BANG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't pleasant to your ears to hear such a cacophony ringing throughout your shelter. For a moment through the pause in noise, you wondered for the first time if contact with a human was t he worst idea ever. Humans were innately curious, there was no hiding here. And, oh yeah, also, she could end you on a whim!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to calm down, however, the bangs return, BANG* BANG* BANG*. She'll destroy your roof panel at this rate! Or worse, she'll uproot your home from its hole, what a disaster! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not well dressed, a too short white t and boxer shorts, nonetheless, you rush out the inner door, past your berries, and up the stairwell to the exit. When you arrive, you find the metal slightly warped. A testament to the giantesses unknowing power. With great effort, you force the lever open. You climb out and are met by the disruptor of your world. She exists over you and your home, her 1300 foot form, crouched or not, focused intently on you. She stares holes into your ill dressed form. You focus on her domineering face, too entranced to notice the knees that almost hover over you, the feet no more than 250 feet away that could crush you into paste. She steadily lowers herself as low as she can and stares at you as you feel the primal urge to reenter the shelter. You cannot take your eyes off her immensity, and she seemingly can't take her eyes off you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger for a moment under he intense gaze. \"Ok, so ummm, I think you have some questions Tara, am I right?\" She seems to study you for a moment, its unnerving to be sure. Suddenly she giggles, loud to you, \"Do you wanna get dressed first?\" You look down at your paltry garments and blush. You are borderline naked! \"Umm yeah thanks...\" you mutter. \"Hmmm?\" She didn't catch any of that. why would she? You weren't in your suit. Your actions wouldn't have communicated with her. You give her the biggest thumbs up you can manage, that makes her smile, \"I'll be back in 20!\" her smile fills your sky, but soon her form is all you can focus on, as she raises herself from the earth. You can literally FEEL her gaze upon you, then she slowly turns and proceeds back to her tent. You have 20 minutes. </span></div></div>",

You were already a pathetic bug to her before, how about when you couldn't move or fight. You pessimism is about to overtake you when you realize that communicating with her may be a whole new chapter in your study on shrinking. Yeah, a whole new way to learn, to live! With some renewed confidence you ascend the stairs, and gaze across the glade to the city sized tent and the woman emerging from it. She gives a look around, a smile, then begins walking towards your shelter. Every step shakes your core, her boots shake the earth and she doesnt even notice, her movements remind you of your place far down the food chain as her feet come to rest no more than a hundred feet away. You'd be terrified, but her countenance is one of compassion and caring. Who would be afraid of that, regardless of size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so you ready for today?\" Her voice thunders around you, but its so full of innocence and hope you can't help but smile. You stick out your hand, thumb protruded once again. You agree. She smiles.

Coming to the center, you sit down upon the open, expansive palm and stare up at Tara. \u201cReady!\u201d, the suit amplifies your voice just enough to be audible. \u201cWhere am I taking us?\u201d Shoot, you hadn\u2019t thought about that. What exactly could you show her? You hadn\u2019t really left this relatively small area in months. Thinking hard, it comes to you. Just show her everything, your stories will hopefully be enough to distract her from the comically limited area. Pointing past her tent, towards a smaller birch tree with a bush at its base, over there. Noticing your tiny limb pointing, Tara proceeds the 20 or so steps to the base of the tree. You use the brief moment to trace your hand along the pam, your hand moving gently up and down the rolling bumps that were her wrinkles in the skin. Practically imperceptible at full size. You don\u2019t notice the far off fingers twitch slightly in the distance at your actions. You are broken from your trance as Tara stops, she looks inquisitively at you. \u201cHere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up you run to the edge of her hand when suddenly your world shakes. Tara had instinctively reacted to your movement thinking you might fall and jerked the hand back, while moving the other beneath to catch you. The rapid movement almost caused what she hoped to prevent as you fell to your hands and knees, hoping not to fall off. A brief pause later and you hear Tara apologizing repeatedly. \u201cI\u2019 so so so sorry, I freaked out. Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d You give her a small glare as you rise to your feet but stop when you realize you shouldn\u2019t be rude to someone holding your existence in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to the forest floor from a perspective you had not had in over 4 months. Noticing the berry bush you point towards it. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019ve been getting my berries!\u201d A small pause and her expectant eyes shut as she giggles, rumbling through you, but kinda pleasurable, like a massage bed. \u201cOk?\u201d She seems to have been expecting more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, well I once had to kill 20 ants in one day fending off one I had cut down. That earned a little more attention from her. Crouching slowly she brings her hand out from her body a bit more. \u201cCould you show me?\u201d You look for the exact spot and point towards the edge of the bush closer to your shelter. \u201cRight there, it was insane. They are nearly the size of medium dogs, and worse they just keep coming. At one point I thought I was done for when one got its mandibles around my chest and frikin lifted me off the ground! The jaws are strong as hell, but the suit held up long enough for me to plunge my knife straight into its head.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara went from amusement to wonderment to disgust during your tale. \u201cGosh I bet that was awful.\u201d \u201cYeah but its necessary, the micro world is unforgiving. Its truly survival of the fittest. Ants are pretty interesting though, their colony is just over there if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d You point and Tara nodded, rising slowly, only needing to take 6 steps to reach the base of a large dirt anthill. She dare not get closer or she\u2019d likely cause a frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare down at the anthill for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019ve only been closer one time before.\u201d Tara\u2019s eyes got wider, \u201cyou came here?!?\u201d You rub the back of your head sheepishly. \u201cHey I\u2019m a scientist. I felt it too good of an opportunity to study the colony from such a unique perspective. Didn\u2019t stay long, just placed some cameras and got outta here once some of the big soldiers came after me. They are like Saint Bernard huge.\u201d You pause for a moment as you both gaze at the ants going about their business, either unknowing or uncaring of the colossal entity and her little companion looming over their home. \u201cAnts are truly fascinating for my studies. They work efficiently as a collective, and more importantly for my studies, their impact on the local environment is so minimal, even helpful. Hell, that one little spot in front of you houses hundreds of thousands if not millions! Think of the possibilities!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were rambling, but Tara was focused on your words. She seemed to at least appreciate your desire to learn. Turning her gaze back to the anthill, she asks \u201cSo you never went in?\u201d \u201cGod no, I\u2019d be dead in moments! I\u2019m not sure how that would work.\u201d Tara stares contemplatively at the ant hill, vibrations rumble through you as she HMMMs. Tara...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lays her massive bulk against the rock. \"So, can I get an answer on what you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, but she had earned an explanation. \"I'm a human, like you, I just shrunk myself to study living at this size.\" Her eyebrow raises, uncertain if you are telling the truth. \"Seriously, I invented this technology to better humanity, to solve all our problems, but I had to live life down there to make sure it was possible.\" You gazed up at two green eyes seeming to stare holes in your existence. \"I get it, I think\", you sighed in relief. She understood. \"Seems like you could have planned better for this, like have a normal sized person to help you out.\" You nod, \"but then it wouldn't be actual survival, it would be a farce.\" You both seem to stare off a bit, you speak up \"I do appreciate your help, but if humanity is gonna live at this size, SOMEONEs gotta find a way to see if it can work.\" The giantess stares at you, judging your decisions.

A little walk will give the two of you time to chat, and if you come across a sight that bears further investigation, or a potential new base site, you can act accordingly.  It's a good thing that Tara can't see the blush that is creeping across you at her last suggestion, and you try to kill the thought.  Staring into the gross depths of her ear canal helps with that; you can make out every spikey hair, every blob of wax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a walk, I reckon,\" you shout into that abyss.  \"From up here, it'll be like a helicopter tour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the fingers of the hand you stand on contract, enclosing you in the warmth of the woman's skin and muscle.  You resist the natural fear your body wants, and hug back, thankful for the shelter that she provides, protecting you from the outside world as she jumps down from this tree branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, daylight is allowed past the spreading fingers, and you look up into Tara's face as she now stands at ground level.  The hand rises to her shoulder, and you hop off to secure yourself atop the megastructure of her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stomps over to her tent, retrieving a cannister of liquid and slipping a bag strap pointedly over her <i>other</i> shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you're off!  And the landscape lurches by, rising and falling with each step of the woman.  Trees pass above you, their dappled shade strobing lights.  Below, it's a great distance down the body and legs, and Tara moves far too fast for you to make anything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, this is pretty unsatisfying.  Your unique perspective is being wasted here, as you can make out nothing that Tara herself can't, and being up here limits your view even more!  You need to be out there, among nature, to see things truly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you inform Tara of this?  You could climb up to her ear, let her know that this isn't doing it for you.  Maybe ask her to walk slower, or even lower you to the ground so you can walk together, you spotting things that she can't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she is enjoying herself.  She does chatter as she spots a bird fly overhead, and is smiling widely, that grin creeping even into the sliver of her face visible to you.   Why ruin that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could instead climb elsewhere, get a better view maybe.  Somewhere lower on this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're at it, you could take a peek into that bag she's carrying...</span></div></div>",

The parachute in your suit comes to mind, you've never needed it, and so, never used it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow might be the time as one of the strands breaks loose from Tara\u2019s little knot, and your screams subside as sheer panic sucks the air from your lungs. You compare this to some other encounters you had, and while those were terrifying, you at least had an element of control. Not now, as the giant Tara suddenly lurches upward, her arms pulling her terrific mass close to the tree branch before your world again flips dramatically as she hoists herself onto the tree branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more strands go, and you make an executive decision to take matters back into your tiny hands. You pull your knife from its sheath on your upper left arm. Sharpened daily it cuts quickly through the brown ropes of Tara\u2019s hair. Youve no concept of what is going on beyond your immediate field of view, and your uncharacteristic panic causes you not to notice the steadying of the world around, after one last big scooch back by Tara to lean against the trunk of the tree, that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last strand takes a couple of seconds of sawing but your through!

Tara\u2019s last second readjustments meant you were drifting lazily down towards her body, specifically towards her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you think there were choices here? The forces of physics has you now son! The mild air current, gravity, and the placement of the moving alive earth of Tara guide you on a predetermined path to a spot just above her knee. You look down as you drift over her upper thigh, your eyes can\u2019t help but wander, in wonderment and sadly base attraction. A booming voice snaps you out of your raptured gaze. \u201cHope that wan\u2019t too rough on you. Here.\u201d You gaze back to see her eyes looking left, her right hand raised above her shoulder grazing the tips of her hair, palm open expectantly waiting for you. You frown, she\u2019ll be waiting without answer, as you can't access the speaker in your current setup, and honestly your not sure shed hear you anyways. After a long pause her voice returns, louder and more jarring as her likely gentle voice rattles the air particles around you, along with yourself.  \u201cRICHARD! PLEASE ANSWER ME! ARE YOU OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice is raised in alarm at your lack of response, and you drift close to stomach level, her movements having pushed you further down her body, now a knee landing is inevitable, unless she moves again. You look back again to see Tara staring more or less in your direction, however she is intently studying a patch of hair she has pulled before her face, vainly looking for your form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201cearth\u201d rushes up to meet you a dozen or so feet, no more than a slight bend by Tara, you suddenly collide with the bare skin, knocking the air out of you and possibly causing a couple of bruises. You lie there catching your breath as the parachute falls over you. From beyond the fabric you hear Tara \u201cWhat the...\u201d Have you caused an irritation?

You can do a full check of your inventory, after you shut your eyes... just.. . for a little... nap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are woken by the calamitour shaking of your entire capsule world.  As you slam into the wall of your bedroom, you conclude this is more than just a tremor from a walking macro-fauna - something is attacking the integrity of your base itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith gritted teeth, you manage to mash a hand into the control to bring up the external camera feeds, and see the unmistakable mass of Tara, stooped over the roots of the tree, her fingers digging into its roots - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lurch, you enter freefall, seeing a moment of Tara standing up on the screen before the feed cuts out.  You slam back into the floor as a thunderous impact echoes through the shell of habitat, again after a moment's pause.  Then there is the call,  deadened by the metal between you, but clearly the desperate wail of a woman:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard?  Richard, are you in there?  Are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems any hope of her forgetting about you and leaving you alone have been dashed.  You force yourself upright, lumbering over to the exit hatch.  It's difficult to open with one hand - and you're not helped by Tara alternating tapping the capsule and calling your name - and even as you do so, you slump panting on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air you were breathing is sucked away from you as a bigger set of lungs gasps above you, Tara leaving you gasping for more than one reason as you look up into her worried face, mere inches from your own.  At the periphery of vision, the tips of her finger and thumb can be seen, your mighty shelter held casually by her in one hand!  You have to remember not to look down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God you're alive!\" your abductor says, and a smile rumbles onto that cliff face.  \"When you didn't show up, I thought...  Never mind.  What is this thing, anyway?  Are you an alien, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, little point in staying secret now.  \"No, no, I'm a regular person.  I just used a device to shrink myself, to better study nature and test myself, see if I can survive in this giant world.\"  You raise your broken arm.  \"Not doing too well at thay last part right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Wow.  That must be incredible.\"  Tara's massive front teeth push out to bite down on her lower lip delicately.  \"That sounds so cool.  To be able to see the world so close, without scaring everything away just by walking.  I'd love to see that.  I'd like...  I mean...  Could I join you?  I mean, just for a bit!  Just to see what you see!  It would be, uh, so helpful for my paper!  To see the beauty of this world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's strange, seeing a pleading look on a face belonging to a being powerful enough to crush you.  The machine is certainly capable of shrinking a second person, and if there is anyone you'd want to have by our side here, Tara would be high up on that list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be very dangerous,\" you say.  \"I mean, I would have died had you not been here.  Two of us, tiny, could be overwhelmed and no-one would know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, you could always swap with me!  I can go exploring, while you go big and look out for me!\"  A shy smile spreads across her face.  \"You could pay me back for that expert doctorin' I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be time to go back to normal, if even for a little while.  But while taking the time to recover and heal at standard size, would it be right to throw an inexperienced person into danger in your place?  Maybe you should just grow back, spend a little time with this woman before decding what course to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr is your proprietary technology more important to you?  If you refused Tara's request, asked her to put your home back, she'd comply.  She respects you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she says: having so much power over you, how do you know she'll just accept your refusal?  Even though her looming, hopeful face is utterly adorable, the brain behind that face controls a monster as big as a skyscraper...</span></div></div>",

Doing your best to keep the memory and yearning to encounter that woman again far from your mind. Most of you hoped that when you left your shelter this morning, you would find that spot she set up in empty... her packed up and gone for good, off to enjoy life somewhere else. Considering it was currently 6:00 AM, you found it likely that unless she was an early bird like yourself, she would probably still be asleep. Not that it mattered so long as she keeps out of your way. After all, today was the day you had to go out and refill your food stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you needed to check if she was in fact still there or not. You walk over to your phone to pull up the camera feed, and weren't surprised at all to find that she hadn't left. What did surprise you, was what she was doing out on a mat she laid in front of her tent. Her body moved calm and tranquil like the ocean as she executed pose after pose in her yoga routine. She looked incredible. Even more powerful than the first time you laid eyes on her. The black leggings and sports bra outfit showed you just how capable her body really was, as she proceeded into an upward dog pose, exposing her toned, washboard abs to you. This made you feel uneasy... like you were invading privacy by standing here staring at her in this camera feed... but then you thought, she knew you were somewhere out here. Was this part of a plan to lure you out or something? You didn't think she got a good enough look to recognize you were even human,... but now who knows. It was very possible you were just paranoid, and this display was no display at all, just part of her morning routine much like your own workout. As tempted as you were to just sit here and watch, you had things to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after slipping into your suit, and dragging your makeshift sled behind you, you head up to the surface and exit the protective shell of your hideout. The woman was still busy with her stretches so you take advantage and make your rounds at all the usual supply spots for your food. You follow the routes you had to help you navigate the areas in the grove where food was available and activity from predators was minimal. Along the trip, you pick and store the usual edible herbs, but the real prize was the crabapple tree, which unfortunately was in the immediate area of the spot where the woman had set up camp. The safe route you had runs right through her camp, effectively blocking it from you lest she discover you again. At this point, you had no idea if she would be leaving soon, so if you really needed to get that goldmine, you might need to take some risks.</span></div></div>",

Yet common sense prevails even through this full panic, and you watch in awe as the foot soars overhead, the heel pressing down into the earth well beyond your grassy shelter.  The first shockwave is followed swiftly by a greater blast as the rest of the shoe lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's second foot follows suit even more distantly, and you are looking up at her humungous heels as she faces away from you.  The heels, which are the first part to complete a step; while the foot is overhead, you are safe from being stepped on by a walker, and if the heel is about to land on you you won't have time to react.  She's clearly decided that you're not in this close cluster of greenery, and has stepped carefully closer to the stream to see if you've gone there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice echoes down from above, as if any creature would come running when a human monster called!  Let her keep searching here, you'll be long gone by the time she gives up!  WIth one last look up at the twin towers of her tanned legs, you turn to leave her to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProblem, though; were you to head back to your capsule, you'd be crossing open ground, in full view of a being with such an elevated position as her.  Should she turn, she'd spot you almost instantly, and the chase would be on again.  You don't want this clumsy excuse for a lover of wildlife bothering you on your own turf, so you'd best keep out of her sight until she forgets about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where to go, then?  Looking away from the oak tree, your view is dominated by the only slightly shorter mountain, recently erected by your unwelcome guest: her tent.  It would be the last place she would look for you, and while there you could see what you could scavenge from within.  It's not really theft, you tell yourself: it merely a tax for encroaching upon your lands, or reparations for the damage she has done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even have to duck under the flaps to enter, and find yourself staring around an enclosure that could contain several small towns stacked atop each other.  The woman hasn't set up a sleeping bag yet, so the floor is merely occupied by that backpack of hers.  Besides the rolled-up sleeping bag, it must also contain whatever supplies she brought for her stay.  Food, drink, construction materials - you should take everything you can, since the presence of this woman will probably scare away the bugs that you would normally prey upon, and who knows how long she'll be here for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, up to the towering bag you walk, ready to force your way inside and take whatever you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThudding tremors warn you of the woman's approach - you either underestimated your travel time to the tent, or overestimated how long she'd search for you.  Damn, best hope she doesn't interfere too much!</span></div></div>",

Instinctively, you crouch down and duck behind a fold in the bag that provided enough cover as a steep hill would, as she walks across the tent, heading right towards you! Fear jacks up your heart rate as she grows closer and closer to your spot, but you soon realize after taking one look into her eyes, that though she was only a glance from looking directly at you, at this moment in time she was completely unaware you were here. Instead, as she leans over with her arm outstretched, she doesn't reach for you or the bag, but her cellphone which was laying on the ground next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but stare in awe as her arm plunges past your elevated position and rises back up to the usual unimaginable height as she types on the screen and brings the phone up to her ear. It looked like she would be distracted with whoever was on the other line for now, giving you opportunity to go ahead and make your way into the bag. You followed the path of the zipper further up to the bag, finding an opening between the two tabs for you to slip inside. You drop down onto the top of a rolled sleeping bag with a soft thud, and use the light that seeped in from outside to your advantage as you searched for something to take back with you. Mostly everything in here was far too large to pick up or even fit into your shelter, but you expected that. You also expected to find what you just laid eyes on, which was a baggie full of trail mix that was sandwiched between the wall of the bag and a book! Perfect!

You comprehend your size to be approximately 1/32 of an inch tall with how much space you have to fit under your family's wooden fence. No human would be able to even see you unless their eyes were at most an inch away from your tiny frame and concentrated on seeing you, much less distinguish you from anything more than a minuscule insect. However, people will not be your primary concern in this unforgiving wilderness. Insects, spiders, and maybe even small mammals or amphibians will be the ones most likely consuming the whole of your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these these thoughts sink in before finally entering your family's backyard. That's when you realized that staying in one place for too long was way too dangerous for someone of your size. The grass blades alone were the size of buildings. An ant would probably be the size of a house or bigger! You would have to adopt a migrating from place-to-place mindset if you wanted to make it out here with all the other forms of wildlife. As you churn the idea of becoming a full-blown nomad around in your head more and more, the concept of constantly moving from one location to another suddenly seemed less forced. You would still be able to adventure wherever you wanted as long as you kept remembering to gather supplies along the way and if you still end up running into dangerous animals you could always retreat to your presently monolithic family members if they happened to be outside. Other small animals wouldn't dare approach your relatives so keeping close to them while their outside seems like a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there is the problem of figuring out where to sleep. You couldn't just lay on the ground out in the open where everything hunted and digging a hole through the dirt wherever you slept would put you at risk to the types of animals that burrow underground which, come to think of it, are a lot. Since you're now traveling the only choices you have are to either build multiple bases out of random junk whenever you feel like settling down and then you'll have multiple places to return to after you make enough or you could create a sort of tent to carry around with you for setting up quick and easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there is the question of whether or not to stay in your family's backyard or to travel around the cul-de-sac from neighbor to neighbor with a new landscape every couple of days. You have a good relationship with all your neighbors and basically know how they act and react to certain situations. You also know that half keep a wide variety of pets that can range from giant dogs, even from human perspective, to rabbits, to even chicks and small cats. You tend to have a decent connection with most of the animals being an environmental conservationist and all but you're not sure how any of them would react to seeing a shrunken person, if they could even perceive you as a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body relaxes as the idea of becoming a nomad kind of sounds pretty badass. Doing whatever you want, surviving off of the land, moving wherever you will, taking advantage of the everyday giants surrounding you. It pretty much fits every desire you had walking into this new experience. Now what should you do first?</span></div></div>",

Every one of them had the same size backyard you did; Ashleys yard being more or less empty aside from a beautiful small vegetable garden that lined her fence, the Duquettes having built a large extension on their patio to accommodate a hot tub and their patio set, then the young people having nothing more than a small fire pit smack dab in the middle of their yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt confident that navigating these properties would prove beneficial, especially with Ashleys garden providing such a great source of food. However the traffic of wildlife that must frequent that garden may cause some unfriendly competition to occur, but you remembered that the whole point of this shrinking business was to get some excitement in your life anyways so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way into the yard was an easy enough journey. The great wall of wooden fence made it easy to know where you were going , and you soon found yourself passing right underneath its gap into the new yet similar landscape of your neighbours lawn.</span></div></div>",

You are far smaller than you realized after walking underneath the fence and in your parent\u2019s backyard.  The entire idea of surviving in this immense jungle seems almost impossible at such a tiny size.  Bugs, birds, other animals. . everything makes a challenging foe.  Just hiding seems kind of boring too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to take a different approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking through the grass for a couple of hours, you made your way over towards the patio area. There, a new jungle appeared for miles and miles. . cement.  Making your way over towards the side of the cement, you saw a large circular tubing systems spiraling upward and onto the cement jungle.  It was your garden hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would work out nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could set up a base camp near the side of the house.  Your family regularly had picnics and other outdoor cooking events which you could forage food from.  You\u2019d have a water supply from the hose system.  During the winter when things start to get colder, you could temporarily build a shelter inside using the holes into the house.  Then, once things warmed up, you could go back and live outside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main problem with your original plan was just how much scavenging, fighting, and fleeing you\u2019d have to do.  With this, you could enjoy everything at your small size, while being regularly comfortable.  The only downside would be with the shrink gun so far away, it would be hard to retrieve the gun.  Realistically too. . . somebody would find the gun.  Then, it might be a cause for investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, for now, everything was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour, you finally made your way up and onto the patio.  Utilizing some grass and shredding some of it to use as rope, you set up a very tiny base camp.  By now, it was late, so you sat down and relaxed under the stars.  By next morning, you were able to get up somewhat refreshed and ready for whatever your new life would throw at you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was tha-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body shook and your flimsy shelter fell apart as another loud booming stomp shook your entire location.  Getting up, you pushed aside the simple grass structure and looked outwardly to investigate the sound.  Your eyes grew wide when you saw who it was!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHHAAAAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles and miles away, you spotted a mighty titaness taking a few foot steps in the distance.  Looking up and stretching miles and miles high was a blonde giantess, wearing a polka dot bikini and holding a broom.  A middle aged woman who was in her early 40\u2019s looked across the cement jungle, your new home.  Putting her enormous arms to her side, the goddess from another world brushed her well toned body a bit, due to the dust from the broom that had swept onto her.  It was no wonder a lot of bugs didn't make their nests by here, your mother was absolutely horrifying!!  Even from afar, you realized that the simplest gestures that she made could cause so much devastation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWELL, I GUESS THIS PATIO ISN\u2019T GOING TO CLEAN ITSELF!!\u201d The booming giantess spouted out loud to herself, as she set the broom down on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the impact of the broom hitting the ground was tremendous, far more impactful than you would have thought possible.  It was strange though, because you could see a different set of. . dust or something moving around as she moved her bare feet through the dirt of the patio.  Could that be. . dust particles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like . . being so small made you a bit sensitive to the movements of things around you.  Whether it be motion or smaller particles.  Interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour supplies were pushed around to and fro, as the impossibly high being started to move things around with the broom.  Watching from the comfort of your partially destroyed shelter, you reached into your backpack and pulled out a high quality binoculars.  Putting them on, you look a bit more closely at what was happening. The dust particles that you could see from earlier were flying upwards and attaching onto the giant bare foot of your mother as she attempted to get things to look orderly.  It was incredible the amount of detail you were able to see being so shockingly tiny!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemarkable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEEEP!!!\u201d The immense goddess yelped out loud.  You were not expecting such an outburst, so you felt yourself getting startled, as if she had somehow noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she noticed something else.  An ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was really weird when it came to insects.  If she didn't notice them, she was fine. . but even the smallest ones that got close to her. . she would freak out.  This time was no exception as she quickly lifted up her enormous feet, high into the air, her toned muscular legs reaching up into the sky, hugging her skin tight shorts high up in the air.  It was if the ant looked right up at your mother as a quicker than light motion brought your mother\u2019s giant foot right on top of that ant, totally obliterating it\u2019s body!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth was agape as you saw small tiny particles of the ant still stuck to her feet as she continued sweeping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on the cleaning, your mother had begun to form a pile.  She pushed the trash in a big pile over to the right. . dangerously close to where your base of operations was situated in.  Luckily, even though she was getting a bit closer to you, unless she started to sweep out the corners, you were safe where you were at.  Knowing your parents well, you knew that they very seldomly cleaned the corners of the patio.  This was partially due to laziness, but also they didn't think they ever needed to clean there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was taking awhile though, she seemed to be cleaning much more methodically for some reason.  It was unusual.  Sure, your family would occasionally have picnics, but she never really cleaned like this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out your binoculars again, you watched her more closely.  A fly landed on your mom\u2019s large left breast, which your mother took notice.  Moving very quickly, she swatted at it with her hand, smashing the insect on her tit, its body exploding all over her body.  With a small grin on her face, your mother went back to looking to where she would clean, ignoring the dead body now paraded on her breast.  You watched from below in awe of her pure power! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping your head back into reality, you realized you needed to focus on survival.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea popped into your head.  That pile wasn't too far off from where you were stationed at.  You had your backpack with some emergency supplies. . but what then?  They would run out so soon.  Yet, here right at your doorstep, your mother had brought you a bounty of food, sticks, and other goods of use.  Some wood pieces, some metal, even some screws.  The amount of salvage and goods you could gather from the pile was tremendous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the risk was high too.  If your giantess mother started to sweep the items in the trash. . you could go out with it.  Also, with your mother\u2019s general hatred of bugs. . if she noticed you in the midst. . she\u2019d make quick work of you underneath her enormous bare feet!!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could feel your heart beating through your chest.  Your mind was reeling on whether to play it safe, or take this risk.  Peering through your binoculars over at the pile, you look through the goods there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrews, wood chips, some food, there was even some metallic tops for screws that you could use as containers for yourself.  So many rations. . it was. . so tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, isn't this what it was all about.  Braving the elements and doing things that were a little bit risky?  Wasn't that the point of all of this?<br>\r\nSteeling your courage, you looked at the pile, then back at the god like amazon still sweeping around the corner.  Wiping your forehead of sweat, you started emptied your backpack in your still partially destroyed base camp.  You needed it to be as empty as possible so you could secure as many supplies as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way towards the pile, you felt really really scared.  God, this was so risky.  You could feel your skin feeling tingly and a little weak as you felt the repeated pounding from both the giant broom and your mountainous mother's feet ravishing the land.  After a few minutes, you made it to the pile, as your mother continued to add to it, still you being unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the piles, you began to quickly prioritize the order of importance based on the items that were readily available.  Food was something that wasn't too hard to gain in this area, because of all the scraps around here.  Quickly, you first placed some of the metal tops for the screws in your bag.  They were a little heavy, but being able to store your goods is something that is critical to the success of your trip.  Next, you gathered a bunch of wooden splints.  Crafting these into building materials, as well as possible weapons, was the next step.  While you did have a machete that you shrank yourself with, it wasn't going to last too long. . so you would need a replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically had a heart attack as the entire pile shifted and shook as your mother's giant foot smashed hard into the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'DAMN!! YOU BUGS NEED TO GET OFF OF MY PATIO!! IF IT WASN'T SO UNHEALTHY FOR ME TOO. . I'D FUMIGATE THIS ENTIRE AREA AGAIN!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that there really wasn't that many bugs that you had seen while going around this area.  Your mother must have really fumigated this place hard before you came in.  You'd need to create some kind of escape if she ever got the idea to do that again.  Maybe, create a tunnel inside the house to hang there til all that poison died down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts back to survival, you started again at the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final set of items you were able to stuff in your bag, was some small pieces of twine.  These were great, because you could deconstruct them and use them for a variety of goods that could be extremely useful to you.  After the final thing was pushed into your bag, you grabbed a broken in half coffee stirrer in your hands and made your way back to base camp, your heart still beating so fast with the adrenaline rushing through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of traveling, you finally made it back, a little sweaty, tired, but feeling good.  It had taken a lot longer getting back than it had to come over here, due to the weight of all these items.  If you were able too. . you might want to pick up some of those smaller screw pieces that you saw back in the pile, to try and make some kind of wheelbarrow.  That would definitely make supply gathering a bit less. . tiresome.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unload the supplies in the nook in the wall besides your broken down base camp.  Once you rebuilt, this would do very nicely.  Grabbing your binoculars, you check back on how your giantess mother was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she had finished cleaning out two entire sides of the patio and it looked absolutely spotless!!  You could eat off of the floor, without fear.  Again, this was a bit strange.  Why was she going to all of this trouble to make the patio so clean?  Your parents never went this in depth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were disrupted when your mother again slammed onto the ground hard, stomping out some unfortunate creature with her giant bare feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, you look over to try and see the damage she had done.  It was too far away as she had started to move in that different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over back at the pile, you saw that at this point, she had merged her two big piles to make an even bigger one!!  Even more supplies and goods were at stake, although you knew it would only be a matter of time before your mother started to focus on your area next.  If you were still hanging around there. . it would be very unsafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your chin, you ponder on what your next move will be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had learned a lot from your last trip over at the pile.  If you could just grab the things you need and not pile yourself down as much, you probably could get back to your base camp before your mother noticed you again.  All the supplies you were gathering would have taken you so much longer without your giant mother helping you.  It was very useful afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you already know what you are going to do.  Argh. . you feel like taking such big risks this early isn't the smartest move.  Yet. . you know how good it will feel being rewarded with such a well-established base camp.  Plus, with your mom cleaning so thoroughly, you'll need to be loaded up with food before your family comes out and has a picnic or something. It would be a lot harder foraging for food later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing over again, with an empty backpack and your bare hands, you stare up at the monolithic mother that hovers over in the distance.  She is still pretty scary due to her size, but she seems less intimidating now for some reason.  Maybe you are getting used to seeing her, and since she is familiar with you, you feel a bit safer around her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you had to be cautious and not let that mindset go to your head.  Even unintentionally, your family posed a great threat to you and your base camp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't let them become aware of your location at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the pile, you looked through it now that it had grown larger in size.  There was some really good stuff here, but for now. . this would probably be your last trip to the pile.  Gathering necessities needed to take priority over grabbing things just for other practical use.  The first thing that you placed in your bag was a couple of small circular screw holders.  These could be used as rudimentary wheels and you could make a wheelbarrow, a cart, or whatever you needed to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'YEAH YEAH YEAH!! YEAH!! OH YEAH!!!' boomed high above, but not in your mother's voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the song <i>Candy</i> by Mandy Moore.  That was her ring tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head as your mother could be so childish having a teen pop song as her ring tone.  She must have wanted to feel younger than she actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HELLO?' your mother boomed, now pacing back and forth.  You needed to be careful here, as if she noticed you now being distracted by the phone. . you'd be finished!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OH HI HONEY!! YES, EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL!! THE PATIO IS LOOKING MUCH NICER NOW!! EVERYTHING WILL BE READY FOR OUR DINNER OUTSIDE, TONIGHT!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears perked up.  That was why she was cleaning so thorough. . they would be eating outdoors tonight.  The question for you though . . was how?  A table dinner on the patio, BBQ, Smore's? There was so many different options, but she didn't seem to be saying anything else.  Regardless, you might have to 'crash' this party to try and gather some additional supplies.  For now though, you tried to refocus your efforts on the pile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you saw a bunch of beef jerky scraps that someone probably was eating out here, but the tiny specks of it were now scattered everywhere.  These would be a good food source due to their longevity and their ease of storage.  Finally, you grabbed some more twine.  Rope would be crucial for tying and otherwise, so getting more of that would be very helpful.  As you started to make your way back. . your eyes grew large when you saw a small triple A battery!!  It was so big compared to you but. . if you could figure a way to bring this back to base camp. . you might be able to use its power to do some rudimentary things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO DEAR, WE DON'T WANT TOO MUCH OF THAT!! WE NEED TO WATCH YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE!!' Your mother said in a somewhat naggy voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad probably wanted to eat something unhealthy but was shot down.  Poor Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the battery, you started to think of some other ways you could put this to use.  A small heater, stove equipment, whatever you could think of you might be able to do . . if you could get this big thing back.  The question is. . how would you do it?  It sure would be risky getting this big thing back to, considering how vigilant your mother has been towards insects.  Still, it might be worth it.  Also, now that your mother was on the phone, you might be able to get it away before she even notices.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, you didn't think it would be a very good idea to try and get that battery.  On the one hand, it was in a pretty good location.  Pushed off towards the edge of the pile, you got the feeling that the dirt and grime around it didn't have a lot of traction.  Plus, the fact that the battery could roll made things simpler too.  The main problem would be how to keep it going forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'ALL RIGHT, HONEY!! I'll SEE YOU TONIGHT!! BYE BYE!!' The mighty giantess stated, hanging up the phone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that her conversation had now ended.  Taking an action now might bring the ever watchful eye of the giantess onto you.  Still, you weren't entirely sure if you were going to go this route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the pile, you saw a plastic straw wrapped in paper.  The straw was positioned semi facing up, but in a way where you could position and push it forward.  That was it!!  You'd use the straw to push the battery out.  Then, you'd use its forward moving momentum to keep pushing it forward, using one of those mini straws from a coffee cup.  It would be a ton of work, but with something like this. . you'd be in a good position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up and onto the grime, part of you contemplated this action.  It was so so risky. . you really needed to play it safer than you had been doing.  Yet, you wouldn't let fear keep you down.  Using some screws as a levee. . you pushed the straw with the entire weight of your body!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. . .it barely moved forward towards the battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching your head, you looked for something else that could knock it forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground had been basically shaking the entire time, but now it was moving at a much quicker pace.  Moving your eyes away from the pile, your face careened upward. . the giantess was pushing another completed section towards yours!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as the broom thrust tons and tons of dirt, papers, food, and other shreds of garbage right at you.  Swimming upwardly, you popped yourself out of the pool of dirt and managed to climb out of the growing pile.  Once topside, you watched as the dirt shuffled the rest of the trash forward. . and into the screws you were using as a levee!! They mashed the straw super hard and thrust it forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grew wide as you knew what would happen next!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battery got hit. . and it started rolling towards your base camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly taking action, you barrel rolled out of the pile and picked up the mini straw like a spear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing after the slow moving battery, you hit it with all of your force and watched it continue to move forward.  It was working!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you'd have the power of electricity. . once you figured out some way to use it, that is.  The act of moving the battery was very tiresome.  You had to wait until the battery was a bit ahead of you, but still moving then rush at it with all of your might.  You could have possibly hit the battery a little weaker. . but you couldn't risk it stopping and staying in place. . or worse rolling backwards towards you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to move the battery in the now open field towards the corner of the wall towards base camp. . you heard a loud shrill, louder than anything you had heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'EEEEEKKK!!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered your ears the sound was so massive and all consuming.  Stopping for a moment, you turned around and saw your monolith sized mother staring right down at you.  In that moment, you both stared at each other, seeing eye to eye.  This. . this was it.  She had. . had seen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WHAT IS THAT UGLY TINY GREEN BUG!!' Your mother stated, her nose and other facial features curled up in disgust at the hideous creature before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grew wide as she started to head right towards you!!  She had come to crush you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back towards the battery, you slammed into it again as hard as you possibly could.  You were so close to getting that battery at base camp. . and with the other supplies in your backpack, you'd be set for awhile.  You didn't want to lose your supplies. . but you also needed to save your life!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOMMM!!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most massive soundings force slammed into the ground behind you, causing a shockwave of dirt to push you and the battery forward.  Turning over on your back, you faced the giantess as you saw she was about one more step towards reaching you.  Looking back at the battery and the ground, you looked for some kind of escape.  A hole, a patch of ground, something to protect you from the massive foot stomp that your mother was about to unleash on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick look back, you saw that your mother had arched her giant right foot high into the sky, preparing to push all of her weight onto you. . crushing you entirely!!  No, no, no!!  The massive shadow of your mother blotted out the sun, creating a dark shadow over everything around you.<br>\r\nRushing forward, you put yourself besides the battery, slightly underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAAAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive sole crashed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous foot had completely compressed the ground around you, but the little gap that the battery had given you was enough to keep you from totally getting crushed.  Opening your eyes, now a little bit more shocked at the realization. . the foot started to make its way up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down on her foot, she noticed that she had not gotten the tiny bug on the ground. . instead he was still there by the battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WELL, THAT WAS PRETTY SMART OF YOU, BUG!! LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I GET RID OF YOUR LITTLE BATTERY!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were far too long off to reach base camp if your mother kicked this battery away without you.  You needed to stay with it.  Just as the words left her mouth, you immediately reached into your bag and pulled out some of the twine you had grabbed earlier.  You threw it like a lasso on the side part of the battery and tied the end around your waist.  This was so. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lasso worked even better than you thought possible.  Since the twine wasn't on very tightly, it didn't rotate you back and forth with the battery as it quickly rushed towards the underside of the wall, somewhat close to base camp.  The only problem as you began to drift away from the giant that had just tried to kill you was that the rope wouldn't last for too long.  You needed to get to base camp soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a careful kick with her toes, your mom kicked the battery to the side, to more easily squish the bug nearby.  She saw what looked like. . a web. . attached to the bug as it moved with the battery towards the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OH NO!!! YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant bug stomper rushed herself forward raising her giant foot towards the battery as she prepared to stomp it into oblivion.  With a careful calculated hit, she slammed her foot down on the battery again. . totally encompassing all view!!  Your heart was beating so fast as the skin and weight of your mother collapsed on the battery a second time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she had stomped even harder as the skin of her foot rubbed against your minuscule body as you started to whimper a little, fear overtaking your senses.  Luckily, the rope didn't break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mother again lifted her foot up to check again if she had crushed you, the battery started to move up with her foot.  Shaking it a little to get it off, she flung you forwards and at the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt super dizzy as the rope had now gotten stuck pretty tight as you spun in circles, dozens and dozens of times before. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battery fell underneath the wall, safely out of sight of your giantess tormentor.  You detached yourself from the rope with your machete and fell to the ground, throwing up all over the place from the dizziness.  You were so tired. . but you had . . done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drifted off into unconsciousness, your mother started to curse and swear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'DAMN IT!! I WAS SO CLOSE!! FUCKING GREEN BUG!! I'LL FIND YOU AND STOMP YOU INTO NOTHING!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant woman started to hyperventilate a little, she realized that if a passing neighbor or mailman were to walk by, they would probably think she was crazy.  Regaining her calmness, she started back at cleaning again. . she wouldn't forget that weird green bug, though.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Ugh. . '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, you rub your head, it. . .like most of the rest of your body, was very sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had gotten very greedy, but shockingly enough. . you were still okay.  Still, taking risks like that would eventually lead to you dying. . so you needed to start focusing on the surviving part of your trip.  There was still a lot of things you had not yet done that still needed work.  Getting up, you felt very funny.  Looking at the ground, you see stains from when you threw up.  Your body must have been a bit dehydrated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering at the giant battery besides you, you realized that it had not crashed exactly where your base camp was. . instead it was a little ways closer towards the door to the house.  From your estimates, it was a good couple 'blocks' from your current base camp.  Not too far, but not exactly a short walk either.  Scratching your chin, you realized that it would be impossible at this point to bring the battery exactly at your base camp but. . an idea struck you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be your new base camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old one was already destroyed from all the stomping and this spot seemed just as well.  Sure, it was a little further from where the water was, but it was also more wedged into the wall.  This would make for an ample escape from predators, such as your giant family or other insects or birds.  As you walked around the battery, you saw that the 'kick' from your mother had made a small hole.  Walking into it, you couldn't see much of anything . . it was too dark.  Once you got your supplies from base camp and moved them over. . you'd figure it all out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed as you went back and forth, moving your supplies to your new base camp.  Having drank a lot of your current water supply, you realized that you would eventually need to gather more. You estimated that you would probably run out of water tomorrow, and that was by just rationing it too.  You were drinking far less than you should be. More importantly, you needed to establish your current base and make it secure.  There were just far too many predators that could make a short meal out of you.  Being prepared and safe was your number 1 priority.  You would have to worry about the water situation later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you set up was an adequate entrance to your base.  Using the battery like a wall and also a room, you moved some of the broken wood from the crash to erect a barrier for things entering, but leaving you a 'door' to enter into too.  That door was basically a simple pulley system where you could pull on a rope outside which would open a panel for you to step into.  It was simple, but effective.  The second fortification you did was seal up that back part of the wall.  You didn't want any creepy crawlers to get a jump on you while you were resting or away.  Finally, using one of the containers, you created a simple easy torch.  It would conduct heat inside its metal furnace, but with a simple top that you could place on it. . put it out just as easy.  It was a bit big though, so while it lit up your base, it wouldn't be much use outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at all the stuff surrounding your base, you smiled, happy at what you had built.  You decided to give your new base camp a name, something other <br>\r\nthan base camp.  If this was to be your new home, you wanted to be able to refer to it properly.  You needed it, in order to keep your humanity.<br>\r\nAfter setting up your leafy bed, some other simple designs, you made a crude sign with your new base camp name: Dion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDion was a Greek village which sat at the bottom of Mount Olympus.  From here, the mortals could look up high at their gods towering above them.  You found it only fitting considering the giants who were now your gods, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making a wheelbarrow, some grappling hooks, some simple wooden spears, and storing the food well so no other insect could make its way inside, you decided to plan your next move.  Looking out onto the patio, you saw the sun was still present, but in a few hours it would be getting dark.  You needed to think of your next plan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I HATE BUGS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of your mother's booming voice stirred you from your thoughts.  Grabbing your binoculars, you peered towards the portal of the gods.  Walking outside backwards was your giant mother.  Now, she was wearing a bit more clothing, wearing a nice red top that showed a little bit of her cleavage and some formal esque black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLAAACK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLAAAACKK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed up again, wearing a pair of black high heeled shoes.  In her hands, was part of the table.  You grimaced as you realized what was happening.  The family was. . was going to be eating outside!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE HAVING THESE FAMILY GET TOGETHER'S!!  BESIDES, YOU CLEANED UP THE PATIO YOURSELF!! YOU KNOW THAT THERE ISN'T ANY BUGS NEARBY!!!\" Boomed a powerful masculine voice.  As the rest of the table came into focus, you saw your father holding it on the other side.  Together, he and your mother placed the table down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAAAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that your mother was closest to you right now, her big black high heeled shoes clacking on the hard cement floor.  Looking up at her, you could see that she was wearing a set of red panties beneath her skirt too, actually matching her shirt.  You shook your head, you shouldn't be looking their anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, BUT OUTSIDE. . EVEN IF YOU CLEAN EVERY BUG. . THERE IS ALWAYS A HUNDRED MORE WAITING!!\" You heard your mother say with an irritated shrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I EVEN HAD THIS UGLY GREEN BUG GET AWAY FROM ME EARLIER TODAY WHEN I WAS CLEANING!!  HE WAS SO GROSS!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at your camo colored 'green' clothes, you realized that eventually you were going to need to switch to something else.  You watched your father roll his eyes as he set out two other chairs on both sides of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH BABY!!  YOU'LL BE OKAY!! IF I SEE ANY BUGS. . I'LL STOMP THEM OUT OF EXISTENCE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother let out a coo when she heard how confident your dad was about killing bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-OKAY DEAR!! THANK YOU!!\" She said with a smile, happy that her man would have her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the den of the gods, you heard another voice, a bit low but still feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS MOM STILL MOANING ABOUT BUGS?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized that voice anywhere.  It was your sister, Jessica.  A few seconds later, you watched your titanic sized 17 year old sister storm out of the house.  Wearing a black tank top revealing a little cleavage from her small slender frame, she wiped her hands on her shorts and long pantyhose.  You rolled your eyes.  Jessica was still going through a bitter phase, embracing gothic culture.  Twirling her short dark hair, she muttered some obscenities under her breath.  You watched as she stomped her giant military style boots on the ground as she brought some food over on the table, letting out an annoyed sigh as she did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD, DO I HAVE TO EAT OUTSIDE?!? I HAVE OTHER THINGS I NEED TO DO TOO!!!\" Jess moaned, making angry faces at everything around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW NOW, YOU KNOW I WANT EVERYONE PRESENT HERE!!  WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO TALK ABOUT, AFTERALL!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY EVERYONE!!!\" The high pitched voice tore through the air.  It was your older sister, Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy had just gotten back from an incredible backpacking journey with some friends of hers.  Wearing a trendy brown sweater, Joy looked absolutely gorgeous, her blonde hair done up very fashionably.  Pulling her glasses off of her face, she placed them down in between her little cleavage.  Compared to your mother or Jess, Joy had pretty small breasts. . but she dressed them up well.  She was basically a cross between a hipster and a hippie. . respecting nature while looking good doing it.  Putting her hands on her tight blue jeans, she struck a pose as she let out one of her classic charismatic smiles.  You hated to admit it, but she looked pretty amazing. . she just had so much confidence.  Joy stretched her arms out towards her family.  Your mom and dad rushed over to hug her, excitedly asking her how things have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH. . BIG HEAD IS BACK!!\" Jess muttered by your base, a not so affectionate nickname that she had been calling her behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the entire family together (unbeknownst to them, including you), the family finished putting the last few items for their big dinner outside.  They were all getting ready to eat their food.  You watched as they took their seats.  Your father sat farthest away from you, nearby the door.  To the left of him, sat Joy, who put her big bag of stuff beside her down, some of it dripping over.  She was relatively close to you, and would be easiest to get to, if you decided to forage from that bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother, with her big high inch heels, sat on the other end of the table.  Technically she was the closest member of your family, and although you didn't see any reason to try and forage by her, you could go over towards Jess who was on the other side of Joy.  Jess was a notorious bad eater, you knew that she would drop a lot of food to you, even if she didn't mean too.  On the other hand, this was kind of risky.  You had already foraged multiple times today, maybe you should just stay at base camp, Dion.  Rest it out and just kind of listen to your family instead.  You thought it over as the family started to grab items of food from the table.</span></div></div>",

So, getting as much non perishable goods stockpiled now is absolutely critical!!  Grabbing your clothes which you had taken off to take a quick rest in your makeshift bed, you grab your wheelbarrow and put on your backpack.  Filling the barrow with your grappling hooks, you are ready to go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your front door, you look out and onto the terrain in front of you.  These massive gods just casually sitting there is quite the sight to behold.  You feel yourself shudder a little, the level of intimidation about them fills you up.  Putting your palms together, you shake off any jitters and prepare to get this done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEN MARK MADE ME A PRETTY FLOWER THAT I HUNG UP ON MY DOOR!!  HE IS SUUUCH A DREAM!!\" You overheard Joy telling some story to your family.  She always was telling them weird stories about her love life.  Although, they usually ended up badly.  As you exited, you know had to decide which family member to go towards.  Before you made any decision, you would need to get past your mother's high heels undetected.  Otherwise, this gathering mission would have to be aborted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH, IF HE WAS SUCH A DREAM, WHY DID YOU BREAK UP WITH HIM?!\" Jess asks realizing that Joy could go on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looks at her dark clothed sister and shakes her finger at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!! HE CAN BE A DREAM BUT. . WELL. . JUST NOT MY DREAM!!  WE HAD. . SOME GOOD TIMES THOUGH!!\" Joy said a little bit sad.  She started to hug herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. . I MISS HIM!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw your dad put her hand towards Joy, in an attempt to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SORRY, HON!\" He started, \"BUT. . WHAT ABOUT THIS LUKE GUY YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy's facial expression immediately changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH LUKE!! HE IS SO CALM AND QUIET!!  HE DOESN'T ALWAYS EXPRESS HIMSELF BUT I KNOW. . DEEP INSIDE HE HAS A LOVING SOUL!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess rolled her eyes and let out a sigh.  You were ready to join her.  You started to shut out their conversation as you were getting close to your mother's heels.  Looking up at her, you saw that she was looking at three general areas.  Joy and her story, her food occasionally to take a bit, and down on the ground. . to make sure that no bugs were coming at her.  You realized that this was going to be a little trickier than you initially thought.  You could go around her, but by the time you gathered the resources and got back, the dinner would be over.  If your parents started to pack up, your mom would notice you for sure.  She was a crack eye for any 'bug' intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as she ate.  Take a bite, look at Joy, watch the ground.  Take a bite, look at Joy, watch the ground.  About 20 seconds of away time from the ground.  That did not give you a lot of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something different happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, WHY DID YOU LET GEORGE SAY THOSE THINGS TO YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge?  Well, Joy really did love those boyfriend stories.  Though now. . she was super focused on Joy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the time!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing with your wheelbarrow, your goal was right past her area of the table and underneath it.  From there, you could determine whether you would go for Jess or Joy.  You looked to the left as you saw your mother's skyscraper sized heel lifted high into the air.  It was absolutely enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her heel lifted upwards, just casually moving as your mom was a bit relaxed.  She hovered the enormous heel. . right over your head!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, you made a mad rush to the side right before it came crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAAAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shockwave pushed you to the side.  She was. . .starting to look down.  Thinking fast, you grabbed the wheelbarrow and dived underneath it.  To her eyes, it looked like a missed speck of dirt on the ground.  She stared at it for a moment before you heard her taking another bite.  Moving the wheelbarrow upwards, you pushed it into the right place as you dashed away and under the table.  What a close encounter.  Shaking a bit, you looked around at what to do next.  Only death awaited you if you stood by your mother and she would not drop any food, she was a very careful eater.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, you could forage Joy's backpack and find some interesting things in there.  She always carried all sorts of nutrients and other goods with her at all times and with her bag already leaning downward, it would be easy to get over there.  On the other hand, Jess' area was already plastered with some spaghetti and other types of food.  A little bit of water as well which you could fill in your container there as well.  You needed to come up with a decision, or lose out on this opportunity!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see scary bugs as you pass by, like a bee the size of a blimp but flying faster than a flying jet overhead and you hide behind a piece of grass when an ant the size of an elephant passes by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I'm so damn small\", you reaffirm as the ant passes by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quicken your pace and soon find yourself busting out the grassy forest and onto the concrete pavement of the patio. After several miles of walking on the rocky terrain of the patio you make it to the backdoor. A sliding glass door. Unfortunately the metal tracking of the door is a giant metal wall to you but a stalk of dead grass serves as an easy climb to get over the tracking. You jump from off the top edge of the tracking and the landing knocks your breath away but you knew you would be able to take it as long as you landed correctly. The glass door is closed but you are so tiny that you fit through a small crack and you are now in the kitchen of your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar smell of your house fills your nose, bring back memories. The old, hardwood floor of the house extends for miles to form a vast, brown plain. The dining table and chairs extend up to an extreme height, you are certain the table itself could fit an entire town on top of it. You can also see part of the living room and it's monumental furniture. The areas appear to be empty for now. You know this is a great time to set up your initial camp or think of where you want it to be at. You decide to...</span></div></div>",

The younger kids aren't <i>too</i> young, either -- Abby is 15, and the youngest brother, Ethan, is 12. This is good, because you're going to spend a lot of time on the floor; you didn't want to be found by a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best thing about the Andersons, though, is that Abby is highly allergic to pet fur, which means no dogs, no cats, not even a hamster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your backpack, with a sleeping bag, a knife, a few days' worth of food and water, and a couple changes of clothes, and head out your door, to the house right beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's noon, and that's not accidental; the kids are all at school, and Rachel and Dan are at work. Checking both ways to see if anyone's looking, you walk up to the garage door and punch in their security code. (Took a few days of observation to figure it out, but it's worth it.) You let yourself in, and close the garage door right away, before entering the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a pretty standard three-level house; you haven't been in it before, but you have a friend who lives in one with the same plan. You enter through the mud room into the kitchen, and begin to scout quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have some time, but still, you don't want to stay big for too long. What if someone comes home early?

There's enough dust there to make you think it's rarely cleaned; that's exactly what you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push the device deep into the space where you'll be; it's designed for you to be able to activate it if you need to, just in case you decide this is a horrible idea. Taking a deep breath, you push the button, and stand back, and wait just a second....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few minutes to regain your bearings. Touch, taste, and smell are immediately online, but your hearing comes in only after a few moments, and it takes a good two or three minutes for your vision to clear.

Irregular -- fast, then slow, then steady, then stopping altogether, then picking up again. Each one shakes you, just a tiny bit -- a small earthquake that builds slowly as the thuds approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, as the quakes get louder and louder.

Your eyes flick to the object and find a small crumb of bread resting beside the barefoot of one of Taylor's friends; the foot was light dark, as if the girl had a Polynesian family background. You walk closer until the cupboard no longer obstructs your view of the three girls and see that she had long, black wavy hair that flowed down to her chest that was clothed in a burgundy t-shirt, and below, black distressed jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another girl standing adjacent to her, a golden blonde haired girl who wore a black v-neck sweater, blue capri jeans and black ankle socks. At one point she looked down to open a drawer and pull a butter knife from the other cutlery, revealing to you that she wore a gold necklace and had bright brown eyes that shined like an ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Taylor had some gorgeous friends... but awing at giant girls wasn't the priority right now.

You could tell it was getting past curiosity now, and was close to deciding whether you were going to be its food, as it followed the pace of your steps toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continue to chatter and laugh among themselves, making you a little angry that they were so oblivious to the standoff happening below them. At this point, you had exited the confines of the gap between the cupboard and fridge and had now officially entered the open floor of the kitchen with stomping feet. With your ears you listened for any indication a foot was coming your way, and with your eyes, you kept them locked on the lizards. The two of you stared each other down as you continued moving in the direction of the girls.

This however, did not fill you with fear or dread, but a sense of accomplishment! This girl was bound to feel this little lizard down here and take action. You give the gecko a victorious smile once you hear a surprised gasp from above and a twitch from the surface you stood upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey Taylor. Looks like Remi got out again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Remi? You couldn't imagine such a cute name belonging to such a monstrous creature, but hey, if you had your usual perspective you would probably find this gecko to be much more charming than you do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Taylor groan. \"Abby must have left his cage open again. That kid can be so stupid sometimes I swear to god. Somebody's going to end up stepping on him one of these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, dont even say that!\", the polynesian girl cooed. \"He's so cute! He came right up to you Sophia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was that little 'mystery' solved. This blonde girl was Sophia so that meant the other girl was Laura. It was nice to put a name to the one who ultimately saved you, even if it was nothing more to her than pointing out a harmless little gecko. You watch with ultimate relief as Taylor scoops Remi into her hand, unaware to the little man also on her friends foot, and watch him rise up as Taylor stands tall. She holds him in the palm of her hand and you watch with a hint of jealousy as each girl takes turns stroking the little monsters back with their index fingers and giving him butterfly kisses. You were so distracted by the coddling that you didn't fully register that Sophia and Laura each held a sandwich in their hand. Unbeknownst to you, the girls had already packed away the ingredients as you were being chased and were about to head out back to school for 3rd period, with the two girls choosing to bring their lunch on the go since the bell would be ringing soon. This becomes evident to you when Taylor addresses her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im going to put this little guy back in his cage then we'll head back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. We'll wait for you outside. Bye Remi!\", Laura said with a cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the foot you clung to suddenly lifted off the ground in a pivoting step, and began to rise into the air and slam into the ground in a rhythmic pattern, as Sophia and Laura walked to the front door! You had dropped to your belly and held tight to avoid falling off and injuring yourself! This was not good! The size device was being left behind! You twisted your body and looked back past Sophia's ankle as you were brought out of the kitchen and soon found yourself in the front entrance in matter of seconds! Already, Sophia had crossed a distance that would take you at least a hour to travel, and without warning she lifted her foot over top her sneaker and began to slip it and you inside! You could feel the heat of her shoe already, before even passing the tongue of the footwear. It was filled with a sick humid air. The sneaker was a gateway to a whole new world of Sophia's feet. The surface of her sock was nothing compared to these stench ridden shoes! In fact, the air around her sock smelled somewhat pleasant, she obviously believed in good hygiene, though evidently she could care less about shoe freshening. The air itself was becoming heavy. When her foot finally got slid into the shoe, you were now by surrounded the dense air. It burned your nose and made your eyes water. The worst part was you could smell a hint of Sophia's well kept foot beneath the fabric of the sock, which acted as your unobtainable light at the end of the tunnel, which would no doubt soon conform with the rest of the stench once she began moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her foot came to a rest inside the shoe, and remained still as he did the same with her other foot. The roof of the shoe was so low you couldn't stand up, so you began to crawl desperately in the direction you believed to be the shoe collar, but it was literally a shot in the dark since you were so deep inside and enveloped by blackness. You could only base your heading on the fact that when you entered the shoe, you were facing straight down her toe, so if you turned in a complete 180, you should be making your way to the exit. As you crawl, you feel a release of pressure and weightlessness before a sudden impact rocks your body to its core! Sophia must have started walking! These events continued in a pattern as her and Laura walked out onto Taylor's porch. Your head was swimming, and for a second you felt you had lost your sense of direction as your vision rolled from side to side before finally steadying again. After a minute of crawling you reached a point that revealed to you the sunlight seeping into the shoe. You were close! As quick as you could you hightailed it to the shoe collar and finally breached out of the suffocating foot stench and sucked in the glory of fresh air as your upper body slumped over the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like heaven to feel this relief, your chest heaved in and out as you savored the clean air and gazed down the side of the shoe wall. It was a far drop to the stone floor of the porch, so you would need to try and climb down then find a way back to the device in the kitchen. Just as you were about to hoist the rest of your body out from the shoe, you hear the front door open and watch as Taylor walks out and joins her friends. Before you knew it, they were all back to walking so you had no choice but to hang on tight and ride it out. You watched the house slowly shrink out of view as the girls walked further and further and you couldn't believe how crap your luck was. Sophia may have saved you from the gecko but now she was taking you away from the house and the shrink device. You could only hope Sophia and Taylor had class together so you could stow away on her and have her be your ride back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls arrived and you were taken aback by the impossibly massive scale of the three story high school. You thought the girls were mountain sized? They were like Hollywood hill compared to Mount Everest! The three of them entered the school and you were once again filled with dread to hear Taylor say her goodbyes as she headed off to her next class and disappeared down the crowded hallway. You slammed your fist in anger against Sophia's shoe. Yet another setback! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as you could see, you had two options, stay with Sophia and probably end up going with her back to her house, or get off her foot and wander these gigantic halls in a blind search for Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With no options for food, a janitor, and miles upon miles of vast open floor, ... that was out of the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia was moving down the hall with Laura to their next class together. Spanish, from what you overheard. The two of them walked for a few minutes until they entered their classroom. There they were greeted by a group of their friends, all in seats near the back of the classroom. The two girls took their spots with them and without missing a beat, joined in on their loud conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you had to just put up with hanging around on Sophia's foot for a few hours. Clinging halfway on the collar of the shoe was making your arms hurt, so you decide to cross over onto the top of the shoes tongue to atleast sit. It was soft enough that you could get a grip on should Sophia get fidgety. All that was left to do now, was wait for school to end... damn... it was gonna be a long day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day went by as slowly as one could expect when you're stuck sitting in a single spot for hours on end. Your ass was dead by the time the final bell rung, and you were hungrier than you had been in a long while now, so the sooner Sophia would move it and get back home the sooner you could finally get off her damn foot and find a bite to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the hell did it come to this? You planned for things to go wrong but this was just... infuriating! One setback after another. You wouldn't be surprised if you managed to get back to your neighbours house only to find the size device missing, not at all. If that happened, you figured you would probably just stand in a giants path and let them flatten you're miserable little body into blood soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you stand up and jog down the length of the shoe until you reach the crossed laces. You sit down on your butt and lift up a lace that was just as wide as you and slither your lower body underneath it to keep you secure as you knew Sophia would start walking once again to exit the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oblivious blonde stood up from her desk and began packing her things in her book bag. One of her friends who wasnt Laura, was talking her ear off while Sophia multitasked and did her best to follow this girls story. From her body language, even you could tell from down here that Sophia just wanted to pack up and head home, but just didnt want to be rude. The girl followed Sophia out the classroom and down the hall before finally fucking off and giving you a much needed break from her droning voice. However it wasnt long before she was replaced by yet another friend of Sophia's in the forms of a girl and a boy this time. Oh great, just what the doctor ordered. The chattermouth appetizer followed by a double dose of silence deniers! It was getting to you. You were never particularly a people person. Often finding yourself bored of a conversation after half a minute, but now those voices werent so easy to tune out since that they were amplified to your puny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them walked to the back of the school and stood aways into the parking lot, along with many other small crowds of students. Your guess was, these were all bus riders waiting for their assigned transportation. Which meant more waiting for you. You had hoped Sophia's mom or whoever would just be outside waiting for her... but no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou puff air from your chest and rest your heavy head against the surface of the lace above you, staring straight up into the sky... or in your case, the sky and Sophia's nostrils. God, these people were living skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there on the shoe, for a solid fifteen minutes. Listening to Sophia and the girl speak about their things, the boy jumping in obnoxiously with a joke, a poor attempt at impressing them but they allow him a half assed giggle anyways. Finally, the buses pool into the lot and Sophia walks on amd takes a seat near the back with her female friend. Once again, another good amount of time goes by. Slowly but surely, the bus makes progress, dropping Sophia's friend off and the rest of the students one by one. You couldnt see outside the window, but you hazarded a guess that the bus would be near outside of town at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suspicion is confirmed when the bus stops for Sophia and she walks off with a pleasant \"thank you\" to the bus driver. The mailbox towered with the word 'NEWHOOK', painted on its side. It seemed you were about to be an uninvited guest of the Newhook family.  She lived in a rural area outside of town. Not secluded, but enough property to keep her neighbours a good distance away. You knew this house. It was one of the few in this area that had a stable for horses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddamit! Did she take you to a place infested with animals!? You didnt know a single family in all your years on this earth that owned horses and not at least a couple cats or dogs. How much worse could things get!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have all these maddening thoughts as Sophia walked down her dirt driveway towards her two story house. It was a cute little home. Not too flashy. Humble would be a word to describe it, and the inside fit that bill as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front porch had only a two step staircase before you could reach the door. On it were a couple of lawn chairs and small potted flowers on either side of the door. Once inside, you took in the entryway. A straight staircase was just ahead that led to the upper floor made of red oak. It seemed that (minus the living room) most the floor was made up of red oak floor boards. The living room was to the right of the landing. The floor there was made of carpet you recognized as the 'spring cheviot' variety... you wanted the same kind for your ugly apartment.<br>\r\nAll in all, this was a charming little place; simple and ornamental at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you finished getting a layout of the place, Sophia had finally; much to your relief, removed the shoe you were strapped in from her foot. You gave an exhausted cheer, and waited for her to leave down the hallway before making a move off. As you climbed down the shoe, you heard Sophia greeting her mother off in the direction you last saw her. The two began chatting about their days which served you just fine, as you now had a location where two giants were accounted for... but who knew how large this girls family was. Best to keep your eyes and ears open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally break contact with the material of the shoe and stand upon actaul solid ground, you couldnt help but crack a smile. It felt so good to be able to rely upon the floor you stood on to not rise and move without warning. You walk away from the shoe and head off towards the living room, keeping your senses alert for any curious pet that wanted to check you out. So far so good, as you entered the carpeted floor of the living room with strands that reached up to your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour goal was to find a spot to hunker down for the night. Not to far from the exit as you wanted to hitch a ride on Sophia back to school so you could find Taylor.<br>\r\nYou continued on your trek through the living room, just getting past the leg of the couch, when you suddenly stop in your tracks! On the other side of the couch, resting on its own dog bed, was a gigantic samoyed dog, nose in the air, sniffing for that unfamiliar scent which was undoubtedly yourself. You watched in horror as the dog turned its head towards you, peeking at you from behind the corner of the couch. It saw you! You froze in anticipation of its next move... when you started to notice, this dog didnt look that young. Its black nose look weathered, its fur shaggy instead of necessarily fluffy, and its eyes lazy. This was an old boy. An old boy that was apparently entirely disinterested in you, as you watched it slump its head back into its bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were astounded! This was a stroke of luck you didn't believe could happen anymore! A quick jog to the center of the living room gave you a view into the kitchen, where you saw a single large bag of senior dog chow resting on the floor next to a food and water dish. From the evidence you gathered, you were pretty positive this was the only household animal this family owned. A sweet old, tired, lazy pooch that you doubted would chase down a mouse even if you dipped it in steak sauce. This place was starting to look pretty good to you if you were being honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also, in your surveillance of this area, you concentrated mainly on Taylor and her parents; it would pay off well to get an idea of Abby's daily routine and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you stumble up to the base of Abby's shoe, gazing up the intimidating height just up to the top of her foot.

The softer surface allows you to progress upwards far faster, but then Abby begins to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strides along, each impact of her foot tossing her lace hither and thither, your insectile form along for the ride and tested to its very limit.

Whether it is flat or not is beyond someone of your stature - the bubbles would be too big for you to swallow anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding again, you look around.  With light only coming from the small opening at your back, much of this metallic cavern is pitch black.  Giving a shout, the echo from all around you speaks to the massive space within here, almost a barrel cathedral.  Quite something, but nothing to stick around for.  You should drink your fill, maybe take a little drink for later - the sugar rush will be useful for quick bursts of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shout has barely faded before a louder sound crunches into your world, the distant ceiling of the can bending inward with a wrenching, agonising screech - knocking you to the floor, splashing full-length in the liquid goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpluttering, you push yourself up, wondering what the Hell happened there.  Then the world erupts, the lake beneath you floating into the air as gravity ceases to have meaning.  You tumble within the cylinder, battered by both the drink and the walls, the dazzling view of the outside world whirling into incomprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything crashes down, and you gasp as you pull yourself toward the light, desperate to get out of here, find out what's going on, continue to SURVIVE - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop out onto the carpet, quite some distance from where you entered.  The can has moved, your bundled shoe material not here.  The can rests against a wall, and you back away to notice that it's perfect shape has been damaged, dented and deformed from above as if from the blow of an angry god, strong enough to smash such a steadfast steel structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away, you can see your resources some distance away, across the carpet, dwarfed by Abby's socked left foot.  Your estimation earlier was right: the whole mass of heavy material is nothing before even her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her leg upward, you see that she is cradling her bare right foot before her, rubbing it as if to soothe a pain.  \"Stupid can!\" she mutters, even that under-the-breath utterance a great thunder from above.  Huh.  Looks like you were also correct when you thought \"Abby doesn't watch where she walks\".  She must have stepped down from sitting on the bed, effortlessly crushing the can beneath her foot before she felt it possibly cut her, and then she kicked it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, it was an apocalypse, yet she won't give it another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sits there on her bed, and she's probably going to stand up soon.

Sliding your building materials under the bed's overhang, you approach the gigantic bag that a regular person could comfortably hold in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin, great orbs of compacted corn are arrayed, smothered in a dusting of cheese flavouring whose particles are almost as big as your fist!  Picking one up and biting into it, it is almost overwhelming in intensity.  With you blade you begin scraping at the hard shell of a snack itself, since some corn could be a helpful, filling ingredient in many a future meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner have you carved off a long stretch of food than the ground quivers and quakes before the terrible approach of the giantess.  You make for the exit, but of course you're too slow, your little legs no match for those of a regular human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the can before it, the bag is subjected to the full weight of Abby's heel.  Unlike that metal construction, it provides no resistance, and the entirety of your shelter is flattened beneath her tread.  All goes black, and with sickening crunching noises each of the massive snacks is reduced to powder.  You hold your hands above your head as you are pelted with and buried in both cheese and corn, thankfully too small to be flattened yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invader is gone the instant after her attack, and you shake your head free of particles as her footsteps recede.  Yes, Abby does not watch where she walks.  You're really going to learn that lesson one day soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" her voice resounds from above.  \"Well, better not waste them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?  But before you can act, the whole bag is lifted into the air, opening angling toward the ceiling and sending you tumbling into a ballpit of unhealthy dust, struggling to fight to the surface, to get to air, to not be buried - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head breaks the surface, you look directly up to see Abby's great eye peering into the bag.  Small as you are, she'll never spot you, but you don't like where this is heading.  Shortly, the bag tilts again, almost entirely inverting, and you're sliding down its inside aloing with all the other detritus, toward the gaping mouth that now sits at the terminus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou claw desperately at something, anything, to get a grip and halt your descent, but the bag is too smooth, and you are being smacked by other items all too eager to be eaten.  Countless crumbs tumble down onto her tongue, and another lesson of tiny survival rears up in these, your last moments: any food found near a giant is at great risk of being eaten by said giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally leave the safety of the bag, cartwheeling through space, you hear the satisfying smack of lips pressing together, Abby closing her mouth.  Thus, instead of her throat, you land on her lower lip, and grab onto it for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may seem that you're saved, but this is probably just a stay of execution.  If Abby is like any other human alive, she'll shortly be licking these very same lips to pick up any stray particles.  So just what do you do?</span></div></div>",

Weighing up the many factors you'll have to consider, you conclude that this will be the best place to stake your new home.  Of all the bedrooms, it will be the least occupied; teenagers spend so much more time in their rooms than adults!  This way there'll be much less traffic, and consequently so much less chance of you being spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, there being two people sleeping in this room means that, should you be in deadly peril and need to alert a regular-sized person to your peril - the absolute last resort, you promise yourself - you have two such people available.  And, being full-grown adults, they're much more trustworthy sources of salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the downside, there will be less food being brought up to the room - teenagers are more likely to snack than their parents - and you'll have to be careful of more conscientious adults cleaning up and destroying your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill!  As you survey the room, its double-bed sitting opposite a large closet, tidy chests of drawers to either side and numerous family photographs studding the walls, you conclude that you've made the wisest choice.  The Andersons will support your life for the foreseeable future.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to unpack your gear, and tune the shrinking device, when a thought strikes you.  Part of the reason you're doing this is to become self reliant in a survivalist environment, but why should you start off with nothing?  While full-sized, you could gather a few useful supplies for yourself and stash them away for future use by your 1/8\" self.  It wouldn't really be cheating, and would give you a bit of a safety net in case the first few days are harder than you imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, every second you spend full size increases the risk of an Anderson coming home and finding you, so is it worth the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it doesn't have to be as extreme as stealing some food and materials for later - you could just wander the house and make a few tiny handholds and such to make moving around easier for when you're smaller...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, before the future giants get back, you could look through their possessions a little, just to get a bit more of an idea of their personalities and lifestyles, what you could not have learned from your previous outside spying.  Don't think of it as snooping, since soon you'll be trapped in this house, at their mercy, and getting to know them much more intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA final thought strikes your mind.  While you had planned to do this in secret, that does feel a little dirty.  Before you shrink, you could write a note explaining what you've done, and leave it here.  You wouldn;t be revealing yourself per se, but having the family know that there is a tiny man in their house might alleviate some of your guilt.</span></div></div>",

Your first gut reaction was to shrink in the kitchen.  With a large abundant source of food and water, surviving there would be much easier.  Yet. . even though it would be easier, would it really be the best place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving through the house at a quick pace, you think carefully as you look at each room.  Opening one of the doors, you see it belongs to one of the kids.  A lot of action figures line the wall, an Xbox. . this is definitely Ethan's room.  There seemed to be a lot of food on the floor, as well as multiple flavored drinks.  Realistically, this room might work out.  The big problem with it though, is with this level of abundance, also comes other scavengers, aka as bugs.  With the size that you had planned to shrink yourself too, competing with these bugs could be deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, you continue looking through the rooms, trying to think of another option.  Looking at the living room, you see that it seems to have been consistently cleaned.  You didn't really know your neighbors to well, so you assume then that one of them is probably a neat freak.  Perhaps Rachel, the wife, is the one.  Making your way around the room, you rethink your strategy about the living room.  If things were really kept this clean, it would make things difficult for you constantly having to dodge these powerful giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading into the kitchen, you rethink your original strategy about staying here.  Thinking it through, you were right the first time.  There was a large amount of food here, the giants might eat in here occasionally, but realistically they would probably eat food more often in the living room or there bedrooms.  It seemed like the perfect place.  Opening the fridge, you grab a nice cold beer and pop it open with your car keys.  Not that you had a car anymore, but hey. . they might come in handy here.  Taking a small swig of the stuff, you look around the kitchen looking for the best place to. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jiggle, jangle'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob started to buckle and shake, the telltale signs of someone entering into the house!!  The shrinking took some time. . yeah, a few seconds but. . if someone saw you actually getting shrunk . . it would ruin everything!!  You couldn't risk it!! You had to get out of there, now!!  Rushing quickly, but softly, you bolt out of the kitchen and living room.  Making your way back towards the garage door, you realize that won't work either!!  If whoever is coming in hears the garage open, they might grow suspicious.  You don't want to go to jail!!  Or worse. . they might have a gun, ending the adventure prematurely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into another bedroom, things looked much different.  Hanging from the walls was some artwork.  A very nice drawings of a pretty blonde haired woman adorn the area, followed by three line paintings, all equally brilliant.  Whose room was this?  You heard footsteps from the other room. . .someone was inside the house now!!  If you left the room now, you would be seen for sure!  You climb up onto a nearby dresser and try to carefully undo the window sill.  You could leave now, then when no one was inside, try and shrink again. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNo luck. . the lock was on too tightly.  You could force it, but the noise required for that would alert the person of your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jiggle, jangle'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was opening the door here!!  You had no time left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, you pull out the shrinking device and zap yourself right here and there.  As you start to dwindle down, the actual device falls and gets stuck behind the desk behind a computer.  Finally reaching your destination, you notice a journal on the desk you are now standing on.  The name reads 'Taylor'.  This must be her room you shrank yourself in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you watch from afar as the door opens and in steps. . .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A puzzled dirty blonde woman stepped into the room, holding your beer bottle from earlier!!  Damn!! How could you have made such a careless mistake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-HELLO?!? A-ANYONE IN HERE?!?\" Taylor said sheepishly, running her hand nervously up and down her stomach area, moving her pink low cut tank top up and down with her left hand hoisting some pink bracelets.  As she did this, her supple young breasts moved up and down with her hand, giving you an ample view of the new giant.  You took a deep breath and closed your eyes for a second. . didn't want to get too excited.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her other hand, she held a notepad. . something from her school, perhaps?  She moved back some of her hair a bit tensely, pulling her medium length hair behind her head as she walked over towards her closet, facing away from you and opened the door carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she saw no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down to check beneath the bed area, you were able to catch a glimpse of her tight white shorts that hugged her body so incredibly tightly.  She was a very gorgeous young woman.  Living in this region might not be so bad, at least the view was nice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main problem was your current location.  It wasn't near any kind of water source or food source.  Setting up a camp around this area would be pointless and if Taylor caught wind of your presence, she would crush you for sure!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched from a distance as Taylor stood up and turned around.  She took a hard step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desk shook a little as Taylor looked back and forth in the bedroom, obviously confused.  Moving towards where you were at, she started to look behind her bed area. . her body hovering right over you!!  Thinking fast, you crawled into a small crack in the pages of her diary.  You couldn't let her see you.  Looking through the hole, you suddenly had a worse thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she found the shrinker that had fallen behind her computer desk!!  If she didn't shrink herself with that, she could do it to someone else or worse . . you if she figured the whole thing out.  Regardless, it wouldn't be very good.  You breathed a sigh of relief, when she stopped looking by there and started to walk away.  Walking towards the door behind her, she looked at the beer and smiled.  Putting it down on the desk where you were at, she started to make her way out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU, TASTY!!\" She said, a passing reference to the beer.  It was a little scary though, because even though you knew she didn't mean you. . you felt like she did. The young giant reached into her pocket and pulled out an incredibly slim smart phone and began tapping away, surely texting her friends or some boy perhaps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKER SHUNK!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed and you heard stomping elsewhere as Taylor continued going through the house, possibly looking for an inturder.  What had she been doing here so early?  You had planned everything to perfection!!  Walking towards the cold beer, you put your face towards the condensation, giving yourself a nice cold drink.  It was actually not bad.  Your thirst quenched, you walked around the beer towards the notepad that she had in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to be the girl's class schedule.  From what you could glean, it seemed that she had been given the next. . .week off!!  What for?  It didn't quite say, but if she was one of those girls who was always in her room. . this might make things trickier for you.  The first couple of days were critical, as they were the time when you had to set up security and get everything ready.  At this point, you realized that your only hope for survival was to be basically, a symbiote, to this girl.   You needed to feed off of her scraps and live off of her waste. . at least until you had enough supplies to go elsewhere.  It was going to be a tough adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the back part of the dresser, you saw a small opening that was in between her clothes and the actual wooden dresser part.  It seemed like an easy climb up and down too.  Sliding yourself down, you pulled out your flashlight from your backpack and shined the light around.  Luckily you had packed one of those ones that you could crack, as it would be unlikely you could ever replace the batteries.  It seemed that. . this was her panty drawer!!  You saw underwear, socks, and some bras littered around the place.  If this is where you planned to set up your camp, you had best stay in the back part of the drawer, unless you wanted to be either spotted. . or worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed a plan though, this was going to be a risky endeavor whatever choice you made.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You must have been out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRummaging through the clothes, you started to disassemble a sock.  It's wool would be used as a good rope to go climbing with.  You had seen some splinters down here too. . as well as some other things you might be able to utilize as tools, too.  Deciding to stay here had a lot of cons.  A lot of them.  You were in an area that was easily and widely used by Taylor.  You were not near any kind of permanent water fixture, or food source.  This would be quite the challenge.  Still, it also had some pros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view, being a big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voyeuristic tendencies started to flair up as you thought about your old life as you continued working through the pile.  The idea of constantly surveying this giant sexual object was . . .stimulating.  You kind of wanted her to return. . to give you another glimpse.  Still, it was better anyway, since you now had an opportunity to focus on readying your base camp.  Throwing the grappling hook up through the hole, you started to climb out of the drawer.  Reaching the top, you realized that your dresser actually had some different areas for you to explore.  You had access to the bed, which if Taylor ate on, could provide some sources of nutrient.  If you really wanted too, you could leave the bed too, but that would bring you really far away from your base, which you had established here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had chosen to make your base down below, that would be another story.  Instead, you were stuck in this situation by your own design.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother area to explore, was the computer desk where the shrinking device lied behind.  She had to have some snacks and maybe some drinks there as well.  Even small amounts would be enough to keep you satisfied for days.  Any other trash would be useful for carrying things and storing them in the base.  If you could make a little hole in the back too. . it would help if she ever fully opened the drawer.  You'd need to be vigilant towards that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you could make it to the window.  You were unsure what items you could obtain from there, but you also knew that birds and insects could get you too.  It might be worth exploring, but you might want to wait til you got things a little more situated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAAAAMM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook in terror as the door slammed open and in burst Taylor again, on her cell phone.  She walked in quickly, throwing off her tank top, revealing a nice little white bra containing her ample breasts behind them.  Her pants were already missing, as she was wearing a white pair of panties down below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over and stood over the top part of the dresser, totally encapsulating all sight of anything else.  Craning your head up, you watched up close and looked at her pretty smooth skin as her soft breaths flowed in and out of her body.  Her face, perfectly aligned but partially concealed, as her breasts blocked them from your view!  She smelled fantastic as well, some nice perfume on her body.  You felt yourself get aroused, your own little guy struggling against your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like watching a living goddess!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, MY PARENTS ARE GONE TIL LATER TONIGHT!! MY OTHER SIBLINGS TOO!! I HAVE THE PLACE TO MYSELF. . BUT IT WAS WEIRD!!\" Taylor said as she looked up at the ceiling.  She turned away from you, her nice scrumptious ass lying right in front of you. . like a massive closeup billboard!!  Her panties were way too small, giving you a great view of her building sized bottom!!  You . . you kind of liked the idea of making your base camp there instead.  You swallowed, a little nervous too.  You didn't want her to see you, afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH!!! I ALMOST FORGOT!!!\" Taylor said freaking out!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I FOUND A BEER OPEN!!  DAD ALWAYS HIDES THE BOTTLE OPENERS SO WE CAN'T GET INTO HIS BEERS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly, she turned and looked at the bottle, but suddenly, she twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD ON!! I THINK. . I THINK I SEE SOMETHING. . WEIRD!!\" Taylor said as she stared down into your eyes.  You just stared back into hers, hoping for the best at this point.</span></div></div>",

You twitch and stay motionless, watching her from above and wandering what she is thinking.  She cocks her head to one side and carefully stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NEVERMIND!!' The goddess states as she continues to stare at you 'IT'S JUST A LITTLE BUG!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that acknowledgement, she grabs onto the beer, giving you a little smile and turns away.  You felt your heart beating out of your chest.  What a close call.  You felt almost like. . . like she knew who you were. . or at least that you were a person.  You shook your head.  It . . it couldn't be.  Why would she let you live in here like this?  She. . she had to have just literally thought you were a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued watching her from behind, watching her young supple butt twitch a bit as she stretched herself forward.  The beer bottle shifted itself upward and some of its alcoholic beverage poured into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WOAH!!' Taylor exclaimed, chugging down a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO, I JUST TOOK A BIG DRINK!! I FORGOT THAT DAD BUYS THE REALLY STRONG STUFF!! JEEZ!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another big drink, you watched as she got a little wobbly.  Surely she couldn't be getting drunk that fast?  Then again. . who knew.  She was kind of on the small side. . . well for a normal person anyway.  Taylor might not have been able to handle alcohol too well.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she started to move backwards a little, her ass and body shaking quickly as she let out a roarous laugh.  Your eyes grew wide as she collided with the dresser, thrusting you forward and causing you to bump into her big tight ass!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOMP!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collided with the ass and fell backwards, still on the dresser but now looking straight up at the grand canyon sized ass!!  Moving backward, you pulled yourself away from it. . if she leaned backwards even the slightest amount she could crush you and never even know it.  You grabbed onto your chest, as you realized that without even doing anything, she had almost crushed you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass started to shake again!!  She was. . was about to laugh again.  Moving yourself backward, you crawled on your arms as fast as you could.  It would have been easier to just stand up and walk backwards, but. . well. . yeah, butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HA HA HA HA!! THAT IS PRETTY FUNNY!!! NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ONE!!  WHAT WAS THE WEBSITE CALLED AGAIN!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned herself back against the dresser, crushing the small area that you had been at.  Your heart was beating so fast as you realized that was all it would take to totally crush your existence.  Standing to your feet, you watched every muscle and fleshy part of her butt moving a little bit from her mildly inebriated state.  Moving closer, you watched as it moved just slightly in the air.  It was . . was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OKAY, I'LL CHECK IT OUT LATER!!  I'M GETTING KIND OF HUNGRY!! I'M GOING TO GO MAKE SOME LUNCH!! TALK TO YOU LATER, BECKY!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she clicked her phone shut and placed it down beside you without even turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched with wonder as this enormous little cell phone crashed beside you.  It was about the size of a small building!!  You laughed a little in your head when you thought that maybe. . it was about the size of one of the original computers.  Getting on top of the phone, you started looking for something you could rip off of.  Some source of materials perhaps?  Moving over, you examined it.  You didn't really see too much that you could salvage from it.  Maybe if you. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoosh!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's hand reached down again!!  She. . she was picking up the phone!!  You were still on top of it!!  What were you thinking!!  She was still right there, you should have never messed with her phone with her still drinking . . and right in front of you!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>RUMBLE!! RUMBLE!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking upwardly, you started to freak out!!  Taylor was grabbing her phone and if you stayed on. . you might get thrown off or worse.  Regardless, you had to get out of there . . and now!!!  Taking a deep breath, you make a mad dash towards the sides of the phone as Taylor started to lift them upwardly.  When you were at the end of the phone, you realized that you were far too high!!  Jumping from this height would kill you for sure!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trapped!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a miracle happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you been looking upward, you would have noticed Taylor eyeing that bottle of beer closely.  She was trying to turn it around, to see the nutritional facts.  She couldn't really do it one handedly, so she had started to lower her cell phone again.  Watching the phone go down, your mind started to relax as you realized that things might be okay after all.  As the phone was put down, Taylor shifted her body towards the bottle, her voice letting out a long singular hum.  As she did this and examined the facts, you leapt from the phone and onto the diary below.  Landing with a small thud, you clutched your chest, adrenaline rushing strongly throughout your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of checking the ingredients, she casually reached back to grab her phone, not even looking at the desk it was sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HMM, DAD HAS GOOD TASTE!! I THOUGHT THIS BEER WOULD HAVE MORE CALORIES, BUT IT IS PRETTY LOW IN CALORIES!!' Taylor said, cocking her head to the side as she looked at it carefully.  With that out of the way, Taylor started walking forward, making her way out and towards the kitchen.  As she walked, she started to hum some little tune, leaving you behind and all alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that all that was done with, you still needed to establish yourself better.  Scratching your head, you figured the best way to do this, was to gather supplies.  Leaving a lot of your goods back in the dresser as it was now your base camp, you re-climbed up the sock rope and looked ahead.  Climbing over to Taylor's computer desk seemed like a good idea.  There was plenty of things over there to get.  Pulling the rope up and into your backpack, you took in a little bit of water, before dumping it down into the dresser hole.  You were ready to start foraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the edge of the dresser, your next step was to get to the main area by the computer.  There was a big wall blocking your view, but a little ways up was a place you could shimmy your way around to get there.  Throwing your grapple hook up and at the hold, you latched on tightly to a point and started to climb your way up towards the ledge.  After a little bit of climbing, you were on the computer desk.  You decided to leave the rope there, so you could make your way back to your base camp later.  If you didn't leave it there, it would be quite hard to get back down safely.  Clapping your hands quietly, you thought about looking behind the desk at the size device. . but you changed your mind.  It was far away and you didn't really need to go over there anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally past the wall, you were in the little area where Taylor's computer was located.  There sat a super thin and small laptop sitting on the top of the desk.  You never understood that fad of having super tiny computers, but oh well.  It probably wouldn't be nice to rip apart Taylor's computer, although eventually that might be something you would do if you had too.  The fans inside the motherboard could be used in tandem with the battery to give you some sort of mini-ac for your new home.  Still, for now, your focus was security, food and water, and making yourself unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook a little beside the laptop as a hard stomping foot from across the room was heading in your direction.  Taylor was. . running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door burst open and Taylor burst into the room, screaming as loud as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!' She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, you quickly hid behind the laptop.  Had you been discovered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafely behind the laptop, Taylor plopped down on the chair, a piece of pepperoni pizza now sitting beside the laptop too.  You could smell the cheesy goodness as Taylor started typing her password into the computer.  She was clicking really fast, going through some website for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HEY!' a manly voice spouted through the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HEY BRIAN!!' Taylor said in a super high pitched tone you had never heard before.  She was using Skype to talk to this guy.  Scratching your chin, you thought about what to do next.  On the one hand, with Taylor focused on this guy, you might be able to steal some of the pizza for yourself.  Alternatively, you could take the safe route behind the desk and just look for things back there while she was on her laptop too.  You needed to make up your mind. . and fast!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thinking it over, you decided to throw caution at the wind and just go for the pizza.  You knew that it would be really risky, but with Taylor's focus on this 'Brian' guy, you'd be able to get to it in time.  Not only that, if you would be able to successfully gather some of this pizza, you could eat that instead of going through your rations, making things easier for you at base camp.  Gathering your courage, you first look through your back pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't carried a lot of things, the reason for this was so that you could bring things back to camp.  Realistically, you probably should have been gathering materials, but with Taylor here, now probably wouldn't be the best time to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW'D YOUR TEST GO, BRIAN?!?\" Taylor asked in a high pitched and flirtatious tone.  Cocking her head to her side, she stared at the screen, her eyes dilated and her lips quivering a little.  You could tell just by that body language that she really liked this guy.  Moving yourself downward, you started to walk cautiously through the open wooden desk towards the plate and its pizza prize on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH. . OKAY. . I GUESS. . \" The man said, kind of bored.  You wondered if this guy was as interested in Taylor as she was into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you had made about a third of the way over towards the plate.  You needed more time if this was going to work.  You watched as Taylor started to tense up, worried about how Brian thought of her.  She bit on her lip and stared to the left on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as Taylor slammed her big elbows (although small to most normal people) onto the wooden surface, shaking the paper plate and knocking you down onto your tush.  From on the ground, you stared up as Taylor tried to come up with something more interesting to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY. . EHH. . . SO. . DID. . DID YOU GO STEAL ANY OF YOUR DAD'S LIQUOR FOR US?!?\" Taylor said, wincing a little as she searched for words.  Brian liked alcohol so maybe . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TAKE FROM HIM ALL THE TIME!! BUT, WHO SAID I'D GIVE YOU ANY?!?\" The man said with a gruffy tone.  This guy sure was a jerk.  If someone like Taylor had called him, he wouldn't be treating her this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up into her own hair, Taylor started to twirl it to and fro.  Moving her eyes in a silly manner and shifting her body forward, she created a good deal of visible cleavage for the camera to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH. . C'MON BRIAN!!! YOU KNOW THAT. . IF WE HAD SOME DRINKS TOGETHER. . WE'D HAVE A GOOD TIME!!\" Taylor said in an incredibly suggestive tone.  It was very obvious what Brian would be getting if he let her have some. . although considering Taylor already had some liquid courage, maybe she didn't need any more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY?!? THAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF A TRADE?!? I'M GOING TO NEED SOMETHING ELSE TO MAKE THE DEAL MORE. . . BETTER!!\" Brian said in a cocky tone, although his words could have been. . better too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you had finally made it towards the plate.  If it had been a normal paper plate where it sticks upward, you wouldn't have been able to climb it.  Lucky for you, it was one of those paper plates that spirals downward, giving you a nice easy ramp up and towards the pizza.  You just had to grab it and get out of there before Taylor even noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A TRADE, HUH?!?\", Taylor said with lust in her eyes \"WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen was silent as Taylor pushed her breasts close to the camera.  You watched and shook your head as you started putting pieces of the pizza into your bag.  You decided to take from the crust area, as the liquid parts could attract other insects.  You did taste some of the cheese. . it was great, even at your small size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL. . \", the masculine voice finally stated \"HOW WELL. . CAN YOU DANCE?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's eyes widened with excitement as she knew what Brian was asking for.  Getting up and out of the chair, she pushed her chair backwards and stood before the camera.  Moving the laptop screen up so that Brian would get a better view, she started to move left and right in a slow motion.  You heard slow seductive music gently (but somewhat loudly) playing from the laptop as Taylor started to move with the screen.  Your eyes grew wide as you knew what Brian was going to get!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strip tease!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were front in center as part of the audience, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You settle yourself down in front of the warm mass of pizza, nibbling on some cheese, as your own inner warmth increases.  Taylor's immense form gyrates above you, hips bucking in time with the music, thigh muscles bulging with each beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands rise above her head, fingers snapping as the head rocks from side to side, eyes closed and hair lashing.  Then the girl grinds downward, knees bending as her hands descend to run over the tight pink tank top she has on.  She's focused on Brian as he watches via her webcam, but when the giantess raises to head to smack off a wink, you feel as if it's directed at you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you're lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humungous female crouches and rises, gyrates on the spot, spinning as if around an imaginary pole; awe-inspiring movements form such a mammoth being at an impossible pace.  Impossible pace, and astounding grace.  Despite the limited space between her desk and her bed, and the intensity of the moves she performs, not once does she stumble or bump into anything.  Your own hands itch to follow hers, dropping the cheese and heading down toward your flies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tease reaches its peak, Taylor raises her top, peeling it upward slowly to reveal a tightly sculpted belly and abdominal muscles, lightly tanned and without blemish.  The hips continue to sway as it ascends ever higher, revealing acres of skin before a brief disturbance as it snags for a moment on the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're beyond hard, and stumble a moment yourself as the anticipation shudders through you.  Blinking tears, you look up again at the goddess as she rips the top away to be flung over her shoulder, her hands returning swiftly to massage and mould the breasts held tightly by a simple white bra.  Proportionately they're nothing great, but to your three millimetre self they're tremendous structures, so malleable and soft...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own massage proceeds apace, but then Taylor bends forward, offering a crushed cleavage to her camera.  The giantess blocks out the light as she looms over you, and glancing upward you can see great boulders of sweat rolling down her landscaped body, running over a ceiling that expands with each roaring breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat finishes you, and in the aftermath of your orgasm you can barely make out the world around you, insensate to all but your own pleasure.  You're gasping and sweating yourself, but there is no calm following your exertion, the ground rumbling as the ground rises.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumble, awkwardly dribbling as you scramble for purchase on the grease-soaked paper plate.  Taylor's thumb is curved over the rim of the plate, itself a monstrous digit dozens of times your mass, casually lifting the pizza closer to the giantess.  She's clearly worked up an appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she's not going to eat you!  Clutching your pants close with one hand, you slide ingloriously down the plate, rolling and falling as you hit the edge, a plunge of but a few centimetres before impacting on the desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind is thoroughly knocked out of you, but you manage to avoid crushing your manhood.  You shove it back inside and zip up, lying on your back as you watch the half-naked girl eagerly cram an entire slice of pizza into her mouth, teeth working up and down on a peninsula that could have fed you for over a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was so close...  And you nearly came to a sticky end because you let your baser instincts get a hold of you!  You planned ahead for all needs, food, shelter, defence...  But nothing for that most primal urge: sexual desire.  Can you really survive here, where the constant temptation of a towering eighteen year-old woman could bring you to masturbatory paralysis at any moment?  Even now, watching her giggle at Brian's jokes, dribbling cheese onto her heaving bosom, you can feel arousal returning.  If this happened in the middle of a food run, or when Taylor was more alert and capable of noticing you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must be a solution!  The size device is still stuck down the back of the desk, but you should be able to climb down and retrieve it.  You could get out of here, find a woman willing to share this experience, and try again with a female companion.  With a good woman to share your miniscule bed, you should be able to easily stave off the false idol of Taylor, or any other giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be a lot like giving up, though.  It's still not too late to decide on a different location for base camp, and if Taylor is distracted by Brian now would be the perfect time.  It would mean leaving the shrinker dangerously unattended, though...</span></div></div>",

So let's say you grow yourself back to normal. How are you going to find a woman who's willing to give up a year to hang out with you and live off the land? And if you do find her...she's going to have her own ideas on what to do, right? It's not just going to be you winging it in the neighbor's house. Heck, she may want to go set up camp in Brian's bedroom, hoping to get a look at a young, good-looking guy with a skyscraper for a cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as Taylor wipes a bit of grease off her bosom, you realize you are going to have to control your urges if you're going to stay here. And this problem isn't going to go away if you move to, say, the parents' bedroom. Taylor didn't get really hot by accident. Rachel is, if anything, more attractive for her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell. If you're gonna stay here, you're going to have to figure out a way to deal with the elephant in the room. Or the enormous young woman. Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you look back at Taylor one last time. Can you keep it together? This is, after all, just day one. Maybe you can....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...sorry, she just...uh...slid some enormous fingers down into her shorts...just for a second....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...right. Maybe after a few days, you'll get used to it. At the very least, maybe you'll learn to observe this all from a safe distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe, as she lets out a tiny, feigned moan that is enormous to your tiny ears, you had better close up shop, and look for that woman on the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's wrong. The thought is horribly wrong, as soon as you think it, you know it's wrong. You can't do that. Not possibly. No.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do have a miniaturization device. And there is a woman, right there....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No, you aren't going to do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you?</span></div></div>",

Out there in the macro-world, there exists doubt and uncertain belief.  Here, you alone of all people know that your god exists in the flesh, towering over you as a creature worthy of worship, providing for a being as insignificant as yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas Taylor not provided you with food in the form of that pizza?  Does she not shelter you within her room?  And she asks nothing in return.  In time, once you've established yourself here, perhaps you'll work out some way of paying her back, expressing your devotion outwardly.  Heh, she'll be surprised should she find micro-art carvings of her, which are massive statues to you!  Yes, ambitions of giving back to this goddess flash through your mind as Taylor continues to entertain Brian and yourself with her sexy show.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was never your intention to choose this room as your new home, but clearly fate has decided to cut you a break.  Surviving each day now has a purpose: each day you live, you get to view this gorgeous epitome of womanhood.  She could never harm you, for she is your divine protector...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, with your recent masturbatory satiation and stash of pizza - not to mention a brush with death - it is time to fully secure your shelter before you have to sleep.  Best to do that while the goddess is otherwise occupied - heading to her underwear drawer while she's about to open it would be disastrous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, across the desk you scamper, bulging sack of scraps slung over one shoulder.  The motions and noises of huge Taylor and her video-linked boyfriend (?) provide a backdrop that covers you completely.  You are safe from sight, and return to your darkened recess with a minimum of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood: secured.  Stashing it away at the back of a drawer without Taylor noticing it may be more of a challenge.  You'll have to gather materials for a long-term shelter which are both sturdy and warm enough to keep you alive, and well-camouflaged enough that you won't be scraped away by a giant girl.  At the back of the drawer you will be relatively safe, as she is unlikely to open it fully.  The biggest danger comes from when it is re-filled with clean clothes, which could carelessly be pushed backwards to destroy your safe zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unpicked one sock to make your rope, but if you take much more Taylor will notice.  Perhaps you should expand your search to elsewhere in the house to get some more materials.  But after the day you've had already, perhaps you should get a little sleep and wait until nightfall before venturing out?</span></div></div>",

Taylor deserves better than that moron Brian, and you'll give it to her!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her sexy movements, you stride to the corner of the desk, and look down the height of its leg.  There are plenty of tiny handholds present at this scale, and as you begin to descend you find out how little effort it takes for your arms to support your insignificant weight.  Were you to climb something this proportionately tall at normal size, you'd never do it.  Here, with your insect-size working in your favour, you scramble downward like a cockroach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrate on your climbing, but can still sense the heat of Taylor, see the mass of her leg out of the corner of your eye.  Without context, it's easier to imagine her killer legs as merely structures, not part of a goddess.  Easier to ignore, less distracting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you touch down on the carpet fibres, you find yourself able to walk atop them, taking only slightly larger strides than normal.  if you were forced to run you may well stumble and fall in the gaps, but at a calm pace the terrain doesn't slow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's encouraging also the amount of dust present.  Tumbleweeds skitter in your wake, and it's clear that the place isn't dusted too often.  As you bring up your collar to cover against breathing too much in, you consider the ramifications: if this place isn't cleaned, there's little chance that your machine will be discovered.  Of course, as soon as Taylor goes missing, this place will be turned over with a finetooth comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine looms ahead, and as you trudge through the dust sea you feel like Rey exploring the star destroyer: the machine is that big.  You were wise enough to leave a tiny, fibre-optic thick hole which a three millimetre fellow like yourself can use to activate it.  This is your chance, to micronise Taylor and have her all to yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would sound crazy coming from someone else, but you're the sanest guy you know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, should you act immediately, or do you need to conceal the evidence before you go too far?

It would be too convenient of a coincidence for you to approach her immediately after she shrunk. She would be bound to figure it out eventually and it would spoil your entire plan \u2013 no matter how pretty or young she is, having a companion that hates you just won't do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep hopping from one carpet strand to another and watch your target. Taylor is looking around in wonder, but mostly upwards and towards the center of her room so she doesn't seem to have noticed you yet. You get close enough to hear her yelling unintelligently: \u201cWhat the hell! Am I still in my room?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Brian's voice coming from far above: \u201cWHERE DID YOU GO GIRL? HEY... YOU THERE?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor continues, confused: \u201cWhat was that sound? Brian? It can't..! No... What the fuck is going on!?! Impossible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTERRY.. TAYLOR? YOU THERE?\u201d \u2013 bastard can't even remember her name... \u201cBITCH FUCKING LEFT BEFORE\u2013\u201d - then you can hear Skype call disconnecting and you concentrate on Taylor as you're getting close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never met up close and it's hard to judge precisely, but she seems to be shorter than you \u2013 not much more than five feet tall, maybe five three inches. Yeah, almost a head shorter... it's unreal to see her tiny frame just moments after she towered above you like a mountain. Distracted and only a few hops away from her you land unevenly and just barely manage not to fall down as some flimsier strand gives in to your weight. Unfortunately, your backpack shifts and strikes the toolbelt causing a clunking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor turns around and spots you: \u201dWhat on earth...\u201d - but the sudden turn makes her lose her own balance and tumble backwards and disappears among the carpet strands. You make the final few hops and peer downwards. \u201cWho the hell are you!\u201d - she exclaims more than questions. \u201cStay back! W. T. F.\u201d - Taylor actually spells the acronym which almost makes you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, please...\u201d - you try to comfort her, but she struggles to lift herself upwards while continuously shouting at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Stop! Where did you..!\u201d - her frantic attempts at climbing a strand several times her height and thicker than she is tall while keeping most of her attention on you are amusing at best. You try to say something a few times, but she keeps interrupting you - \u201dWhat the hell is going on?!? Keep the fuck away from me! This can't be happening! I don't\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you frigging shut up for just one second!?!\u201d - you finally raise your voice in anger and she stops. You continue: \u201cThere... sorry for yelling at you, but it will be easier if you remain calm. But first let's get you\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on??\u201d - Taylor shrieks interrupting you, but at least she seems to have calmed down somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I'll explain but let's get you out of there\u201d \u2013 you consider your options and promptly decide to reach to remove your backpack \u2013 \u201cwait, I'll throw you a rope so you can get up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize it's a good thing you came prepared with another shorter rope. In the meanwhile Taylor focuses on the climb herself and is on top of strand next to yours before you can even open the backpack. \u201cThere, so...\u201d - she concludes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...?\u201d - you ask a bit surprised by her sudden display of agility. On the other hand you did just climb down a desk that was probably hundreds of times your height, smaller scale works in her favour as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo explain what's this.. this...\u201d - she doesn't finish and instead covers bra and panties with her hands, suddenly embarrassed by her revealing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell.. you shrunk...\u201d - you state the obvious while thinking how to break details of your involvement to Taylor. Or even whether you should admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that's impossible! People don't just shrink!\u201d - she complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook around, isn't this your room?\u201d - you point around and behind her - \u201cOnly on a much larger scale? Almost as if you were.. smaller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how.. and where did you.. Wait!\u201d - she speaks frantically, not giving you a chance to insert a word - \u201cThat was you, wasn't it? On the bedstand! I figured I was hallucinating, bugs can't possibly be shaped like people or stand upright, but I didn't think.. and.. and..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, let me explain\u2013\u201c - you try to continue, but she connects more details together:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that was you walking around the house! I could swear I heard somebody sneaking around, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shrunk you\u201d - you finally blurt out and Taylor stares at you speechless. She was figuring it quickly on her own and maybe she won't be too mad at you if you come clean on your own. \u201cI shrunk myself first.. I panicked when I heard somebody entering the house and then I got scared of...\u201d - but you stop. Of what? Being microscopic alone? It dawns on you that maybe this part would be best left unmentioned for now. But you need to figure out an excuse quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy...\u201d - Taylor asks while you think how to proceed. \u201cOr screw that, how?\u201d - she adds and you glance back without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's complicated, there's no time\u2013\u201c - you try to bluff, but she interrupts again pointing at the size device clearly visible behind you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that thing how.. what is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't answer and instead think how to explain yourself so your act wouldn't look too bad. It's not exactly easy to put it in a good light... Maybe you should have prepared some convenient story for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait.. why?\u201d \u2013 she goes back to the more difficult question. How to explain why you shrunk her... But Taylor adds: \u201cWhy would you shrink yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis at least you can answer truthfully: \u201cWell.. I was stuck living a boring life, no prospects or hope to ever amount to anything meaningful. Then I found about this startup, a company that was trying to make size reduction tools..\u201d - you don't want to mention your size fetish just yet.. or at all, better to focus on the other thing: \u201cYou see, humans are destroying the world, polluting everything, burning the forests, fishing the oceans empty.. we're killing the planet! Do you know that every single day there's like a dozen species that goes extinct and if\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it have to to with anything!?!\u201d - Taylor interrupts angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \u2013 you were lost in the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the F is this relevant to you shrinking yourself? And me for that matter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI.. It's simple, shrunk like this people only consume a tiny fraction of resources that they would otherwise\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that's crazy! So will you just go around shrinking everybody now?! You're insane!\u201d \u2013 she's clearly mad at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no.. look, I didn't mean to..\u201d \u2013 you bluff again, maybe if you convince her that it wasn't entirely premeditated: \u201cListen, I tried to hide somewhere and ended up here, but then you came in and I panicked, didn't know what to do. There just wasn't enough time for me to hide...\u201d \u2013 you trail off realizing it's not making much sense already, you really hope she bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why.. I mean, couldn't you just... Instead of..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, and I'm sorry, I shouldn't have.. shrunk you, but now it's done...\u201d - you figure it's only a little lie. Maybe you'll admit all of it when she gets used to being tiny, in a few days.. or weeks. You'll have to depend on each other in order to survive. Hopefully it will bring you two closer.. that is if you survive that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't..\u201d - she sounds desperate at this point - \u201cNo, this can't be happening! I don't..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I know it's hard to\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! But it means you can fix this, right? You can just use that\u201d - she points behind you - \u201csize thing to make me big again? That's why you came here, right? To tell me to just stay still while you figure it out and make me normal again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm..\u201d \u2013 it almost sounds like Taylor got over the fact you shrunk her, but you definitely don't want her back to normal size now. Or ever: \u201cNo, actually.. it's permanent.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!?\u201d \u2013 she shouts in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I know, and again.. I'm sorry, it must be tough...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closes her eyes and speaks through clenched teeth: \u201cYou monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds bad, but by now it is pretty obvious she would blame you for everything. And she very much should considering it's your doing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not that bad, I mean you're still alive and\u2013\u201c You stop as she looks at you again, very angry at first, but then calms down a bit. \u201cIt will be fine, I promise.\u201d \u2013 there's no way you can guarantee anything at your insect size, but it feels like a good thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both stand in silence, suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Stop!\u201d - Taylor shouts as loud as she can and keeps jumping and waving upwards. Rachel sighs and approaches the desk. \u201cAaaargh\u201d - Taylor shrieks as an enormous slipper lands in front of her. It's still pretty far, hundreds or even thousands of feet away.. or a few inches in regular scale, but it sure is daunting. You jump to the strand Taylor is standing on and grab her arm, trying to pull her back towards the wall. She clings to you instead and shudders as her mother places the other foot next to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to go back under the desk!\u201d - you yell to be audible as Rachel shifts her slippers causing roaring noise. Taylor looks at you confused, so you add: \u201cShe'll crush us if we get ourselves under the shoes when she moves! Let's go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor lets go of you, looks upwards and complains: \u201cYou did this! It's your fault!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance upwards too, but you can't see what Rachel is doing \u2013 the chair blocks your view. The giantess seems to shift her weight onto the chair, as if leaning in or something. Sitting down? Shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's great that you still hate me, but we have to go...\u201d - you plead. \u201cIf your mother sits down, she'll move the ch\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT'S ONE STURDY SPECIMEN\u201d \u2013 Rachel comments far above and giggles. She must be looking at Brian's profile pic on Skype! Shit shit shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider simply picking and taking Taylor with you, but you fear carpet strands aren't solid enough to support both of you on your legs alone: \u201cTaylor! Listen to me, please!\u201d - she looks at you now - \u201cWe. Have. To. Hide. Now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above you two, the gigantic mother slides her finger across the laptop's trackpad and taps a few times, giggling some more and even whistling once softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor takes one last glance upwards at the giantess mother, then finally nods defeated and jumps on another strand beginning the journey back to the relative safety under the desk and you quickly follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you hear Rachel closing the laptop lid and stretching back, then picking up the beer bottle \u2013 you realize this would mean some tough talks with her daughter.. if she wasn't tiny enough to hide. You note to yourself to remind Taylor of some benefits of this situation if she ever questions you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear.. or, more accurately, feel Rachel lifting a foot \u2013 you pray it won't fall on you two, but fear to look back. There's nothing you could do about it anyway. Taylor, however, turns her head and loses balance falling down between fibers again. Great... now she's stuck. Humongous footfalls follow and luckily they grow weaker, so you reach Taylor's location and look down, making sure she is safe and already climbing up, then quickly glance back at the giantess only to catch the sight of Rachel leaving the room and closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Taylor climbs up onto the strand you are standing on, she...</span></div></div>",

She would've..! I could have d.. D...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her arms and bring her closer, you confirm quietly that she is much shorter than you.. five foot three at most. She struggles at first, so you try to comfort: \u201cYou won't die, nobody is getting crushed today. Or any day...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears appear in Taylor's eyes just before she closes them. She then buries her head into your chest and hugs you just like she did when her giant mother was inside. \u201cI hate you!\u201d - she cries. You embrace her carefully, trying not to upset her. Everything happened so fast when she clung to you out of fear previously that you barely had a chance to experience it, but now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoy her smooth naked skin on your hands and arms, the roundness of her bra-clad breasts on your chest. She is still only in her underwear.. holding onto you and the situation turns you on a lot. You remember how huge her mother was \u2013 you can still faintly feel the footsteps from outside the room \u2013 and Taylor was just as huge before! Same Taylor that is hugging you now! You contemplate removing your clothes inviting her to some sex, but it may be going too far too soon... You still experience a raging boner.. will she feel it? Will she be annoyed by it? \u201cI just hate you so much!\u201d - she repeats while sobbing quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I hate myself too...\u201d - you joke quickly and she chuckles through the tears. Good, you think to yourself, maybe you're making progress. Then you remember that it's not all bad like this and suggest: \u201cYou know how you left the beer bottle out in the open?\u201d - she moves away and looks at you confused, so you continue: \u201cYour mother found it, y'know.. but since you are so itty-bitty now, you won't get into any trouble because of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closes her eyes and complains: \u201cYeah, sure.. not that I will ever drink beer again, stuck like some bug under the feet of my loser family!\u201d Ouch, that backfired really quickly. You reach out to hold her again, but she pushes you away: \u201cDon't touch me... Don't fucking touch me!\u201d - that is rough, you think.. but fair, after what you did. You consider apologizing again, but before you can think of what to say exactly, Taylor adds: \u201cI just can't believe that you..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, I shouldn't have\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd stop fucking apologizing!\u201d - she wipes her eyes. \u201cMake me big instead! Just make..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't...\u201d - you lie again, it feels really bad watching what she's going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if you.. we, I don't know, contacted that company you got this thing from? Right? That shrinking tool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the size device...\u201d - you add absentmindedly, thinking of how best to refute any possibility of returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, maybe they figured out some way to reverse it or...\u201d - she suggests and studies you carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally decide on how to approach this: \u201cI know you are trying to figure out a way out of this, but I don't think they would. It was only meant for shrinking you see... Plus it's not like we can even call them now. Cellphones don't work when shrunk, we can't possibly operate a normal phone and.. you've seen just how enormous your mother was. She is just as likely to crush us by accident as to notice us\u201d \u2013 but then you remember how she did saw you on her bedstand.. apparently even being this small you can be spotted. So you continue: \u201cAnd even if somebody did, even if we somehow caught a normal person's attention.. they are just as likely to mistake us for bugs or something...\u201d - you trail off as you notice how awfully quiet she has suddenly become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did say 'size device' though...\u201d - Taylor finally recalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah.. I meant the shrinking tool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but you did call it 'size'.. 'device'...\u201d - shit, you didn't even notice that little detail yourself, she continues: \u201cAnd size suggests both shrinking and growing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no.. that was my mistake, I meant 'shrinking device' of course\u201d - you correct quickly, and add to diminish the importance of the whole thing: \u201csilly me, I'm just bad with words and.. stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope Taylor buys that explanation...</span></div></div>",

Yeah, you find that strangely convenient... yet, she smiles \u2013 probably the first time since being shrunk. \u201dBut that's alright. Because since you are\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not, I really\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh\u201d - she silences you gently, and starts nodding suggestively while continuing to smile - \u201cbecause.. since you are.. then I can get back to normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can insist on that all you want, but the truth is there simply is no way..\u201d - but she's already hopping towards the size device. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you won't fix my size, then I guess I'll just do it myself!\u201d - she exclaims without even looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you can't...\u201d - but Taylor continues onwards. Out of necessity you follow her. Luckily she's not moving too fast from strand to strand.. has she noticed how she's faster than you too? You shiver thinking of how much she figured out on her own.. no, it's better to focus on convincing her to stop: \u201cLook, there's really no way to 'fix'\u201d - you emphasize the word excessively, \u201canybody's size, we're stuck like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, like I'm going to believe you just shrunk yourself with no way out!\u201d - she stops and looks at you: \u201cIt didn't sit well with me since you admitted how you shrunk yourself... At first I bought is since you admitted so much and all, but when you mentioned the 'size device'... Look, if you mentioned that you don't know what happened.. or maybe even how you woke up like this and struggled to survive ever since, I could've believed you all the way. Or at least for a bit longer. But hey, no matter how much you care about the environment, I don't think you would\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do care about the planet, and deeply too\u201d - you protest having caught up yet again. \u201cMore than I've been able to admit, in fact!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try\u201d - Taylor comments with a smile and jumps away again. Damn, you think.. there's just no way to fool her, it seems. Shit.. if she gets to the device, how long will it take for her to figure out that it works both ways? Well... there's no way to outright grow anything, but the 'restore size' function is advertised quite openly. She'll probably figure out the timed controls too, which means she won't even need your help \u2013 and while you can stop it manually... you'll also need to sleep and forage for supplies every now and then. You can't just sit by the size device and prevent Taylor from growing back. \u201cCome on, lets go!\u201d - she shouts and waves in the direction of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what then? You consider your options while jumping over the carpet. Killing her is.. out of the question. No matter how many times Taylor said that, it didn't make it true. Same goes for tying and holding her hostage. She already suffered enough. Shit.. what if she has been playing you all the way? But no... she really tried to get help from her mother and she was really terrified, she couldn't have faked that. She may be smart, but not 'that' smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it would make this whole thing easier if you show me how to use that thing\u201d - Taylor comments while slowly gaining lead over you. You might be able to keep up with her if you dropped the backpack.. and the toolbelt, and maybe your jacket too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can't be used to\u2013\u201c - you deny again while slowly running out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d - she replies and actually speeds up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.. she looks so sexy doing athletics, smoothly jumping from strand to strand, hardly waiting to rest. You don't think whether all your blood rushing to your dick will help chasing her, but you simply can't help to admire her cute frame. More than admire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! You'll break it and we'll both be stuck...\u201d - you make one more desperate attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, now I'm confused...\u201d - Taylor stops to tease you. Of course she caught that, you weren't thinking...\u201dI thought that we were stuck like this anyway, with the 'shrinking device' being unable to ever grow us, right?\u201d Yeah, you must've been already thinking with your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have passed the point where she was shrunk and getting closer and closer to the device, you almost reach Taylor and take a breather. You're so tired that you couldn't grapple her even if she waited for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d - she insists and puts hands on her hips teasing you seductively. Damn.. she looks so sexy now. Those hips.. boobs.. No! You need to think clearly now! You look down trying not to stare at her and collect your thoughts. Finally, you...</span></div></div>",

She clearly has a point. Several good points, actually.. but then it's not what you imagined an 'adventure' to be like. But then again, it might be a decent 'dry run', you reckon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor picks up cautiously again: \u201cYou don't have to use my help right? I mean.. it's not like I can force you or anything...\u201d \u2013 the main thing is.. she 'could' very easily force you to do many things. \u201cAnd even then you can always leave.. or I could help you move someplace else, if you'll want that...\u201d \u2013 she concludes with a barely noticeable hint of sadness, or did you just imagine it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be very anxious to have me around, as a pet or\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't mean it like.. that, it's more like.. we could be friends or something, right? It would definitely be a new thing to have a little person\u201d \u2013 this time she proceeds very carefully \u2013 \u201caround in my room and... I noticed how you were watching our house and that's why I thought you were a perv, but secretly..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was pretty obvious for anybody who was looking, you know. Knowing your neighbors is one thing, but staring at our house through curtains or at night.. or walking around the block and repeatedly past our house sure is kindda creepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas anybody noticed? I mean, has your parents or anybody else...\u201d \u2013 you're not sure how to even ask about it. You thought you were discreet about it, but obviously not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know.\u201d \u2013 Taylor dismisses it while you realize that she is pretty clever, so maybe nobody else connected the dots. It doesn't really matter now... She continues: \u201cI didn't tell anyone. Not that I care anyway, as I was saying, secretly I hoped my bedroom window would face your side so you could watch me directly. It would be kindda kinky to have a secret adorer... And it could still be the case, sort of anyway...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \u201cI'm not sure if this could even work. Having an insect for a friend\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you're not an insect!\u201d \u2013 she considers it for a second. \u201cSorry I called you a bug earlier, I was talking on the phone and didn't really think about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but still..\u201d you consider everything she said just now. Despite her repeatedly denying the pet thing, it's exactly how this plan feels to you. You actually realize one more detail and begin carefully: \u201cSo let me get this straight.. You never had a pet yourself and\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it won't be like..\u201d \u2013 Taylor begins to protest but this time it's you to silence her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh, your sister has all those allergies and you probably\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know.. that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear things. I watched your house like a creep, remember?\u201d \u2013 you add with a smirk. \u201cAnyway, you never had a pet right?\u201d - she nods reluctantly. \u201cAnd are feeling lonely. No, don't deny it, you admitted it yourself only a moment ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't mean\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it very much sounded like it!\u201d - you accuse and Taylor doesn't deny. \u201cLook, I don't judge, it's simply that.. you seem awfully anxious about this whole thing and.. I don't know, I never planned for this to end up becoming a\u2013\u201d you barely stop yourself from saying 'teenager' \u201c.. young woman's 'pet adorer'\u201d \u2013 you particularly emphasize the last thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect Taylor to protest again, but instead she asks bluntly: \u201cWould that be a bad thing?\u201d \u2013 a long pause while you ponder this. \u201cDidn't you say just a moment ago how much you enjoyed this amazing scenery?\u201d \u2013 she recalls and while that wasn't your point back then, it sure it helping to convince you to agree to this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best to avoid thinking with your dick again. It's hard.. in so many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

And the size difference is considerable - it's no surprise that she doesn't spot you immediately!  The impish delight on her face is slightly worrying though - can you really trust this girl to keep her promises, now that she's fully in control of this situation?  She could easily take you under her full power now, as well as grabbing the shrinking device for herself!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door to the room opens, and her mother strides in mightily.  \"Taylor?  When did you get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's distracted - you could run for it now, and she won't find you immediately.

You bump into another person of your size.  A woman.  Taylor has used the size device to shrink and kidnap some innocent person to keep as a pet alongside you.  It's monstrous, and it's just what you had planned to do to her!</span></div></div>",

All that pizza and beer has filled you with energy, that you expend gladly!  Still, you slump and pant amongst the giant carpet fibres, noting the reverberation of Taylor's continued gyrations through the floor beneath you.  Such a slender woman, and yet to you she's a behemoth of untold destructive potential!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreep, creep, creep, you edge along under her desk, your eyes watching those toes as they tap to the music, press down to pivot the swivel chair or rise into the air, all with equal ease.  She's fully absorbed, and by her casual attitude she's not expecting other family members back yet; you'll be able to get to another room and settle in in relative calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch gentle curves, calves smooth and graceful, you'd love to explore them more than this house...  No!  You won't be distracted!  You ignore the sounds and motions of the giantess, and fix your eyes on the yawning doorway.

You feel faint as one part of your anatomy takes the king's share of your blood, as Taylor expertly strokes the ego of her internet beau...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly collapse against the doorframe as you breathe a sigh of relief, the siren call no less loud or lewd, but the ability to physically touch something outside of your own body gives you a focus, and you nearly drag yourself along, desperate to at least put a wall between yourself and the potential sight of your sexy neighbour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need a goal, so your mind won't be able to wander.

Checking that your possessions are all secured, you take several steps backward.  The trick will be to not look down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA run and a jump.  It's simple, and it seems to you that you hang in the air for a long few seconds.  You can't help but imagine yourself as the star of an action movie trailer in that time, arms pedalling in the air, the thrilling freedom of having nothing to weigh you down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall is quick, and you roll as you impact on the thick, flower-patterned duvet.  Your pack is still shut tight, nothing was dropped!  A moment of cheering in celebration is allowed.  What a rush!  It's not just about survival, it's the incredible experiences that no one else will ever go through! If you'd tried a stunt like that at regular size, you'd have been splattered.  Being the size of a bug brings with it a certain resilience to the gravity that so oppresses most of humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there's nothing of interest on this featureless, lumpy landscape, so you waste no time in working on the next step of getting to the floor.  It's quite a trek across the uneven surface, and you're still half a dozen inches from the edge of the bed as a series of thundering booms announce Taylor's return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strides into her room, chattering away on the phone clamped to the side of face tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's no sign of anyone here!  But the beer didn't open itself, mom!  I'm scared, and I don't know what to do.  I feel like there could be someone watching me right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, how right you are</i>, you smile, crossing your arms to take in her beauty again.  But that moment of cockiness will cost you:  you whistle at the widescreen view of her ass when she turns around, but as she collapses down onto the bed you fear that you're going to be crushed beneath it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, bugs can fall far without injury.  But when a bigger creature gets all up in their face, they're going to be the loser every time.  Taylor's considerable body presses down half the bed surface, the spring creaking in protest under her weight.  You're not directly beneath her, but well within the area of the giantess' influence, and when the bed springs under her, you are catapulted upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't go flying very far, but as before it all happens in slow motion, Taylor spread out beneath you like a landscape.  You look down, and quail as the giantess gets even larger as you fall toward her.  Fingers crossed, she should be as soft as her duvet was, and you'll make such a tiny impact that she won't notice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath is kicked out of your lungs, and you can hear straps on your bag breaking as you impact heavily.  You can't waste time scrabbling to see what you've lost while cradling your own head for injuries.  Your vision blurs, but you seem to have landed on the girl's shorts.  Time to get off here and onto the bed, unless you want to spend precious time searching for the even more precious supplies that could be scattered in the creases of her clothes.</span></div></div>",

Still no success.  Even the valley where her shorts meet her torso and end, giving way to the sheer expanse of her shirt as she sits up, there's no sign.  But there are no scattered pieces either, so it must be intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't fall onto the bed itself, did it?  Turning away from Taylor's intimidating tummy, you walk across her thigh, looking for a good place to climb down from.  You don't even know which side you should look on!  Maybe it's gone for good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, as you look back ahead to keep track of your progress, you spot a dark, lopsided lump sitting out beyond the safezone of the shorts, incongruously settled on the expanse of pale flesh that issues forth from beneath Taylor's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run forward, soon coming to the sawn-off terminus of the fabric, nothing but the girl's skin ahead of you now.  But a few yards of your scale away lies your precious survival pack.  You must merely step out to reclaim it and you can be on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor strikes without warning.  That tiny pack must have caused an itch of some sort, as her hand swoops down, and one of her fingers extends to scratch at it.  A simple motion, and your pack is obliterated utterly, her nail and fingertip exploding it beneath them, then grinding the contents to dust.  As a final insult, the flick of farewell as the hand reascends scatters what molecules remain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't have asked for a better depiction of the power and threat this girl holds. Even if she doesn't see you, think you're a bug and try to crush you, she could perceive you as a minor itch and kill you in a moment.  You also couldn't have asked for a graver predicament, all your supplies destroyed and trapped atop a girl that at best will present an obstacle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing down from here - from her - remains an option, but you'll be without tools or supplies, scrabbling even harder to keep alive.  The other option would be to return to higher ground, tag along in Taylor's pocket or similar, and hope that she can get you close enough to some food or other useful items so that you can get a bit of a head start in getting back on track.

Several comfortable looking chairs and a couch arc before the massive flatscreen tv hanging from the wall, and pictures of each family member, alone or in groups, speckle the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this area, supplies will be plentiful, and there'll even be a little entertainment available when the Andersons gather to watch a program.  With such a vast amount of traffic however, there is the increased risk of being spotted, or just plain accidently crushed underfoot.  But you wouldn't have opted for such a survivalist lifestyle if you feared taking risks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where would be the best place to station yourself?  Still regular size, you check the room thoroughly before you take the plunge to an eighth of an inch.  You want to get this right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the couch, right up against the skirting board, you will be out of sight.  Bar any decisions to move the furniture to vacuum underneath, no one will spot you.  You run a hand along the carpet underneath the couch, and find it pretty clean; it must have been done recently, so you have some time before you'd have to fear being sucked away.  Time to prepare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device is simplicity to use, and in moments you are a speck, traipsing under the impossible awning of the couch where before you could barely squeeze your arm underneath.  You marvel in the sheer scope and scale of your new home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirting board sounds solid to a cursory rap of your knuckles, but at this closer scale you can see how fragile it is, how easy it would be for you to dig in, termite-like, to construct a living area for yourself in the very fabric of the room.  You hadn't considered it before, but it's something worth contemplating.  It would be more tiring than simply setting up your little tent, but may be worthwhile in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there's always the third option: go without.  Why tie yourself down?  There's no hostile climate to fear indoors, and leaving evidence of your dwelling is just more likely to lead to discovery, whether you're present there or not.  Perhaps it would be better to live as a nomad within this room, without any ties to a specific point, going where the food is and living beneath chair or couch as the mood takes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the mood takes you...  Looking upward, you see the vast expanse of the ceiling.  It may be crazy to think this, but then it's surely crazy to shrink yourself this small in the first place.  Why not live up high, and swoop down when supplies are needed?  Live like a spider, some crazy series of ropes and pulleys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, surely that's a step too far...  But some height might be helpful in avoiding the feet of the family.  Maybe it would be possible to scale and nest within a bookshelf...</span></div></div>",

You've got time to take a nap, and despite your nerves, you do manage to catch some sleep.  The beeping of the drone wakes you up, alerting you that you've arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating near the ceiling of the place, you can't help but feel awed.  Even from up here, the place looks massive.  The ground looks so far away, and the people strolling along appear so tiny, even though the smallest of them could crush you without even knowing it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, clearing your mind of these thoughts.  It was time to be serious.  You've done some reconnaissance (read: you've been to the library before) and determined a few hiding spots that could work as a base camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was a disused bookcase near the back corner.  It contained some \"Adult Romance Novels,\" and you had to assume not many people used the area.  Camping out back there would keep you more than safe from the crowds roaming the place.  Of course, it was far from anything, making scrounging for supplies much more difficult than it had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the employee break room.  Technically, you hadn't seen it, since the back rooms are off limits to anyone but the librarians, but you assumed it was there.  It'd be a great place to get supplies, since all break rooms are mandated by the state to carry snacks of all sorts (That is a law, right?)  Admittedly, it did suffer from constant use, making getting trampled a bit hard to avoid.  Plus, you'd need to spend time finding it before you could set up camp.  That'd be a pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in the children's section, you could hide behind the picture books.  You've stealthily been back there, and you knew dusting wasn't a thing that happened there very often.  Having your base crushed under a feather duster would be quite the set back, you'd willingly admit, so it'd be nice to not have to worry about that.  Unfortunately, it was near kids.  Loud kids who'd keep you from sleeping and likely use you as a toy if you were found.  <i>Shudder.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's time to decide.  The drone'll drop you off, but it can't fly for much longer without recharging.  The sooner you pick, the better.</span></div></div>",

The ration you had for breakfast was gone, too, leaving enough food for a few more days at most. Water was looking even worse, as you'd severely underestimated how thirsty you could get in the dusty shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping out a piece of notebook paper, you began to scribble a list. First and foremost, water. You had only enough for the day, and doing anything would be impossible without staying hydrated. You knew you could get water from the bathrooms, but they were on the far side of the building, at least a day's trek if you were being cautious. The break room was closer, only a few hours away, but it suffered from serious danger issues. You wrote two columns down: 'bathroom' and 'breakroom.' You needed water, badly, but nothing was looking good.  Then a thought struck you of a recent addition to the library: a small cafe, designed to attract more foot traffic to the dwindling business.  There will be food and drink there, but the very nature of 'foot traffic' is dangerous to you.  Still, you scribbled 'cafe' below the other two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you slipped the paper into your back pocket. Before you could go anywhere, you needed off this bookshelf. It was possible you had been a <i>bit</i> too ambitious when you chose such a high perch, but there was nothing you could do about that now. On a hunch, you moved to the back of the shelf. A hole was rusted through the metal, revealing the wall behind it. And, more importantly, revealing a thick power cable that connected to an air conditioning unit somewhere above. You can't help but smile. At least something's going your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, and you had descended the cord to the ground. Next time would probably be faster, but it's always better to be safe than sorry. Looking around at the darkened shelves that surrounded you gave you a bit of a rush. Yeah, this was difficult and a bit of a pain in the ass, but it was an adventure! Pulling out the list again, you took the pen and circled:</span></div></div>",

As stupidly dangerous as it was, you were going to need help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something you'd expected and considered, and you weren't looking forward to it.

If you were going to survive a ride, you'd need to find something stationary with a safe hiding spot that would be likely to head towards a restroom. Maybe a purse, or a backpack, or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, just across the shelving aisle. A baby stroller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the perfect target. Right now, it was completely still as the mother browsed books beyond it.

Clouds of dust billowed behind you, but you couldn't stop, couldn't slow down. You'd made it across a quarter of the aisle, then a half, then three quarters. With a mighty leap, you grab onto the worn wheel of the stroller. Little divots make handholds, and soon you're at level with the basket. One final jump, and you land in it, tumbling down to rest alongside a bright pink diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no time to rest, however, as the baby above you begins to cry.  \"Waaah!  Waaahhh! MmmaaHH!!\" It's deafening, forcing you to cover your ears and grit you teeth.  The thin canopy of polyester above you shifts as the child struggles. Even though you know better, you can't help but worry that it'll break and you'll be crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden pounding of footsteps indicated the mother's return. \"Shh, shh, it's okay, I'm still here,\" she coos, trying to calm her child. \"Ohh, you made a mess. We'll fix that right up, okay? No need to cry, mommy's here.\" She bends down, and before you can process it she tosses her book into the storage basket, right on top of you. It presses you down, hard, but the diaper beneath you cushions most of the weight. Still, you're helpless as the stroller begins to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute, the mother makes it to the restroom, completing the trek that would have taken you all day. Still trying to calm her child, she sets up the changing station, pulling out the talcum powder, baby wipes, the diaper. And, unfortunately, you. The book hadn't hurt you, but it <i>had</i> forced your leg into the pink frills on the diaper's front end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft thump that only you heard, the now quiet baby was set beside the supplies. She was a girl of two or three, but even laying down she towered far overhead. You worked at your leg as the mother worked at her child; her long fingers removed the soaked diaper and began to clean the child's behind. In moments, she'd be ready for her new diaper.</span></div></div>",

Your fall halts, and you have a moment to catch your breath and contemplate your survival.  Just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the woman moves, a simple step to the side that creases a contortion all across the wall of fabric to which you cling, deforming it to the whim of her godly thigh muscle, and shaking you wildly.  It's all you can do to maintain a grip; any dream of descending to the floor dies here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified beyond description, you cling tight to the jeans, afraid that any movement may coincide with the giantess moving, and casting you, screaming, to the ground so far below.  You're stuck here for the foreseeable future, waiting for a chance of the woman ceasing movement for a guaranteed period of time before you try to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you wait, listening to the cooing of the mother over her daughter, and narrowly avoiding becoming crushed between a fold as she stoops to place the toddler back in the stroller.  The rise upward is more exhilarating than any roller-coaster, but then she begins to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leg swings back and forth, and you doubt any mountaineer would stay attached better than you are right now: this is akin to climbing the slope of an exploding volcano!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotion ceases, and you blink a few times before looking over your shoulder.  You can make out the hazy form of the library's front desk, close enough to leap across to, and with a rough enough surface that gripping should be a cinch.  You don't risk it yet though, listening for any indicator of sudden movement on the woman's part:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the one today?\" the amiable voice of the librarian booms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hardly get any time to read with this little bundle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, tell me about it!  See you next week, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's checking out a book - perfect!  You can jump to the front desk with time to spare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough...  This woman will be returning here in a week.  You could stay with her, allow her to take you home with her.  While the library is desolate, devoid of food, the house of a family will be plentiful.  You could gather lots of supplies there, and if you stowed them aboard the stroller - invisible to a regular human eye - you could have the woman bring you and them back to the library in seven days' time!  Then, suitably outfitted with supplies, you'll have reserves to fall back on while you build your new life here in the library!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirdly, here's your chance to return to the streets, the original plan you set out to survive.  Once this woman's out the door of the building, you get the Hell off her and try survival here on Hard Mode.</span></div></div>",

You roll onto your stomach, looking out at the concerned face of the goddess.  The position of her wrist shows that her finger and thumb are pressed against the sides of the girl's face, and at the peripheries of your vision you can see indentations in the walls of the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl forward, casting aside your destination - all that matters is getting out of here!  You were so lucky to have taken no real damage inside the girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the fingers of the mother's other hand squeeze into the mouth, filling the space ahead of you are they probe for the unapproved morsel her daughter had been sucking on.  One finds you, the sheer power of the skin-covered digit somehow harder than the girl's tooth.  The ridged surface scrapes at you for a moment, and its dryness is a welcome respite from the mouth's saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the second digit takes you from behind, squeezing you painfully, unstoppably.

You want to nap, but you don't want to be stuck in an empty crib. Hide out here, and you'll be with the girl no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stow your supplies, and lay back, letting the huge rush of air below you lull you to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*   *   *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake to a screaming roar that takes you a moment to get a handle on.

It's surprisingly not deadly; you are well-positioned between ribs, and it feels more like you're a part of the tender hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the mother's voice rumbles through you. \"Let's change your diaper, and then it's time for a bath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBath? That could go wrong in so many ways. You probably had better get off this ride on the changing table -- you can always get down on your own, or you can hitch a ride at the next change. That said...well, you did want water. And there would be water there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...you have to admit, being snuggled into this breast is rather pleasant.

Suddenly the lid came crashing down as the mother let her foot up and now there was nothing but darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t see worth a damn and the smell was enough to make you pass out but you knew you couldn\u2019t stay in here and so you began to make the climb to the top. The diapers that you were between may have been rolled up but you could clearly smell urine and the one above you definitely contained something worse. You pulled yourself up clinging onto the material as best you could before you were once again on top of the dirty diaper on the top. On the sides of the pail lined a plastic bag that you worked your way over towards and began to climb the rest of the way up, using a small cutting tool you had to make small incisions in the bag to act as foot and hand holds. Eventually you reached the lid but realized you were far too weak to open it yourself. You would have to wait until the mom changed the baby again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed and you made yourself comfortable, putting your legs through the holes you cut while your arms held onto the plastic rim of the lid. Soon you heard some commotion outside and without much warning the kid opened again, the mother standing over it with a wet diaper in hand before letting it go. The diaper plummeted past you landing stop the others with a loud squelch. \u201cHmm... looks to be full\u201d you heard the mother say. You meanwhile where pulling your legs out of the bag and attempted to make your escape. Suddenly the lid was removed and you saw the mother\u2019s hands reaching down towards you to remove the plastic  bag from the pail in order to empty and dispose of it. \u201cIt\u2019s now or never!\u201d you said as you made leap off the side of the pail and<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There are repeated, popping explosions, rising from beneath you to get closer and louder.  As more light shines upon you, you see that she has unbuttoned her shirt, removing it to expose her underwear to the world.  But why would she do that?  Unless -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's great and terrible hands vanish behind her mountainous back, and then the bra beneath you pops free, the breasts luxuriating in freedom.  You dig in tighter to the mammary flesh as it drops ever so slightly - but to you it's a massive shift!  She gives no time for you to recover either, and then she's walking, and there's a tremendous splashing noise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisking a glance, you see the monstrous child in the bathtub, and also that the mother has stepped in with her.  She lowers herself down with another rush of force, and one of your hands loses its grip.  With splashdown, you are pelted with great globules of the soapy liquid around you, which smashes you face-first into the hot, pulsing skin of this lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering in the moment of calm that follows, you put two and two together.  She did say she was giving the girl a bath, and really, when would she get a chance to get in the tub herself?  So, two birds, one stone as she bathes alongside the child.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deafening voice of the goddess gives another proclamation, presaging more doom:  \"Hungry?  Okay, just a little before we get you cleaned, missy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour guess was right.  There is a last vestige of lactation going on within these funbags, and here comes the chosen recipient to get her due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouth of the infant clamps around the nipple, and a slurped suction begins, creeping through your skin.  The hand of the child, complete with great, grabbing fingers, slams down to your left for more support; an inch or so to one side and it could have crushed you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time, the woman is still, luxuriating in the steaming, soapy ocean that she dominates like a volcanic island.  Her daughter is distracted - and distract<i>ing</i>! - and you can now choose what you should do.  If you want some of that milk, you could cling in place and wait for the daughter to be done and grab some yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's dangerous, of course, so perhaps you should just climb higher, to this woman's shoulder, clear of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman still needs to wash herself, of course, so no matter where you climb, she will be splashing and scrubbing eventually.  Should you just take the plunge, jump down into the water?  There are two immensely powerful creatures in here with you, but without direct contact, maybe you're safer?</span></div></div>",

The titflesh to which you cling shudders not only with the working of the child's mouth but also every little flinch of those great fingers that dig deep into the skin, enough pressure to squish you were you to come between the two.  And through it all the surface rises and falls with the breaths of the goddess, sucking in countless amounts of air even as her daughter drains her of her liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your own part, you hang on as best you can and try to ignore all the sound and motion these titans are expelling.  Only when you hear the sickening sound of the lips disengaging, popping free, do you look that way, noticing the string of baby drool stretching between the girl's mouth and the woman's nipple.  Disgusting, but you can see some small amount of milk still pooling in the darkened tip of the tit, and that spurs you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's hand withdraws with a vast rush of air, the skin surface shuddering ever so slightly in its wake.  The shadow passes over you, and then that hand splashes into the bathwater, spraying all around you with bombshell force.  A single droplet of soapy liquid smacks into your back with agonising force, not only bruising you but soaking you through, adding to your weight as your clothes drag you down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you drag yourself across to the areola, where the skin thickens and becomes rougher, closer to a rockface but still soft and warm, pulsing with life.  Your hands become sticky as they come into contact with the spittle of the toddler, but it's all worth it as you plunge your face into the white pool, taking a great mouthful of the milk.  So sweet and refreshing, just what a growing boy needs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman leans forward, her breasts slightly mooshed as her arms raise - \"Close your eyes!\" she roars, and you can picture her putting shampoo to her daughter's mountainous scalp.  Where before she had been reclining calmly, now she's making vigorous motion, her colossal tits shaking like an earthquake to your tiny senses.  Still, you cling tight and scoop as much of that dairy product as you can into one of your receptacles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSealing it up as best you can one-handed, you wonder how you could possibly extricate yourself from this apocalypse!  Jumping down into the water is one option, choppy though it may be between the two goddesses.

So you set to climbing with renewed vigour, looking across at the mountain-face as you ascend.  Powerful jaws clash and open as the woman coos over her daughter, and as you watch her tongue and teeth work away, your mind wanders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have already taken from this woman, milking from her very breast.  In the name of survival, how much more can you actually take from these humanoid gods themselves?  You've heard stories of birds that pick food from between the teeth of crocodiles on the Nile - could you do the same on this much greater scale?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the gleaming sharpness of those molars puts a shudder through you, and you can't think how much opportunity you'd have to search that ominous orifice.  You'd be noticed for sure, and crushed or killed.  To wait until a giant sleeps would mean after they've brushed their teeth, and what slim pickings available would be reduced even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was just a passing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you manoeuvre sideways, closer to the head, your grip shaking with every movement of the goddess.  The ear lies behind strands of this thick, wet hair, and you pull yourself between them, soaking yourself even more and almost catching your bags on some of the split ends that scratch at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour three-quarter inch body makes the leap clumsily, and it takes a moment or two to get yourself upright on the edge of the ear.  There's not much further into this cave that you can progress given your bulk, so this ledge isn't as much shelter as you could have wished for.  Still, infinitely better than the shoulder or scalp!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, you place a hand on the skin of the woman.  Warm, and no reaction from the greater being to your presence.  With luck, your odds of survival of the bath has now increased, and she'll be none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the chance to reorganise your bags, lament the loss of the food bag you drpped during the climb.  You can always get more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot from the mouth of the woman, no!  But can anything here be taken?  You pick at a patch of sticky earwax and wipe it away in disgust.  Not that.  But the woman is made of meat, covered in skin, and you wouldn't need much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, the very idea preposterous.  There wouldn't be much nutrition in whatver skin cells you could safely scrape from a human!  Would it count as cannibalism though?  Are you so far removed from the human experience to even count as the same species?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch idle thoughts are all that can sustain you in your perch, as you have no view of anything but the woman's hair, and all sound is drowned by the cacophonous splashing below, and the thunderous voice of the goddess babbling cute nothings to a child.  Let them get clean, then they can get you out of here and you can find somewhere to store your supplies.  You're pretty much at capacity for what you can carry on your person now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning over possible locations in your head is futile - right now you're at the mercy of where this woman wants to go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight increases, as gigantic fingers brush hair back.  Is she about to shampoo?  You may want to batten down the hatches while the storm intensifies, or maybe take the chance to clean yourself a little.  Risky, but fighting to survive doesn't mean you should neglect your own hygiene!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, another idle thought...  Here, you could be heard by the woman, maybe?  You want to survive on your own, of course, so talking to get help is out of the question!  But as a last resort, it would be useful to know if the woman COULD hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could talk to her now, at a time when she may just dismiss such a voice as her imagination, just to confirm if it's possible...</span></div></div>",

Sparing only a moment to whistle as you marvel at its height, you scuttle around her legs, quite a diversion as you follow her bent knees to crest around the mighty heels and wiggling, bare toes.  They're no threat really, but the simple movements of each of those muscled behemoths still sets your survival instincts on edge; the woman remains a threat, enough power in her smallest extremity to destroy you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's still overall though, a steadfast rock for her daughter as she reads through the trite tale.  It's as you step around those feet that you see the danger of the moment: her daughter laughs at points in the story, gently kicking out with her legs and smashing them onto the ground with frightful power.  In the macro-world, those are small gestures on behalf of the toddler, but your three-quarter inch height finds her motions catastrophic.  The feet on the end of those legs are diminutive, a third at most the mass of her mother's.  Yet they still ram down onto the carpet with a surface area greater than you can cover in a few seconds, and with a random, unpredictable rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the origin point of those limbs is your goal though, and so you proceed further, hugging close to the comforting form of the titan mother, whose solid presence emboldens you.  Let the girl lash out, while you remain safe in the shadow of the true power of this house!  Your confidence only grows as you crest the feet, proceeding back up the shins to the knees, where the girl leans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you step away from the goddess to venture onto her daughter's skirt, and to the distasteful area.  It smells clean - or rather, doesn't stink to high heaven - so you set to with your blade again, repeating the process of slicing out a few sacks.  You have more time than yesterday as well, with enough warning from the tone of the story that echoes like thunder.  You have half a dozen sacks, good to stash food, water and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to fill them.  Yesterday, you got it filled quickly but were caught out.  Should you stick with the daughter again, and try to salvage her food?  Or should you transfer to the adult?  Her feeding habits will be less predictable, and she will be much less likely to spill any for you to gather, but the sheer aura of comfort that she's exuded should make it a calmer experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could strike out on your own, content to scavenge scraps from the floor and remove the whims of giant gods from your survival equation.</span></div></div>",

It was her that swept you into the rubbish yesterday, and today you shudder to think what may happen if you go climbing around the daughter or toward that jar in her absence: what will she do when she gets back?  You may not be so lucky as to survive today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead you swiftly transfer across to the woman's forearm, careful to clutch tight to her clothes and not get her attention by touching her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, you are whirled away, up and around in a motion more terrifying even than when the daughter was being swung in the air.  At least then you were upright; now you are pendulumed back and forth at the goddess' side as she strolls casually to the front door.  At every one of her footsteps, each time that her wrist reaches its upward peak, you swear that you're going to plunge off and to your doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, miraculously, you do not drop.  No, you dig your fingers deep into the thick, silky material of the blouse, and tell the heavens that nothing will stop you from surviving.  Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last, you're nearly undone when the journey stops.  The arm comes up higher than before, and while you prepare yourself for the usual backswing, its continuation of motion twirls one of your hands loose, leaving you dangling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arm freezes in place, and you look along the arm above you to its terminus at the hand, the crushing fingers applying themselves to the handle, wrenching open a monumental doorway and ushering in a dazzling sunlight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Package for you,\" announces the newly revealed goddess, backlit but still clearly dressed as a postal worker.  She proffers a gigantic box, and your host swings up both her own hands to accept it, taking you along for the ride once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere you have another choice - if you've had enough of this household, you could take the moment of contact as an opportunity to scuttle across to the postwoman, and accompany her on the rest of her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could just climb across to the box - the woman is sure to return to feeding her daughter once the transaction is done, and while she's thus occupied you could explore the package to see what resources you can scavenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you could stick to your constant plan, and remain on the woman's arm as she goes back to feeding that monster girl, and thereby collect your daily food rations.</span></div></div>",

Ample time for you to work your way to her wrist, in preparation for stage two of your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box thuds down, the goddess rises, and the arms swing again.  You are steady and secure, even if disorientation still dizzies you.  But then the great hand at the end of this arm reaches out, plucking up the jar of peach baby food ready for its partner to begin scooping with the spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, you're atop the wrist, and inching your way toward that welcoming source of nourishment.  The fact that you haven't been swatted off proves one of your assumptions correct: the act of feeding her daughter is so familiar to this woman that she doesn't even need to look down at the jar when she scoops food from it.  Her eyes are concentrating wholly on her daughter, the spoon on autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, you can scamper across her wrist, the pulsing flesh beneath you, and brace between finger and thumb to scoop as much food as you can into your welcoming sacks.

Unwilling to be taken to feed the god-child, you remain in place until it has left, and then resume scavenging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are careful not to get too greedy, to repeat your mistakes of yesterday.

Soon she'll be cleaning up, carrying her daughter and all manner of other activities that would be risky for a tiny passenger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow burdened by several sacks filled with nutritious peach-flavoured goo, you can't just go leaping around like an acrobat, and your transfer is more like a controlled fall.  You throw out a rope as you let go of the wrist, and snag one of many stray strands of denim jutting from the sheer surface of the woman's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraced, you hardly feel the impact as you collide with the immensity, and slowly begin the descent.  The rope is actually less reliable than the plentiful and thick handholds offered by the rough surface of these jeans, and soon you are slowly climbing down by jamming your feet and fingers into gaps between threads, feeling all too well the warmth pulsing from the powerful flesh beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she inevitably walks, it's not so difficult to keep from falling.  She steps slowly, and doesn't have much distance to cover.  No hard task to remain still as her muscles work up, hefting the whole forward with a lurch and a thunder.  Once she's still again, you resume your descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it's slow progress, and when you reach the open space between the bottom of the jeans and the floor - where the bare expanse of her ankle and foot fills your world - you have to play out another line and scurry down it, for if she were to walk now you would be kicked for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet luck holds, and while you're down a couple of ropes, you find hair enough to replace within seconds of hustling away from the titan woman, through carpet toward the kitchen once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you though yourself clear though, there is a cacophonous bark, and the monster dog lopes into view.  It is greeted with words from the woman, who turns to face it, one foot swinging dangerously close to you before coming down to flatten so very much of your immediate world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna play outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be a chance!  While your last journey with the dog-beast was less than pleasant, a chance to explore the back garden would be interesting.  Who knows what manner of plants may be available there for you to partake in?  Unable to open the door yourself, you'll only get opportunities when the gods deem it time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is still close - and your rope still attached -  so you could instead grab onto her as she heads to the back door, although she may not step outside herself, leaving you with a lot of effort for no reward.  Unless merely the intel from <i>seeing</i> outside is reward enough in your opinion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, this makes a trip to the water bowl even easier, removing the dog from the equation entirely!</span></div></div>",

The effort will be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, your hair ropes have nothing to loop onto to allow you to climb, so to get yourself started you have to hack at the base of the counter with your weapon, get some decent climbing holes.  You pull yourself up the painful feet - to you, anyway, in reality fractions of an inch! - until you reach the overhang where the doors of the cupboard built into the counter end.  Of course, opening those doors would be like prying the gates of Heaven open with a toothpick, so all they are to you now is another surface to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, these sections are more pitted and scarred, and you can secure your rope to a tiny fragment of wood splinter that no mighty human eye would possibly detect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh to yourself as you swing out over the abyss.  Already you're thinking of 'them' as being human, and yourself as something so much the lesser.  Only two days ago you were one of those gargantuans, and now you're already thinking of them as impossible obstacles rather than former peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing to the base of the door, you can look up and see many more scattered holes in the surface, cratered like the surface of the moon.  A bodged-together grappling hook and line sinks in above, a tug to make sure it can hold your weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach such swing and climb drains yet more of your energy, aching muscles protesting as you drag yourself up further and further.  The simple handle of this door stands out to your left like a plateau, and you clamber across to it for a little rest, lying on your back as the spool rope in your hands again.  God, but this had better be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handle means the halfway point of the door, and after your near-nap from exhaustion you haul yourself upright again, almost staggering into the wall.  But you must press on, spinning, throwing and pulling taut again and again, hauling your puny weight ever upward until finally you slump onto the shelf at the top of the door, just a final few inches to the counter-top itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet you can't make that last push just yet, instead grunting at the lactic acid burning through your muscles.  This simple counter, waist-high to the gods of this world, is nearly insurmountable.  There may be food at the top, a reward from the gods, but the effort you've put into it will be greater still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to make it all worthwhile.  Staggering to your feet, you send the last hair rope up to the very edge of the counter, and the last, longest inch-climb begins.  You have no time to luxuriate in reaching the summit when you get there, treating yourself to the third and longest rest of all.  Above, you see the distant ceiling, even further above you than the floor is below.  And this new world is just the most mundane of environments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, laughing as you take in the landscape: a mound that can only be a bread-bin, behind towers that hold salt, pepper and all manner of other condiments.  Far distant to your right sits another precipice, above which monolithic water taps loom.  Fallen towers end in gleaming, razored metal, knives that put your little needle to shame.  Bins and boxes of cereal and rice, and an upended dome holding fruit bigger than houses.  A golden goose and a magic harp, and it may have been worth climbing that beanstalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where to start, where to start?  You have several bags, and several possible sources of nutrition, but there are non-food options as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the death-knell sounds, as the front room crashes open, signalling the return of the goddess and her daughter, doggie in tow.  What had been silence is shattered by their return, and you stand up in panic, eyes darting for somewhere to hide.  In moments she has crossed into the kitchen, scooping her immense child up into her arms.  \"Time for lunch!\" she announces, stomping closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll have to put the baby down somewhere first, and that buys you moments.  Moments for you to hide from her.  There's the terror of her potentially finding you, but also possibilities opened up by her making available resources that you otherwise would have found inaccessible.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was little reason to hide like an insect. It was extremely unlikely that the busy giantess would notice a bug sized person with all the clutter on the kitchen counter, and what with her other duties. In fact you were quite amused by the situation. Since you had met this family you had been consistently at their feet. Now, for the first time since you'd shrunk, you got to look down on two of the monsters, the toddler and the dog. You approached the edge of the counter, taking in this amusing sight, and getting the lay of the land in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out your journal and make notes of the patterns of the giants, this knowledge would no doubt be very helpful and could mean the difference between life and death in the future. However, as you observed this average family, something occurred you hadn't considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosey, the immense Husky, finally noticed you. When you had been on the ground Posey ignored the little bug. It didn't smell interesting, and Posey wasn't the kind of dog to take interest in such insignificant things. But now, on the counter, something the god dog associated with yummy foods, the creature felt you were now worth investigating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so distracted with observing the human giants, you didn't notice the dogs approach until the last minute. Suddenly your brain's logic center seized control again, and you realized that you weren't as safe up here as you'd arrogantly assumed. This was a giant's world after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble back from the edge, turning to run towards the wall behind the counter. You briefly fall as you are gathering your supplies on the run. The delay probably wouldn't have mattered, due to your slow speed with your reduced legs, but it seals your fate. Suddenly, two massive gray paws, attached to long gray and white legs slam down on either side of you. In the macro world, it was probably a few inches to either side, but it rocks you nonetheless. Shit. Your senses innately pick up the presence of the immense being behind you, to which these legs are attached to. Slowly turning, you are rendered in awe of creature staring down its great nose at you. Judging you, like a god of old would judge a follower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky's great head cocks to the side, it clearly doesn't understand what you are. You are the weirdest looking bug its seen, looking more like one of the toys the child plays with. It lowered its head towards the creature, intent on gathering further information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slow but inevitable movement of the giant dogs head makes you want to scream and run. But you know that's guaranteed death right there. You have to hope the creature simply loses interest and moves on, leaving you to your adventure, which was going pretty roughly. Still, your hand reaches slowly to your downsized machete. It was a final, last ditch option should this encounter turn ugly. For now, you observe the large black nose getting closer, sniffing intently and creating a bit of suction that also messes with your hair. Behind it, two massive ice blue eyes seem to stare straight through you. It's humbling what power this creature has over you, and the whole of the micro world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug/toy creature smelled of the home, and of humans. It was so confusing to Posey. She couldn't decide what to do about this little intruder. It clearly wasn't a threat, but what actually was it? Was it food? It was on the counter after all, but Posey didn't eat bugs. Nevertheless, having exhausted the information from all her other sense, she finally decided to go with the last one, taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head had retracted somewhat, as the beast clearly processed the information she was gathering on you. You were taking small, unnoticeable steps backward, trying to gain some distance in case of immediate escape. But you had made no more than an inch or so progress, when the head began lowering again towards you. A massive pink tongue briefly flickered across the muzzle of the husky. Looks like you were about to be tasted. That wouldn't do. If she liked what she tasted, there was no chance you'd survive her maw. The nose directly above you, the tongue darted out, but you were ready. You jabbed directly into the oncoming muscle, stopping it dead in its tracks, as the a loud yelp filled your ears briefly. Retracting its head swiftly, more in shock than actual pain, the animal descended to the floor below. Even up on the counter you could fill the impact. You take off, sprinting for cover. Your \"sting\" will only last mere moments, and you are certain that a now very pissed off husky will want vengeance on the offending insect. You do feel pretty boss though, the whole experience felt like a scene out of God of War. The \"boss\" recovers quickly though, rising back up to its former spot, but you are now out of range of the angry god beast. It barks at you nonetheless, causing you to fall to the ground and cover your ears. Its so loud and intense. Several barks later and the master of the terrible beast makes herself known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP POSEY, QUIET GIRL!\" echoes around you. Seems the giantess has had enough of this. She approaches the counter, briefly glancing toward what Posey could be barking at inside the house. She sees only the cans and other items normally on her counter. \"SILLY GIRL, THAT'S PEOPLE FOOD, YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT.\" Risking a glance, you see the midriff of the giantess towering over the counter, and the dog, which doesn't seem quite so big now that she's made her presence known. With a display of strength almost terrifying to witness, the woman grabs the dogs collar, and drags her down to the ground below, scolding the whole time. She's the true master of this domain. Still, the immediate danger has passed, and you can get back to scavenging. Still, you worry that the dog which has ignored you up to this point now will have it out for you. A formidable enemy that can pick up even your tiny scent, hunt you down, and exterminate you. Maybe staying in this house isn't an option anymore. Maybe you should gather what you can and leave as soon as possible. Maybe back to the library, maybe not. Just away from the beast. Or, you COULD try to survive here. Maybe you can make peace with the creature. You had found that a bit of cold chicken could calm the most aggressive of dogs. And there was some, not far away on the counter...</span></div></div>",

You'd just escaped with your life, and now here you were, hacking at a piece of chicken to offer to the beast who almost ended it. Sigh. If you wanted to continue living here, among this family, you were gonna have to be at peace with the family guardian. The larger the offering, the likelier of success, as you hacked out a piece about the size of you. You smirked, a chicken was now a creature that could end you without effort. You were much lower on the food chain at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your reduced size, you did notice you had superior strength. With a you sized piece now available, you put away your machete and lifted the chicken onto your back. The mother and child had left, you had no idea where. Across the kitchen floor was the husky, sitting calmly on the ground, a towel underneath, the woman had hooked up the great beast to a leash, tied to a knob on the nearby door. Approaching the edge, you tossed your token of friendship off the side, and proceeded to make your long way down. Fortunately the same imperfections that made for handholds on the way up, worked just as well on the way down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the bottom you quickly reacquired the chicken. No one was in the kitchen, but you didn't know how long that would last. Hoisting the chicken once again on your back, you began the long journey. Only once does the giantess pass by the entrance to the kitchen, but does not enter it. Her massive footfalls reverberate through the tiles under your feet. A mountain of power, so far away, and yet for her, so close. You continue under the central table, growing ever closer to your goal. Only now, does what your planning to do start to enter your mind. Are you an idiot? You were about to voluntarily reintroduce yourself to an animal a hundred times your size, that had a bone to pick with you. You should be hiding in a hole, not walking towards it. A part of you reckoned that it might have something to do with your old life. In that one, you weren't afraid of a dog, and you reasoned that maybe some of that carried over to your small self. That didn't change that you were being dumb. Pushing the thoughts behind you and hoping for the best, you carried forward out of the shadow of the table. The husky's head turned toward you. It had spotted you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosey had sensed the creature, but had not spotted it until it left the shadow of the table. Angry thoughts about the pain it had caused flooded through her mind. But she did not rise to bark. The creature was approaching her, slowly but steadily. She smelled a familiar delicious scent. Chicken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mega beast gazed down at you, similar to its treatment of you when you were nothing but a curious insect in its eyes. You were almost within its leash range. Last chance to back out. You looked up at the silent god. It was not mindlessly trying to get at you, it wasn't gnawing at the leash. It just sat there, in a U shape, staring at you. \"Here goes\" you muttered to yourself, causing the husky's ears to perk up. What senses! You crossed the threshold into what had to be the dog's range. No reaction. Just the silent judgement. Unnerving. You wished you could read minds as you came closer and closer to its chest, enveloped on all sides by the creature's mass. Maybe then you'd know if you had a future. The machete was pointless here, it was only its will that mattered. Humbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to your earlier encounter, how it felt like a scene from a video game, or a callback to the legends of the old world. A god judging the lesser creature's offering. You slid the chicken off your back, and slowly backed up, dropping to your knees a few feet away from your offering. O please o please, kept ringing through your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosey gazed down at the tiny creature that had the temerity to harm her. It was so small, so weak. Nonetheless her nose picked up what it was carrying, and leaned in. The small creature jumped back a few paces as her snout approached, but no matter. She lapped up the chicken, so good! Smacking her lips a little at the small bite, good but hardly filling, she then regarded the little insect once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching something as large as you be lapped up by the dog monster like it was nothing had sent fear through your little body. Now the husky stared down her nose at him once again. You stared down, not brave enough to meet its face. The final judgement started now. </span></div></div>",

Clearly, such a tiny morsel was insufficient to placate her, and you need to be out of here post-haste.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosey rises as she stands, a moment of movement that buys you the time you need to get out of her reach, and then be blown across the room at the force of her jaws snapping shut.  She barks, the blasts of her wrath keeping you pinned down and covering your ears, before a bigger threat puts her into perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family matriarch storms back into the kitchen, her feet raising furious impacts as she once more admonishes the dog.  Just over this, thanks to the higher pitch, you can make out the crying of the child in the next room - upset the kid, make the mother angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S IT - OUTSIDE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFIghting through the din, the shaking ground and the breeze of macro-movements you witness the woman unleash Posey and drag her to the back door, opening it and removing the dog from sight.  You shake your head at the sudden peace, broken only by the siren call of the wailing toddler.  The chicken idea may not have worked, but looking back, trying to live outside instead would be worse -  the dog could get you even more easily out there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman returns, wiping her sandals on the kitchen mat before closing the door and removing them.  She then strides over you once more to quiet and reassure her child, and you are left to consider the fallout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hostile dog, there's no way you can live anywhere near ground level.  There are a number of alternatives that present themselves for you to think over while the dog remains outside.  The obvious one is to climb back up where you just came from, the kitchen counter.  Plenty of food up there, for sure.  You can find somewhere to camp, and only have to remember to get aboard when the next library visit rolls around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could always just make a permanent base on the stroller, with the downside there being your isolation from any source of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might be a good time to look into exploring the house, to find another room to spend the week.  The question is, will you make it to safety before the dog gets back inside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out at the archway passing to the rest of the house, the crying baby has been replaced by a calming shush noise, the giantess displaying the gentle, maternal side of her nature in contrast to the wrath and power when the dog crosses her.  You could make a pilgrimage to the foot of this goddess, and climb onto her to gain immunity from the doggy threat.  Stowing away on a normal-size person can't be a permanent solution, but it'll do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, you'll have to leave this place, get out through the front door and stay in exile from Posey's domain.  Maybe you could hitch a ride to the library in a few days, perhaps you'll merely adapt to pure outside tiny survival; you can think that out once you pass the near-insurmountable problem of the door itself...</span></div></div>",

The metal bars above you are spaced equally, curving in an arc that is just part of a row of similar constructions, supported by occasional offshoots.  It's... a toast-rack?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet held within those firm prongs are not colossal pieces of roasted bread, but far thinner, less nutritious pale slices.  Paper?

She and her husband deserve your thanks, and should definitely get a mention in your memoirs of this experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, seeing these words has reminded you of the journal you planned to keep, to relay your experiences to the greater world, to show people how much the world can be improved by people belittling themselves.  Up to this point, you've had too much on your mind to think about it, let alone start writing it!  You hadn't thought about it since Chapter 2...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour notebook and pen are still in your pocket, but you slash a few pieces from the envelope above you to provide some more writing material.  No need to pass up a chance for more materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, you see the shadow of Sarah pass away, as she walks back to the kitchen table to begin eating.  Now would be a chance to run over and see what crumbs she left behind from making those sandwiches.  Unless you want to keep out of her way a little longer, maybe wait until she is out of the room first; you could use that time to write your journal, but she may clean up after herself in that time, removing resource opportunities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, what need have you of her leftovers?

In fact, while returning to putting slices of soap into your sack, you realise that you reek quite badly.  You having undressed since being shrunk, so perhaps the rest of your body needs a wash as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping down, you shudder at the chill your three-quarter inch body experiences, and throw yourself at the soap, coating yourself with the pleasant-smelling substance.  Scrubbing it free from yourself, you feel like a new man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasking in your birthday suit, you look down the incredible depth of the sink, shiny metal to a sheer stop.  Humbling.  Swinging your arms back and forth for a little exercise while you rest, you behold Sarah's vast form approaching rapidly, the titan stepping forward with the same casual speed of all human beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand reaches out before you've even taken a single step back, bringing a waterfall cascading from the tap above you, splashing down that vast drop.  What is she doing here?  Is she washing her hands, filling the sink, or what?  You'll have to react quickly, as close proximity to humans always carries the danger of instant death!</span></div></div>",

Your body tears, your organs rupture, your mind screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith increasing vigour she slides her hands up and down the soap, smearing you more and more with every motion.  By the time she finally brings her hands beneath the deluge of water from the tap, you've long since checked out.

With a wrench the monolith of soap is torn from the dried residue that glued it to the dish, shaking the whole thing and rattling you where you lie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn optimistic, overconfident fool might think they could take this opportunity to go back and gather their things, but you know better.  The crunching, squealching cacopony of the woman rubbing her hands with soap lasts only moments, then the soap is placed back where it came from.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropped from the goddess' hand, it once again shakes the ground, and you cling to the edge as much as you can.

Throwing the rags over your shoulder, you pull yourself out into the light, and see that there is  a brown, leathery surface of seating below you, past the extent of Sarah's thigh.

If you just drop to the chair or try to climb down her leg, it could go disastrously wrong. What if she decides to get up? What if the little girl wakes up? No, you'll be able to get an idea of what's up before it happens if you can keep an eye on her. Besides, you figure you'll sit by the pocket. Maybe you'll ride with her some more, or maybe you'll get off this ride, but it gives you options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to get around Sarah in the most efficient way, which means climbing back into her jeans and working your way around the frilly lace. You make the long transit around her hip, and you're working your way back across the front, when suddenly, Sarah decides to rise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't prepared, but fortunately, you were holding on to lace when the world suddenly shot upward, and so you are able to maintain your grip as you head to wherever you're heading. Of course, you have no idea where that is, but you'll figure it out when you get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, it's apparent. There's a crack as a snap is undone, and then the sound of metal grinding, and suddenly, the world is dropping down, acres of skin zipping away as Sarah drops her jeans and underwear, and sits down on the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis motion is too much for you to manage, and you lose your grip, going briefly airborne before landing on a soft trampoline. It takes you a moment to figure out where you are, and strangely, it's the scent that does it before your eyes manage the task. You're on a piece of cloth suspended about halfway up Sarah's shins, as the sound of a cataract opening into a pool roars above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're laying in her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is...not good. Fortunately, she hasn't looked down, but you're big enough that she'll see you if she does, and you've got some explaining to do if she does. You could bail out through one of the leg holes, but given the bunched up denim beneath you, it's no telling how that would work out. Would you be able to hold on? Would you be squashed against her thigh? Or would you fall to the floor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could, of course, just stay very still and hope for the best. And given that even now, the roaring waterfall above has dropped to a trickling creek, that may be the best move you have. Of course, once you're zipped back up...you're not sure how you get out of that one without being felt. But one step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is one other option that you suddenly realize exists. The panties she's wearing aren't particularly expensive ones, and the gusset of the cotton crotch isn't sewn shut. If you hurry, you could dive in there, and hide out between the layers of fabric. You'll be a bit safer, but it's probably physically harder to escape, and you might end up in the laundry if you aren't careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyhow, she's pulling some toilet paper off the roll, you're out of time, you have to decide.</span></div></div>",

Leaning on it with your hand for balance - the thrill of pulsing life beneath your palm - you look down the sheer drop, only a folded mass of denim to cushion your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitation at the thought of such a fall, but then the leg jerks as a prelude to the rising of the panties, and the time is now!  You spring forward, clutching tight to the pack of your supplies, and watching the skin shoot past you with speed.  You daren't reach out to touch her, but Sarah doesn't share this instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of you - below you - a mighty hand seizes tight the edge of the jeans, and begins pulling them upward to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuck and roll, and you bounces from the edge of the clothing, smashing off to one side and sliding, exhausted and bruised, to a stop on the rough bathroom rug.  Tight and pained, you cling ever tighter to your bundle while above you the goddess Sarah re-clothes herself, her vast feet crashing down with force enough to shake the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes open slowly, and you glance up at the majesty of the woman as she rises tall above you, bare toes flexing once before she takes a step, soaring over you with dread potential, so much mass carried with no effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot stamps down out of sight behind you, and the other leg swiftly follows, the giantess walking away from you in moments like an eternity.  It's over before you can blink, the fading echoes of her earthquake pace the only evidence she was ever here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, alone in a chamber designed for gods.  The porcelein mass of the toilet and bath-tub rise so high you can scarcely dream of scaling them, but that doesn't matter.  What's important now is that you are alone.  Sarah shouldn't be back here so soon after her last visit, so you have time to clothe yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe material of her panties is thick and heavy, and with only her hair to tie it together - itself tough as nautical rope - the robes you fashion for yourself are far from convenient.  It'll be impossible to find threads as fine as those you shrank with, so a cloak as delicate as mammoth hide is about the best you can hope for.  At least it wraps you in warmth, and is thick enough to not easily be pierced or torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may be emasculating to be dressed in clothing torn from the underwear of a young mother, but beggars cannot be choosers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you've regained what was lost, where to now?  You had been thwarted in your full attempt to gain cleaning supplies, so where better to renew that quest than here, in a bathroom recently vacated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's the rest of the home, open to you but you cannot be sure where the dangerous giant and her daughter could be right now, nor how safe you may be...</span></div></div>",

Transport, shelter, food...  She even stripped you of the clothes of your previous life, gave you an incentive to struggle toward new survival challenges!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull yourself atop her thigh, naked body already covered in sweat, you consider her immense, heaving form above you.  A sheer cliff of woman-hood, her notice far above you, on some book or television or phone - you can't even tell, from your persepctive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goddess, when you write your memoir...  you'll give her at least a four star rating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trundle along her leg to the knee, the denim rough between your toes, your burden weighing you down more and more.  Looking down the length of her shin, your odyssey is far from over.  Yet you persevere, swinging yourself over to begin climbing down the thick threads, careful with every step not to catch your junk and end in such an embarrassing manner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is sitting still, but no human can remain fully motionless.  Imperceptible movements on a human scale rock your tiny world, minor flinches that send panic through you as your climbing surface shakes.  Down and down, hand and foot, to the ankle of this goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBare flesh beneath you, warm and pulsing, and sure to pick up on you if you touch it.  So you shimmy once more, dropping from the denim to the carpet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou avoid carpet burn, but the impact still winds you, leaves you lying on your back and panting as you look up at Sarah's heel.  Dried skin at its bottom, rising into a powerful monument of weight.  She shifts again, her heel rising and falling in a moment with untold crushing force, and you jump up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying near her feet is just asking for trouble.  So you scoot across the carpet, skipping and jumping to avoid catching your toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes have no such problem, writhing and pulling at the fibres so casually, with strength that would tear you limb from limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her behind, you pass on into the kitchen, where the smooth, tiled floor has its own traversal probems.  You duck as powerful feet stomp past you, the monster dog walking by to curl up in its basket with a yawn, displaying all its many, deadly teeth.  You've been lucky that the creature has paid you no attention while you've been here - are you literally beneath its notice, a mixture of insignificant size and humans scent enough to keep you safe?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, who cares.  You trek across the kitchen, the day disappearing in exertion, all notion of time lost from your mind.  Beneath the table, across to where the stroller is stored, and with it your supplies.  Sitting at last, you let drop your bags, the food and soap therein added to your stock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you set to with hair and panty-frill, wrapping yourself in thick fabric and tying it down with weighty ropes.  It's rough clothing, little more than wrappings around torso and feet, sleeves being beyond your skills.  It's enough to keep you warm for now, and in the future you'll have to try to get something more advanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo pass the time, you settle down with your journal, writing through these first few days, your insights on what a society at this scale may be like, your discoveries about humanity and yourself.  High-falutin' stuff, and who knows if you'll even ever get to share it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're tired, and regardless of how much time is left in the day, you need to sleep.  But as you lay your head down, the dog barks fit to end the world, and comes bounding across the floor of the greater kitchen area, back and forth with tail wagging.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see why.  Black-shoed male feet stomp in, the man dropping his briefcase close to you as he stoops to pet at the dog, it licking his face in return.  It's a handsome face, strong and chiselled, and yoiu can see why Sarah loves this man.  He stands as the woman herself enters, her cry of \"Alfie!\" rewarded with a distant hug and kiss, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there's his name.  You keep clear of the touching reunion, for there's no hope of living through their movements.  Once they're gone, you'll sleep.  And you can awake to a fourth day here, planning now what you want to do.  You have so many options within this house, but now you could try going to work with Alfie, get access to some new materials...</span></div></div>",

More than enough room for a three-quarter inch survivalist to thrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's where you are when Alfie picks up his luggage, cracking it with his immese strength.  From the smell that briefly haunts the air, you feel that he must be putting his lunch inside.  It would be nice to get a look at that, but you've got time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you sit tight in your dark, narrow space and allow the noise and motion to swing you up and about, jostled by steps and then a sudden impact - following by the roaring activation of car starting.  The vast machine carries you and your unwitting host onward at speeds unimaginable to you now.  Maybe, just maybe, you should look into some way of constructing a vehicle for yourself back at the library - that would make navigating the stacks much easier.  Food for thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt drive's conclusion, the briefcase is whisked away for another round of back-and-forth, and your confined space acts in your favour - no room for you to tumble about so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final, world-shaking landing has you waiting for a few moments, listening as Alfie's footsteps carry him away before popping out for a look:  And it's an office space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, but there's no real indicator of what business it is they do here.  There's desk above you, so far, far above you, chair out and ready.  Constant background chatter makes you aware of the other workers that Alfie shares his space with - he's not so high-up as to have his own office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where to go?  You'll need to reconvene back at this briefcase in a few hours to be taken back to the house, but in the meantime you should strip this place of as much materials as possible.  Where to start in this gigantic area?</span></div></div>",

It's thick as a steel bar, and even curled back upon itself is taller than you!

Thinner and shorter than the papeclip, the only problem is how the row of staples is bonded together, waiting for the pressure of a stapler to stamp one out.  However, at your size there's ample room to fit the tip of your blade between two of the staples, and... just... press...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last staple tears free from its place, lightweight and compact enough to be carryable.  Your blade has also bent a little, yet still maintains its sharp edge.  Best not try such a stunt again lest it break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill!  You have some metal, which will be very useful when it comes to constructing a shelter or larger tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what else is here to take?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock!

Ducking for cover behind a standing pen holder, you look up to see that a woman stands in the doorway, powerfully dressed with a skirted business suit, a confident smile on her face.  She throws her long, dark hair over her shoulder with a toss of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffee?\" she asks, shaking the massive mug in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie looks up from his screen as the giantess stalks across the room, laying a hand on his shoulder as she looms over him and you.  \"Earth to Alfie!

They're terrible at that age, aren't they?\"  Becca moves away from the giant and leans against the desk.  Her normally slight weight would have little effect to a human, but the moment her ass brushes against the furniture, you feel a shudder throughout it, an almighty creak of protest.  \"Sounds like you really could use the caffeine, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, looks like this could be an opportunity to explore elsewhere.  With Becca in contact with the desk, you could hop aboard her to go along for some coffee yourself - a few beans could be a stimulant that might be helpful in keeping yourself awake when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if Alfie accompanies her to the break room, you'd be more free to explore and loot his desk...</span></div></div>",

You head toward his shadow, threading through the throughfares of the crockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to kill it, or just get it out of here?\" the giant sighs above you.    Looking up, you see that he is turned away, facing the gaggle of goddesses in the room, and so he can't see you.  And thus you jump for him, leaving the edge of the table and heading for his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you impact heavily, but the staple is secure enough now that you don't get any more damage.  You can hook yourself around a belt hole, and stay secure here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie does as Becca did at first, lifinig mugs and crouching low to see where you could have gotten to, before concluding that the bug is long gone.  He shrugs an apology to the ladies, and then gets about making coffee for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca is grateful for this, as you can tell my her increasing proximity.  Her gargantuan form closes on Alfie, pressing tight enough that you fear for a moment she may crush you between them!  She talks up his achievements, saying how the bug must have been scared off when he arrived, and how she feels so much safer with a strong man like him around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's laying it on pretty thick, and with your admiration for Sarah you feel indignation rising up within you - how dare she try to come between these two loving parents!  You're mad enough, you ponder for a moment jumping across to her body: you could climb onto her and give her some annoying pricks whenever she tries flirting with this married man.  A little negative reinforcement to get her to back off?  It would be cathartic revenge for the terror she's run you through over the last few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you do still smart from recent exertions, so perhaps attacking a woman ninety times your size isn't the best idea right now.  You can find somewhere better to sit while you recover.</span></div></div>",

You leave the briefcase - taking your equipment but leaving the staple and coffee bean - and head off toward the doorway.  Strolling through this worn carpet is still like a field of high grass, and the only noise to accompany you is Alfie's typing high above.  Almost relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the open, gargantuan doorway, you peek your head out before moving, and see no giants about.  Of course, given the speed at which they move, it would not do much good if you did see them coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging the wall, you progress toward the next door.

You couldn't even travel to the bathroom in the library, and now you intend to search an entire office building in just a handful of hours?  This was stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ground vibrates, and a giant moves past.

This won't take as long as you feared; what luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grows as you get closer, and soon you're looking up at her as a statue in motion.  One foot is planted solidly, an impressive monument to femininity, while her legs are crossed at the knee, the other foot rotating at the ankle idly, a casual movement that none-the-less sends a thrill of fearful intimidation through you.

Your rope will not be needed here, and you stow your pack securely before setting to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth of the woman's skin is very distracting as you pull yourself up her shin.  Even sitting motionless, beneath the skin her body is a frenzied factory of activity, rivers of blood gushing at incredible speeds not so far from where you climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt times she presses down with this leg, pivoting her chair around it so that she may look through the door at Alfie; in those moments you stop moving and concentrate on holding tight to the mobile mountain.  These infrequent surprises mean that you're unsure how much time has passed when you finally crest Becca's knee, able to run along her upper leg to the safety of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you've gotten this far, now to decide how you'll take this path of revenge.  What can a tiny like you do to a massive woman like this one?  Something that will annoy her, but not something that will earn her notice and return murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, you could get some more clothing from her underwear - she might have materials that would serve as an alternative to Sarah's.  While there, you could saw part of the way through it, so that her movements as she walks might tear it fully, dropping her underwear at an embarrassing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that's too subtle and delayed for you, you could always stab her a little with your tiny prick of a sword.  Draw some blood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould that really send a message, though?  Such pranks would not make Becca learn the lesson.  From here, you could go up her knee and get to her desk.  From there, you should be able to write a message - her phone, her computer, you'll improvise - and let her know to stay away from Alfie.  The mysterious origin of the message should scare her straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the best way to get the message across would be to whisper it in her ear.  You could climb further up - all the way up this gigantic, monstrous woman - to her ear, and shout your threat and warning to that dark cave.  Again, a disembodied voice should be scary enough for her not to argue with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are just the obvious options - there may be something somewhere in Becca's jacket pockets that you could use against her, and the only way to do that would be to go diving within them...</span></div></div>",

Your current, plastic sacks are good for what they are, but a net...  That has great potential!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, before you head deeper in, you stop to slash away, cutting a neat patch out to fold up for later use.  It's probably almost inconsequential to her, but to your tiny eyes a vast swath of her warm, thick skin is revealed, and you step hurriedly away lest she feel your presence.  Lord knows, you feel her imposing size all the more now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther up her thigh, there's ample room for your less-than-ample frame to squeeze under the dark skirt, and reveal to yourself what she wears down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's certainly sexier than what Sarah had - all black and lacy.  Just the sort of thing a shameless homebreaker would wear!  With such judgemental thoughts floating through your head, you set to harvesting a second set of clothes.  This stuff is lighter than what you currently wear, and you're not too proud to have an entire wardrobe constructed of panties.  Slash, slash, and you have enough for a change of clothes, summer garb, maybe?  You stash it in your new net sack, and then get down to the serious business of sabotage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the apex of the hip is where the waistband is thinnest.  Again, you are careful to avoid touching that mass of flesh, the musk somewhat distracting as you do so.  Carefully, you saw away, back and forth, ripping thread after thread of the elastic, but stopping shy of parting it completely.  No, just enough that the simple movement of her legs when she walks will wear away some more, bringing the whole shebang crashing down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor its part, your blade has cut its last.  It is now little more than a heavy lump of metal, and you toss it to one side once you step back out into the light, looking upward toward the unseen face of Becca, who doesn't know what righteous retribution she's in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly question now is whether or not you wish to stick around to see her suffer this revenge - do you want to be carried about with Becca so you're present for her embarrassment, or get off her now and see if you can get any materials from her office once she's gone?</span></div></div>",

As the simple lock clicks into place, you take the short jump from your doomed position to the slippery porcelain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkidding to a halt, you look behind to confirm the wisdom of abandoning your position: Becca slams her bottom down on the closed lid of the toilet, flinging her underwear to the ground as she begins to weep loudly.

You embarrassed me here at work, in front of everyone, because of Alfie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she can see your nod?  She definitely smiles wryly in response, shrugging and throwing her head back.  Maybe she just thinks she's gone mad and is rolling with this insanity.  Well, whatever gets you through this experience alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I suppose I did kinda deserve that.  But do anything more like that, and you're getting flushed, buddy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems more than you deserve.  Does cuteness buy a lot of forgiveness?  Becca is looking at you rather like a woman would a pet, or a beanie baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We good?'  you mouth to her, and Becca rolls her eyes in mock thought.  Both of you jump at the knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca?  You okay in there?\" Alfie asks.  \"I'm worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor, sweet boy,\" Becca sighs, then looks down at you.  \"But I guess that he is taken.  So, what do you want now, little guy?\"</span></div></div>",

Best not to antagonise a woman that literally has you in a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you settle down and try to make yourself comfortable, enough padding here from tissues to make a soft bed.  In moments Becca opens the sky and her eye make-up drops down like a bomb, thankfully nowhere near you.  Her immense face smiles, and she says: \"See you after work?  Sit tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocking as she lifts and carries her handbag is relaxing enough that you can catch a little sleep, dream a little dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit it,\" you say, and step into the size reducer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it shrinks you, the cicular platform beneath your feet rises telescopically in time with your rate of shrinkage; despite an ever-decreasing height, your eye-level remains constant, and the disc beneath your feet always proportional.  Your tapered pillar ceases rising as you stop shrinking at three-quarters of an inch, and you speak into your head-set.  \"It's safe to come in now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolett almost runs into the room, her face alive with joy, and you freeze as you witness your first giant.  She's still your youthful lab assistant, you tell yourself, dark hair still cut just short enough to brush the collar of her white coat.  Yet, magnified to those proportions, she's a terrifying beast that rakes your primordial fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" she says as she stops in front of you, \"it's quite tempting to pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best avoid that for now, just to be on the safe side,\" you tell her.  \"The important thing is that we know a living human can survive the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble breathing?  Not too cold?  Memory just fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell.  No ill side-effects.  Works like a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can contact some of the buyers, let them know -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  We keep this a secret.  Don't you remember what I told you?  I'm going to use this to see if I can survive, test myself in the giant wilderness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy leaves her face, replaced with a mild annoyance that her size amplifies to a raging tornado.  \"Really?  Think of what we could do with this!  We could make food last longer, reduce prison populations to manageable levels, fight pollution!  We could really help the world!  Hell, you could RULE the world with technology like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolett pauses for a moment at her last statement, and raises a finger to point directly at you.  A finger thicker than your body, more than capable of crushing you.  \"But no, you want to use the greatest invention of the millennium to go through a fucking mid-life crisis?  Maybe there <i>have</i> been a few side-effects here, screwing with your mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand fast.  \"Violett, no.  It's not all about me.  I need to see what it's like at this size, what a shrunk person has to live through.  I can't let others go through this without being fully aware of the risks myself.  And lab conditions are no fair test; it has to be out in the wild, with fully unwitting participants, to account for every variable.  I'll keep a journal, note what I discover, and come back once I'm certain that this process is one I can live with subjecting my fellow humans to.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolett folds her arms.  \"<i>If</i> you come back.  I don't know if you've realised, but you're small enough to swallow whole.  Lotta animals out there'd like to make a meal of you, and let's not get started on people just stepping on you by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I've got to experience the full range of threats and dangers, really stress test this scenario.  You just keep things quiet here, and I'll be back before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolett rolls her eyes, but still smiles.  \"Little kiss for luck, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands on tip-toes to reach you on your perch, lips pressing together to blanket your vision -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake with a start before Becca's face, sitting on her hand as she puckers her lips, blowing a strong current of air across you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you're not dead,\" she says.  \"That's a relief.  Well, I'm clocking off now, so I wondered what plans you had?  Alfie's off-limits, I get that, but I know of one man that can't object if I decide to take him home.  Still, better give you a little say in the matter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts you to her ear, and you can let her know where it is you want to go:</span></div></div>",

And why not just go off with him tonight as well, huh?\"  When Becca speaks with you in her ear, the rumblings through her skull are like a mountain is talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just fancied a change of pace for one night, and it would be rude to just abandon you after putting you through all these shocks.  I want to make sure that you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're sweet.  Sure there isn't some other reason you want to go home with an attractive, single woman..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, well, given out current size discrepancy, I don't think it would be too safe to think any further in that direction...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  I imagine you're blushing now!  Sorry!\"  Becca's laughter rocks you where you sit.  \"Well, you won't be much trouble to put up for one night, and I doubt you'll eat me out of house and home.  Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the bag you go, and this time you can't sleep, too riven with thoughts of what may happen now.  Putting everything in the hands of this woman - literally - is risky beyond belief.  Certainly not something your scientific mind should be doing!  As you go over all the ways this could end badly, you are subjected to every movement of the handbag, as she walks and swings it.  The shudder as she places it down is the last for a while, but still you can't rest, pacing back and forth and examining all the outsize items in the bag, looking but not touching out of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dark, you still have time to catch up on your journal, describing your latest curious change, and wondering what subliminal thoughts might have directed you down this path.  You are not choosing the path most dedicated to preserving your survival; is the human mind too cluttered to dedicate itself thusly?  DO the thoughts and drives of your previous, giant life skew your decision-making?  Behaving like an animal may not be possible for a great scientist, with decades of casual life behind him.  Is a shrunken survival test just too extreme for someone above a certain age?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusings for another time, as the bag opens after hours, and Becca's hand descends to bring you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be her home, as she walks across a bare wooden floor, most of the furniture for both a kitchen and a primary living space together.  Not a big place, and probably one she lives in alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand crashes down on the back of a couch, and you scuttle off as she strides away again.  She removes her jacket to hang from a wall-hook, rolling up the sleeves of her blouse as she moves to the kitchen.  She heats a pan and begins chopping vegetables, the delicious smell of a stir-fry wafting across to you.  After so long on subsistence, even this simple meal is like a gourmet feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Becca says, not looking up as she casually lifts and destroys food bigger than a house, \"little guy like you, there must be some way I can help you in your crazy, survivalist crusade.  So, I'll be a generous giant: ask for one thing, and I'll give to you.  Just whisper it in my ear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe casually strolls over, crushing carrot between her teeth as she crouches down, her immense ear dominating your view again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what will it be?  Some more materials to subsist off would be good, as would some materials you could use to build.  Maybe just some material to make something other than panties.  Your hip still feels naked without a weapon for protection: she must have something that you could replace your machete with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless...  Unless this is a test.  Maybe you should ask for nothing, and Becca will like you more?  Again, not a pure survivalist instinct, but that seems to be where your mind is leading you...</span></div></div>",

Rocking back where she squats, she raises an eyebrow even higher.  \"Oh?  You use it for cutting?  Like what you did to my underwear, you little perv?  Like what you did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands, rising in terror as much as stature as she looms, and her hand descends to her thigh.  A giant finger pokes through the hole you cut in her tights.  It wasn't so big when you made it, when you cut out your sack, but as she pokes through, it tears even wider.  To think, it took so much effort to carve through the thread, and now she rips it apart accidentally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TO MY TIGHTS!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands move to her hips, and she must be looking down at you sternly from her great height.  Now do you realise how different things are between this random encounter with a giant, and the laboratory condition conversation with Violett.  How you miss your headset, and the ability to talk back to a creature so immense and powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter booms out from the heavens, and Becca walks back to the kitchen to continue her cooking, lifting and tossing the contents of a pan.  \"Don't worry about it.  But if you want me to arm you, then you're going to have to do me a favour; after we eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca hums to herself as she cooks, and you cannot talk to her with your diminished voice.  Instead, you sit and watch, in awe of her strength as she cooks, marvelling at the sheer quantity of food she intends to devour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she actually begins her feast, you are even more impressed!  Sat at her elbow on her small, fold-out table, you can barely take your eyes off her as she forks immense quantities of noodles and vegetables into her maw, crushing then with rapid movements of her jaw, compressed bundles passing through her throat with a noticeable bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part, there's no way you'll finish what she has lain before you.  With her knife she cut off what she sees as a tiny portion of her own meal, but the oozing food that lies before you must be almost equal to you in mass, more than enough to last you several days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull hunks off with your bare fingers, stuffing your mouth with the first proper food for ages, ignoring the mastication of the gods going on over your very head.  It looks no smaller by the time you're finished, and as you sit back Becca's fingers snap around your leavings, lifiting the mass with a simple flick of the wrist to send it tumbling into the oblivion of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a burp that rumbles through the table you sit on, Becca pushes her chair back and looks down at you.  \"So, if you're finished, you can get on with that favour you owe.  Just a little thing really, which is just as well for someone as small as you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to ask more questions, but instead she scoops you into her grasp, and you fight to keep your meal down as she whisks you away at great speed.  She crouches over the floor as she lets you tumble free, and raps her knuckles on the floorboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost an earring through a hole here.  I don't want to go tearing the floor up just to get it back, but skinny little you can climb down and grab it back up for me, cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her smiling dominance and then to the hole between the floorboards and back.  \"I'll get you that weapon you wanted if you get me that earring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuck off the greater amount of bags you carry, just yourself in your panty-robe for lightweight ease of movement, and pantomime up at the giantess.  Lasso, your waist, pulling on an invisible -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rope!  Ah, you want me to tie a string to you, so I can pull you out?  Sure, I can do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe string that Becca ties around you is almost as thick as your arms, and she pulls it tight enough to leave you gasping.  Such is the strength of a simple woman!  Well, should be more than able to pull you up when you tug though, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down the darkness, it's not too far to the dusty ground.  \"It's gold, with a dragon design,\" Becca advises, as if there'll be some Last Crusade variety of artefacts for you to choose from.  As an afterthought, she lifts the string, and you with it; you dangle before her face as she nods; \"Okay, looks secure enough.  Down you go hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca crouches, and lowers your lifeline into that darkness with no care.  For your part, the unknown holds countless terrors, which you prepare for even as your feet touch the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nString continues to feed down, and you have enough to walk along the dusty ground, lit by cracks to the greater world above.  Becca shifting her weight - even minutely - creaks the ceiling above, and sends more dust showering down.  You hurry onward, knowing that you're safe but still subject to an instinctual fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead, the glint of gold, and the earring - shorter than you, must surely heavier than you can carry.  Well, Becca can pull it out once you tie the string to it.  All you have to do is stride through this particularly thick heap of dust and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh.  Your leg is stuck.  You shake it back and forth, and while that throws dust aside, it does not break free, merely revealing the thick thread to which it's stuck.  Thread... like that of a spider's web!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a near-silent clicking announces the return of the web's creator, alerted by your stuggles.  You can still turn your head, to see the many-eyed horror stalking closer, gyrating it fangs.  While it's less than half your size, with those mandibles on its side and you lacking a weapon, even were you not webbed you're not confident of victory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets ever closer, in no rush even as you struggle to free your arms and legs, that pink panty clothing a truly shameful death shroud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait!  This spider may be able to catch many insects in its web, but not a human, someone who is capable of removing their clothes!  You wrench yourself out of the fabric, leaving it hanging from the web while your naked self drops down before the earring.  The spider pauses briefly to poke at your discards with a forelimb, before all of its eyes focus on your movements and it hisses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt advances, deadly intent in every move of its powerful grey legs.  You've bought yourself moments, nothing more.  You back off on your ass, until you meet the cold metal of the earring, a dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider pounces, but you shift, pulling at the jewelry to bring its pin to the fore, piercing and slaying the beast.  Odourless fluid leaks from it as it thrashes, before the legs curl in on themselves, and it remains still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're owed a few moments of heavy breathing before proceeding.  Then you heave the dead arachnid off, pull enough fabric from the web to cover your modesty, and tug on the string, hopefully hard enough for Becca to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth above dutifully pulls at the string, and you cling tight to the earring as it is dragged along, tearing through the spider-web as if it were tissue paper.  You snag some of your clothes as you are whisked by, and duck instinctively just before you would hit a wall, only to lurch upward into the light, and hanging once more before Becca's deific countenance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it!\" she shrills, and pinches the earring from you.  You are sent rocking back and forth by her small claim, and then dropped onto a tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she says, \"I do owe you something, so here's a 'weapon' for you.  Hope it isn't too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up from your efforts to untie the string, and something metallic flashes before your eyes before thudding down with great weight.  It might be a shard of a razor, snapped and broken until it's merely the length of your forearm.  It is indeed pretty chunky, a good deal thicker than your own shrunken machete, but it does give you confidence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting it, you cut through the string in seconds, and beam happily down at the thing.  Might this be your new best friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it,\" Becca says.  \"Now, it's been quite the day, so I think it's just Netflix and chill for me.  You don't get a say in the matter, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she does at least lower her hand to the table and wait for you to step aboard before carrying you somewhere, so maybe you're growing on her?  Regardless, you are placed on the arm of a chair while Becca settles her gargantuan form into the seat itself, wriggling into comfort while shaking your very world and leaving you fearing she could knock you off.  While she sorts through the programming available, you go over your next steps in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll stay the night here, a holiday in the presence of a giant knowing of your existence, and then be taken to work tomorrow to get back to Alfie and through him Sarah.  You need not get used to this sort of treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why shouldn't you?  This hasn't been bad so far, and what's so bad about living in the care of a giant woman?  You could tell Becca that you want to stay with her, and still have your library exit strategy present in case you tire of being small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what is this bullshit?  You started this to endure tiny survival, not be waited on hand and foot like a Roman Emperor!  This is a slippery slope indeed!  Perhaps you should cast aside all human aid right now.  You could sneak away from Becca now, while she's distracted, and forage from her home without her help.  Seems a bit harsh, and if you do care for her feelings, you could just ask her to take you outside, to live in the hostile outdoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, just forget all these thoughts. Get Becca's attention right now, insist that you both talk rather than 'chill', and determine between you how this is going to go.  Now that she's seen a shrunken person her whole world outlook must have changed, and you could help her come to terms with it.</span></div></div>",

She was kind enough to provide a thimble-full for yourself, but the strength of the alcohol is too much for your tiny body mass, so you abstain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass in chillaxation, changing only when the screen blinks black and Becca roars a yawn of pure exhaustion.  Her hand carries you to her bed, but you are placed safely out of sight within a drawer, hope of an escape utterly smashed.  It's comfortable here, with unidentifed soft objects in the pitch dark, but you smother any idea of looting from here and get down to sleep.  Dreams trouble you with the possibility of Becca simply not releasing you, under no obligation to such a tiny personage, but you only scream yourself awake once during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue day greets you as the floor rumbles, Becca pulling the drawer out and allowing you to see the light, backlighting her beatific smile.  Five days now since you left the library, and your three-quarter inch self still has more to experience!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are left on the dinner table to eat over some crumbs while she gets ready for her day.  Effectively a captive audience, you cannot reply as she runs through her routine, her plans and thoughts.  None is of interest, and you're glad you're too small to have to nod or grunt agreement with some of her more outrageous opinions.  All she is now is transport, and you're glad you didn't give too much consideration to the idea of staying with her forever!  You'd have been begging for death within a day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time she's applied her face, selected the correct suit and offered her hand for you to climb up.  Her last words before you are set into the darkness of her handbag - new weapon and old bags of supplies tucked alongside - are: \"Now, keep out of my pants this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, she's wearing a trouser suit today, and some pretty tight-fitting boots over that.  It's come to something when a woman goes to such lengths to keep herself safe from you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour darkened journey is one of faith, as you have to trust that Becca delivers you to where she had promised - back to Alfie to get on with your life.  As it is, when she drops you out and hurriedly walks off, you look about in astonishment.</span></div></div>",

She stomps off immediately, and you look up at the almost-familiar office space of Alfie Gillespie, the man himself dominating your view as he sits at his desk.  He turns, so far above, probably wondering at Becca's brief presence, but he never looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast his feet, under his desk, his briefcase sits waiting for you, a means of travelling back to the house, ready for your connecting flight to the library in three days.

Becca helped, so why not just tell this dude all about you, and make this a lot easier?

Looking across the aisle at the woman in her cubicle, settling her immense ass into an office chair, you have to hope that words will be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, the only suppliers you carry are your hair ropes, the bundle of material from the woman's tights and your new razored blade - you're not weighed down much at all, and have plenty of space to carry any new supplies you happen across.  Let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would take a human mere moments to walk is a brisk journey for you, and you're not even out of Alfie's doorway when the sound of the world ending brings you to a halt.  Thunderous wheels roll across the carpet, crushing all in their path.  You dash backward, and the cart rolls to a stop neatly blocking the way between the two workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like the stroller you rode a few days ago, with its wheels smaller and thinner.  In shape its an immense wireframe cuboid, a pair of shelves connected by towering poles at each of its corners.  You cannot see the upmost surface, but the lower holds a smattering of large, flat sheets, mostly dirty brown, a few white -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the mail trolley.  The person pushing this contraption is here to delivers internal and external letters to the staff.  Looking to the left, you see the gigantic shoes of the lowly employee who pushed it here, stooping to retrieve letters to give to either Alfie or Becca.  She's young, just starting out in this business - whatever this business may be - and yet another awe-inspiring obstacle for you to overcome.  Running past her to get to Becca does open up the possibility that she may step on you, or roll the cart over your fragile form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should just head back to Alfie, play it safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you've got a whole work day to play with here, and a light inventory.  You could scale this vehicle and ride it out, perhaps even rummaging through some of the letters yourself.  If that's too risky, perhaps you could get onto the post-girl herself!  Or else roll in the opposite direction to where she's going, to explore the office in places that're definitely safe from her rolling path of destruction.</span></div></div>",

Having regular-sized humans serving as transporters will be very efficient; think of the mass-transit possibilities!  You're already scribbling a few ideas into your journal, but you stop once you realise you've begun doodling the uniforms these titans would wear - a mixture between a fairy-tale giant and a bellhop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing yourself back to real-life, you note that the cart stops several times, but each time the massive woman in control takes only from the upper surface of the trolley.  As you watch her enormous trousers walk away to another desk, you wonder why that is.  Clearly the contents of this trolley are organised so that she works her way through first the upper tiers, then this bottom row.  Given that you can't see the top of this strucutre, you don't know how much there is for her to go through, before she stoops down here and her hands invade your personal space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well; you can't affect it, so no need to worry!  Instead, you consider the gigantic envelopes looming over you, seeing who has post on their way.  A large manilla envelopw bulges with some large item within, no doubt shrouded in bubble wrap.  Large, simple letters address this to the IT department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA more formal-looking white envelope is addressed to management, neatly printed text wasting no space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn its way to accounts is a gridded re-usable office envelope.  Many addresses before that one have been scrubbed off with powerful strokes of a black marker, and it stinks of the dozens of sweaty hands that have passed it around over the months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, a box of office supplies seems to headed on its way to human resources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wanted, you could secrete yourself atop one of these pieces of post, and be taken to that department with it.  What materials you could harvest could be deduced fairly easily.  Wow, this is like the transport system working in your favour already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe risk - besides that of being spotted by the mail-girl, or the unknown of these office rooms - is that it may prove difficult or impossible to get back to Alfie before the end of the work day.

With the simple design of the cubicles, there's a wide, clear aisle to walk back down toward your origin.

Just a reinforcement of your conclusion that the office is too populated for tiny survival; a handful of people you can handle, the dozens of individual god-beings stomping around this realm is insurmountable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet no more crash past you, so maybe the ordeal is over for the moment.  Panting, you complete your journey as you lean on the corner of the entrance to Becca's cubicle.  You peer around to see what she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoots and Sandals made it here before you, the two giantesses standing as they talk with the seated Becca.  Their words thunder above you, but you can make out words here and there, and the longer you listen, the higher your heart rises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two newcomers are surprised by Becca's announcement that she's giving up on chasing Alfie!  Good for her!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" asks Sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sophie, let's just say that I had a little meeting with another man last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" laughs Boots, \"don't leave us hanging!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a grin form on your face.

Now, you sit tight in here, for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands funnel you into her handbag, out of sight of any other giants and safe.  As before, you restrain yourself despite the treasure trove of loot around you; you need to be on best behaviour for your date!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the humungous hand mirror in here, you look yourself over.  Your clothes are rags, and you hair is a mess.  Hopefully, your three-quarter inch stature will hide most of these details.  Even if it doesn't, there's nothing much you can do about it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, the world shudders around you as Becca hefts her bag, but it's not until you're placed down beside her in the passenger seat of her car that she speaks with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm guessing you don't have any cash to wine and dine me,\" she correctly states, while keeping her eyes fixed on the road, \"so I think we should take this back to my place.  Normally I wouldn't do this on a second date, but you've already been there once before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her home, she removes you from the bag, transferring you to her kitchen counter.  While you orient yourself and catch your breath, she casually strolls around, opening cupboards far above your reach.  \"I cooked yesterday, so it's only fair you feed me tonight.  Now, I don't expect much, so I'll have a quick nap while you whip me up a sandwich!  Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterspacing her words, she slams items down on the counter, until you are surrounded by gangantuan cutlery and food.  Through a small gap you can see her kick off her shoes and stretch out on the couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the great loaf, you wonder how she expects you to accomplish this task.  It would be so much effort to cut through that bread, let alone get some slices of that ham, or of that tomato!  Maybe it's the effort alone that she wants to see, of your devotion to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could have a joke with her.  She never said how BIG a sandwich to make, so you could just create one sized for you and offer it up!  Surely she'll see the funny side?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy play along at all?  Now you're in her house, and she's asleep, you could sneak down from here and get to looting her home, perhaps making a little nest for yourself and continue your tiny survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities stretch before you more than even that great boiwl of salad.</span></div></div>",

Oh, well, what's the harm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thick fingers pinch you up effortlessly, bearing you toward her monitor.  They release you to drop onto a furry surface, some googly-eyed mascot whose adhesive feet stick it the side of the screen's frame.  You sit there in comfort as the giantess gives you a thin smile and returns to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes and answers calls, rummages throug paperwork, types at her keyboard with bone-breaking power.  You hope you're doing the right thing here.  It's a big step, trusting someone with the secret of the super-science that you created.  And why?  Is this all just guilt over what you did to her?  Or is this just another layer of your experiment, seeing how someone may react to such news?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts and more whirl through you as you take a rare moment of rest, content to just observe the ordinary in the immense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end of the work day is heralded by Becca reaching toward you, plucking you up to be whisked once more to her carvernous ear.  After so long without communicating, you give her a brief \"Thank you,\" as you settle down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she's walking, and you split your attention between the dark, hair-lined cave of her ear and the blurred outside and outsize world passing by.  When at last she slams into her car seat and pulls across a seatbelt, you have a proper chance to relish the skin ledge to which you cling, and Becca can finally speak to you without fear of an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be worth it, little guy.  Spending Friday night without getting myself totally shit-faced is going to ruin my weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be great, don't worry.  You've got to see what I have to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all aquiver,\" she whispers, gyrating for a moment where she sits before keying the ignition and setting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey is swift, and soon you are witnessing the great opening of the library building from another angle, an impressive number of giants passing in and out, no doubt eager to grab a new novel to see them through the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adult Romance,\" you instruct your ride, and Becca can't suppress a giggle.  \"Something to get me in the mood, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you can the stacks passing by as if you were in a helicopter flying through skyscrapers.  The new angle takes a bit of getting used to, but soon enough you get your bearings and stop Becca's walking with a sudden kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry; Werewolf Lovers IX, that's the one we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some freaky shit.  The series went downhill after number four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her hand reaches up to the second-from-top shelf, grabbing both the book and the small device sitting in its shadow.  \"And what have we here?\" she queries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A machine capable of altering the size of people and objects,\" you say simply.  Her stunned silence is all the reply you need, and indeed expected.</span></div></div>",

At your direction, Becca places you and the device on the floor, her immense feet stepping backward so that she can can a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCranking a few dials, you smile at the surprise she's about to get.  A little perspective should help her appreciate what you go through daily, very important for a three-quarter inch tiny survivalist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smash the big, red button and jump aside as the shrinking beam lashes out, enveloping the titaness before you.  The bright light blinds you, and so you miss the process of her decreasing in size, seeing only the result as she has dwindled to under your own height.  You dash across the carpet toward her, through the small valleys created by her previously massive feet, and help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're big again!\" she laughs, and for once her face is a complete delight.  Previously even her glee had been terrifying, but now she's on equal terms, no longer an all-powerful being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look again,\" you tell her, pulling her forward to take in the skyscraper bookshelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've shrunk?  A little warning would have been nice, you jerk!\"  Mockingly beating a tiny fist on your chest, she stops to examine your panty overshirt.  \"What is that you're wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I had to make do,\" you say, resolving not to show her the sack you made from her tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll have to see about getting you some decent duds!  No man of mine is going around dressed in rags!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No man of yours..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb,\" Becca says, taking charge and smiling up at you with lidded eyes.  \"Why else would you get jealous of Alfie and me?  Why would you make us the same size?  Why would you do all this on a Friday night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, you have no answer, but you can say nothing as she sweeps you into a kiss.  The woman is smaller than you now, but still she wields far more power.  Following her lead, you lose track of time as your mouths explore each other, backing into the machine as Becca peels your sorry clothing off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the panty-rag serving as a blanket, the two of you sink into the horizontal, wasting no time with words.  The world moves for you: but that could just be the tread of passing giants, as the two insect-people, so far beyond the world's notice, find comfort in each others' arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes.  All that exertion must have tired you out, sent you straight to sleep; tiny people don;t have the greatest amount of stamina.  Scratching idly, you look across to Becca, snoring contentedly.  This was certainly not a result that you had forseen when you began this experiment!  You'll have to make new plans for where to go forward here, and reach for your notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look away from Becca, you notice the immense eye looking down at the two of you, focussed intently.  Instincively, you freeze, and the burning breath of the giant washes over you as it talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you couldn't resist using the device again!  Gave me a chance to narrow down my search a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Violett, your young lab assistant.  She hadn't been too happy with your plans for the device, which is why you didn't tell her you'd taken the machine last week.  Perhaps she's not too happy about that?  You need to reach the machine-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolett's gigantic fingers lock around the machine and effortlessly lift it from the ground.  \"Yoink,\" she says.  \"Now I can put this to some proper use.  Who knows what might have happened if you'd gotten yourself killed, lost this thing?  You're a shitty scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settles her gaze on you, her brow furrowing.  \"But you did teach me so much.  Hmm.

The ground quakes beneath the tread of another giant, and Alfie's voice cuts in above:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get that bug yesterday, but I can make it up to you by getting this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's enough of a warning for you to get moving, sprinting full-out toward the distant form of Becca, soon blasted off your feet at the incredible impact of the man's shoe stomping down behind you.  You tumble forward in the wake of Alfie's step, rolling along the dusty carpet while the macro world above explodes above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bug?  Ugh, call me when you've got rid of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alfie, maybe we'll leave the two of you alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Don't kill it!  You don't know if it might be -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world shakes more as those massive people move, and the only one you can really see is Becca, lifting her immense form to step over you, leaving her and Alfie behind you now, the others leaving.  Rolling onto your back, you take in the conversation of giant man and woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, Alfie.  Good thing you came by, though...  I wanted to apologise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?  What do you ever have to apologise for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My behaviour...  When I tried to...  Um.  You and me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Why would I mind that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have Sarah, and it's your anniversary tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to remind me.  It's so stifling...  Just for one night, I'd like a little freedom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like those two living skyscrapers are almost... embracing?  Can it be?  After all that effort you went to to 'punish' Becca for this, now Alfie himself is encouraging this extra-marital activity!  At least it seems like he's no longer interested in crushing the bug at his feet, so you're safe for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalling your fists as you stand, you feel like you should do something.  Staring up at the immense form of Alfie, you let your rage be tempered by your fear; still, you could pay him a similar visit to the ine you gave Becca, crawl onto him and somehow embarrass him as payback for this, push him back to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout that risk though, you could just climb aboard the behemeth and stick with him, let this cheater take you home with him to Sarah and the familiar house.  No need to get onto him personally, though: you could scamper back to his cubicle and mount the briefcase again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr do you need to talk with Becca again, now?  Her foot is right there too, and you could climb onto her for a discussion a little later.  If you don;t want to get between these two conspirators right now, you could just head off to her handbag, where it lies beside her empty chair.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You must stick to the shadows, and not concern yourself with what petty matters the society that you abandoned treasures so highly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you creep at the edges of the cubicle, well clear of the immense, stomping feet of both Becca and Alfie.  Who knows why they're standing so close, what they're talking about in the heights of the sky?  Who cares?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot you!  You stride purposefully out into the corridor, Alfie's cubicle just across the way, and the briefcase that will deliver you back to the house is within.  You just have to climb up inside and let the work day end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatter still thunders out here, and looking to the left you see the gigantic boots and sandals of Boots and Sandals.  They are pretty distant, but on their scale haven't walked far, and must be discussing what is going on behind you.  Such juicy gossip you could spy on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo!  What are you thinking?  You're not one of them anymore, not one of the big, powerful creatures who have so established themselves as dominant that they have nothing better to do than indulge in trivialties of relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have your survival to think on.  And turning to the right you can see a discarded coffee carton, alongside a crushed peanut packet.  Some lazy asshole dropped their rubbish here!  That's something you can look through for some supplies, and just hope that no danger comes along again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that, too, a temptation you should resist?  Play totally safe, head back to the briefcase, exit with as much grace as possible...</span></div></div>",

A perfect lesson in avoiding populated areas.  Best you keep your head down in Alfie's briefcase for now, and get transported back to a house of three giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's calm as you re-enter the man's cubicle, and stride across to the massive form of his luggage.  It takes quite a while at your size, plenty of time to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs the library itself too populated?  The unpredictable nature of the giants that frequent it poses just as big a risk as this office space.  Add to that your foolish first choice of camp space, and maybe an argument could be made for packing up from there and moving on.  Once Sarah takes you back there, why not re-locate, taking the shrinking device with you elsewhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you just getting overly fond of the small giant family?  Looking for any excuse to stay around them for longer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou creep into the dark of the briefcase's exterior, the growing hunger of your belly causing you to seek out the lunch that was packed for Alfie by his loving wife.  The loving wife whom he has just betrayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you use the blade that Becca - the very woman with whom Alfie's betraying Sarah - gave you to slice open the clingfilm, you wonder how much you should care.  The giants are both above and beneath you.  Above, due to their size and power, and beneath since their petty concerns matter not to your quest for tiny survival.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nibble away a the sandwich, the quantity you take impossible to be noticed by the giant.  He will remain oblivious, as you engorge yourself on this free meal.  Let him remain ignorant... and you should probably resist the urge to inform his wife of his misdemeanour.  It will do nothing to aid your survival chances.  Their relationship does not matter to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping and wiping crumbs away, you scuttle back to your hiding spot as a god cracks light into your dark world, his great hand reaching down to grasp the giant sandwich, to eat in a few bites what would last you months.  Your view of him is limited, but you can imagine a shit-eating grin on his face, the after-glow of his liason with Becca lighting it up.  The very thought sickens you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah has helped you so much, even in ignorance, while Becca went so far as to make you feel pity for her despite being everything you assumed she was.  Sarah deserves your pity, your love!  She deserves to know this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe briefcase clicks closed, and trapped once more in darkness, you curl up and force yourself to rest.  Cast these thoughts from your mind, lose yourself in slumber to conserve energy.  Looks like the biggest detriment to your survival chances is the same as your biggest asset: your human brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, your mind allows you to think in ways that no mere animal would, but it also has a tendency to wander, to become fixated on irrelevant matters to distract you from the important matters!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, this debate in your mind leaves you no time to rest.  By the time Alfie lifts your world on his journey home, you are running circles in your mind, and when everything thuds back to the ground again you grab up your prizes - your replacement weapon, the coffee bean, the metal - and exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack into the Gillespie household, you watch Alfie stride away, the monstrous dog leaping up to get his attention, earning a pat to the head, much scratching behind the ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a few moments to yourself. You should stow your supplies up on the stroller, but what then? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat then?</span></div></div>",

The bags of Becca's tights you keep close, far better quality than the plastic ones you've been using up til now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the backing track to your exercise, pulling yourself up to a height with a mighty load, and descending again once relieved, is the thunderous movement of giants.  They continue with their ordinary lives while you struggle with yours, and long, long minutes have passed by the time you re-enter the kitchen, timidly poking your head out to see what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog has returned to its basket, and Aflie stands by the counter, no doubt cooking dinner for the family.  How caring of him, as if that small act can make up for what you've seen him do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimmering where you stand, you watch Sarah's immense feet stomp over to her husband, no doubt putting her arms around him as she gets so close, maybe nuzzling at him from behind in appreciation.  Sure, it's their anniversary tomorrow, but she doesn't know what he <i>did</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do.  You know, but you force yourself not to care.  The lives of these giants are of concern only where they can be of benefit to your tiny survival.  Their feelings you shouldn't care for.  You can't eat their feelings, can't keep yourself warm with their emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the loverbirds to what they imagine to be their alone time, beginning your trek across the kitchen.  There will be food here soon, but only at the same time as hungry and dangerous giants whose danger will outweigh the benefit.  Better to scavenge from this area later; there will be plenty of scraps for you to pick at in the aftermath, once the room is empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, now is the time to explore a greater area of this house.  There must be treasures untold of, waiting for your keen eye to find!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vast portal to the hallway is the first step, the living room across the way, and the bedrooms further down the end.  Sarah steps over you as you cross the threshold, swiftly pounding vibrations through the ground as she walks back to the living room.  Picking yourself up, you turn to move away from these two giant-inhabited areas, down toward the bedrooms and bathroom, where you can be alone and free to steal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore rumblings ensue behind you, but you pay no attention.  Giants will be giants, and giants are noisy.  You focus on the door at the corridor's end, already running over the method you will deploy to bypass it.  You pause at one point for a brief rest, such is the length of this trip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you struggle onwards, ignoring the noises until a foot suddenly explodes right before you, heel slamming to carpet before launcing off and bearing its owner to the end of the corridor in mere seconds.  From your hands and knees, you see the being that has overtaken you stumble against the door with a crash, swivelling one eighty and laughing, clapping her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, Sarah's daughter just toddled down this corridor faster than you could walk!  Her clap is echoed, and you see the mother crouched at the other end of the hallway, encouraging the girl's stumbling, world-shaking steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear lord, the girl is going to head back again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProstrate before the child-god, you pray that she misses you with her feet.  As a two-year old, she's under three feet in height, hardly the most intimidating of creatures.  But with your own six foot three frame shrunk to three quarters of an inch, the world about you has swollen to one hundred times its normal proportion.  Thus: terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer steps are not the predictable, easily-avoided straight path of an adult, instead wavering side to side with the uncertain mind of a child.  The feet still shudder down with enough weight to annihilate you, but with no hope of predicting which way in which you should dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all is not well.  Her swift turn at the door has unbalanced her, and the towering toddler falls, her shadow swallowing you up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor shudders more than ever, but you live.  The girl looms above you, her hands planted either side.  She caught herself just in time, but her great, flabby face is right above you, her ignorant eyes widening at the sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes herself back, and you turn to run, but her clammy hand clutches around you, clapping shut like a vice.  From the shoulders up you protrude from her grip, your arms hammering helplessly against her iron-strong skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she giggles, and in the background you can hear some mild concern from Sarah at the thought of her fallen daughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get out of here.  You do have the weapon Becca gave you, and could cut away at the girl.  The pain should get her to release you, but can you bring yourself to harm a child, even one as gargantuan and dangerous as this?</span></div></div>",

You have to throw that impression from your mind, and see her as the pure destructive force that she is.  To a three-quarter inch tall man, she's a monster, a beast to be avoided if one is to survive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girl's fingers hold you tight, your own grip the blade that Becca gave you.  With all your strength, you rip it across the clammy skin of this giant, gouging through skin cells that explode into the air before your tiny eyes.  Yet once it's done, you can barely see a mark; you certainly haven't drawn blood, perhaps nothing more than merely scraped her slightly!  Wow, you're so pathetic now that you can't even hurt a child!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand around you releases, and the mouth above rips open to blast you with sound, a great scream of pain and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smack into the carpet, luckily not having been held too far above it.  You roll onto your back, watching in awe as the immense toddler above you bawls loudly enough to end the world.  Looks like her resistance to pain isn't too high at this age, and even the small scratch you gave was enough to really upset her!  Once again you must choke back the pity and guilt you feel for having hurt a two-year-old; it was necessary, as now you can get away and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mountain thuds down just above your head, and you roll away to see that a towering mass of denim has smashed down, only narrowly avoiding crushing you.  Sarah's mom-jeans-wearing knee supports the giantess as she comforts her crying daughter, and your conscience whispers that you deserved to be crushed for what you did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" you tell yourself, standing and dashing away from the two huge females, your ears followed by the sounds of one crying, and the other shushing and comforting.  \"She could have killed me.  I was only defending myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat the mantra as you move up the hallway, toward one of the open doorways, stopping as more giant feet pace toward you from within.  Four, furred feet, carrying the dog forward to stop over you.  Her head swoops down, the damp, dark nose directly before you.  A sudden exhalation knocks you onto your back again, prostrate before this great canine.  Having been ignored by the bitch for so long, you wonder why this is happening now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLips peel back, revealing gigantic teeth, and a low, rumbling growl grinds out toward you.  Is she going to eat you?  But no, a moment later the dog raises her head ahead and walks onward, stomping over you to go to the mother and daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear the delighted giggling of the girl as the dog licks at her injury, and Sarah laughing \"good dog!\".  Such a loyal creature.  Was that...  was that a warning she gave you?  A threat that she had ignored you up until now out of kindness, but if you dared to hurt the girl, there would be no mercy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould a dog be that smart?  You right yourself andf turn to look back, watching Sarah stand to her full height, effortlessly cradling the immense weight of her daughter.  \"Come on, let's get some dinner,\" she says, striding away with ground-quaking steps.  The dog pauses to look over its shoulder at you, baring her teeeth again for a second before jogging off at its master's heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly run on, into the master bedroom of this home, a bed looming above as a humungous landmark.  Yet for all the massive objects you've seen, it is the sight of a simple pair of slippers that puts you in your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch normally insignificant items, now big enoiugh to contain houses.  You don't know if they're his or hers, but the fluffy material at the toe end is something you want - it would be a comfortable substance to warm yourself with in the colder days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you're here, there's a lot of stuff to take in.  You no doubt have a few hours to spend, as the family has their dinner, and they're likely not to come back to this room until they want to sleep.  Even with hours, clambering around these giant pieces of furniture will take much of that time, so you're unlikely to be able to explore everywhere before the giants return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to start...</span></div></div>",

The front side of this cabinet is a door that can be easily opened by a regular human, but you lack the power to do so.

You eagerly advance on it, drawing your weapon as you do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharpened at one end, covered in yellow paint, the blunt end has been chewed.  This indomitable structure bears the crush marks of a god far above you, and you quiver at the thought of what those teeth would do to your pathetic form.  Still, they have weakened the structure of the wood enough to give you a start, and you set yourself to sawing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch time and much sweat is spent as you assemble a small supply of logs - or what might simply be miniscule splinters to a larger eye!  Still, you're happy with the lumber you've harvested, and pack them away in sacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only get a final inkling of how much time was lost climbing, searching and cutting as the ground shakes, the tremendous approach of the gods of this house getting closer.  Clearly they've finished their meal and evening activities, and now head to bed.  You scuttle back to behind the clock to observe them as they enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at thigh height, their sheer size is intimidating, mobile mountains that speed past like racecars.  Alfie is the first, and he passes around to the far side of the bed.  He strips down to his trunks, and you are mesmerised.  You had long ago given in to treating these regular-size humans as gods, but with the flawless physique of his chest he surely looks the part.  No wonder the asshole thinks he can get away with cheating on poor Sarah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, the wife is more demure, a long nightdress her sleeping clothing of choice.  Both titans sweep back the sheets before sliding their gargantuan weights into bed, and you can do nothing but watch, mesmerised by the spectacle.  Such power, such speed...  Your plan to leave here in three days' time is looking better all the time, as to remian in this house would be so dangerous to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie scooches closer to his wife, reaching an arm out, but Sarah bats his approach aside.  \"Cool your jets,\" she tells him.  \"Tomorrow's the anniversary, and it'll be a lot more special if we just wait a day.  'Kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe humours her husband with a kiss to his forehead, smiling as he turns away and pulls his covers tighter.  Her arms rises, fingers splaying as she reaches toward your position!  But no, her great grasp merely lifts the book and pencil, her vast might rendering those objects almost incoinsequential.  Here you are, your bags weighed down by the little slivers you collected, and she's taking the whole great lump!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her page through to find her place for a few seconds, before turning your attention to more important matters: where you're going to sleep tonight.  Staying up here may be easiest, but there's a great chance that a giant may wake before you tomorrow morning, and spot you while you're helpless!  It might be better to -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah screams, and captures your attention once more.  She is pulling the end of the pencil from her mouth, and you realise that she must have been chewing it, and got a splinter left over from your exertions stuck in her lip!  Amazing, that your pathetic self can manage to cause harm to such a behemoth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explains this to Alfie rather quickly as she rises once more.  The gust from the sheets being torn back is terrific, and you duck for cover behind the clock again.  That was close, it almost blew you off the table!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sarah slams the book back down, and the crushing impact blasts you from your feet regardless, spinning into the air helplessly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumble, but the giantess steps past you, pulling you along in the wake of her mighty motions.  You have but one hope of saving yourself as you descend, reaching out your arms to grab the thick fabric of her gown - got it!  Your already blistered palms are rent anew by the roughness of the threads, but it beats falling to your death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah continues stomping on her way, lighting her path as she goes, you swaying side to side and back and forth with every movement of her legs.  Just an insect, along for the ride!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slows to a stop - her gown continuing to swing for several perilous moments, slamming you against her rock-hard thigh - in the bathroom, reaching out to get some tweezers and lotion to deal with the piercing injury you inadvertantly dealt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess will be occupied for a little while, which gives you time to decide your own course again, however briefly.  Should you continue your journey to the ground, get away from her and hope not to be stepped on?  Or stay where you are, wait for her to walk back to the bedroom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you are rather low on her body right now; perhaps you should climb higher, get to somewhere safer, even if such motion risks you being thrown off if she begind moving before you're in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah has opened a bathroom cabinet for you; you could jump off of her onto nearby furniture, and use this rare chance to look around high ground in this most secure of rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you could concentrate purely on gathering materials right in front of you; why not cut a little of this gown for yourself, to replace your current pretty rubbish garb?  Sarah owes you now after this little incident, so why not?</span></div></div>",

The dawn of your sixth day in the company of this family, and you've finally slept with Sarah and Alfie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining in your foxhole for now, you peek out only with your head, watching the titans embrace and wish each other a happy anniversary before dressing.  Once they're done and stomping away to see their daughter, you feel safe enough to pull yourself out and look around for what you can do in their bedroom now you're left to your own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, since you've already dug into the mattress, you take a section of the lining for yourself - it was quite cosy, and should make for good bedding for your camp.  Looking around, you can see the wardrobe again, where some clothes could be salvaged.  Perhaps there's something secret stashed away under the bed that you can use.  Or even ON the bed -  looking toward the hills of the pillows, there's a great length of landscape to search through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bask in the quiet while you puzzle things out.

Looking in the direction, you see a fly buzzing its wings helplessly in the web of a spider, in a low corner of the room about knee height to a regular human, beside a cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be a chance to test yourself against an insect in battle, see if you could triumph in a relatively controlled situation,  You'll have to do it at some point, you reckon.

Your trek across to the corner is even longer, with the only sound the frantic buzzing of the doomed beast as it attempts to free itself, futilely.  You sure don't want to get yourself tangled up in the spiderweb, so you'd best tackle this smartly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hook a rope up the side of the cabinet and climb up to the fly's level.  Becca's Blade is a bit unwieldy to go swinging while also trying not to fall off a rope, so you settle for sawing at the web strings.  It's difficult to apply too much pressure, but the sharpness of the razor makes up for it, and the fly thuds to the ground far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast can't break free still, its wings held in place, and it can do little but drool and paw at the air.  You're taller than it is long, but its bulk is greater than yours, and as you close your lip involuntarily curls at its hideous visage.  Strrange, that this insect is the nearest to a peer that you've yet met at your scale, and yet all it is to you is a target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your weapon at its compound eyes, smashing one open as you carve into its head.

Wait until she's gone, and pray she doesn't want her scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could rush forward, to get out of here as quick as possible while she's got her attention fixed so far above.

Jumping the last little distance to the thick carpet, you turn to face the valley between Sarah's immense feet, naked toes rising and falling idly.  Your own bare feet skim through the dust - you really should have thought about making some slippers for yourself at some point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resist looking up the towering form of the woman as you scurry between her legs, the door leaving the bedroom mercifully wide open!  With your new selection of clothes on your back, you jog gently forward, looking forward to getting out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour exit is blocked as a great form smashes down directly ahead, dust gusting into the air in a huge cloud.  Sarah's huge heel has been brought down in your path, your brief run only half a backward step for this giant!  Coughing, you back away from that living landscape, awaiting her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she's not talking to you.  A brief glance upwards, past the vast length of leg, you see that she holds in each hand a garment, lifting them before herself for the opinion of her husband, distant at the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew, she hasn't seen you, it was merely an accidental almost annihilation!  While Alfie hums and haws, you edge your way past the wall of flesh and bone, even at a distance gasping at the heat it gives off.  Once around, you give up all subtlety and sprint flat-out for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the hallway, you ponder where to go next.  Looks like the adults will be occupied for a little longer yet, but the further the distance you travel, the more likely they are to be mobile again before you reach your destination.  So, if you head right back to the stroller to stow your clothes, you'll probably be overtaken by the fully-dressed gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearest to you is the bedroom of the child, and you haven't fully given that a look-around yet.  Next would be the bathroom, which you also haven't explored, although there's a good chance that Sarah or Alfie will visit it before too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a stop-off in the living room, again a place that you need to fully shake down for goodies.

While Sarah and Alfie dress, you begin your pilgrimage across the vastness of their home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek across the hallway is exhausting, struggling against the thick carpet fibres, expecting at each moment for a giant foot to interrupt your journey and end your life.  But no, you are left alone with your burden and your thoughts, which is to say you're very tired and very lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as you pass through the impossible portal to the living room, you espy the other half of this building's occupants: the child sits within her caged playpen, while Posey the dog stands outside, wagging her tail as she licks at outstretched fingers.  The baby chortles, but the moment you enter, the fun stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog turns her head to look at you.  She does not get any closer, does not bark or take any offensive action, yet her eyes follow you as you step forward.  Watching you, letting you know that she hasn't forgotten.  The child follows that gaze, her little hands holding the bars with a crushing power that you know all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, not intimidating at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plan to use the couch as cover from the pair, but then the elder titans enter, Alfie striding over you first before Sarah's bare feet pad in, delicate steps that could still annihilate you should you get in the way.  Fear lends speed to you, and you dash to safety under the furniture even as the two walk over to their companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down, girl!\" Alfie says.  \"This here's a fancy suit, and I've got a hot date tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hear that Sophia?\" Sarah says, finally revealing the giant toddler's name.  \"I think I'm getting jealous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two descend into lovey-dovey noises as you progress through the darkness, and you slow down again.  You're safe, they have no idea you're here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crash above, and dust showers down.  The ceiling has caved slightly, somehow supporting the massive weight of one of the giants.  Sarah, as her voice thrums through the structure:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on, these toenails aren't going to paint themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie's legs stomp around to the front of the couch, and he plops down onto a pouffe with another cacophonous impact.  Out of sight you can imagine the giant woman proffering her feet to him, and hope that should keep them occupied while you escape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scuttle to the far side, and see empty space between you and your destination in the kitchen.  You step back out into the light, and another strenuous trek awaits you.  You daren't look back for fear of seeing Posey and Sophia watching, and let the idle chatter of the adults wash over you like weather, nothing that you care for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the kitchen, wolfing down the last of the fly meat as a snack with some water from your canteen, and to the nook where the stroller lies.  You take the time to organise what you've stashed so far, to congratulate yourself on your cleverness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have your sacks, some shards of soap for cleanliness and bottles of water fro drinking, a big metal staple, a single gigantic coffee bean, a net of Becca's tights, some clothes (poor-looking in comparison to what you wear now) made from Becca's underwear, some comfortable and un-popped bubblewrap, alongside your newest acquisitions of splinter-logs, mattress lining and clothes and sleeping bag.  You're running a little short on food, but you're fairly well-set otherwise, and the other thing you might want to consider is some form of wheelbarrow or cart to enable you to transport more items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsh knocking brings your attention back to the giant world around you, and you remain in the shadows as the gods react.  \"Down, girl!\" Sarah cautions, while Alfie strides over to the door, crossing right in front of you before he opens it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on time!  Come in, Taylor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, can it be?  You peer out a little more watching as Alfie moves back to allow his visitor to enter.  Massive mustard and black sneakers bear them inside, feet far smaller than the man's.  You crane back as you look up, past a brief flash of skin before black tights follow lengthy legs up to heights, skipping past further details in your quest to see that face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe speaks before you see her mouth, and while the voice is far louder and more distant than you've ever heard, you recognise it immediately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mr Gillespie!  You're looking very smart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door sams shut and she walks on to joon everyone else in the main room.  That was Taylor Anderson, the eighteen-year-old girl whose family lives next door to you!  Well, you lived next door to them back when you were six feet two and a quarter inches taller than you are now.  When you were deliberating over where to carry out your shrinking experiment, the Anderson residence was one option.  Mainly because you'd been too lazy to travel far!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd planned to break in, shrink yourself to an eighth of an inch and survive amongst them.  Now knowing how difficult three quarters of an inch is, being six times smaller again would have been a terrible idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you look longingly after Taylor as she interacts with the other giants.  She's a link to your past, a familiar face now rendered into a terrifying monster by this disparity in scale.  She must be here to babysit while Alfie and Sarah go spend their saturday night celebrating their anniversary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat means they must live close by.  Taylor doesn't drive, so at worst this house must be a short bike journey from where she lives.  From where you lived.  If you wanted, you could latch onto her, and go home with her, and see your old place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, why not have a night out yourself with Sarah and Alfie, experience some of the high life, get some quality food in a night off from survival?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany are the temptations whirling through your mind now...</span></div></div>",

Then the whole monster is hefted into the air, as an even vaster being lifts her as easily as you are trapped.  \"Let Mommy kiss it better,\" Sarah booms, and now you cling tight to the child as she is whisked upward, her mother standing to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah begins walking, and you are trapped in the hand of a girl held in the arms of her mother.  Humbling, and somewhat terrifying: where is this going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food's up!\" Alfie shouts, and your question is answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are borne back into the kitchen by these gods, although you can't turn enough in this grip to see the path ahead of you.  Instead, you just grip tight and hope for the best.  The child is lifted higher, then brought down, and your blood is slammed all around within you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your head back across, you see the child seated, and above, the looming form of her gargantuan father.  He leans over, placing a gigantic bowl in front of her, resounding loudly on the feeding platform of her high chair.  Then the hand finally releases, cold air rushing past you as you plummet to the platform yourself, hitting it hard enough to smash all the air out of your lungs.  Gasping, you look up to see - and hear - the girl smashing her palms together in glee at the meal before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeding time.  And you remember how well things went last time you tried stealing her food?  Looking around, you can see that the adults are seated as well, their own plates of steaming food before them, scents tantalising your nose.

Even should it begin rotting, there's enough of it that you should be able to find still-succulent sections no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stripping of the edible hill takes longer than you imagined, and the rising of the giantess reminds you that you don't have unlimited time.  She steps back to her place, shading you with her bulk, and snatches up the tupperware container of chicken with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she takes it to the fridge, you breathe a sigh of relief at having dodged that fate.  She'll soon be back for the tomato - still a mound of discarded produce, which you have made an almost insignificant dent in - and so you move backward, piling what you've managed to scavenge into your sacks.  A little damp, but nutritious and tasty for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon the gargantuan hand of Mrs Gillespie descends, crushing finger and thumb effortlessly plucking up the pathetic remains of the tomato, whisking it heavenwards with the merest effort.

She covers distances in moments that would take you minutes, and could hold you and all your weighty supplies in the palm of one hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of those hands descends now, throwing you from your feet as it lifts the chopping board beneath you, lifting your world, and you along with it!  You slam against the hard plastic, and raise your head to witness a dreadful sight you had hoped never to witness again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piece of kitchen towel, vast enough to cover a house, backed by the phenomonal power of the woman's fingers and thumb.  Of her other hand, all you can see is the thumb, its titanic majesty paling as it presses down on the floor beneath you, dwarfing you in mass and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloth sweeps down to wipe away any tomato juice or seeds, and once again you are swept up with the woman's zeal.  Held tight within her crushing embrace, you find yourself unable to even struggle, gasping for air a the thick paper towel tears at your exposed skin.  How could one man suffer this same fate more than once?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour prison is crumpled in the fist of the goddess, and luck alone can be the only explanation for how your three-quarter inch self is not annihilated in her grasp; not that it's good luck that got you into this situation in the first place!  She's clearly not that bothered, and as the pressure is relieved on you, gravity takes its place as you fall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're grateful for the paper, as it cushions your landing in the bin.  Your blade cuts an exit, and in the dark you can breathe a sigh of relief, although doing so sucks in foetid air, redolent with the decay of whatever waste you're sharing this space with.  Oh, to have had the foresight to bring a light source with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing as you do that the bin collection has only recently passed, you can't hope for rescue through that means any time soon.

At this rate, perhaps you'll reach your promised land just in time to collapse asleep again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, salvation!  Ahead of you, on the carpet, lies a boulder, bigger than your head.  It smells good.  Sparing a glance for the giant currently dominating the aisle, browsing some titles, you creep closer and note that it is a crumb, most likely of some baked good.  A little hard, but in your condition you tear at it ravenously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother crashes to the ground, and you realise that the person - man or woman, you don't know - ahead of you is snacking on something while they browse!  It's not the most nourishing fare, but you could stay here for a while to see how much in the way of supplies you could collect, or you could just use that new energy charge you've gotten to forge on ahead to the break room - every moment you spend out here is another one you'll have to pay for in sleep!</span></div></div>",

It was out of reach but not unobtainable using your mind you brought a stick over to the wall climbed up it and plugged in recharging the drone.

She was a slightly heavier women but not obese under it all she had it were it was most appreciated big round butt and large breasts. She looked like she was in her mid thirties and she was whistling and chatting to the cow she was milking. You leaped off the raptors which to you was like hundreds of feet into a pile of hay sinking deep within the pile. However the sound you made was enough to arouse suspicion from the milk maid.

And most of them are almost buried by the untrimmed grass - the place is pretty overgrown, and you suspect it doesn't get a lot of care.  The perfect place for an unseen landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrack!  A drone's fan stops working, and you're going down!  You clamber across the machine, looking for how you can fix it, and see a cannonball embedded in its wing, having torn through vital mechanisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not a cannonball...  You're three-quarters of an inch tall!  That's just a ball bearing, fired from a bb gun, not a cannon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt makes little difference as you crash into the garden, your drone whining as it bounces before drawing to a halt, its remaining fans sputtering and dying.  Well, looks like your landing zone has been chosen for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't no-one spyin' on my property with a god-damn drone!\" someone shouts, and you can feel the shudders through the ground of approaching footsteps.  That kinda solves the mystery of the shooter, but doesn't decide what you should do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could stick with the drone, hide under it and let the giant carry you away when they pick it up.  A chance of being spotted, but hopefully they're not that observant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could run into the long grass, hide until the shooter goes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why stay here at all?

Arms above your head, you look across at the retracting boot, and the giant wearing it.  With her shoes on the furniture, she's clearly not too caring of what others think, emphasised by the trashy, rebellious clothing draped over her form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud bang heralds the popping of her pink bubblegum, before she drags the remains back inside her mouth to be crushed between her teeth some more.  Once revealed, you can see the details of her teenage face, and realise that Mabel can't have been much older when she gave birth to this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This fuckin' place.  I hate it here...\" she mumbles, looking back to her phone again, unaware of the three-quarter inch man sharing the couch with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now,\" her mother says, stepping closer and throwing you into her shadow, \"don't be glum, Dahlia.  We all love this family, don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not too sure about that.  Do you want to spend your time surviving inside this place, with these people?

If that happens, you won't have to drag your drone all the way to the garage and could be fixing there all night. Your eyes then looked at Mabel again and feel disappointed that you still won't be getting close to her just yet. Hopefully if you get back to the living room in time, you could finally get the chance you always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the gigantic kitchen and see what looks like pieces of food from earlier that were scattered around the dining table; it looks like they haven't clean up just yet. You go straight under the table and look around the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you were pieces of rice, chicken, beans, corn, and many more. As much as you like how everything around here is so messy for you to use during your survival, you kinda wonder if this family ever care about cleaning up their home. Oh well, you're not complaining or anything as long as there's free food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the pieces of food and eat them up. All of them were pretty stale from being on the floor for too long, but at least there still edible to eat (though they were pretty hard to chew due to being dry). After filling up your tummy, you put the remaining ones in your backpack just in case your hunger comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that your ready, you can now go back and go see Mabel at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Hey, maybe you could even learn her routine, get the layout of the house, and earn much more valuable information to enhance your survival odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you charge toward the huge heel of the maid's shiny shoe, crossing the fine carpet while she runs the vacuum back and forth under a table at the room's centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plain working shoes have a very low heel to them, yet still your three-quarter inch self finds the form increasingly intimidating as you get closer.  You're not even as tall as this woman's foot!  She takes a step back and brings her weight smashing down right in front of you.  You slam into the leather surface and collapse, trembling at the thought of her moving more and finishing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, she's merely stooping to allow the vacuum to get further under the table, squatting low.  You take the chance offered, gripping at tiny imperfections and dents to pull yourself upwards.  As your hands reach the top of you shoe, you thank heaven that her uniform includes stockings: were you to grab her skin, she'd feel you for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you drag yourself up with the thick threads of those stockings, your feet balancing on the ledge of her shoe's heelside rim.  No chance to get too comfortable as she stands up, and your dangerous journey begins.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning, she steps slowly, yet each time she raises her foot you are threatened with falling from her.  At the moment, she's taking no more than one step at a time, but once she gets to walking at a steady rate, this will only get more treacherous.  Now is the time to secure yourself better.</span></div></div>",

It's obvious you can't stay here any longer, sooner or later, you are highly going to fall off at some point. You need to get much higher-up just be safe. Of course, trying to climb up her body is also very dangerous and might fall off along the way, but it's the only way to get a safer perch on this maid. So with that, you were going to do it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing stockings as you already noticed it before which makes it easier for you to climb up her leg plus it stretch all the way up her knee so that you can go grab onto her skirt since it's nearby. Now that you already made your plan, it's time to get climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou again grab onto the stocking and began your journey up. The threads were thick enough to make things easier as they could support your weight. It didn't took too fast however, as the maid walks around which makes it very difficult to hold on; the most simple walking is like climbing a mountain during an earthquake. You try to hold on as much as you can; who knows when will you fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you successfully reached the end of the maid's stocking and just like you expected, there was the hem of her skirt hanging over it. You focus carefully as you want to make sure you time it perfectly. After a few seconds, you make a leap for the skirt and managed to grab on to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" You shouted as you nearly slipped your fingers there. You grasp the bottom of her dress uniform as hard as you can since you were being swayed back and fourth while she walks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud sound of her vacuum finally stops as she's finally finished with the floor. Is it over now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really, she picks up a feather duster and walks to the book shelves; she was now going to clean them. As she begans her work, you were now caught in the middle of a strong dust storm that was enough to blind your eyes. Coughing, you realized that you definitely need to take cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed something on her apron that can help you; it was one of her pockets. Unfortunately, it's in the severe zone as it was closer to the shelf. You wanted to go higher as quickly as you can, but you're not sure if you can make it in time. You could wait here until her hand comes near you for you to grab on and get lifted to a higher level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

The distance to the door is hard to gauge but you think you can make it while the maid is busy cleaning the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start your trek to the door.  Luckily, the carpet is not tall enough to significantly slow your speed.  It was a very interesting, walking across a carpet has become a serious task.  Something you used to do every day without any consideration.  Thinking about your situation, you realized you would need to set up a source of food and water.  Maybe taking up residence in the kitchen or nearby would be the best idea.  Although, the kitchen carries other scary risks like being eaten or killed due to the higher traffic of giants.  Something to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about half way to the door when you checked on the maid's progress.  To your abject horror the maid was no longer vacuuming on the opposite side of the study, instead she was pushing the vacuum at breakneck speeds right at you.  You wish it felt like slow motion but unfortunately life didn't work that way.  The maid was on you in seconds and you had barely moved an inch.  The vacuum was approaching your direction and it was clearly going to pass over you.  If you didn't get out of the way right now you would be sucked into the vacuum with all the dirt, dust, and other discarded nastiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was not the time for thinking, now was the time for action.

You're so close to making it.  A shadow over takes you as you make a final mad leap forward in hopes it carries you out of the way.  You crash down on your back, still feeling the ever increasing suction.  As the noise becomes deafening, you feel a horrendous pain in you legs as the front wheel of the vacuum runs over you.  You scream in raw agony as everything below your thighs are utterly obliterated by the front right wheel.  Before you can process anything else, the rear wheel runs over your legs again.  The vacuum pulls at your body harshly, but the blood and remnants of your legs have become stuck to the carpet, preventing you from being pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vacuum continues past you, a second shadow over takes you.  You look upwards, body frozen in shock and pain, and look at the maid who has ended both your adventure and life.  She stands over you, from your perspective she might as well have been miles tall.  She's still humming you realize.  She just destroyed your legs and she's still happily humming away as she pushes the vacuum forward.  She didn't even realize.  Why would she though?  She is just doing her job, and why would she notice or even care that she ran over a bug.  And isn't that all you are now?  By your own actions you turned yourself into a bug.  Into nothing.  Her mary janes crash on top of you.  But you weren't dead, unfortunately.  You were between the sole of her shoe and the elevated heel.  Quickly as it occurred, the maid stepped off of you and continued forward.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou were left on the carpet, legless, bleeding, and soon to be dead.  Your vision was fuzzy as you watched the maid continue cleaning.  God she was pretty, you thought.  Her soft brown eyes studied the floor for any specks to clean.  Her french outfit hugged her curves perfectly and the way she moved.  She moved with a sway in her hips that wiggled her cute ass as she semi-danced to the song she hummed.  She probably didn't even realize she was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the vacuum shut off.  The maid looked around the room, studying the floor making sure she got everything.  She smiled the most beautiful smile you have ever seen as she appreciated her work.  That was until her gaze fell upon you.  The smile disappeared as she took a step towards you.  She continued to hum as she approached.  You couldn't even beg as she walked forward slowly.  It was almost like she was taunting you.  The little speck which refused to be cleaned.  That didn't matter to her, she might have missed it the first time, but she would make sure that whatever the red splot was, it would be gone before she left this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls a cloth out of her back pocket as she stands over you, dominating your world with her presence.  You made eye contact with the maid, barely conscious and fading fast.  You look into each other eyes for what feels like forever.  Maybe she recognized you?  No.  She didn't.  You were nothing.  Hell, you didn't even have a human shape anymore.  Lying in a pool of your own blood you were utterly unrecognizable.  The maid bent at her hips, her slim stomach and medium sized breasts overtaking your sky, bringing the cloth down towards you.  The cloth increased in size as it got closer, eventually completely blocking off sight of the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made contact pushing you into the unforgiving floor as you once again screamed in agony.  You could feel her finger poking you through the cloth, exploring your little body.  You could feel a faint heartbeat even through the cloth.  You wondered what it would feel like if she touched you directly.  But the maid had no interest in actually touching you.  You were a gross spot on the floor.  And she was hired to make gross spots like you disappear.  The pressure from the cloth increased tenfold as the maid began to twist her wrist back and forth in an attempt to get you out of the carpet.  In no time at all, your body was destroyed and absorbed into the cloth like any common fluid, leaving a small red stain which would be washed out later that day.  The maid brought the cloth away from the floor, looking over the carpet where you once were.  She nodded satisfied with her cleaning, once again showing her pearly white teeth in her perfect smile.  Another room cleaned.  Without even looking at the cloth, she stuffs it into her rear pocket, where whatever chunks that were left of your corpse dropped to the bottom of the pocket to be even further obliterated every time she sat down or her outfit stretched around her generous rear when she bent forward.</span></div></div>",

Looking down, you see city hall.  That would be an interesting choice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou imagined seeing all the giants and giantess\u2019 going around and trying to deal with political issues, as you listened from down below.  There was one politician in particular that you liked too.  You couldn't remember her name, but she was so young and beautiful.  It would be quite the adventure living around her!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking more, you spotted a nearby library.  That would be. . really really hard for you to survive.  With no way of obtaining food, you\u2019d need to eat bugs, or even just skin from the patrons.  Maybe some librarians would have some snacks.  You remember seeing one of them bring a cake through there once, so maybe there was a stash in the back.  It was so risky, yet. . it could work too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother area was a cool looking neighborhood.  It wasn't exactly the most. . urban place. . but hey.  It could be interesting living around a little neighborhood.  Working your way throughout the system.  The big question would be if you stayed outside or inside.  You scratched your chin as you thought about it.  There was a forest around too. . but forget about it.  That place looks crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese places, while interesting, were not really very \u2018urban\u2019 at all.  They didn't really fall in line with the objective that you had set for yourself.  They probably would lead to some pretty exciting adventures, but you wanted some true \u2018urban\u2019 living.  It would be the ultimate test of evolution, surviving in a totally different kind of environment.  Braving the elements that man had made for themselves. . a true testament to the urban experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two places that you thought would fit that mission well.  First, was the downtown area.  People, animals, and bugs were everywhere, so there was plenty of obstacles.  There was also a ton of food and water.  Leaky water manes, restaurants, people walking around with food, and even those food trucks would lead to a million possibilities on where you could establish yourself.  The evenings would be particularly interesting.  With all those parties happening all the time, you'd have some nice music to listen to. . as well as some pretty crazy people walking around drunk all the time.  It would work nicely and be a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched people scurry about more, you noticed a pretty Hispanic woman walking down a set of stairs into a train stop.  Of course!!  How much more urban could you get there!!  That one might work out better too, because at a train stop, you\u2019d have an absolute ton of people passing by daily, but they\u2019d also be bringing food with them.  You knew that the train stations had water faucets. . most of the time leaky due to the laziness of the city.  Better still, they kept it kind of clean there, so you wouldn't have to deal with animals or that many bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over. . you decided to go towards. . . <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The streets were lined with establishemts ranging from restaurants to food markets and much in between. Of course since your goal was to live off the resources of your surroundings, a building that contained a plethora of food would be ideal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing to take note of, was that this was a very busy town and the foot traffic on any given day would be insanity to one such as yourself. As long as you kept to your senses and stayed careful you should be fine, but its just something to remember. Last thing you wanted was to be a glob of mush under someones shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pilot the drone closer to the ground, (still hovering a small distance above the roofs of the buildings), and prepare to make your final destination decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left, was as most of the customers of this place would call it, a 'charming little food establishment' called Ciboulette. You had eaten here once. It served as a coffee/pub house, open all hours of the day and served mostly vegan options. Normally, this would turn you away, evident by you only eating here the one time. However, it may not be a bad idea to eat a little healthier if you plan on living the rough life for awhile. It had a patio in front of it that jutted out into the sidewalk, and there appeared to be a group of young women sitting together at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the right of the street, right across Ciboulette, was a fairly sized food market. Now THIS place was obviously stacked with food! Nourishment wouldnt even factor as difficult to find here at all. The shelves would provide brilliant means of staying out of sight, exploring the market, avoiding stomping feet and grabbing a bite whenever you felt like it. Although getting past the packaging all the time would be a pain, and if the store got enough complaints of customers buying food with torn packing and pieces missing from it then they might call exterminators or lay out traps themselves. You were by no means as dumb as a pest, but in this scenario... you were definitely acting like one. And all it would take is one slip up to end up being stuck in a glue trap or something.</span></div></div>",

You take the drone down farther until without about as much subtlety as a buzzing drone can manage, you land it softly on top of the frame of the open veranda, positioned above the patio and overtop the customers. For now, you were going to leave the drone up here. It would impossible to drive it into the building without someone noticing and chasing you down, so this was as good a spot as any to keep it safe and out of immediate sight for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you couldnt use the drone to get you inside, and finding a way to ground still made you uncomfortable due to the waiters going in and out constantly... so you needed to come up with a plan you felt happy with, ideally before a hungry bird finds you up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to multitask, scan the skies and come up with the gameplan. Your backpack had a nice range of tools and supplies, though nothing that would help you out with vetting down from a height like this. Luckily, you saved the real heavy duty stuff for the drone to carry. You reach your hand down the side of the machine and lift the attached duffel bag from its position. You thanked yourself for your forethought and level of preparation, as this large bag plus the one on the adjacent side of the drone kept many useful tools to keep your puny self alive such as a crowbar, hatchet, first aid kit, an EXPENSIVE lifestraw, and the tool that would be helping you out here and now, two big ol' bundles of rope that had a combined total length of 200 feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hugged the heavy yoga ball sized bundles to your chest, and carefully dismounted off the drone onto the veranda. With a loud thud you slammed the bundles down with your hands ontop of them and peered over the edge of the veranda, way way down to the occupied table below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced. \"Damn... will this even be enough rope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell. Perhaps vertigo from being at such an altitude was throwing off your depth perception but... it looked like your standing on top of a mountian... with even more living mountains below this one!<br>\r\nSheesh... loud living mountains by the sound of it. These women could shatter glass with their laughter. The spooky part was, it looked like most of the commotion was coming from one girl! A gorgeous blonde wearing a straw sunhat, grey long sleeved shirt and denim short shorts. The vibes you got from her were rich, snotty and obnoxious. It was a wonder her friends, (who all seemed to be more polite about their behaviour in public), could stand to be around her. They all appeared to be women in their mid twenties. And god were they all gorgeous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thats not the matter at hand right now. Right now it was time to get down to the plan, which was to get down there with them, wait for a server to arrive, then hitch a ride into the building and find a spot to set up camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only issue was with this rope,... should you go through the trouble of unraveling it, tying ends together and tossing it down only for its length to be too short? Maybe it was best to just try your luck with the drone taking you closer to the ground and just walking inside yourself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Judging the height down to the table was pretty difficult, but 200 feet of rope... that had to be enough, right? Whether it was or not, it was worth a try. Getting into that restaurant was imperative to living your survival fantasy and this was the safest way you could think of doing it, so long as you play it safe, slow and nobody spots you and thinks your a creepy arachnid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" you thought. \"Maybe I should have just shrunk myself in the bathroom of this place and took it from there.... no... I wanted an adventure, now I got it. Time to grow some balls pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith steady hands you grip onto one end of the rope on a single bundle and boot it off the ledge. You watch as it simultaneously plummets and unravels through the air until it finally straightens fully out and sways back and forth in the air. It covered a good distance from what you could tell. Perhaps the second bundle would be enough to cover the leftover. You tie the the rope to the second bundle with your best constrictor knot, grab onto the opposite end and toss it over the edge. The two seperate ropes combine to form a super rope thats so long you cant even tell where the bottom is. You anchor the rope around one of the drones propeller bases and step to the edge of the veranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositive thoughts flow through your head. \"This should do... time to get to it. Just a quick trip down a... long... long drop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs steady as you possibly could, you began descending down the rope like you were in some kind of spy film down to the table. It was pretty tiring and after about 10 minutes you were nearly there. Unfortunately, the closer to the bottom you got, the more you realized the rope didnt quite make it to the table, instead it hovered slightly above the head of one of the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you picked up from their conversations as you went down, this woman was probably named Jessica though you werent a hundred percent positive as you werent exactly focusing on their chatting. You loop the rope around your boot and use it as a foothold to alleviate some of the strain on your muscles as you dangled their in the air for a much needed break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasnt going to plan. The only way to get off this rope now was to get onto this Jessica woman and that was something you didnt know if you were prepared for. To be this small on a human being, like a bug, their body now an entire landscape to you! Your drop off point was going to have to be somewhere on her head from the looks of things. Picturing what a human scalp would look like from your view, ...what it would be like to wander around in this womans black hair like it was a forest. Or to walk on her skin... she was tanned, like a bronze gold tan, so she must be warm to the touch, especially on a sunny day like today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was creepy to think, but it gave you jitters. You hated the sound of that word, but it seemed to sum up your feelings perfectly. After all, aside from her gigantic form, she was also very beautiful. All these women were overwhelmingly intimidating to you, but she stuck out to you. Out of her friend group here, (atleast from what little you observed) she seemed to be the most reserved, laid back, cheerful, friendly... all the qualities that you would find endearing in a partner... but you were getting ahead of yourself. Right now, you just needed to get down to the end of this rope and leap onto her body before someone swats you out of the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release your foot from the rope loop and start once again on shinnying down the rope. The blonde woman; the loud one, was getting mighty expressive with her storytelling as she revelled in the attention her friends gave her, as in waving hands, looking up, down and all around. She was having fun telling a story about what you gathered to be about an ex-boyfriend and what she referred to as, 'the gear shift incident'. Apparently there was a mishap during a fuck session in the unfortunate mans car seat, but that didnt matter. What mattered was her mannerisms. Her eyes tending to look upwards whenever she recalled her ex's stupidity, which actually put you directly in her point of view! If she was more attentive, she may end up spotting you and mistaking you as a spider or something. Which ofcourse would most likely mean your death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Jessica was very close now. A little further down and you would be able to safely drop onto her soft head of hair.</span></div></div>",

You release your grip on the rope and land with a thud in the sea of black hairs atop Jessica's scalp, vanishing from the blonde womans sight for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on your gut, clinging to strawberry scented strands that suspend you above the surface level of her hair. Your measly weight wasnt enough to even break through upon your landing, which you were thankful for,... having to blindly navigate your way out of a womans hair was not on your to do list. What was a priority, was finding a way into that restaurants doors. Your initial idea that brought you here in the first place, was to get to a position that would allow you the possibility of hitching a ride on a server as they enter the building... but things hadnt quite gone according to plan. For instance, that gamble you took on the rope being low enough to get you straight down to table... well, hadnt quite panned out.

Learning from mistakes would come later, but first, you needed to keep your composure and figure out what to do once you were inside this woman's mouth, because at this point it was inevitable. The thick, gooey substance that was the dip, kept you trapped on the carrots surface, slowing your movements down to much to able to break completely free in time. Therefore, you would need to be ready, for only teeth mashing this carrot apart would do the trick. Obviously, that was incredibly risky. You would need to be very lucky and hope you wouldn't end up directly beneath a tooth once the chewing began. The combination of breaking apart the carrot, and the humidity of her breath, would no doubt liquefy the dip enough for you to be free, then you would have to improvise from there to avoid being swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had just lifted you past your breasts, and you watched as the face that towered above you, grew closer and closer until she took up your entire field of vision, bringing you so close to her opening mouth, that you could already feel the heat from inside washing over you. Doing your best to calm yourself, you desperately scan the inside of the woman's massive maw, for possible areas to make a mad dash towards one you were (hopefully) free! You make a mental list of possible choices,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you took interest in the space behind her molars in her bottom row of teeth. It was uncomfortably close to the back of her throat, but if you could manage to hold on to the molar, you would at least be safe from getting crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was the possibility of wedging yourself between her gums and lip. You would be surrounded by slick surfaces that would be difficult to climb when you would need to get out, but again, it would keep you from being crushed under teeth and decrease your chance of being swallowed, as long as you don't cause an irritation and make her force you out with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, the uvula. That would be the absolute last resort. It would be incredibly difficult to cling onto due to its slimy texture, you would be dangling above the long drop into her stomach, and not to mention you weren't tall enough to reach it on your own! You would need to leap from a piece of carrot or something to be able to reach it and latch yourself on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plans weren't perfect, but they were the best you could come up with in such a short amount of time before you were deposited into this oblivious woman's body. You were so close that were now passing under her nose, a mere centimeter away from entering her mouth! From this distance, you could now truly experience just how high the temperature was in there, as a powerful wave of heat blasted over your body, blowing your hair back and warming your skin like you had just spent an hour on a beach in summer. You looked along the front of the carrot as a shadow began to crawl up its surface towards you, as you were brought further into her mouth, passing her lips and hovering above her large pink tongue. You were now inside and could already notice the humidity doing the trick on weakening the dips hold on you! You broke your arms free of its hold and turned to look behind you, just in time to watch her top row of teeth descend down onto the carrot and snap it in half with a deafening *CRUNCH*, closing her mouth and blackening out your vision in darkness. Quickly, taking advantage of the fact you haven't been freed of the dip yet, you plunge your hand into dip and dig around at your waist until you were able to grab onto your headlamp in one of your pouches. You secure it to your head and flick it on, watching with amazement as its beam of light illuminates the inside of the cavernous mouth, glimmering in saliva coated walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like riding a very large kayak in raging rapids, as the young woman's tongue pushed the carrot all around into teeth that continually broke it apart into smaller pieces. Eventually, your area of the carrot was demolished in all this carnage as well, releasing you from the dip and dropping you right onto the center of the squishy, bumpy tongue! You struggled to keep yourself in place as bits of carrot rushed past you and the tongue squirmed underneath your feet! You had to make your move towards a safer area of the mouth now and wait out this chaos! But which one was closest?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't matter to you if there was a God or not, you silently praised and thanked the lord as you frantically scooped globs of dip off of you and freed yourself from it. Now you found yourself balancing precariously on the slippery surface of this cylindrical vegetable, unsure of what your next move should be. The woman was still busy chatting with her friends at the friendly young server, but you also noticed that two of them already had their meals in front and he was just about to lay this woman's plate down in front of her! Time was running out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a lot you could do to get off this carrot safely, but looking behind you, you saw the woman's thumb and forefinger gripping onto the end of the baby carrot. Beyond that, you peered over the side of the carrot and followed her arm down to her bent elbow resting on the table miles below you. Aside from the white fitbit she wore on her wrist, her exposed skin should mean you could just slide all the way down easily enough. If you run up to those fingers, then make your way down her arm, you would be able to get on the table and finally escape this madness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite end, you were within jumping distance to this woman's chest area. Her low cut tank top meant you may be able to land directly on her breasts like cushions, or even if you ended up landing around her collarbone, you could try and grab onto her silver necklace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the waiter was setting her plate onto the table! Time was officially out! Time to make a decision!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you step off the bus with the handful of vacationers who rode with you, you realize that this will be the last time in a while that you can feel these things at full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step onto the sand.  It's a bit hot, but it's still early enough to walk on.  You set your beach bag down, and start digging into it.  While most of the people here packed for a nice day at the beach, you packed for desert survival.  First things first, you pulled out what you called \"The Contingency Plan.\"  It looked like a simple black box, but it was actually one of the most powerful size altering devices ever made.  Of course, when it's also the first size altering device ever made, that's an easy claim to make.  You set a timer on it for fifteen minutes.  That's how long until it shrinks you.  Then, you set another timer for 6:00 tomorrow morning.  That way, if day one convinces you that this plan is complete garbage, you'll be able to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bury the box under some sand so no one'll find it.  Standing up, you close the bag and walk over to a nice, deserted spot in the middle of the beach.  It's far enough from the ocean that high tide won't touch it, and it's in the middle of sharp shells and rocks so no one will step on you.  You settle down into the spot and wait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd wait some more.  Maybe fifteen minutes was too long.  You decide to take inventory of what you have.  Five bottles of sunscreen, to help prevent sunburns while your skin is still pale and unused to the sun; a canteen to carry water; flint and steel; cookwear designed for camping; a sun hat; and of course a sword.  You've taken courses on how to wield it, so finding food and fighting predators shouldn't be too difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've killed some serious time now.  Only a minute left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. 4. 3. 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like a good place to set up.  Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1!  Wait, what was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body goes numb as it is being reformed.  Slowly, your senses come back online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmell hasn't changed.  Neither has touch or taste.  However, as sound comes back online, you hear voices.  Loud voices from not too far away.  It's too hard to tell who's making them, since these ears might as well be new.  You'll need to see who is ruining your plan, but testing showed that vision always took the longest to come back online, since the eyes needed a lot of work to use light of a different wavelength.  As the blurring clears, you see...</span></div></div>",

While the boy and the girl are running to the water, you watch the mother and father begin to lay down on their towels with beach bags posted in between them. You figure that there has to be food and water in there so you start your trek past home sized shells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple seem to be miles away and the sand is much harder to walk on at this size. It is like walking on many pebbles but they are all uneven and shifty under your footsteps. The smell of the ocean water is very strong at your tiny size and the overwhelming sun is starting to test your will. It takes almost half an hour but soon you make it to the giants on their towels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is hot outside but the sight makes you quiver. The giant couple's feet towered up in the sky like city buildings. Wrinkles that seemed deep enough for you to use as handholds lined up the perfect soles speckled with grains of sand. Their long toes were easily large enough to crush cars. The guy's feet were noticeable larger than the woman's but she could easily set her little toe on top of your one fourth of an inch tall body and make you into paste without even noticing. You couldn't even see their faces from this point of view but you could make out the beach bag looming above if you go past the titanic feet in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by the heels causes you to hold your breath. At any moment either of them could slightly shift their enter foot or lift it up to place it to the side and easily snuff out your insignificant life but luckily they are completely still aside from an occasional toe wiggle. With you passing their feet, you can now see down the couple's impossibly long legs at both sides of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a long walk from past the calves and knees until the world starts to shift under you and a shadow is cast over you. Believing you are about to be squished on top of the pebbly sand below, you put your hands over your face in a useless shielding maneuver and look up to see the giant man's arm pass over you and he grabs the beach bag's handles with his godlike hand and lifts the several ton bag into the air to move it to his other side. Then the man lets his arm crash back down, his hand landing next to you causing a displacing wind to blow you against the giant woman's arm. Her skin is soaked with some kind of sun tan lotion and you land on it with a squelching squish before bouncing off and back onto the sand. The tanning liquid now coated your back. Besides nearly wetting yourself, you are just fine but now the beach bag is at the whole opposite side! However the woman's purse remained in-between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing around the man would take forever to reach the beach bag and by the time you get there the man might move it again however you could climb up his trunks for a quicker route. The woman's purse might have items as well. Although you can't imagine it containing a lot of food, you can imagine that there will be useful items in there. The purse has a smooth and unclimbable exterior, however, but the straps of it are contacting her stomach. Perhaps you can climb her and walk up the purse straps to get in the purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...</span></div></div>",

No matter how desirable the contents of the beach bag, it's well out of your reach, over an unknown stretch of hostile territory.  The purse though, that's in direct sight, and only a short climb to get to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the woman could pick it up at any time, you think to yourself as you stride closer.  But then, between two giants as you are, any moment one of them could stand up or roll over and crush you, so worrying about the actions of the gods is about as productive as trying to halt the tides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay a hand on the skin of the woman's side, bringing it away sticky with the same tanning lotion coating your back.  Not the most trusty climbing surface.  Pressing both palms hard and high against the wall of goo-coated flesh, you pull, lifting yourself, getting those feet in place as well.  With a little practice, you manage some upward motion; as long as you don't make movements too sudden, you can 'slide' through the lotion, allowing its powerful suction against your puny form to keep you steady against the surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts slow going, no lie, but you're soon atop the stomach, where standing upright becomes a struggle against the power of the lotion.  By this point you're pretty much coated in it, spitting gobs from your mouth.  You're probably not going to burn up, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being so much higher than you were before, your vantage doesn't give you a better look at the lay of the land.  To the south, those mighty feet, still intimidating at a leg's distance.  Opposite, hills obscure a face.  Timing your steps with the rising motions of the breaths the giant is taking in, you move across her toward the strap of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat wonders could lie within? you ask yourself as you approach the strap.  Surely enough supplies to allow for the outfitting of a modest initial camp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your hand makes contact with the strap to pull the rest of you up, you realise your mistake.  There is a loud slurping noise as your feet pop free of the quicksand-like lotion, but once you are atop the strap, that same lotion becomes slippery against the material, and standing upright proves impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not too late to cut your losses and get away before anything goes wrong, just climb down the woman and back to the sand.  But you're so close!  You could perhaps just scrape some of the lotion off yourself if you spent a little time, and then the purse could still be yours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why stop there!  Why not climb toward those distant hills, and explore this new landscape while you can!</span></div></div>",

Every step and action that you take will cost you energy and with no reliable food source or even drinkable water, every move that you take has to have a reward at the end. To do this travel for absolutely no reason now would be horribly inefficient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use your hands to shovel off as much of the thick, cream colored goo as possible. The stuff covered your desert fatigues, tan boots and camouflaged light jacket like a chunky clay. After a moment of brushing at the coating, you have a pool of it surrounding your feet. A fine layer of lotion coats your body, especially your hands, but you feel comfortable enough to continue on with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the strap proves tiring. The strap itself is so thick and wide that it is like being on a road but unfortunately this road goes on a steep, uphill slope. Several times you almost slip from your slippery boots on top of the leathery material. About halfway up, you look back to have an even better view of the goddess you climbed from. From your position on the purse strap, you can gaze upon the flat plain of stomach up to  the peaks of the woman's Mount Olympus sized breasts that you are level with although they are seemingly miles away. You can just barely see the giantess's face from beyond the twin peaks. Her beautiful but colossal face laying down while sunglasses shade her eyes. A light breeze makes her blonde hair flow slightly while to you it is a gust that you are just barely able to withstand. This snaps you from your sightseeing so you can get focused on the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an arduous journey it is but finally you make it to the very edge of the purse. The top of the purse is pressed together for a thin opening but to you it is more of a canyon-like crevice instead of a gaping mass below. Because of this, the sunlight doesn't reveal much for you to be able to make out below. It's just a massive, black void and you can only guess what items are below. With your flash light, you will be able to make things out better but you doubt the light will reveal much from up here. You just need to find a way to get down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so busy standing at the very edge and looking down that you are caught completely off guard by an invisible force pushing your back with incredible power! Another gust of wind! The oils of the lotion against the smooth surface along with the force of nature causes you to slip right off the edge to the void below with ease! You know it's no use but you reactively scream as you flip around the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how much time has passed. It could have been seconds, minutes or even hours but you open your eyes to see many structures towering around you. Although it was complete darkness from above, with you now in the purse, your eyes seemed to have adjusted to the dark and the light pouring in from the crevice above gives dim illumination to the contents of various sizes; all bigger than you. The ambient noise from the ocean waves and the howling wind make the inside of the purse surprisingly loud. The amount of space seems to provide excellent acoustics, you could shrink a band and use this purse as a stadium for a concert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCringing, you try to stand up, hoping to be prepared for an injury from the fall but you seem to be fine aside from some soreness on the left side of your body that you landed on. Looking down you see that you are on a wad of soft, white material the size of a trampoline. A kleenex tissue. Although it was an unconventional entrance, you can now start gathering supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off the tissue, you notice a crumping noise upon landing and see that papers litter the floor of the purse. Sticky notes and receipts are everywhere. Pulling out your sword from it's sheath strapped to your back, you slice pieces of the papers and stick them into several different pockets of your fatigues. These papers are very light weight and will provide excellent firewood. Now to collect more heavy duty items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see several items just ahead that are absolutely gigantic. The smallest of the being a tube of lipstick the size of a toppled city building, what appears to be a water bottle that is now like some kind of see through ship and a circus tent-like blue cloth. The use of the water bottle is obvious to you. Jogging towards it, you hold your sword out and thrust it as hard as you can into the plastic wall. You then pull your sword out and a sprout of water drips out. The bottle holds enough water to fill a lake at your size and in an hour the amount of water that leaks out will probably only equate to a single drop to a normal human. You open your canteen that is strapped on your belt and let the flowing water fill the cup before you close it and then you make sure to lap up plenty of the water into your mouth before continuing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing past some humongous makeup items, you make it to the cloth and use your sword to start tearing pieces off. You tear off a big enough piece to make a small tent before folding it up and placing it in your light backpack. You then cut out a long and thin strip of the cloth to make a rope before rolling it up and placing it between your hip and your belt. With all the supply collecting, you realize you have been using your sword a lot. This means the blade will dull which will make it less effective as a combat weapon. Eventually, you will have to craft some kind of weapon for when things get tougher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA toppled skyscraper encased in plastic lay ahead. A tampon case. You use your sword to cut out the plastic and store in your backpack as well, you have plans for the plastic. You can't help but realize with all the supplies in here, you could have based your survival on just living in a woman's purse. You are sure you can probably find food if you did more searching, you have only explored a fraction of the inside of this purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you don't have much more room to carry anything else. You need a camp so that you can drop stuff on and go on more supply runs like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you wonder how the hell you are going to get back to the top of the purse, then again you could also travel more through the purse and replace some of the items you found with more potentially useful items....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Your sword has dulled. You have used quite a bit of energy thus far although the water has helped gain some back. The amount of supplies you are carrying make you heavier which will cause slower travels and more energy loss until you find a place to drop the stuff off.)</span></div></div>",

You scrape and writhe, and the absorbent white sheet slurps it all hungrily away.  Your freedom of movement is restored, no longer sticking or slipping to surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding your blunted sword, you search through the bag for something that you know should be here that would help in that department.  Strolling past outsize artefacts of the giant world, you waste valuable time deciphering their true purpose before you find what you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's nail-file.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dainty little thing to the busy mother of two, to you it's a rough and heavy mass that you could never even lift, but you don't need to.

With focus and devotion, you restore its sharpness, and once more have a useful companion for your future survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that takes time.  You haven't been keeping track, but your time of leisure is brought to an end as the titanic hand of the bag's owner peels apart the sky.

You join them, impacting heavily but taking no damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are once again in the shadow of these items, but the sun beats down from above, only just eclipsed by the empty bag, shaken by the immense hands of this giant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking about, you can see that your new world on this blanket, surrounded by her possessions, are walled by her legs, as she sits cross-legged around you.  Her towering thighs and calves cut off access to the beach, her ankles crossed too tightly to allow you past, and the lotion still too slick to allow you to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like she's trying to find whatever it was that pricked her.  No sign of her man-frind though, so maybe he's gone to join the kids or something.  Just you and this goddess...</span></div></div>",

The rough surface has enough texture for you to grip easily, and the back-and-forth swaying of the giant as he walks almost reminds of you being rocked in a hammock during a lazy summer day. Looking to the side, the man\u2019s massive penis swings back and forth, keeping time like a fleshy pendulum. A neatly-trimmed forest of dark pubes sits right underneath the waistband of the trunks. You return to having a staring contest with Mr. Jackson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a salty smell assaults your nose. Water begins to lap at your feet, and the dollar bill begins to shrivel up as it takes on water like a sponge. You try to climb up the mesh threads of the pocket, but the water level quickly rises over your head. You feel like you\u2019re trapped in a fisherman\u2019s net. The cash floats by, resembling a giant green piece of seaweed. The top of the pocket is sealed shut from the water pressure, and your tiny arms can\u2019t force it open. Your lungs begin to burn as your strenuous activity quickly depletes the remaining oxygen in your blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, you swim between the mesh ropes that form the pocket, into the dark space between the man\u2019s thigh and the swim trunks. The hair on his legs wiggle in the current like seaweed, and you grab onto a cluster of them to steady yourself as he continues to walk. His massive movements continually create eddies of water around your tiny body that threaten to pull you down like a riptide. Trying to remember your swimming lessons from so many years ago, you thrust your arms and legs forward in the darkness,. Suddenly, you bump into something warm and wrinkly. With arms and legs outstretched, you grab onto the round object, feeling wiry hairs tickling your body. You realize that you have grabbed onto the giant\u2019s scrotum, shriveled from the cold water. Looking up through the shimmering water, you can see a pocket of air just below the waistband of the giant\u2019s trunks before spots cover your vision from the lack of oxygen. Thankfully, the man has stopped moving, and you take the opportunity to scramble up the sheer surface of the giant\u2019s testicle. Grabbing handfuls of the wrinkled flesh brings back memories of climbing a steep rock wall, except this cliff face is the scrotum of a living mountain. The man\u2019s massive penis floats serenely beside you like a sleeping whale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin gives way to a thick carpet of hair as you reach the giant\u2019s pubic forest. The thick wet strands entangle your body, wrapping around your arms and legs like an octopus\u2019s tentacles. The air pocket is just above your head, barely out of reach. In a panic, you thrash out. Your arms and legs cry out from the effort. Just as you are about to pass out, you are finally free of the pubic prison. You begin to float backwards, until your back presses up against a smooth, warm surface. The shaft of the giant\u2019s colossal manhood extends before you, its tip drooping downward. You now know what a barnacle feels like when it attaches itself to a blue whale: utterly insignificant, lost among an incomprehensible girth. The man\u2019s warmth flows through your chilled body, and you spread your arms and legs out as if you were hugging a tree trunk, welcoming the heat entering your body. You can feel the blood pulsing through a prominent vein just under your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden shudder reverberates through the man\u2019s cock, causing you to grip on tighter, lest you get thrown off the awakening beast. The powerful penis begins to rise, bringing you along for the ride. You can feel the blood flow increase to a thundering roar. Like a whale breaching the surface of the ocean, the colossal manhood begins to tent the swim trunks as it pokes into the small pocket of air. The air is stale and musty, but you gulp it into your lungs greedily. You lay on your back, arms and legs spread wide, feeling the titan\u2019s heartbeat throb through the rigid cock. The penis bobs gently on miniature waves in this closed ecosystem on the man\u2019s trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you massage your sore limbs, you can suddenly feel water splashing against your body. The rock-hard rigidness of your penis platform has begun to soften, as the cock starts to deflate and slowly sink under the waves. In a panic, you begin to scrabble along the length of the dick, hoping to reach the pink head and make a jump toward the towering wall of the man\u2019s swim trunks. You pull yourself along the penis by grabbing handfuls of the hot flesh as the cock begins to descend. When you reach the taut skin of the head, however, something strange happens. The penis begins to rise again! You are ecstatic that you won\u2019t be thrown back into the unforgiving waves. However, you also realize that your minuscule exertions have aroused the titan enough to get him erect and keep you within the wonderful pocket of air at the top of the swim trunks. Your salvation will hinge upon your ability to keep him horny. Taking a deep breath into your lungs, you begin to rub and knead the boiling-hot flesh the best you can. You even begin to kiss and lick the cock, tasting the mix of saltwater and masculine musk. Certainly, your efforts have not gone unnoticed by the god whose manhood you are currently worshiping. </span></div></div>",

In reality, it's only been a few minutes, but between your constant fight for oxygen and your having to work on keeping a monolith horny despite not really swinging that way, it feels like eternity. You just pray that something will happen to make him leave the water. And then, your prayers are answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waters begin to recede, as once again the world begins rocking; the man's penis drops a bit, going from fully erect to semi-soft. This has its good and bad parts. The good part is that you're no longer clinging to an erect penis, which isn't sentence you ever thought you'd think. The bad part is that said no-longer-quite-erect penis is beginning to wilt, meaning you're clinging to what is rapidly becoming a steeper and steeper hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaft begins swaying -- a bit less than before, but still significantly. You brace your feet against the head, hoping you can maintain your footing; the other option appears to be falling down past one of the man's two legs to the sand thousands of feet below. You don't think you can survive that, and you don't really want to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it feels like the man walks forever, before pausing. You hear his voice from on high, rumbling like thunder. You can't quite make out the words -- they're loud and deep and you feel their vibration in the flesh you hold tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" booms a voice closer to you, one still rumbling and even louder, but this one more feminine. There's a pause, and a laugh. \"The water, sure. You were probably looking at those sorority girls playing volleyball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rumble from your host, and a coquettish boom of a laugh. \"Yes, I can see that. But Cody, you really think a cold shower...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the body rumbles, you think you've got this figured out. The man is talking to his goddess of a wife. You can make her out, probably because she's sitting up, which would put her head not far from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother laugh. \"No, you're right, if the kids weren't there, maybe, but...you know, they have some private changing rooms up there. And Annie is watching our kids and hers....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath you begins to swell up again, and you're not doing anything this time. \"Well, that looks like a yes from here,\" the feminine voice rumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is another pause, and then you hear her voice again, but more distant and less distinct. You aren't able to get it clearly -- she must have stood up. But she makes her presence known mere moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not prepared for the collision; suddenly, something slams against the swim trunks and the hill you hold onto. You're crushed for a good moment, and only the slight give of the trunks and the man's skin saves you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the crushing force, your mind fills in the blanks. The woman stood up, and knowing her husband was already aroused, she hugged him, or kissed him, or something. She pushed herself up against him flirtatiously, teasing him with her body. To him, to her, it was sultry and hot. To you, it was like being pinned between two buildings -- two very horny buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure abates just as suddenly, and the penis springs back, flinging you upward. Like a springboard, it flings you off of it, and you hit where his belly meets the waistband of the trunks. You're briefly wedged by the elastic before a slight movement of his causes you to come loose, and drop again. You reach out, and impact the loop knot that ties his drawstring together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. This isn't going at all how you'd planned it.</span></div></div>",

Earlier, you had thought over how her smallest toe could annihilate your quarter-inch tall form; soon her entire body will be getting close to you, and you're not sure you'd survive between two horny giants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it's a long way down if you wanted to drop, and that's not something you're sure you could survive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman pushes a gigantic door open with her ass, walking backwards and beckoning the man on with a smile and a curled finger.

In the distance, you can see what appears to be the children's mother. A blonde haired woman in a black bikini who can't be any older than her early thirties. In one hand he is carrying a rolled up beach chair, in the hand is her purse and a large beach bag that no doubt contains towels and food. You don't have any time to watch the woman setup as your immediate attention is back on her giant children getting dangerously clothes. Both of them appear to be the same age, no more than six years old, and carrying beach sandcastle buckets with shovels inside. How cute. The boy is wearing a pair of red swim trunks and the girl is in a one-piece baby blue swim suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of sand crunching under their feet is heard from seemingly miles away and a dust storm is created as the giants kick sand ahead of them. To your less than an inch tall body, this sand is pebbled and rock sized, causing you to be pelted. You can't even see where the giants are but the sand storm finally stops. You look forward to see enormous toes that tower over your miniscule body, looking up you see the girl is standing right over you. \"She is freaking huge!\" You gulp as you have to crane your head all the way back to look up at her towering form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make one right here!\", the giant girl suggests with a thunderous voice dropping the bucket and shovel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy does the same and now you are stuck in the middle of a sandcastle build. The girl squats down ahead of you and grabs her shovel. You see  her dig it down seemingly far away but when she lifts the shovel up part of the ground below you starts to raise. You quickly jump off and watch as the shovel goes up in the air. The girl dumps the pile of sand into the bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to get lifted on the shovel, poured into the bucket and then buried alive by subsequent loads of sand; you quickly run away form the area but smack into a warm wall of flesh. You look up to see you ran into the giant boy's pinky toe as he is doing the same thing. You move away to a safe distance as the kids continue shoveling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl is able to fill her bucket and place the bucket upside down to form a perfect castle tower shaped pile of sand. She fills another bucket and makes another next to the first pile. The boy on the other hand keep failing when he turns the bucket upside down and soon stands up and stomps angrily on his shoddy work at castle making. \"I'm going to go find shells!\" The boy pouts as he stomps away. \"Okay\", the girl replies as she starts to shovel around the sand castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Soon, there were four single bucket towers surrounding a large triple bucket tower.  How she got the dry sand to stay in a perfect shape was a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, you didn't stay for the castle; you stayed to watched the incredible act of a normal sized person moving.  Even on her knees, the girl was taller than anything you'd ever seen, and every movement of hers seemed to defy logic.  There was no way anything that large could move so fast, yet she continued to scoop sand and fill buckets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were standing far enough back to feel safe, but in the back of your mind you knew it wouldn't make a difference where you stood.

Brother dearest was returning, and he was heading right towards you.  His shadow quickly covered you, and his massive sandy feet plowed through the ground with ease, yet you couldn't be bothered to get out of the way.  Don't take it the wrong way; you were scared shit less.  You just realized how futile it was to try and move.  Hell, you could see rocks stuck to the boy's feet that out sized you.

The girl is close right now, as close as you could hope for, and unaware of you.  You could jump onto her, hold on until the tumult is over, and then drop off later, when it's safe.

You stop short of the neck-wall, and back away as she turns her head, the skin ahead of you smoothly folding as the face ahead of you considers something else.  Her voice booms above, unrestrained by thoughts of a passenger, rocking you more than her movements ever did.  If you are to communicate with this behemoth, you need to overcome this danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin is rougher than the fabric, something you would not have guessed at before you were shrunk to this scale.

She rushes forward, no doubt having seen something she wants her mother to buy, and the breeze rips one of your hands free.  Dangerous, but while she's distracted she's not scratching you in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ear lies above the line of her crushing jaw, and so you have to deal with an overhang briefly, which would be far more terrifying were you not so light, and her skin so climbable.  This will not deter you!  More sounds crash above and beyond you, giant conversation that you attempt to drown out, thankful that you're not deafened yet, though your head is ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp the edge of her face, amidst longer scalp hairs that drape like vines, you change from warm, sensitive skin to cold, unfeeling hair.  The chance of her noticing you just vanished, and these strands are as easy to scale as rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, the cave of her earhole, dark and forboding.  You can get in there easily, but step carefully around the spikes of hair and globs of wax that lie in wait like monsters from a dungeon.  Squeezing yourself past the tragus, you lick your lips in anticipation of speaking to a being that - for all intents and purposes - encompasses the entirety of your world now.  Your first words will dictate where this goes.</span></div></div>",

She said with a giggle before swiftly removing you from her ear, and gently placing you down on the towel in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her phone out from her beach bag before setting it down in front of you. It was quite literally the biggest screen that you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. You watched as her monster digits tapped and swiped at the screen only to pull up pictures of some of the terrariums she had in her home. You knew they were designed to be realistic, but her\u2019s were taking it a step beyond. You were enthralled by the pictures she was showing you until her booming voice once again chimed in catching you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou see what I mean?\u201d</b> She said with a giggle. <b>\u201cI designed these terrariums to simulate the outside world. A lot of what I do is studying how insects react to different conditions... Whether it be through temperature, weather, day and night cycles... The terrariums are equipped to simulate all of these factors...</b> As she continued explaining you couldn\u2019t help, but agree with her. They were practically worlds inside a glass cages. This might just be exactly what you\u2019re looking for. You thought to yourself before you were snapped out of it by the prodding from one of the woman\u2019s giant digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou know... If you agree to it, I\u2019m thinking that this one here might be the best option for you\u201d</b>. She said with a giggle as she scrolled through many pictures of what looked to be the biggest, and most thought out terrarium yet. It was equipped with full forests, and plains... Rivers and lakes dotted the landscape, along with full mountain ranges even! You were in awe from the sheer beauty of it all. Right when you were about to agree to her suggestion, some concerns stopped you which you made sure to address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know... this looks great, and all... but what would I do for things like food...? Shelter...? You know things like that...\u201d You sheepishly said aloud. The only reason the woman could hear you being that her ear was now pressed against your spot on the towel. You were caught off guard by her sudden booming laughter which threatened to nearly blow you away, and get lost in the sand. However, you just barely managed to hold onto the thick fibers of the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued laughing, not even realizing that she literally almost blew you away. <b>\u201cOh... Oh wow... And you call yourself a \u2018survival expert\u2019!\u201c</b>. She said as the laughs eventually turned to giggles, and died down. <b>\u201cAhh... Don\u2019t worry...

I guess you\u2019ll just have to make your own... My little survivalist...\u201d</b>. She said with a grin as her finger slowly started to block out the sun, threatening to crush you as she began to rub your head very lightly. <b>\u201cHowever... I\u2019m not a cruel owner... If you\u2019re in desperate need of something like food, I\u2019ll be more than happy to step in, and give you some rations...\u201d</b>.

You couldn't help, but notice from earlier that she was with who looked to be her husband, and daughter. Although, if that was that case... Was she just going to leave them here, and take you back to the house? You tried waving your arms around, and yelling for her in an attempt to signal her when she finally took notice and gently placed you in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal Ms.???\". You ask confused. \"Isn't that your husband, and daughter that we just left back there? Shouldn't they know about me if I'm going to be living with you guys from now on??? And wait... If we leave, how are they going to get back to the house??\". You said spouting off question after question since your were genuinely a bit confused by her actions. The woman let out a slight laugh before speaking up once again. <b>\"Oh! I'm sorry... I guess I owe you an explanation since well... How else were you supposed to know if I didn't tell you right...?\"</b>. She laughed once more, before making a <b>\"duh...\"</b> sound and chiming in once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"The people you saw me with was my ex Ron, and our daughter Allison... Since we're separated, we don't live together anymore. However... Allison usually stays with me every other week\"</b>. She looked as if she was pondering something for a moment, before speaking up once more. <b>\"I guess I could tell Allison about you if you want... I'm not quite sure how she'd react though... Buuuuttt... The terrarium that I'll be keeping you in will be setup in my room, and Allison really doesn't have a reason to go in there... So for that reason, I could just keep you as my little itty bitty secret!\"</b>. She said cutely as she reached up to her ear, and gave you another colossal head pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Annnyyywaaayyy... It's best not to worry about that right now, since she won't even be back for another week...\"</b>. She said with a giggle as she finished loading everything into the car, before putting on some clothes over her bikini, and getting in, before closing the door. <b>\"Now... Where to put you...\"</b>. She said biting her lip as she looked around the car, and her purse trying to find anything that she could store you in for the ride home. <b>\"Aha! Gotcha!\"</b>. She exclaimed as she pulled what looked to be an empty Tic-tac container out of her purse. Before you even knew what was happening she gently plucked you out of her ear, and tilted her hand towards the opening in the container. You were like a leaf in the wind as you tumbled down her palm, and gently descended down into the bottom of the huge container. Being barely a 1/4 of an inch tall really had it's perks when it came to things like this. If you were any bigger, the fall wouldn't have been nearly as graceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her giggle to herself as you got up to your feet, and patted yourself down. Watching your descent into the container must've been pretty comedic for her. <b>\"Oh! By the way, I guess I should've mentioned this before... My name's Serena...\"</b>. She said with a smile as her colossal eye loomed a bit closer, examining you a bit more from outside the container. You nervously gulped down the lump in your throat as you watched her examine you. Seeing that you were going to speak up, she pressed her ear against the opening in the container so that she could hear you. \"It's nice to meet you Serena, I'm <b>'Your Name'</b>\". You said with a small chuckle. <b>\" 'Your Name'... huh? I don't think that it fits you very well... we might just have to change that...\"</b>. She said before busting out laughing. <b>\"I'm just messing with you... mostly...\"</b>. She said with a grin before setting the container back down into the dark depths of her purse, and starting on the drive back home. You tried to stay awake, but the rhythmic humming from the car, and the darkness from inside the purse was more than enough to make you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke, you felt a warm breeze wash over you. You stood up in what felt like long reeds of grass...? The light from above was a bit to bright for you to see anything until you rubbed your eyes a bit more, and let out a yawn. However, when your eyes finally adjusted, you couldn't believe what you were seeing... You looked to be in what appeared to be a large field, with a river running through it... And at full size none the less. You looked around and were amazed to see huge forests in the distance filled with pines, and birch trees. As well as sloping hills way out in the distance, which eventually led out to what looked to be a very distant mountain ranges. The landscape before you went on for so long that you couldn't even make out where it ended. For a minute you began to question if you had died in your sleep and moved onto the next life until you heard, and felt a rhythmic booming getting ever closer and louder. You weren't quite sure where it was coming from until you saw the sun in the sky begin to get blocked out by something colossal. Before you knew it, the artificial cloud layer in the sky had parted revealing the monolithic face of Serena peering down at you. You were so in awe of your now Goddess-like owner that you were frozen in pure shock of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, you were snapped out of it by her booming voice echoing throughout the lands around you. <b>\"Aww... Finally awake now, are we sleepy head?\"</b>. She said with a booming giggle following after. <b>\"You were just so adorable sleeping that I didn't want to wake you, I figured that I should place you in your new home. Well... new 'world' for someone your size...\"</b>. She continued on with a warm smile on her face. <b>\"Well I hope you like it...\"</b>. She said looking a slight bit nervous about how it might look for someone of your scale. <b>\"I design all of my terrariums to be as life like as possible, and this one... well it's definitely no exception...\"</b>. She let out a slight giggle. You wanted to speak up, and ask her more questions about your new world, but before you could she spoke up once more. <b>\"I'm gonna go shower, and get cleaned up... And you should probably start on some kind of shelter little guy... I hear it gets pretty cold at night...\"</b>. She said with a grin before her face ascended back up into the heavens, until the clouds finally closed back around it... Letting the sun shine back onto the lands, and leaving you alone in your new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to waste, you figured that she's right. Without some kind of shelter you weren't going to last long in the elements. The only question now was where to settle down...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you continued to think about it for a while longer, you realized that this was a race against the clock... and whatever you chose to do; you had to do it soon. Suddenly realizing that you'd be an idiot for choosing anything else besides the forest, you started on the short walk towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperature began to cool down a bit quicker than you expected it to, especially since you had no idea what season this world was going into it. However, after a bit of time passed you had realized that it was in fact early Winter as it started to get pretty cold out. With no time to waste you started to gather up small twigs, stones, and long reeds of grass. After a few hours, you had managed to craft some primitive tools as you started cutting down big low-hanging branches to form some sort of shelter. The environment in the forest was definitely much more bearable than the grassy plains. It was easily a good 15 degrees warmer here within the natural insulation of the vegetation rather than bearing witness to the chill winds out on the plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to wonder how low Serena had set the heat lamp, since it was Winter in the terrarium... maybe she was just trying to make a realistic world for you...? After stopping for water a few times from the nearby stream, with the cold water stinging your throat... you had managed to build a sort of small log cabin-like hut. Grabbing moss, and leaves off of the ground and nearby trees to act as insulation. After all, you had to keep the heat in however you could if you wanted to even live through the first night. You'd gone around the thing three more times just to make sure that there were no extremely visible gaps, before slumping down against the outside wall of the hut. \"Phew... I don't think that I've worked that hard in years...\" You said catching your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you initially signed your life over to her, and became her pet; you knew that things would still be difficult.  After all you didn't expect life to at this size to be an easy task. What you signed up for was a challenging existence filled with survival, and this was exactly that! \"Well... at least she'll provide me with supplies if I start to run into trouble...\" You said with a sigh of relief as you continued to sit there. Exhausted from a long day's work. As the sun started to set, you realized that you should probably start on a fire. With that, you used the last bit of your energy for today to gather kindling around the camp and produce a small, but still effective fire. You started to rub your hands next to the flames, knowing that you'd have to find food tomorrow or things could get bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Serena had shut the water to the shower off, she couldn't help but wonder how you were managing for your first time in a terrarium. As she continued to dry off, she pondered if she was being a bit too hard on you by making your first season there Winter. But as she walked out of the bathroom, and sat down on the edge of her bed... she could just barely make out a tiny pin-prick of light coming from one of the lesser forests. Suddenly her concerns for you well being had pretty much vanished. <b>\"Good for you little one...\"</b>She said aloud to herself. <b>\"Just you wait until Winter really sets in...\"</b> She said with a mischievous laugh as she knew that soon, things were bound to get a lot more challenging for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chill wind of night washed over you rattling your bones a bit too much for your liking. Even with the fire, it was still way too cold without your clothing, not to mention what it'd be like when snow starts to fall. Before turning in, you made sure that the fire was stocked full of wood, and kindling before opening the curtain like flap to your shelter, where you began to bundle up under the heavy amounts of dry grasses and moss that you gathered up earlier in the day. As you began to fall asleep, you could've sworn that you heard what sounded like a distant booming laugh. However... you paid it no mind as the cold was making you sleepy, and you just couldn't force yourself to stay awake any longer...</span></div></div>",

You see the entirety of her face, it is not encouraging. In place of compassion or understanding there is a cold face, with just a hint of bemusement. That bemusement grows as the woman shuddering words wash warmly over you, but cut icily to your core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsking was really more a courtesy, my little pet.

You follow it. Her unoccupied hand has plunged into her handbag, feeling around for something. Her voice returns. \u201cTrust me little guy, this is better for you and me. You can live out your dream in a safer, controlled environment. Heck, conduct whatever studies you want. More importantly I can study you and your ability to survive and adapt in diverse environments with differing flora snd fauna, just like my other pets.

What\u2019s worse is she seems to perversely think its in your best interests, regardless of your opinion on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, here we are.\u201d Her hand retracts holding a \u201csmall\u201d Bag of green Tic Tacs, each about your size, but wider, yet she holds them and their container with infinite ease. Dumping dozens of you sized boulder like Tic Tacs into her hand, she tosses them far and wide, hoping the seagulls take interest in cleaning up her little mess. She raises the bottle underneath and realization hits too late, the powerful fingers release and you fall into a decent sized hole, smacking against the clear glass on the side before sliding down asteep angle to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit with an \u201cuff\u201d. The smell of the Tic Tacs is all around you. You scramble to your feet and look up the narrow container, the swirls of the woman's two fingers holding the container do not fully conceal the massive brown eyes staring at you with unabashed glee over her find. You pound you scream but the woman is only further amused before lightly shaking your prison, or charitably bug box. With one last happy stare and a murmur, clear to your micro ears. \u201cBut which to put him in first.\u201d Without further acknowledgement the woman lowers the box into the purse, plunging you into semi-darkness, surrounded by towering everyday items. The drop jostles you into the plastic walls some, as does the subsequent Great shake as the bag is hoisted to her shoulder. But its not those bumps and bruises that bring you to the verge of tears...</span></div></div>",

So, all you can do is nothing but sit and wait. You sit in the dark for hours as you have no other choices of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, the woman just lays against her towel while she enjoyed the sun. She is given the occasional conversation from her husband but for the most part they both just relax in the sun. Her daughter seemed to have been having a blast playing in the water. And eventually her husband finally came back and told his wife that they should all get dressed and head back home. It was a very relaxing day for all of them except you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all put there clothes on and left the beach.

You can then feel the purse being placed onto the floor of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive is about 30 to 40 minutes long and your left with really nothing to do the entire time. But finally the family arrives at there home. They unload everything from the car and go inside. You can hear the TV on in the background with there laughing and shouts of play at certain points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you then eventually hear the woman who captured you say that she needed to finish some work up in her office. And with taking the purse that you are in side of. She strolls into her office and closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still have no idea what to do. The wait is the worst part, you can't do anything except sit there and wait.

She holds that Tic-Tac container that has you inside of it up to her gigantic brown eyes. She shakes the container a little bit before giggling as she opens it and then shakes you out onto the palm of her gigantic hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a bit dizzy as you hear her giggle. You stabilize yourself a bit and get a chance to look around at the room you are in. You see a wall of shelfs filled with terrariums that look very realistic on the inside. And as you stare at them you see insects swarming around the inside of the terrariums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention quickly back to the woman though as you hear her say \"...Well my little pet survivalist, are you excited to get into your terrarium?...\". You don't really know how you want to respond to that though. But then again she wasn't really waiting for you to respond as she giggles and begins walking over to her desk. She sits down in her chair and then she stares down at you in her palm. She begins examining you carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?...)</span></div></div>",

She was a sociopath, with no regard for you as a human being, a fellow sentient creature at least. Now over the cup of her hand you see the myriad of terrariums on shelves, large and small, some with tubes, others the classic glass tanks, various creatures surely inhabited them but at this distance it was difficult to make out any specific creature. Further, there were likely dozens of others at hip height and lower you could not see from your limited perspective in the palm of this woman's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her other hand the woman taps on her chin, deep in thought, as her eyes wander the room. \"Hmmm...\" rumbles through the air, and also through your feet and up into the rest of your body. A surprisingly pleasurable sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustration grows at her, for past deeds and for completely ignoring you as she decides your new home. Finally, it boils over. \"Hey!\" \"HEY!!! This isn't right! I'm a scientist and a human being and I demand to be released right this instant!\" At first she pays you no mind, so you drop to your knees and begin pounding on her skin, fists nearly fitting between the wrinkles, and obscenities at the top of your lungs. After a few moments of this, you get the distinct impression you are being watched. Turning your head up, you see that you have the woman's full, focused attention. She stares down her nose at you, seemingly annoyed, but her massive lips betray a twinge of amusement. \"Yes little one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have her attention, you suddenly feel weak kneed and struggle for words. The bemused smile fades after a moment, and before you can speak your frustration, the woman does your talking for you. \"Ah, eager to begin the experiment I bet? I suppose that makes sense, you did make such a sacrifice for such a unique experience.\" You have to seize this moment of attention, however fickle. \"Look, ma'am. Please take me back to the beach. This isn't what I wanted, and honestly this whole shrinking adventure thing was probably a terrible idea. This is dangerous and I don't wanna be some pet or lab rat! I need to restore my size!\" She stares for a moment, evidently hearing some if not all of your pleas. Her face contorts contemplatively. \"But this IS what you wanted, and its what I want too, for now at least.\" Her gaze turns to something beyond your vision, and you realize further attempts at communication, at least at this time, are pointless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning you are shaken from your knees to your side as the woman rises from her chair. Seems she has decided for you where you will begin the next phase of your rapidly spiraling adventure. </span></div></div>",

It rests on a table, just below hip height for the woman. Above the long, clear box is a large lamp, which appears to be on some sort of moving wall mount. Judging by its color and intensity, it is some sort of heating lamp, and its movement seems to be an attempt to imitate the movement of the sun. At present it appears to be near the far side of the table. The wall behind the terrarium appears to be coated in a large picture resembling an ocean. On the far left side in the corner there is a small pond, that connects to some sort of aquarium under the table that nearly matches the size of the one above, teeming with fish life. To the right is followed by an area of sand, dirt, and pebbles that leads a short distance up a slight hill before entering a thick foliage of wide leafed plants that appear to be those found on tropical islands in the Pacific. Another small clearing is at the opposite wall, but you can see little else as the woman approaches too rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding above what appears to be your new home, or prison, the woman scans the inside for a moment. Seemingly contented, she opens one of the large windows at the top, then her hand containing you descends rapidly to the floor of the terrarium. The impact through her hand once again tosses you to your stomach, and wasting no time for your own initiative or well-being the woman tilts her hand, rolling you roughly off her palm and into the sand below. Without so much as a 'sorry', the giant hand pulls up and away at rapid speed, belying your feeble attempt to reach out to it. Your only way in and out of this cage has just left you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputter out some sand particles the size of gumdrops, and pull yourself onto your butt. You glance up at the appendage, now gripping the inside of edge of the window. A part of your mind wants to beg the thing for salvation, until your rational side kicks in. That is not a creature, but an appendage of the massive being stooped over the desk, watching you from just beyond the glass. It won't help if she doesn't decide to, and she's clearly decided on your fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that annoying smirk and trademark giggle, the woman speaks up, sound distorted by the glass and echoing down instead from the hole above. \"Trust me, this is a much better way to test your survival skills and study your environment.\" A pleased expression, from the certitude that she's doing the right thing, fills her visage. \"Now, its not 100% safe in there, not for a little thing like you, but safer than some beach, and this is an amazing opportunity to study human survival skills and mental effects. I can't pass up something so interesting! So try to stay alive, alright? I'll need to work you into my research schedule, but overseeing your developments are my BIGGEST priority *giggle*\" The condescension is palpable. You are nothing more than a subject in a research project for this person, whose name you still don't even know. This control freak, who has locked up hundreds, if not thousands of creatures smaller and bigger than you for her curious studies, or worse, amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little wave she rises to her full height. Her tight shorts covered hips and upper thighs now dominate your view. You stare straight ahead at this further reinforcement of your pathetic stature to your new \"overseer\". But you are lost in shock, and barely notice the loud click of the glass locking above, nor focus on the immense being beyond the glass's turn, footsteps thundering away as her hips swayed, carrying her immense mass swiftly away from your new home, and amplifying her enormity. Returning to her chair, hundreds of feet away, she sits down and begins filling out some paperwork on a notepad, while occasionally typing things into her desktop computer, seemingly not giving the slightest attention to the terrarium just a few steps away where the first known shrunken person resides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see all this, but you surprisingly don't care. She is now beyond the glass, and not your concern right now. Slowly, unsteadily, you rise to your feet and turn your attention towards the jungle beyond. You steel your nerves, the only way to get out of this mess was to survive. Survival meant a chance, however slim, that you'd find a way out of this grim situation. Survival was what you had set out to do, and despite the terribly worse situation, its what was still priority number one. Eyeing the jungle, full of unknown life, dangers, and tools, your courage falters for a moment. The task before you is tremendous. But that was the challenge right? Time to step up, time to throw every physical and mental part of you at overcoming this challenge. Time to survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurriedly you rush to the water, diving your hands into the thick, viscous surface tension, you pull upwards with notable effort and come off cupping a droplet, perfectly remaining a sphere in your micro hands, you suck on it. You cough, drat, saltwater. You'd need to find water soon, shelter right after that, and then food. Then take on other tasks. In the distance about halfway to the \"treeline\" is a thin stick, probably splinter sized to a normal human, but to you its your spear, at least for now. You rush towards it, bounding between dog and even person sized pebbles further from the water. In the distance, beyond the glass, the woman goes about her routine, rising from her chair, moving from terrariums to cages to aquariums, observing her research subjects, making notes, providing food. You dully feel her steps and notice her distant somewhat blurry shape moving about out of the corner of your eye, but your attention is focused here and now, on world on the inside. Funny that you could be in such close proximity to another human being, her very existence so consequential to you, and be completely disinterested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon acquiring the 'spear', you observe some small droplets of water hanging from the distant plants. Looking up, you notice a large black cylindrical object hanging from the roof of the terrarium. A sprinkler. So that's how she simulated fresh rain. Knowing how you'll get water, you begin looking for a place to create a makeshift shelter. This open area was likely not the safest, but you feared going into the jungle so soon. So involved are you in your tasks, you fail to notice the woman has placed her notepad back on the nearby desk, and begins to leave. She reaches the door and with one quick look back towards where her new fascinating study subject resides, not visible from across the room, she smiles and turns off the overhead light, causing the room to go dark initially, before automatic lighting kicks in in some of the terrariums. Instantly the artificial lighting that filled you world is replaced by a dull, bluish, moon style type of lighting, and you turn to see the distant shadowy outline of the woman in the yellow lit doorway exiting, shutting the door behind her with an audible click, even with the distance and through the glass. Returning back to her house and her life with her casual normal concerns, cutting off any connection of you and the human world, and leaving you to your desperate survival concerns. </span></div></div>",

The air felt thicker at this size, but seemed to buoy your movements, not hinder them. It was hard to describe, but you felt more agile at this size. Even the world seemed just a hairs breadth slower. The drops of water off the plants, the deliberate Even ponderous  movements of the woman, the roll of loose rock. Perhaps something to do with the distance electrical neurons had to fire in your head. Such investigation would have To come later as you reached the first of the plants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching, the plants grew greater and greater in their domination of your sight. From your perspective in the woman's hand they seemed low lying tropical bushes. But from within the tank right at their base they are several hundred feet tall behemoths and quite wide. A plant that to you could fill in much of a stadium. Now it could be a source of tools and materials, or it could contain a plethora of threats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unnerving blue glow of the lamp casts large deep shadows beneath the multitude of leaves. The darkness is so foreboding, and past the first layer of plants the jungle for lack of a better word becomes much more dense, closer to a wall of vegetation, full of the unknown specimens the woman keeps locked in here, some large and terrifying you're certain. Is that rustling you hear? Youd definitely heard ambient noises of some kind approaching here. Or is your terror deceiving your senses. You calm your breathing, which had unconsciously picked up these last moments. You can\u2019t beat yourself or this is all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stepping slowly over to a lower hanging stalk, you reach up and fill the texture. Surprisingly tough at this size, but the leaves are certainly more brittle in general due to reduced water flow, they must have adapted to rely on rain from occasional ocean squalls, which worries you that fresh water may be more scarce than you first thought. You reach into your pocket and pull out a sharp blade you'd intended for your original survival plans. You weren't expecting to need to cut plants on the beach however and the knife cuts through painfully slowly. More than once you stop progress. Certain you\u2019d seen something out of the corner of your eye. regardless of any creature\u2019s presence, you are happily unmolested as you now have a few brittle leaves to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter such thirsty work, you cautiously approach the base of the main root, deeper into the darkness. While more damp, you don\u2019t see a reliable source of clean water until you glance upwards. Along the main stalk are several droplets of water, each more than enough. You hoist yourself onto the lowest stalk and move higher and higher, keeping close to the main stalk until you reach a droplet almost as large as you. Eagerly you plunge your head in, only to be bounced off by the surface tension, like a rubber ball. Rubbing your head, you decide on a more cautious approach. Grabbing both sides you lean your head in and bite into the water like ice cream. You are forced to chew hard to break up the mouth sized drop into several smaller ones, then gulp them down one at a time like wet candy. You\u2019d have to find a better way of doing this in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you return steadily towards the base of the plant, you are hit by the realization that you are already planning for the future here, not thinking of escape. You shake the thought, it was a short term solution before you hatched your master and no doubt cunning escape plan. Right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth below is lukewarm as your shoes touch down. It might get colder in here and that wouldn't be good on your first night. Your contemplations are interrupted by a faint series of thuds in steady motion. You hear rustling in the great plants.. Just beyond your vision, a great creature pushes aside the impenetrable jungle like paper. The whipping of the stalks and plants reminds you of a strong rushing wind. You rush to the base of the bush a pray whatever this creature is doesn\u2019t see you, smell your, or hear your whimpers. The sound fades and you are none the wiser of what the creature is, but at least it is no wiser of you. You hurriedly gather up your supplies and rush for the only area you believe may be safe for tonight. The glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you decide to stay along the edge of the grassline, but you won't have time to construct a shelter or safe place in just one night. The glass is impenetrable to the denizens of this world, it would protect an entire wall from attack, save time, and allow you to watch the larger world beyond. Hopefully the woman would return and bring anything you could use to survive whatever she locked you in with. Using one of your leafs as a makeshift shovel, you dig into a patch of semi soft dirt and sand and after some hard work you have a hole. A little extra effort to expand it and you hop right in. You dig in a bit more once inside, in order to pack your entrance closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, you drop your shovel on you chest and lean up against a thin patch of dirt still separating you from the glass. Wearily, you wipe away a few particles for one last look outside your box. Its hard to make out much in the dark, but the woman's computer with a dull blinking standby light is the nearest large structure on her nearby desk. Dozens of other little worlds line the shelves. The thin outline of the door frame, lit by whatever light was in the hallway beyond. Nothing happens as you stare out, and exhaustion, and maybe a small hint of accomplishment, though for what you're not sure, overtakes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n Your dreams are of eyes in blades of the jungle outside. First one pair then two then dozens. Finally you hear a loud thunder and two enormous eyes eclipse the others!<br>\r\nYou awaken in surprise!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A fitful sleep is interrupted in an annoyed snort as a small clump of earth smacks into your knows before rolling onto the floor of your hole. You rub your eyes, hoping for a little relief. Your back would be complaining all day you figure. And what would you do with that day, you wondered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in your thoughts and your aches, you\u2019d ignored the dull thumping, but you finally recognize it and the white light pouring through your small hole to the glass. You look outwards, initially squinting at the artificial light until your eyes adapt. Beyond was the woman, pacing from shelf to shelf, nearly on the opposite end of the room, clipboard in hand, and covered in a white lab coat. You notice also that she appears to be wearing tight grey pajama shorts and slippers. You glance at your thankfully still working watch. 7:17 AM. She must be doing the her morning  rounds, having just woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it astounding that she hasn\u2019t come to check on you. You KNOW you\u2019re the most incredible sight she\u2019s ever witnessed, and she'd captured you to prove it. Yet here she was checking on insects, lizards, and small mammals and not you! What if you were dead!? You\u2019re a bit miffed. But then again, would her attention be a good thing? The more she treated you like another animal, the better your chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch machinations are shattered as the woman pivots and comes directly towards you. Well, your end of the terrarium that is. The previously dull thuds become louder and more jarring with each of her steps collapsing more bits of dirt in your hovel, and your restricted view sees less and less of her. You are mesmerized as the skyscraper sized being reaches the edge of the table. Your limited vision can see only her right leg covered in grey cloth where on the right it connects to her hips, and the left disappears behind her coat. She\u2019s standing roughly where she dropped you off yesterday. You figure she must be looking for you. You get a little red for the moment given your perspective on her body. You feel bad for a second, but then you recognize that shes unaware and either way you\u2019re not capable of being a threat to her, so maybe a few looks isn\u2019t such a bad thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of movement confirms her search and snaps you out of your lewd thoughts as the hips bend and the coat drapes onto the edge of the table. She\u2019s scanning for you. You don\u2019t move. Rationally you know the size of the opening is just larger than your head. Your head on your 1/4 inch body. Noticing that and the person within would take the eyesight of the god Apollo. But instinctually, your brain believes that this thing with the seeming power of a god is one, and you stay still as stone in your shelter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later the woman stands back to her full height, still not saying a word! Another thud suddenly rumbles through you, but coming from above as reverberating through the glass. Had she slapped the glass? No, you\u2019d have felt that alot more, your hole would also probably collapse. Within a second the leg steps away to your left, followed by the blurry quick movement of the rest of the woman as she walks down the length of the aquarium. Occasional pauses in her thumping indicating that she must be observing other denizens of your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, you pull down some dirt and peak your head above ground. You can\u2019t see her, indicating she\u2019s at least several steps away. A look at the jungle offers no evidence of any creatures. You glance up where presumably the woman smacked the glass. There about halfway up the wall is a large yellow billboard. A sticky note! On it in large letters with blue ink is the message \u201cMeet 8 am.\u201d As if on cue the giantess moves into view as she crosses in front of your position, but at a greater distance, heading to her desk. She places the clipboard down and walks towards the door, leaving it open on the way out and leaving you alone for now to think about her note. You sink back into your hole to contemplate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a bit miffed with the note. Yes it was precious communication and gave a meeting time, but it sure felt like a uncaring command. Maybe it was just done for expediency but would a \u201cplease\u201d hurt? How about an \u201care you ok in there!?\u201d You force yourself to be calm. Getting angry would not hurt her or help you. But now you gotta decide whether to show yourself. Yes, she represents a lifeline, supplies, and potential restoration, but she seems to be completely apathetic to your well being beyond your value as a test subject for her observations. And who knows what she may have in store for you. She may give you food at 8, or she may pluck you up and use you for some sort of tests!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever her intentions, if you stay here, tear some clothes, you can eventually convince her you'd been gobbled up you reckon. You could leave some sign you are alive but avoid her, blend into the terrarium until you figured a way out. Maybe your absence will change her approach? Or you could show up and hope for the best. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For all the callousness the woman has shown, you still know that on some level she values you. While you hadn\u2019t given up on convincing her that you were an equal, you needed to show value to get any sort of possible aid. Maybe even talk her into more. She seemed analytical, if nothing else. With that slim thread of optimism you make up your mind to be there on time. You set an alarm on your watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging out of your hole you take a moment to collect your leaf shavings, then stretch hard. A pop and shooting pain shoots though your back. Not happy with sleeping on the ground, it is being extra cranky this morning. You suppose you should head directly under the nearest opening to the terrarium above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rustle and movement out of the corner of your eye catches your attention. Your heart rate spikes and you grab the stick, your only protection. Your mind imagines the terrifying creatures that the woman keeps in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour terrors are confirmed as two antennae pole out followed by a terrifying, 6 legged, brown, grotesque, slow...waddling...and entirely unthreatening creature. It was about 14 or so feet long with a flat wide back that looked like a giant shovel and just over half your height. It pays you no heed and continues walking along, pecking at little edible things, to it anyways, along the ground, before moving along. In the distance you see a few more doing the same. Must be a routine. If your correct, thIs is a stinkbug. You\u2019re almost disappointed, but mostly relieved that your first encounter is with a leaf eater. The thing lumbers by 40 feet away. Pausing for a moment to take stock of you, then resuming its journey. You couldn\u2019t even intimidate a stinkbug. But the brain that compelled you to shrink in the first place kicks in. You could kill it and eat it, use its carapace for armor, ooh or ride it like something outta a sci fi movie. It could probably be a great transport animal. You approach steadily, spear at the side. When you close within 20 feet the creature takes stock of you again, now you're threatening it. It rears up and you fear your about to be smelling rotten for weeks. But you drop your spear and fall to the ground, your leaf sheddings falling too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature falls back on all legs with an audible thwump. Slowly it makes its way towards you. Should you run? Stick it in the eyes? It pauses before you and begins gobbling up the shavings. You resist the urge to yell or attack. You do slowly stand though. Seems that your tools made a welcome meal for the creature. It waits for a moment for more, but noticing none slowly waddles away, but not straying too far. Maybe this is an opportunity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch thoughts are placed aside as your alarm goes off, coincided with the memorable thumps of a giant attract your attention towards the outside world. The woman approaches the glass, now seemingly cleaned up after this morning. She rips the sticky note off and crumples the movie screen sized object in her hand before casually tossing it hundreds of feet into a small bin. A casual and likely unintentional reminder of her power. She gazes down looking for you, you presume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovered in dirt against a dirt backdrop, you decide to wave for her attention. Those big brown eyes lock on, and a genuine smile comes across her face. For what you're not sure. Happy you lived, yes, but why. Or maybe just amused or surprised. She reaches up and pops open the glass door. Her other hand comes in, only now do you notice it contains two long metal bars that run into her fingers. Tweezers! This could hurt like hell! You wave asking her to stop, but no response from the face outside the glass. You see the tweezers much closer now and instinctually bolt. The wide as you tweezers follow you then suddenly crash down right behind you, sinking into the sandy dirt several feet. You fall to the earth and turn to see the mildly annoyed face of the woman, a bit of her tongue out as she concentrated on getting you. As you stand the tweezers retract from the nearby earth and in a swift motion latch around your upper chest. It's hard to breathe. Despite her expertise in this and her care, the force her fingers exert on the metal is far greater than your ribcage can exert on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet left off the ground as you are hailed swiftly up from the spot of last night's adventure. Through the glass you go and stop before one of those same analytical eyes you were fast growing accustomed to, and resenting. It darts all over your form before you are lowered into the woman\u2019s waiting palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and heads for...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The woman reaches her desk in a couple of strides. You notice objects strewn about, tools, tweezers, measurement sticks, a magnifying glass and even a digital microscope. These objects soon tower about you as you are once again dropped by her palm to desk level, then rolled off. You weren\u2019t sure if the tweezers or this were worse, but both were painful in their own ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still rubbing your sore hands that you used to slow your fall and don\u2018t pay attention to the woman as she moves a few items around on the desk. That is, until the magnifying glass to your right is suddenly grasped by her building sized hand. Lifted up, it takes position ominously above you and her already large eye now appears several times larger. You see the little red veins in great detail, her pupil expanding and contracting like an unstable black hole, poring over you and processing visual information into her great mind beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSEEMS YOU SURVIVED THE NIGHT WITHOUT NOTABLE INJURY.\u201d Her words are even more jarring with her face so close to your sitting position. \u201cDAY ONE: SUBJECT ZETA, A REDUCED HUMAN MALE, HAS MANAGED TO SURVIVE OCEANIC PRIMARY HABITAT, WITHOUT INJURY, NOTED USING SPLINTER AS WEAPON, SHOWS SIGNS OF CREATIVITY IN STRESSFUL CONDITIONS. WILL CONDUCT MEASUREMENTS TO TRACK ONGOING PROGRESS.\u201d She must be speaking to a recording device, likely her nearby computer, her analytical nature is confirmed, but it leaves you cold with its lack of concern for you as an individual or human being. Did she say measurements? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her other hand maneuvering the long metallic measuring stick you saw earlier. With a thump it is placed uncomfortably close to you. \u201cLIE BACK.\u201d She commands. Despite all you\u2019ve witnessed of her power and personality, that spark of resentment and desire for freedom prevents you from obeying. You continue to just sit there, trying to avoid the eye and stare across the desk. A frustrated sigh emanates from the giant being and without further attempts at wooing you, you see a pair of micro metallic strands attached to a similar system as the tweezers fast approach you. You are barely onto your feet when the arm width mandibles latch onto your right shoulder, and with amazing precision you are forced into the air then steadily onto your back next to the measuring stick. You squirm and grunt in pain as gentle but firm pressure holds you down. You are also cowed by the realization that the force exerted is the gentlest a human being could probably manage. The micro strands retract but hover menacingly close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTRIP.\u201d You glance up despite the dull pain in incredulity at her latest command. The immense eye rolls. Finally modulating her tone for you and not the computer, her voice becomes softer. \u201cI need accurate measurements of your body, your clothes throw off the data just a little.\u201d You don\u2019t fully believe her purely scientific rationale. \u201cSIGH, if it makes you feel better keep your boxers. I don\u2019t need that measurement, for now at least. But if I must remove your clothes, I will\u201d The finality of the threat forces reluctant compliance. You shudder at what the tiniest slip of her fingers with those metal bars could do to you, and you are soon in your boxers lying flat, this time without command. \u201c.258 INCHES\u201d the booming recording voice returns, and lasts as she measure arm and leg length , torso width and so on. Soon a tiny scale made to measure creatures and objects your size is placed nearby. Graciously, the woman does not pick you up onto it but makes a \u2018bridge\u2019 with her pinky finger. You oblige, happy to not be tweezered, and grasp the whorled surface of her pinky\u2019s underside and climb up. Even here you can feel the gallons of blood pumping through her warm flesh as your bare feet climb up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale is relatively small and you reach it quickly at the woman\u2019s knuckle. Hopping off, you walk to the middle and her finger lifts and presses a button on the device. A loud snort and giggle radiates around you as the woman gets the measurement. \u201cWow the machine isn\u2019t even registering your mass. I\u2019ll have to purchase a new one.\u201d You put your hand on your hips and look up with frustration. Noticing your little display the woman replies \u201cWhat? Come on, its not my fault you shrank yourself so small.\u201d Another snicker, but she does have a point. You got yourself into this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, weight can come later, now we need to talk about your activities last night.\u201d A large microphone the size of you is placed nearby and angled down towards you. Judging by its size it was designed to record barely audible sounds, like your current voice. The woman taps a key on her keyboard and resumes her study. SUBJECT ZETA WILL RELATE DAY 1\u2019s EXPERIENCES NOW.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stares down expectantly. Ok, you figure, this may help in the long run, cooperation. \u201cFirst, my name is Stephen, not zeta. But as for my experiences...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour story ambles on with one or two flourishes, and the occasional question from the woman for clarification and to insert plant and animal names for purposes of the recording, but is without incident. The woman picks up the microphone and places it away. She speaks to the recording one last time. \u201cSUBJECT ZETA WILL BE RETURNED AND FOLLOWUP OBSERVATIONS WILL BE MADE AND RECORDED. GOAL OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS TO STUDY AN AVERAGE HUMAN BEING\u2019S ABILITY AND EFFORTS TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE IN HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. AT THIS TIME IT MAY BE PRUDENT TO RESTRICT SESSIONS SO AS TO AVOID CONTAMINATING SUBJECTS NATURAL BEHAVIORS AND PATTERNS.\u201d Another tap of the keyboard and her full attention is on cleaning up her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid this mean she was going to limit her interactions with you? That was good and bad you supposed. Out here you were safe from predators, although maybe being around giants was actually worse. Particularly this one. Did she also mean that avoiding contamination meant no free food or supplies? As if answering your question the woman uses the micro tweezers to pick up your pile of clothing and unceremoniously drop them into a tiny plastic bag. \u201cYou won\u2019t be needing these anymore, it's climate controlled in there. 90 degree days and 75 at night. You\u2019ll be just fine, in fact these could slow you down or get caught on something. Plus, they introduce outside elements not natural and contaminate the experiment.\u201d She stands to store the bag in a nearby box. Once again you are angered at the complete disregard of your opinion and the lack of trust you had in her. You could only trust her commitment to studying you, whatever that entailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning before you her palm smacks on the surface. \u201cEasy way or hard way?\u201d She probably can\u2019t see your glare, but you do it anyway as you walk over to her hand and climb on. \u201cI\u2019m Devya.\u201d You stare up at the first real time she's treated you with a modicum of humanity. \u201cI think this whole experiment is going to be quite fascinating little guy.\u201d With that she goes through the motions of returning you to your new home. As you roll off her palm back onto the dirt, you stare back at her. The self-satisfied smile remains before lifting up to her great height. Without so much as a goodbye or good luck she strides away. You are back to survival Day 2.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Placed back into the open area of the terrarium you notice something has changed. It's not just that the sun lamp has shifted in its position, somewhat mimicking the actual sun. Nor that everything feels different without your shoes and clothing. The bugs from earlier are gone. You take note of this. If your weeks of reading up on survival habits of insects told you anything, it's that wildlife follows a pattern for a reason. If the bugs are gone it's either because there's food elsewhere, or there's danger. You suddenly feel very isolated and vulnerable. Ironic considering the titanic woman you now know as Devya is no more than a half a dozen strides from your position, examining a terrarium at chest height that your earlier observations seemed a desert one, complete with some sort of shiny lizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve no idea whether a similar creature inhabits your area, but you recall the incident from last night. Frustratingly, Devya had not provided the creature\u2019s species, and merely noted the incident on her data pad. It was possible she wasn\u2019t sure. Depending on how many larger animals were in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find your discarded spear nearby, no worse for wear. Grabbing it you bound across toward the glass, then along it to your hole. None of your leaf chippings remain, likely all consumed by the damn stink bugs or some other inhabitant. This place was at best temporary, and hopefully only an emergency shelter. With little reluctance you depart and move back into the jungle, which seems only a little less foreboding with the \u2018daylight\u2019. You move in cautiously at first, every step considered. However this won\u2019t work. Most everything in here was likely stronger and faster than you, and with better senses. You remember your beach strategy. Quick brief bursts from cover to cover, like tiny spiders. You are up against the base of the plant from last night when you make your first sprint into the jungle to a nearby thick mound of soil. You scan around and above, 360 degrees. Nothing but some ambient sounds, no movement. The next sprint is to a low bush with longer pointer stalks with a little needle at the end. You recognize the needle as the same you carry now. A good source of armaments for the future you reckon. Then you detect movement near your dirt mound you just came from. Slowly moving to get a better view, you catch sight of a black beetle lumbering along. Its not particularly big, maybe twice your height and 25 feet long. It pauses briefly at your former location, likely trying to figure out the different scent or however it detected you. Before you can worry whether it's carnivorous, you detect small vibrations in your feet. Within moments the twig you stand near jumps a dozen feet in the air as a massive grey creature plants its weight upon it and shoots out of from behind a low hill covered by undergrowth and steps on said twig as it squeaks so shrill you are forced to drop your spear and hold your ears. The beetle has no chance to escape as the monster grabs it with its pink hands and grips it tight while using sizable jaws to tear at its head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is through the roof as you fall to your ass.  From the speed and violence of such a creature, and you finally get to see the now mostly stationary beast. A shrew. A frikin shrew was what terrified you, and it wasn\u2019t even particularly big. Using quick math you estimate its size at about 3 inches along, or nearly 75 feet to you, and 30 or so tall. Basically a Beast of legend then. They often ate insects, and while its attention was focused on the beetle, you had no doubt you\u2019d be a tasty easy snack for it once done. Glancing one more time at the monsters locked in a death embrace, you turn and proceed deeper into the jungle. So that was your roommate? Well one of them. That\u2019s what you heard last night right? You didn\u2019t think so. Unlike the other creature, this thing had moved and struck silently. Even lumbering along if would not make as much noise as last night you figure. Still, a creature of its size and power would overwhelm you. You needed to be smarter, stealthier. Strength would not be any more than a mild speedbump to such a predator. You fall to your knees at the base of a nearby bush you've fled to and rub as much wettish dirt on you as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrews presence also likely explains the bugs leaving the easily spotted nearby opening from earlier. You decide to forge on, the known dangers may have grown but the need for materials to survive was growing too. That and a need for food. What to do next?</span></div></div>",

You've performed your morning exercises, eaten your breakfast and pried one of the bugs from your traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been as dead as you'd suspected - another lesson learned - and had tried to decapitate you with its mandibles.  A thrust of your spear put an end to that, and you'd set to carving it apart for its meat and its armour-plated hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what manner of bug or beetle it is, and while the world's owner, Devya, has tried on occasion to educate you on the features you share your habitat with, their names haven't held any value for you.  No, all you care about is how easily they die and how good they taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExposed in the open, there's no point to hiding as the daytime light is flicked on and the giantess approaches your glass prison.  You stand and wipe some dark haemolymph on your trousers, trying to look presentable as she looms over you, hips at ground level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and gives a little wave with her gigantic hand, still so timid when interacting with a quarter-inch man.  As different from her mother as night and day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzna stoops to bring her eyes level with you, and you marvel again at how similar her face is to her mother's, differing really only in expression: her eyes are wide with wonder rather than cruel curiosity, and when she smiles it's at the comfort of others and not herself.  How did this girl manage to avoid being so twisted by her psychopathic mother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother's late up today, so I thought I'd better get here quickly to make sure you got your light,\" she says.  \"That's why I'm such a mess, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApologising, to the likes of you?  And for something that doesn't even matter!  If her clothes are ruffled, or her hair less than perfect, you can hardly notice.  The fact that she even thinks of that though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr is this a trick?  Is this wide-eyed teenager just playing a role assigned her by her mother, acting as 'good cop' to see how it affects your behaviour in her great glass petri dish?  Gaaah, that woman has already got you doubting everything around you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seems like you've managed to feed yourself, so no need for a supply drop today,\" Izna giggles.  \"Um, well, I've got to head off, but I'm sure mother will be along soon to see you.  Is there anything you need, before I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't be able to hear you anyway, so you don't even attempt to bellow about how you desire your freedom, that as a human being you have the right to go where you please, to challenge yourself in the game of tiny survival in the manner of your choosing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you just smile and give a salute, watching as her smile grows wider, her eyes narrow and she rises to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was a distraction, but you've got to get back to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an hour or so you've sliced the insect into steaks, the salvageable shards of its exoskeleton tied together to be used later for building materials, tools and armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at your makeshift shelter, you stash your supplies away before taking another slice of leaf to chew on for refreshment.  Devya hadn't lied about all the plantlife here being edible, although climbing high enough to harvest from the house-sized leaves was quite a challenge, and the taste was rather bland.  You couldn't live by this alone, hence the hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevya hadn't shown any annoyance at your killing of your room-mates, but she had other things on her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned by your mere thought, the ground begins quaking with approach of a titan being, and you swallow down the last of your sustenance before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevya strides across to you in far more terrifying aspect than her daughter, not smiling at all.  She gives a cursory glance at the other terrariums before slamming a hand down on the glass roof of your world, shuddering the very air itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she says, \"looks like you've adapted fairly well.  But let's not beat around the bush here: are you ready to tell me where your shrinking machine is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she's had other things on her mind recently.  She's set her sights a little bit higher than just keeping one shrunken man as an experiment.  \"I could let you out of here, you know,\" she continues.  \"That's what you want, isn't it?  I'll get a replacement, you can go on your way, we'll all be happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that doesn't strike you as a particularly good idea.  She's been quietly asking about it for the last couple of days, and getting steadily more annoyed at your silence.  Were you to refuse her again, it would not bring any great anger from her, but tomorrow..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat approach should you take to this situation?</span></div></div>",

You've spent more money than you've had in your account all year, yet you smile.  The staff and customers may have looked askance at your relatively slovenly attire, but you're wearing it for reasons other than looking good while eating.

Choking back disgust, you pick up the rucksack that you took the precaution of shrinking earlier; it would have looked very odd to enter the restaurant carrying a bundle of survival gear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting it onto your shoulder, you take stock of the situation.  The toilets are not the place you want to set up any sort of camp.  Hygiene is one concern, as is the possibility of predatory insects that wouldn't think twice about eating you.  Then there's the real possibility of a giant waiter coming in to see why you haven't returned to settle your debt!  No, you need to get out of here as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenturing under the yawning archway of the door,you marvel at the gleaming white chamber beyond, almost a marble temple to the gods.  Almost.  There will be much better sights once you're free of this stench hole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek to the exit will take a few minutes, plenty of time to ponder a destination.  Somewhere to sleep, or maybe staking out a hunting/gathering ground for supplies?  Those can always come later though; being well fed, perhaps a little sight seeing, taking in the giants in their native habitat?  All involve danger. It may be best to recharge the device - emptied by that last shrinking - so that you'll be able to restore yourself when you wish, although that would involve locating a suitable power source...</span></div></div>",

Wind whistled in your ears as hurtled in a slightly concussed daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tumbled head over heels, a bizarre landing spot began to fill your vision. A huge, white lake.

Too disoriented to put together where you were headed, you plummeted half-conscious toward the body of liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Plop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed softly in the swamp.

The ceiling blurred above his head as he carried the delicious-smelling sea you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled with the realization of where you were. A soup. More specifically, a soup that was about to be served. Small islands of chicken and dumplings floated nearby, all dwarfing your quarter inch frame. The broth was too heavy to swim to them. Shreds of spinach were scattered like seaweed. Like you, they didn't even break the surface tension of the aromatic muck. Suddenly, everything pitched as the waiter stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, who had the Chicken Gnocchi?\u201d He asked over a multitude of chattering voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's mine, thanks.\u201d A booming, distinctly female voice said eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, point you were struggling desperately. The device's battery was drained. You were hopelessly tiny and covered in soup. Everything shifted as the waiter lifted the bowl off what you assumed to be a much larger platter. Your stomach dropped as he lowered it rapidly until it landed with a thunderous \u201cClink!\u201d on the table. As he began passing out the other dishes, you peered skyward to see whose dinner you were stranded in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m starving.\u201d The enormous girl rumbled. She looked to be in her early 20\u2019s. Her lidded, blue eyes stared down hungrily. They contrasted quite nicely with dark brown hair and lightly tanned skin. Minimal contouring enhanced what was an already pretty, albeit obscenely humongous, face. Red lipstick drew your gaze to her mouth. The plump lips parted, allowing a glistening tongue to push out. It left them glossed with saliva as it swept over quickly. The spaghetti straps of her white dress left her shoulders mostly uncovered. Her neckline wasn't any more modest. It swept far below her collarbones, displaying a smooth expanse of sunkissed flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arm swung overhead, prepped with a gleaming spoon. You waved and shouted at the top of your lungs from the mire of her meal. It was pointless. You might as well have been a stray hunk of chicken. The stainless-steel tower she held descended toward your spot in the bowl, ready to collect a pool's worth of soup.</span></div></div>",

In a single, chilling motion, she guided the soup into her massive mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chewed slowly, savoring a shed-sized piece of grilled chicken.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways being a fan of shrinking, survival shows, survival stories/scenarios, being a huge environmental conservationist and you being tired of the world. You decide to put all of your money into shrinking yourself and surviving off your surroundings. You told your family and anyone else who care for you in your life that you are traveling the world and will be banning the use of any phones but will leave emails. These emails that you are sending are already made and being automated to send regularly so no one will worry about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you just need to decide what environment you want to shrink yourself in and consider it's dangers and advantages...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackyard survival: You will shrink yourself in your parents' and neighbors' backyard. It will be a grassy jungle where you will truly have to fend for yourself for the most part. In your backyard is the danger of your two parents and 2 younger sisters, in the other backyard is your 47 year old single woman who loves to garden. You will have to watch out for the occasional lawnmower from your dad and be very wary of being in the neighbor's garden for too long. Some miscellaneous dangers with humans but your biggest threat will be insects and the occasional animal. You will almost exclusively be on your own and have to use the maximum of your survival skills as leftover food from humans may be scarce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndoor survival: Quite the opposite as you shrink yourself in the neighbor's home (Neighbors before you moved out for your life change). A strange environment that ranges from a weird jungle of carpet strands to a desert of hardfloor, sources of food and drink can be available in abundance for great risk and limited time. The 39 year olds Rachel and Dan are parents still well into their sexual peak to an 18 year old girl and two younger children.  You will have to be careful for the whims of humans that will be like gods to you. The occasional bug may be a threat but the family is by far the greatest. There is also the safety blanket of them finding you in case things get bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrban survival: Shrunk in the city. You will be in a bumpy mess of concrete, living almost exclusively off of the giants above. The environment will consist of dark corridors to massive amounts of hard ground where giants commute. The danger is being super tiny while thousands of people, rich and poor walk to their destinations, not giving a care for the tiny person they may almost step on. Food will be of abundance but competition with insects and animals may force quick acquisition of weapons and craftiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeach survival: Shrunk at the beach, you stare at one horizon being blue and one being tan. The environment will be either a hot desert speckled with various people depending on the day or a deceptively dangerous sea filled with some waves over thousands of feet tall. Food will be available in the form of human leftovers or sea creatures. Humans are always a threat but the sea life and animals have a new member of their foodchain, depending on how smart and strong you get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRestaurant survival: Surviving at the burger fast food place should've been easy but you wonder just how easy it is. Your environment will be a hard floor with many different weird shaped buildings that are actually seats. Be careful the giant customers and workers. Leftover food will only be available for limited time due to the worker's cleaning and eating fresh food is a huge risk. How long can you survive in this death trap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: The only rule is no underage sexual scenes, kids can be in the story for realistic situations but please no sexual tones with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore on the unaware side with this story but you can be found. Try to stick with the survival environment but if you are found and taken elsewhere, well these things happen although with a creative mind you can always find a way to end up getting stuck back to surviving<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> but it's up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to 4Eva for creating this world, and for the trust and honour I feel at having it transferred into my care.
