            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Summer. Best time of the year, at least as far as David and his girlfriend Ashely were concerned. Ashely was somewhat tall for a 15 year old at 6 feet tall, but she hardly minded. And thanks to her figure being practically born for a bikini, none of the boys in school minded either. Luckily for David, the beach maiden was only too happy to accept him as her boyfriend. She was generally sweet and fun loving, but could get a bit on the selfish side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps that's why she refused to share her fruit smoothie with David today. She wanted to come to the beach today to show him something, but had refused to comment on what it was. He just assumed it was her new bikini, its white color suiting the tanned beauty very well, but something in her brown eyes suggested there might be something else besides that... But she hadn't shared her fruit smoothie, and while David pretended to not mind around her, he secretly had been counting on it and waited for his chance to carry out his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chance came when Ashley left the half-finished beverage behind to go swimming, which David declined going in with her. She pouted slightly at him, leaning forward into his face to present her generous cleavage as incentive to join her, but eventually went in alone after playfully calling David a spoil-sport. While she was in the water, he slipped in a little flask of liquid into her smoothie and stirred the concoction before trying to make it look like the smoothie had been undisturbed. Ashley would be in for a surprise when she next took a drink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile enjoying her time in the water, Ashley thought she spotted something in the shallow waters next to her feet. Something oddly shiny. Her curiosity getting the better of her, the dirty blonde haired girl bent down into the water to retrieve it. Upon closer examination, she found it appeared to be some sort of old coin or medallion of some sort. \"Huh. Wonder who left this thing behind? Oh well, it's mine now. Finder's keepers and all!\" she grinned. Surely David would find this cool as well, and maybe they could come up with some fun story about it later...like those growing girl fantasies he liked so much. As she thought of it, the golden object seemed to glimmer oddly. But the glimmer was ignored in favor of showing David the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to anyone at the beach, however, a strange meteor had crashed into the sea by the beach last night. By the afternoon, the meteorite had been mostly covered by beach sand, so no one noticed it. And indeed, no one would have likely found the hand sized thing...until a certain dirty blonde haired brown eyed tanned beach maiden happened to run and trip over it in her excitement over showing the cool medallion. Ashley fell face-first into the sand as a result. Picking herself up, (though tempted to let David help her to her feet even if she was taller than him) Ashley pondered whether she should throw the thing out to sea or just leave it alone and show her boyfriend the medallion...though perhaps after finishing her fruit smoothie. She could certainly use it right about now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley ultimately decided to leave the space rock alone. She had read enough stories about weird things happening to people who purposefully touch those things, and she didn't want to end up being one of those. She was weird enough as is, in her own delightful way. So she returned to her beach chair and went to take another drink of her fruit smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is, until Ashley noticed that her straw was oddly out of position from where she left it. At first she thought that David had taken a sip from her fruit smoothie behind her back, which she wouldn't <i>actually</i> mind, but the look on his face seemed...somehow suspicious. Upon closer examination, the beach maiden noted how there was slightly <i>more</i> liquid in her drink than when she left it. Now she suspected he put something in her drink, probably to make it taste awful to get back at her for not sharing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Ashley was going to share it with him now. She picked up the smoothie and walked behind David, then dumped it all over his head. \"Whoops, clumsy me!\" she said with a playful giggle that told her boyfriend it was not an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quickly guessed that his efforts to hide his addition to Ashley's fruit smoothie weren't good enough, only now remembering how detail oriented his girlfriend could be. That came in handy as a lab partner in Science class, but made pulling pranks on her very hard. Trying to avoid fully admitting his guilt, he asked, \"So what did you want to show me today here at the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley showed David the gold medallion she had found in the water, and said, \"In a minute, David... But first, look at what I found in the water! Isn't it neat? We could make up stories about it later when we get back to my place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's interest was piqued. This certainly looked like something out of his fantasies, but he set it aside and asked Ashley, \"That's interesting and all, but I think I'm getting a little tired of fantasies at the moment... And how much longer are you going to keep me guessing on what you wanted to show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley brushed her dirty blonde hair away from her brown eyes and smiled. \"Hm... I don't know if I <i>should</i> show you. You didn't want to go swimming with me, and you just said you're tired of fantasies...\" she teased, but finally revealed, \"Does that also go for fantasies that can be made <i>real</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught David's attention, and he asked with suspicion, \"What do you mean, fantasies that can be made real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley giggled and replied, \"Oh, just this.\" she suddenly started inching up in height, but only a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was convinced she was standing on her tip-toes to mess with him...until he looked down and noticed that her feet were still flat on the ground. Her bikini still fit her perfectly fine. \"What the-\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And THIS!\" Ashley cut him off and this time grew more. She left 7 feet behind, and then 8 feet. 9 feet met the same fate, and then so did 10 feet. David was speechless as she grew past 11 feet and then stopped at 12 feet tall, twice her original height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you <i>do</i> that?\" David stammered out after a minute of gawking up at the bottom of her breasts. He was definitely turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By willing it, of course! Now, I can do the same thing and shrink back down, and whatever I'm wearing sticks with me unless I will it otherwise, but where's the fun in getting smaller so soon? I can grow so much bigger than this!\" Ashley explained. As much as that turned David on, he also had a bad feeling she might get a bit too carried away with it. Especially if she was enjoying what she was doing...</span></div></div>",

She was definitely enjoying the moment to the fullest and wasn't going to let anyone interrupt her from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Ash, I don't think that the other visitors are very fond of what you're doing right now\" said David somewhat fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley on the other hand beamed a sinister grin on her face instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about what those peasants' thoughts, only yours have any value to me. Speaking of your thoughts....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley took one powerful step closer to David so that she would be right in front of, in order to make her tremendous size very clear to him. Her sinister grin was filled with pure desire and lust for him, which even surprised him somewhat, as he didn't know she care SO much about him that she would reveal this power of hers in front of everybody just to make his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like to see me grow, don't you?\" Said Ashley with complete confidence and control within her voice, David was so hypnotized by her manner of speaking that he remained silent simply because his mouth refused to move, along with the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even deny it, you like to see every part of my body growing bigger, like my breasts... my curves... my hands... my ass... and even my enormous feet, don't you?\" Said Ashley as if she read David's mind about his foot fetish.... which is now very likely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, if she hasn't caught David already, her feet comment certainly has caught him now. While the rest of his body refused to move, his eyes refused to look away from her beautiful black-nail polished feet, as her grin grew wider and wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind if i rest my feet on your lap, do you?\"</span></div></div>",

It only made sense that a perfectionist such as Ashley would strive to make every part of her body flawless for the person that she loved more than any other person in the world, and her slender, soft, enormous soles and toes were a highlight of her efforts. The heat emanating from her sweaty, steamy soles were comparable to holding your hands close to a fireplace; extremely comfortable and David was beyond fascinated how perfect his girlfriend was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you think i took care of my feet well enough Davey?\u201d Ashley said already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.........\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, earth to Davey! Are you going to reply or should I consider your pervert stare at my gorgeous feet as a yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last one\u201d David said now only half hypnotized by her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhahaha! Glad to hear that! Though I already knew that since we first met\u201d said Ashley teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be fair, it\u2019s kinda your fault that i developed this fetish in the first place. It didn\u2019t even cross my mind until then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is my fault that my feet are so perfect?! I guess perfectionists are doomed to be too perfect for their own good~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t think a perfectionist wouldn\u2019t forget her gym shoes, would she? If you simply stayed true to your title, I would be as innocent now as i was back then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorth it, Seeing as we became a couple because it! Maybe it wasn\u2019t a mistake after all~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-i remember that moment all too well\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.... maybe it wasn\u2019t such idea to remind me of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come Ash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thinking about it makes me so.... ohhhhh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Ashley\u2019s body felt that now should be the time to have another growth spurt, most likely caused by her arousal thinking back to when they became a couple. They growing giantess and her foot slave didn\u2019t seem to notice or care about the surrounding spectators of fellow beach goers looking at her grow larger while squeezing her breasts tightly and moaning in delight. It\u2019s as if they didn\u2019t exist for the lustful couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth ended with her being a few feet taller and even more dominanting. Her gaze at him had never waived from him while David was having trouble doing the same her now even more enormous feet kept tugging for his attention. This didn\u2019t really help with her narcissism, as it was making it skyrocket instead, much like her physical size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, i\u2019m sorry my dear Davey. I didn\u2019t mean to make my feet even more irresistible. It\u2019s just that i got so exited thinking about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.......there was always a reason why i\u2019m glad that you weren\u2019t born in the middle ages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat reason? They couldn\u2019t see my size powers as witchcraft if I didn\u2019t used them, could they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but the spell your feet put people under is a dead giveaway\u201d David said cheekily. Surprisingly, Ashley became very flustered with David\u2019s comment, and he received a brief moment of dominance. Of course, it was short lived, as her flustered expression turned into a lustful one as she leaned closer and closer. She grabbed hold of his head so that he would be looking at what she wants him to look at. The feeling of power had completely vanished for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, my feet do put people under a spell, but i want you to be the only one to look at them.... feel them.... taste them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley then shoved David\u2019s face almost into her foot, nearly getting the mixture of sand and sweat onto his face, though he honestly wouldn\u2019t mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuck my toes Davey..... now. I know that you have been holding yourself back ever since we began dating. I hated that so much, so i\u2019m going to make you worship my feet as much as you want. Go ahead, they\u2019re all yours.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...... this is just like back then, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.....huh, i guess it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why but i feel like that\u2018s worth talking about again, don\u2019t you agree too Ash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched as Nicole absolutely DESTROYED her competition in track and field. Again. Okay, you were mostly watching 'dat ass' of hers, but with it being as big and muscle-packed as it was, it was hard not to. Not that the rest of her left much to be desired, but you like big butts; (and everything else but flab or bellies) you cannot lie. And hers was <i>big</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a towering (for a girl) 6'2\", Nicole had virtually no fat. She was over 190 lbs of almost pure muscle, though she wasn't ripped. It was the pleasant, feminine muscle kind; the kind that made the 18 year old very well toned, built for excellent endurance than overwhelming strength. Her tanned skin gave the appearance of having played outdoor sports year round, which was just about true. You had the bruises and scratches to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whenever you got hurt when playing together, Nicole would drop what she was doing to tend to you and make sure you were alright. Between you and sports, the outgoing girl might actually stick with you. However, as much as she loved you, you couldn't take that which she enjoyed so much away from her. And thus you had tried out for some...with varying success. Interestingly, when she raced you, she gave you a head start. Sometimes she waited until you were but a few steps from the finish line before she started, thus throwing the race. But if she didn't, she would beat you hands down every time. Even if you tried to wear Nike shoes like she was virtually never seen in anything but that brand. Talk about customer loyalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, you did wish Nicole was taller. A lot taller. Bustier wouldn't hurt either to complement her prodigious posterior, but a giant Nicole occupied your deepest fantasies. And most other attractive females both young and old, but your girlfriend especially. However, an interesting fact about Nicole was that she was <i>shorter</i> than you less than a week ago. Now she was taller. It's a little late for a growth spurt, and especially one so big, but your fetish ensured that you weren't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today she was a full 2 inches taller than yesterday. You weren't complaining, but you were curious as to if there was a cause that could be...modified or influenced to make her grow even bigger...and bigger. \"Hi, Nicole!\" you greeted her in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! David! Were you watching me beat the pants off of that girl...or were your eyes glued to my butt again?\" Nicole said somewhat playfully. She tended to know where your stares went. And often stood on her toes to make herself appear even bigger, almost as if she knew what you were into...but you never told her anything about it as you didn't want to force her into becoming a giantess purely for your sake like you knew she would do if she was aware. There wasn't much she wasn't willing to do for your sake she loved you that much, and that actually concerned you. What would she do if you decided to break up with her? Would she commit suicide? You hoped not, as you didn't want her death on your conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, so far you didn't have to worry about it as you had no plans to dump her. In the meantime, you looked down at the ground halfheartedly and admitted in an equally halfhearted manner, \"Guilty as charged. But I'm a man. And I can change. If I have to. I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's response was to giggle and wrap you in a hug that was beyond anything a bear could deliver. This was more like a constrictor squeezing the life out of its prey, only more enjoyable. It could certainly save on trips to a back massage therapist; if your back was feeling in a knot, ask Nicole for a hug. Problem solved! \"Oh really? Well I don't mind so much, though I'd like to think I've got some merits higher up. But I guess since my last growth spurt my backside is just that much more in view, huh?\" Nicole said half-teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but isn't it a bit late for those? I don't mind, of course, just saying.\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...Well if my body wants to get bigger, that just means that much more of me to love, right David?\" Nicole winked and then headed for the showers. The green-eyed brunette was soaked with her own sweat, and wanted to change into something more casual. Though her casual shoes were also Nike shoes...</span></div></div>",

You just took her extensive success at face value, never once thinking that there might be something more to it. Perhaps the two of you could also work on your history assignment on Greek mythology, since Nicole had claimed to already be done last time you talked with her. You found it odd, however: while she did somewhat poorly with modern history, (a 60 on her last test on the subject, lowest in the class) she was at the top of the class for this particular subject...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure has turned awfully stormy all of a sudden...\u201d you said as you noted the storm clouds having rolled in within the span of a minute or so from a perfectly clear sky. How odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Crap.</font> Uh...y-yeah... I-I guess you want to head back to your place before it gets worse, right?\" Nicole said with an unusual hint of nervousness in her voice, almost like she <i>wanted</i> you to go. However at this point her house was closer, and something told you that Nicole was hiding something and this freak storm had something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good. Besides, we're almost to your place.\" you point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh yeah. Well, let's hurry. And by 'us', I mean 'you'. Wouldn't want to leave you eating my dust!\" Nicole teased, and the two of you ran the rest of the way. <i>Conveniently</i> just narrowly avoiding the downpour as you and she headed inside, almost like something was making the clouds wait for one of you to get to shelter. And it probably wasn't you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, her parents weren't home. Come to think of it, you've never seen them, let alone met them. You follow Nicole downstairs into the game room, by far the largest room in the house. \"I'll be right back. Gotta empty my gym bag of these clothes or else it's going to reek. You know where everything is, David, so help yourself!\" she said absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you were hardly one to refuse Nicole's hospitality, so you looked around at all the trophies on the wall to see if you could spot any new ones, then checked her PS3 out of curiosity. You noted the slightly dusty case cover on the floor: the latest God of War game. You were with her when she bought it, but her game library consisted of little else. What was it about Kratos she liked so much? You turned around, only to come face-to-face with...an old man?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!!!\" you yelped out of surprise. He had a beard and wore predominantly white clothing. He was alarmingly well built, and had a commanding presence. The weirdest thing was that he was completely dry despite the downpour still going on outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I thought I was her only visitor today. Must have forgotten...\" the man said with a voice almost like crashing thunder. He then said, \"No matter. You'd find out sooner or later, my boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what he meant until Nicole walked out from the laundry room with...<i>wings</i>?! You always thought of her like an angel, but this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...busted, aren't I?\" Nicole said, and to your shock her wings drooped with her mood. Her wings were very much real! They were pretty though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nicole? What's going on? And who's this old guy?\" you asked, somehow finding words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole? So that's what you go by in this modern age! I'll be sure to let Athena know. Although these gold...trophies seem a bit tacky...\" the man mentioned. Wait. Athena? As in the Greek goddess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeus, I've earned those trophies. I find it nice to receive rewards for a change instead of handing them out all the time. Not that we actually do much of anything these days. Even you resorted to putting on a show just to visit me.\" Nicole stated bluntly. Zeus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine. The skies are clear now.\" he said, and from the sound of things outside, the clouds dispersed in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole then turned her gaze to you and said with a slightly sad tone, \"David, I'm sorry I never told you sooner. As much as these wings make me seem like an angel, I'm not. My real name is Nike. I'm the goddess of victory. But I guess the trophy wall kind of speaks for itself. And yes, my powers do include knowing where someone is looking at me at a particular moment. Or whatever happens to be on their mind. I came here mostly out of boredom, but I have to say I'm delighted at most of the things named after or inspired by me. Especially the Nike company!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I suppose I should introduce you to the king of the gods, well of us Greek ones. David, this is Zeus. Zeus, this is David.\" you offer your hand for Zeus to shake, and he accepts it - almost crushing your hand accidentally. Nike sighed and put her hand to her face as you attempted to shake feeling back into your hand after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...suppose you hold back with your strength when you hug, then.\" you commented and Nike nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and make my wings disappear, though it's always a relief to have them back. I can't hide them indefinitely, just as he can't stay away from a female's skirt for long.\" Nike said, though not going into detail over what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've...gotta go. I'll be right back, trust me.\" you said and left the room for the bathroom upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you went fully up the stairs, you caught a part of the two gods' conversations. It still blew your mind that you were dating a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You care for him, don't you? He might not accept you now that he knows the truth, and even if he does, you would do well to remember that he is <i>just</i> a mortal boy. Sooner or later he will die, while you will not. I can't command where your heart lies, but your time with him is limited regardless.\" you heard Zeus say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust David to see past it, especially for what I have planned for him. I know his time will come, father, but it just means I need to make it count.\" Nike said, and it sounded like she was standing her ground. You go up and relieve yourself, but do you go back down, or run?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ultimately, you talk yourself out of running. Nicole/Nike could easily outrun you, could fly, and...you'd have to probably face her tomorrow at school. Plus she had honestly put her trust in you, and breaking the trust of a being way more powerful than you is definitely a bad idea. Not to mention Zeus might take offense and send a thunderbolt down your spine and that would be bad. So that left going back down and seeing what it was that your goddess girlfriend (literally) had planned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back downstairs to the game room and went inside, and said, \"I'm back, Nicole...er, I mean, Nike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNike smiled and looked over at Zeus, holding her hand out. \"Told you he would come back. Pay up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe god grumbled slightly, which you would have almost confused for the rumble of an approaching storm, and handed over a few gold coins. This didn't seem to satisfy the goddess of victory as she said, \"*ahem*In a usable currency for this country, please.\" And with a further grumble, the coins changed into a ten dollar bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you two were taking bets on whether I'd run away screaming at this news? That my girlfriend is a goddess?\" you said with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Completely his idea.\" Nike answers, unfolding her wings to try and look innocent like an angel. You're not sure if you believe her, but you weren't really offended. Your girlfriend then turns to Zeus and asked, \"Now, this hourglass of Chronos will work, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king of the Greek gods nodded and replied, \"Once turned over, time will slow until the sands no longer fall. Gods won't be affected, and its bearer is immune to its effects as well. Though I fail to see why you wanted to borrow it, Nike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because what I have planned for David may very well take a lot longer than we have left for tonight, and we have school tomorrow that I've no intention of missing. Or letting <i>you</i> miss, David.\" Nike said to both you and Zeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus chuckled slightly, and then presented a small hourglass tied to a golden necklace in such a way that it wasn't impeded from being turned over. While it didn't seem any more ornate than that, for such a small thing it felt somewhat hefty. It had to be the hourglass they were talking about. When you looked up again, however, Zeus was already partway up the stairs as he said, \"Very well, I'll leave you two to your plans. Though perhaps next week you can teach me how to play this...darts game you've described the other day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNike nodded and said, \"Shouldn't be too hard.\" and then Zeus left. You had no idea if it was through the door or simply vanishing, but you nonetheless felt a bit relieved to be out of his commanding presence. And while you still wanted to know what her plan was...you needed a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, you found yourself on a couch. Looking around, you recognized your location as Nicole's game room. Was everything just a dream? A look at Nicole next to you, wings still in full view, strongly suggested no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon, sleepyhead. No, you weren't dreaming. Unless you like dreaming about old guys that look like they could bench-press cars before breakfast, but I doubt it.\" she winked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...no. No, I tend to dream about tall girls. Especially ones with feathery wings that happen to be Greek goddesses.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, if you'll just step outside with me, we can begin my plans for you! I <i>know</i> you're going to love it!\" Nicole/Nike said happily, as evidenced by how her wings rose up with her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what this would be, you followed her outside and she closed the door behind you. You then asked, \"So what are these plans, Nicole - I mean, Nike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, she said, \"Either name is more than fine by me, David. As for my plans...\" she reached over to the hourglass hanging on your neck and turned it over, causing the sand now at the top to slowly pour to the bottom - and time seemed to suddenly almost stop. Nicole then announced to you, \"Until the sand runs out, I intend to make your fantasy of really tall girls reality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that, the winged girl began to grow. Soon she was 10 feet tall, and wasn't stopping. You were so turned on that any and all misgivings about your girlfriend earlier melted away, and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needn't worry about my surroundings. I won't inflict any harm no matter how big I grow for you. Once the sand runs out, I will return everything to normal, but...that won't happen for a <i>long</i> while yet. Unless, that is, you tip the hourglass back over before the halfway point to end it early. And you could tip it back over past the halfway mark to...extend the effect, if you wanted.\" Nike winked as she rose above 20 feet. Her clothes were growing with her, and as her casual wear served to emphasize her curves from her big breasts to her even larger posterior, you couldn't be happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is this <i>big</i> enough girl for you yet, David?\" the 30 foot tall winged goddess before you asked in an almost seductive tone.</span></div></div>",

The 16 year old's backyard was HUGE, and a tad unkempt during the summer when it was just too darn hot to cut the grass. David jokingly referred it as going into Savannah's savanna, to which the blonde haired, blue eyed girl took a liking to and started referring to it as that herself. She often told David how she wanted to go to the African savannah...and the Australian outback...and the North Pole...and outer space... the list went on. She loved adventure, some would say THRIVED on it, and knew the forest beyond her backyard easily like the back of her own pale hand. David never understood why she was so pale when the only time she was indoors was when she absolutely had to be. She hated being indoors, and was always dressed in the clothes of an adventurer. David felt her outfit made her look like a female version of Indiana Jones, to which her response was to kiss him at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday would be the start of a new adventure for Savannah. One of giant proportions - literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go out to a restaurant, Savannah? We could explore this new place that opened up... I think it's called, Titan's Bounty?\" David suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavannah thought about it for a second. She was feeling slightly hungry, but more for adventure than for food. She looked at David lying there like a lump. A lump that she nonetheless found herself attracted to. \"Or, we could dig in the forest for possible buried treasure. You never know.\" She proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of treasure, David remembered this mysterious potion for lack of a better term that he found in some dusty old shop, with the description cryptically stating, 'drink, and become the hearts' desire' He assumed the apostrophe being after the 's' to be a spelling mistake but curiosity won over and he had bought it anyway. He was going to challenge Savannah into drinking this, believing it to be just a hoax and nothing more but knowing she couldn't resist a challenge, when another idea popped into his head. Savannah had told him the other day about this gun she found abandoned by her driveway. He had his suspicions as to what it was, and dreamed of her using it on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, it could be fun...but what about that toy gun thing you found the other day? I dare ya to try it on yourself!\" David announced, then quickly added, \"Or...you try out this odd potion thing I've got here, said to make the drinker the 'hearts' desire'. It's misspelled, so it's gotta be worth a hoot, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavannah narrowed her eyes and smiled. Oh how she loved challenges, but she wanted to be sure the proverbial gauntlet had been thrown. \"Is that a challenge, David? Shoot a toy gun at myself, or drink your joke drink. Is that right?\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly she pauses apparently for no reason, but David notices that the cuffs of her beige shorts look to be biting into the flesh of her thighs more then usual. Moving his gaze upwards, he notices that the edge of her white blouse is being pulled out of the waistband of her shorts. \"Whoa!\" Savannah shouts as with one more jolt her entire body shutters upwards ending just shy of of six feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The six inches of added height making her stretched out clothing look like she had raided a siblings closets. \"That was amazing!

The increased inches added to the length of her legs making for fewer strides as she walked over to him. Sidling up behind David, Savannah realized that she could now look down significantly at David as she now had an extra eight inches on David's own five four height.   </span></div></div>",
