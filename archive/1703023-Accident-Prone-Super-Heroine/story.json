She was a super hero yet had to deal with stuff like finals and her swimsuit dissolving in the water during practice.  Her brother had given her the swimsuit, which she thought was unusually kind of him.  She did tend to run through things like that inordinately fast, so she thought he had decided to be nice for once.  It turns out it was a prank swimsuit that simply melted away.  In front of Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just tried to start thinking about finals when she heard screaming in the neighborhood, several streets over.  She froze.  She couldn't simply run there; she needed to don her disguise, or her identity may become known.  Yet there was little privacy to be had to change into her suit, and she wasn't impossibly fast like Superman.</span></div></div>",

So she ran towards the screaming and hoped she\u2019d find time to change later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran three blocks to get to the area and nearly wet herself when she saw a monster picking up vehicles and throwing them at buildings. She wanted to fight it, but there were still people around. Cathy turned around and ran off to find a place to change into her costume. She reached a fence and climbed it, but as she was going to the other side, her skirt got caught on the top and when she jumped down, it ripped off and she was left in her panties. Thinking she could go back for it later, she kept running.</span></div></div>",

What made it worse was that a few people had seen her so far. The only good thing about that is that they were so busy running for their lives, they weren\u2019t too focused on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found an alley and went behind a dumpster to change. She quickly took off her shoes, socks, and shirt. Just as she was about to get her costume out of her backpack, a large shadow was cast on her. She looked up and saw a car, about to fall on her. She moved out of the way in time, but the car had landed on the clothes she had just taken off and her backpack. Now she was standing in just her underwear. Cathy would have used her strength to lift up the car and get her things back, but then she saw a large crowd of scared people running towards her. She had no choice but to run or else she would have been trampled. \"Damn monster!,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow half naked and running alongside a crowd of fully dressed people, not to mention the monster terrorizing the city, Cathy wondered if things could get any worse.</span></div></div>",

Her bra scraped against the rough brick wall with every breath she took, while the one behind pinched and pulled at her panties whenever she leant against it. She waited there for a few moments before peeking her head out into the alley. Empty. The people were gone. With a sigh of relief, Cathy slipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the distant cries of the city reached her ears, she knew that she had to act fast. But down here, amongst the regular people, there was simply too much to distract her. Using her powers she flew off the ground and headed onto the roof of the nearest building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRough gravel crunched beneath her bare feet as she landed upon it. Apart from a TV aerial and a stairway into the building there was nothing up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had lost more than enough clothing for one day, so rather cleverly (or so she told herself), she unhooked her bra and, clutching her bare breasts with one hand, hooked them onto the TV aerial. It sagged ever so slightly, but held. She slipped her thumb into the waist of her panties and pulled them down her legs, daintily stepping out of them and placing them alongside the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way if I have an accident with my suit I can always come back here for these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly she removed her hand from her breasts and reached up to her shoulder. She touched bare flesh. She tried the other shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell is my backpack?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crept towards the edge of the roof and looked down onto the alley she had been hiding in. There was no sign of it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course!\" she said, slapping herself in the head \"It's buried under the car with the rest of my clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

Cathy then looked around the alley for something cover herself with. After some searching she found a large trashcan lid to cover the front of her body and a smaller lid to cover her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs people were still screaming in fear, Cathy felt pressured to get her costume as soon as possible. \"Here goes nothing!\" She exclaimed. She then left the alley and ran towards the alley where she left her backpack was as fast as she could. While she was running to the alley, many people were whistling and gawking at her naked (but pretty well covered) body. Cathy ignored them and blushed intensely. \"Here it is, but how am I going to move this car without anyone or the news copter noticing?\" She thought. \"There's to no time to think Cathy, just move the car and end this nightmare!\". She said. Cathy then dropped the trashcan lids and threw the car out of the alley. Luckily no one saw Cathy doing this. \"Here it is!, my backpack, boy I hope I didn't forget my costume!\". Cathy then opened her backpack to find her costume and mask. She then let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy then noticed nobody was paying attention to the alley she was in, so she quickly tried to slip on her white spandex costume as quickly as possible and showing off as little as possible. She then slipped on her red mask. She was very happy to have some clothing on and eager to take down the monster.  As soon as she exited the alley  she noticed her friend Jenn was completely naked!! With her right hand cover her breats and left covering her snatch. Cathy then went up to her and asked what happened. Jenn replied \"oh thank goodness it's mega girl!, the monster terrorizing the city has some sort of beam that disentegrates all the clothing you are wearing! Watch out, or you'll end up in your birthday suit like me!\". Cathy then nodded and flew towards the monster when suddenly....</span></div></div>",

The news copter following cathy was getting great footage of the bare women at the ground level. \"Oh shit, If i get hit with that beam, the news copter will expose my secret identity to the world!\" she thought. Cathy then went over to the news copter and said \"sorry this camera needs to go, hope you dont mind\". Cathy then takes the camera and then throws it across the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then set her sights on the monster, the monster noticed and fired a beam at cathy. She barely managed to dodge it. The beam instead hit the female newscaster Melissa Lockheart: a slightly chubby and busty dark haired white woman. \"WHAT THE HELL, IM NAKED, DON'T LOOK AT ME\". Said Melissa. Melissa then ordered that the copter go back to headquarters to prevent people from seeing her. \"Now I dont have to worry about them, good\". Thought cathy. She then tried to surprise the monster from behind. But the monster heard her and smacked her into the ground. \"that hurt\". Cathy then heard the screams of humiliation of many nude women trying to run away from the monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy then tried to devise a plan. After a couple of seconds of thinking. She decided it was best to attack the monster at its legs by attacking it from the ground.Cathy then ran towards the monster and punched its leg. The monster roared in pain. And kicked cathy in retaliation. Cathy then flew a couple of blocks away from the monster and was in a little bit of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow 4 blocks away from the monster, cathy noticed that the whole town had evacuated except for Angela Hoffman, a newspaper journalist who specialized in writing stories about superheroines. Cathy had no time to worry about Angela, she then in a fit of frustration, flew and punched the monsters stomach as hard as she could. The monster then let out a beam of its mouth that hit angela! Angela then grabbed a newspaper and used it to cover her now naked self. She then evacuated the city like the rest of the nude public. \"AAAAHHHHH, IM IN MY BIRTHDAY SUIT\" Screamed angela as she ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy then went in for the finishing blow by punching its head, but the monster recovered faster then expected. It then opened its mouths and slowly let out a beam. While the monster was opening its mouth cathy let out a loud \"NNNNNNNOOOOOOO\". The beam then hit cathy. Completely disintegrating her costume and more importantly her mask! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy then used her hands to cover her face as quickly as possible. She didnt care about her breasts, goodies and ass being exposed. All she cared about was preserving her secret identity.The monster then hit cathy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy then landed in a victorias secret. While still covering her face. She grabbed a red cotton thong and a white sports bra and headed towards the changing room, in the changing room cathy spotted a burlesque face mask. She put in on, along with the underwear and made one last shot at the monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy then jumped at the monsters head when it wasnt looking and hit its brain. Knocking it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its time to get out of here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy then flew to her house, but stopped at a pair of bushes and removed her mask and underwear. She then ran towards her house in the buff and snuck in through the back window and walked in to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a nap\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her troubles were not over ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sliding her backpack to the ground next to her, she stands up to her full height, and in doing so realizes that the bushes only come up to just above her round, full breasts, and that if she were to stand at her full height at the wrong time someone could spot her head and come investigate. 'Or see something else,' she thought, blushing to herself madly. 'Might as well get on with this' she thought 'before someone shows up or its too late.' Crouching down again, she grabs her full body, skin tight suit out of her backpack, and sets it down on a low hanging branch next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly another scream rips through the air, spurring Cathy into action. Quickly, she pulls her shirt off of her head, exposing her bra and large breasts to the open air, the chill reminding her of her exposure. Pushing these thoughts away, Cathy kicked off her shoes and socks, and pulled her skirt down to the ground and off of her legs, leaving her wearing nothing more than a lacy blue bra and a black thong. 'Oh my god' she thought, 'if anyone were to see me right now I don't know what I would do.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy shivered again, before realizing that somebody needed her help, and spurring herself on with a 'you can do it girl!' thought, she unclasped her bra, sliding it down her arms and off her body, allowing it to fall to the ground. Before she could let the mortification of having her heaving breasts simply hanging out in front of her, uncovered by anything, in public get to her, she takes her panties and slides them down her legs, kicking them off and revealing a light patch of blonde fuzz. Blushing madly, she thinks to herself, 'Oh god... this is horrifying...

The crowds of people below were still screaming, but what had sounded like fear from a distance now seemed like cat calls and lame pick up lines.  \"These are the people I'm trying to save,\" she muttered.  Meanwhile, the super villain changed the level of his gun and fired at her again, but instead of disintegrating clothes that she no longer had, it knocked her right out of the sky and into a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed madly.  \"You can't fight me without risking your identity, girl, so I'm going to humiliate you until I get bored or you run away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the rubble, Cathy realized that the building she had crashed into was a clothing outlet store.  She grabbed a shirt, pulled it over her head, and tied it around like a mask.  \"Stop monologuing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super villain realized that the naked heroine was surrounded by clothes and fired his disintegration ray, but Cathy saw it coming and flew out of the way and went outside.  She picked up a car to throw at him when a man on the street interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on!  You can't take that car.  That's my car.\"  His eyes raked over her naked body.  \"Of course, with a body like that, I'm sure we can come to some...arrangement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizen, you just lost your car privileges.\"  She flew up in the air with the car and shouted at the super villain.  \"Hey, pervert with the ray gun!  You want to play?  Let's play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super villain's eyes grew wide behind his mask.  \"Um, actually, if you want to stop playing, I'm fine with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late.\"  She threw the car at his head.  She figured that if that didn't knock him out, nothing would.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before the news reporters could get there, or anyone else with a camera, Cathy flew into the sky and headed home.  If she flew all the way to her house, someone might discover her secret identity, so she had to land about a mile away and make the rest of the way on foot.  She undid her mask and wore it like a shirt, wishing that she had picked a bigger one, and covered her crotch with her hands.  Hopefully, no one who saw her would match the masked marvel with the half naked girl running down the street.  Heck, chances were that no one who saw her would notice anything besides her exposed butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of her neighbors saw her, but they didn't do much besides wave and say hi because they were all used to seeing her come home in even less.  When she got home, she opened up the door and saw her little brother, Randy, watching tv on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cathy,\" he said looking up at her and seeing that she wasn't wearing pants.  \"I was going to ask you how swim meet went, but it looks like you had even more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy glared at her fourteen year old brother.

That's mine, you little twerp!  Give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy waved the shirt around like he was a matador.  \"You want it?  Come and get it.\"  Cathy charged, but got nothing besides another spank.  \"Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't run so fast after I break your legs,\" she snarled, charging again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, as much as I hate to enjoy dancing with my sister, you make this fun,\" Randy said.  \"I really should film this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to dance?\" Cathy demanded, lifting up a couch over her head.  \"Fine.  Let's dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the couch flew to the ceiling and Cathy and Randy flew to opposite walls.  Their telepathic mother walked into the room with disappointment on her face.  \"How many times do I have to tell you two, no roughhousing!\" she said.  \"If you're going to fight, take it outside.\"  She looked at Cathy.  \"But you're not going anywhere dressed like that.  Honestly, I know you're in the privacy of your own home, but we have windows.  It simply isn't decent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the one who took my clothes!\" she said, pointing accusingly at Randy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who threatened to break my legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Mom shouted.  \"I don't want to hear about it.  Both of you, go to your room, right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom,\" they chorused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy glared at Randy in the hallway.  \"Gremlin,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Troll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy slammed her bedroom door--accidentally.  If she slammed it intentionally, there'd have been splinters--and threw herself on her bed.  So far, it had been an incredibly rotten day.  She wanted to boil herself in the shower, but on the other hand, she could check if her superhero organization had any missions for her.  Slamming a criminal's head through a concrete wall could be just what she needed right now.  Either way, the day couldn't get any worse.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for Cathy, he was also an evil genius in miniature.  Short, smug, and maniacal, he made it his solemn duty to make Cathy's life miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd because their parents were super villains too, Cathy could hardly go to them for help.  To them, Randy was their darling little honors student while Cathy was a rebellious teenager with a drug problem, her drug of choice being heroics.  They loved her, of course, trying to take over the world didn't change that, but they made it clear that they wished that she could be a bit more evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy tugged at the hem of her shirt.  She could cover the important bits in front of she bent over slightly and stretched the shirt to its limits, but that exposed her butt completely, so she made sure to face her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randy,\" she said coldly, \"I am going to go up to my room, put some clothes on, and then do something horrible to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed.  \"Like what?  Turn me over to the proper authorities?  Good luck with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grit her teeth, but he had a point.  There wasn't a lot she could do without losing her super hero status, and even less to a family member.  Still, she'd think of something.  She turned around, careful to cover her butt as soon as it came into view, and started to trudge off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Randy called after her.  \"News flash, you flashed the news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around before realizing that she was still covering her butt while exposing her front and facing him, giving him an eyeful.  Which was a pointless thing to worry about, because she was completely naked on TV, wearing only a makeshift mask.  She had been so focused on the man with the Nude-Ray, she hadn't noticed the local news station filming the whole thing.  And because they cast the news live (and because Cathy couldn't sue them without exposing her secret identity), Cathy's super powered alter ego was displayed to the world naked and uncensored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she moaned.  Now everyone she knew, even the one's who wouldn't recognize her, had seen her naked.  Whenever she put on her spandex super suit to fight evil, she'd be remembered as the super heroine who was filmed flying around naked.  It was almost enough to give up vigilantism all together \u2026 but that was what her parents would want, and she wasn't going to give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy grinned.  \"I can't wait to see Mom and Dad's faces when they find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy frowned.  The Nude-Ray \u2026 that was the sort of thing that their father liked to invent.  Other super villains built death rays and doomsday devices, but their father designed weapons for chaos and humiliation.  \"Dad didn't invent that, did he?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy grinned and said \u2026</span></div></div>",

Descending quickly, her skirt flying up, she saw Leroy focus entirely on her, while the nuns began to run, seeing their opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeroy continued to fire his lasers at her, missing each time, or just barely skimming her suit, making tears at odd angles and places.
