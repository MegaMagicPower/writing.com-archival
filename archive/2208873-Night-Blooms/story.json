Few set foot in the dark woods, except the few who live in its embrace and those who profit off it, those who mutilate and destroy it; farmers who tear down the trees, fisherman who steal the water life, and worst of all, poachers, those who dare to venture into nature only to slaughter it and return with their prizes held high, proud of their murder of those innocent creature the forest does hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a section of this wood, not too far in, yet further than most gentlefolk venture, in the dead of night, a single light source floats in the dark, a lone torch held in the grasps of a wicked poacher, hauling abound, yet still living dear, whos cries had attracted attention from those who would save it, a single drow elf - Gilden Nightglade - who will stop at nothing to save the innocent creature and \"deal with\" the intruder. Armed only with a slingshot and curved knife, he will still fight to defend his home, but where will he begin?</span></div></div>",

Poacher!\" Gilden spat the word with such vitriol that it revealed his deep veined hatred of those who would seek to harm the natural world, his world.<br>\r\nThe poacher simply smiles, a toothy grin creeping slowly across his face, he was obviously not intimidated by the 5'4, very feminine, Drow Elf. Placing down the dear and unsheathing his sword, he remarks on his view of the elf.\"I've been looking for an exotic meal or another fucktoy, you'll do nicely\". \"This'll be easy\" remarks the poacher, openly cocky.<br>\r\nThe two opponents circle each other, each one sizing up the other. The short, feminine, elf has great agility and perception but would surely be overcome in a battle of strength. The tall, well built, poacher sports brute strength, only not backed by any great wit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will strike first? What will Gilden do?

Grabbing Gilden's hands and roughly forcing them behind his back, causing Gilden to cry out in sobering pain, and quickly wrapping them together,  pulling hard as the rope bites into Gilden's wrists causing him once more to scream. The intruder then performs the same act on Gilden's legs, though taking his time to rub in his victory now that Gilden was is neutralised. The poacher lifts Gilden by his ankles, dragging his face into the ground and then to add insult to injury, knees his hard in the stomach as Gilden screams out once more, crying now. Gilden is then dropped hard and his ankles bound tightly, the poacher demonstrating his wealth of experience at tying up helpless prey. <br>\r\n\"Shut up stupid whore, I've had enough off your screaming.\" The poacher tears a piece of cloth from Gilden's outfit and hooks it into his mouth from behind - garrote style - then pulling back hard, biting into his cheecks as Gilden bites into the gag out of pain, screaming hard but all that emerges is a muffled cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back to observe his prize, the poacher can't help but laugh at how a mighty \"defender of the forest\" could be brought down by a lowly criminal. Gilden can do nothing but squirm against his binds, only causing his binds to cut deep and him to cry out into the gag again. Now comes the decision of what the poacher should do with his prize, after all he is in complete control of this beings life, what will he do with it?</span></div></div>",

Next, he picks up his struggling meal, with some difficulty as Gilden kicks wildly in a desperate last attempt to survive but to no avail, after some struggle the Poacher holds Gilden firmly on his left shoulder, the hysterical elf crying into the Poacher's ear, returning the wide grin to his face.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to eat well tonight, can't wait to roast you up and carve up your cooked skin. Oh man, I'm sure you'll taste delicious with a pinch of salt\" The poacher is just being sadistic now, desiring a response from Gilden - which he got in spades, Gilden continues screaming, kicking and thrashing wildly but he is secured too tightly to move anywhere<br>\r\n\"If you're lucky I might even kill you before I put you on the spit\" Gilden has retreated to helpless sobs now, completely devoid of hope. The poacher sets off with his cargo to find a gentle spot to make camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon approaching a clearing nearby a rushing river, the Poacher drops his prey to start setting up camp, the hard landing of both Gilden and the deer produces muffles cries as they hit the hard dirt and crawling roots. The Poacher quickly sets about erecting his camp, hastened by years of experience living and camping in the forest, Gilden brakes down into tears and muffled sobs. After quickly raising his tent, the poacher constructs the framework for a hot fire - designed to easily cook his meal.<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be such a good meal, I'm sure you'll crisp up beautifully, golden crackling dripping with fat.\" The Poacher squats down in front of Gilden, overexaggerating licking his lips.<br>\r\n\"That fat ass should melt wonderfully in the flame and bring a beautiful marbling to the meat\"<br>\r\nGilden is screaming as hard as he can now, tears streaming down his cheeks, a pitiful last attempt to cry for help.<br>\r\nThe Poacher collects a bundle of sticks and assembles a makeshift spit designed to slow-roast a hearty meal, then he picks up Gilden and carries him over to his soon to be funeral pyre. Gilden is going crazy now, tearing his wrists and ankles against his binds, foaming at his gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Poacher takes his time tying Gilden up, whistling calmly, smiling broadly, and all-round clearly revelling in his prey's sorrow. First, he ties Gilden's still bound wrists to the spit, ensuring he pulls hard enough on the rope to cut into Gildens wrists. Walking over to Gilden's ankles, he repeats the process, slowly lifting his bound ankles, stretching out Gildens body to make sure he can't bend away from the flames, and violently tieing his bound ankles to the spit. Lighting a match, the Poacher waves it in Gilden's face, taunting him, the fire reflects in the Elf's Indigo eyes as they plead for his life, pleading for the Poacher to show some empathy, but they leave no impact on the Poacher who tosses the match into the tinder pile under Gilden, setting the fire alight. He then sits back under his tent and watches, retrieving a pipe from his backpack and beginning to smoke as he watches his prey, soon to be dinner, scream and squirm as he is slow-roasted alive. The fire grows higher, flames licking at Gilden's flesh as he thrashes on the spit, fighting to find a moment of the reprieve he won't find as the fire starts burning his skin. The elf is screaming as hard as possible as he is slowly rendered on the open flame, the Poacher simply sits back and watches, smoking his pipe and smiling to himself, remarking on the beautiful smell of his food cooking. As the flames overcome him, Gilden's mind goes absent as he fades from consciousness for the last time, dying from being spit-roasted alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting a while longer after the elf passes from life, the Poacher eventually takes down his meal as the fire begins to smoulder. Lifting the entire skewer off the flame, the Poacher takes his spitroast and places it down on a crude table inside his tent. The Poacher produces a large cleaver and cuts down the roasted elf, remarking on the extravagant and exotic smell of the elf, cooked to perfection. Discarding the skewer, the Poacher raises his cleaver and sets to work, skillfully butcher the elf. First skinning the elf, cleaving his blue - now deep purple - skin from his body, exposing the well-browned flesh underneat, then places the skin to the side. Next, he amputates the arms at the shoulder and places them to the side. Returning to the torso, he removes the backstraps - the tender sections of flesh either side of the spine - and places them to the side. Then he saws the body in half, separating the torso at the hips for easier access to the leg meat. Separating the legs from the hips, he places them to the side. Finally, with one mighty stroke, he decapitates the dead elf, separating his head from his torso. Standing back and admiring his hard work, the Poacher tastes a portion of the roast and is pleased with what he tastes.<br>\r\n\"Delicious, I knew you would taste exotic, I'm sure you'll fetch a fine price at the market and I might even find someone to buy your head as a trophy, might mount it on the mantlepiece and brag to their friends about how they defeated a mighty protector of the forest\"<br>\r\nBundling up his meat, he places it away in his neverending backpack and lies down to have a hard-earned rest, in the morning he would set off to the market and make a fine profit...</span></div></div>",

What the hell does he mean, \"connect with nature\", he soon found out as the poacher set down his large backpack directly in front of Gilden and withdrew a large coil of rope, dangling it in front of Gilden. Gilden suddenly realises, he means to hang him, and he begins thrashing wildly against his binds and crying out into the gag.<br>\r\n\"Ah, so he's caught on has he?\" remarks the poacher, flashing a wide, maniacal, smile at Gilden.<br>\r\n\"I wonder when you'll be found? Do you reckon the wolves will get to you before the adventurers find your body? Well, I guess neither of us will be around to find out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilden is bawling his eyes out now, kicking wildly but only achieving to cut the ropes into his skin. The poacher simple squats down in front of the bound elf and starts tying a noose while whistling to himself and singing a little song. Proud of his handiwork, the poacher holds it up for Gilden to observe.<br>\r\n\"I think it'll look great on you my good sir. I do say, a nice necktie to match your outfit\" <br>\r\nGilden is hysterical now, his mind is breaking. Tossing one end of the rope over a high branch of a nearby tree, the poacher adjusts the rope to the right length and then hammers a peg into the tree to act as a tie-off point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to his prey, the poacher tries to put the noose on Gilden's neck who in response reals back and then heads butts the poacher warranting a hard kick in the jaw from the poacher, sending Gilden's head spinning. Now that his prey is incapacitated, the poacher successfully puts the noose on Gilden's neck, ensuring the knot is nice and tight, then walks over to the other end of the rope that has been slung over the branch. Taking up the slack of the rope, the poacher starts brutally hauling up Gilden by the neck as Gilden returns to consciousness, resuming his wild thrashing, futile begging and crying streams. As he pulls the elf higher and higher, the poacher can't help but smile - obtaining great happiness from the lynching of his prey. The rope is cutting hard into Gilden's neck, crushing his windpipe and turning his face from lavender to deep blue - gagging and spluttering for air. Reaching his desired height, the poacher ties off the rope on the peg and, dusting off his hands, returns to collect his bag and deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilden's eyes cry rivers as he screams into the gage, his world swimming and his mind starved of oxygen, he soon fades from consciousness for the last time, dying in the noose like a common criminal as the poacher picks up his torch and cargo and sets off again, whistling to himself all the while...</span></div></div>",

Our hero will soon find out as his fate is turned into the hands of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over the bound and gagged Drow elf, the poacher can't help but laugh, a \"great defender of the forest\" taken down by a lowly criminal.<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well my little toy. What should we do with you? I could cook you alive or string you up on the noose. No, I have a better idea, why don't we let your precious 'mother nature' decide? Surely she will protect you, after all, wouldn't it be ironic if nature's protector was undone by what he protects. On that note, my wriggly elf, I think I'll go on my way again. Besides, I can't be bothered to deal with you right now, you best hope you starve before the wolves get you... or worse\" Gilden is trying to beg for mercy but the gag prevents little more than a muffled whimper from emerging. Picking up his torch, the poacher collects his cargo and prepares to leave.<br>\r\n\"Full moon tonight, lots of wolves around, you better hope they're horny and not hungry\" With a cruel laugh, the poacher sets off, the torch slowly disappearing into the forest once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilden futilely whimpers and wiggles, struggling to escape from his harsh binds but only causing the course rope to cut further into his flesh. Nonetheless, he struggles again, and again, and fails over and over. What seems like hours go by, yet the sun still hides behind the hills, and Gilden starts losing hope that he will ever be found. Giving one last struggle, more out of spite than actual hope, the bindings seem to have loosened up a bit, but not enough. More time passes, when Gilden notices for sure that the ropes have loosened up, bringing about a fresh bout of wriggling and thrashing, even allowing Gilden to roll over and sit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rope cuts hard into his flesh, but what will his suffering lead to?</span></div></div>",

A small trail of viscous blood begins travelling down the back of Gilden's head. As our hero's vision fades to black, the last image he sees is the wicked grin of the intruder as he looms over him, burning that image into his subconscious as he sinks into the void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiding his sword back into its sheeth, produces a smooth, metallic, \"Shing\" sound, the Poacher remarks \"I've got you right were I want, I could do anything I wish and wont stop me.\" He continues, talking to the limp Elf who obviously has no cognition of what is happening. \"I'm sure such a nice looking blue'y like yourself would go for a fair price in the sex markets or even at the butchers... never understood why people want an exotic cut like yourself, I never had the fuckin' money to afford it...\" Suddenly, an idea comes to his mind, why should he labour, only to give to others. Why not get a little taste of what the customers get? After all, there must be a reason why these weirdos are always wanted? A little taste couldn't hurt? The Poacher's stomach grumbles, he hungers for a meal, a real meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before a great meal, there is preperation to do, afterall, you don't want leather or a shoe stuck in your bowels. Picking up the Elf's curved blade that had been dropped beside his lifeless figure, the poacher began his work - cutting away Gilden's clothes and removing his shoes, first unseaming the rough spun pants, then seperating the shirt down the centre, exposing Gilden's flat, blue chest. Finally, the Poacher removed Gilden's crude undergarments revealing his small, 3 inch, penis, and atlast he was prepared for consumption, fully nude and completely incapacitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as you pose no threat to me, I may as well savour this\" Starting at the legs the Poacher ran his tongue up Golden's thigh, deliting in the exotic, almost spiced flavour. \"Mmm, I see why they look for you guys so much. Delicious, you have no idea how much I'm gonna enoy eating you, and I'l probably enjoy the rest too. Oh well, down the hatch\" Beggining with the feet the Poacher began to feed himself Gilden, deighting in every inch of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst went the ankles and the Poacher felt the first part of his meal touch the back of his throat, the new sensation brining excellent joy to him. Next came the wide calves, so much meat on the bone, exquisite, then the large thighs, intitally halting the  Poacher's process, causing spluttering and gagging, but after some extra effort the thicc thighs to fall prey to the Poachers snake-like maw. Reaching Gilden's massive ass, the Poacher began to choke, he swallowed and made big gulps but to no avail, his tongue only lathering Gilden's huge behind with a serving of saliva. The saliva soon proved to help however, for as the poacher jaw compressed Gilden's buttocks the spit-lube allows the roadblock to eventually slip into the throat, meating with a tight, fleshy tunnel on its trip further downwards. The rest of the way was no struggle, tucking the arms into his wide mouth, the Poacher downed the rest of the Elf, elbow to head, in one large gulp. With a large splash Gilden landed into the stomach proper, the moist, fleshy expanse hugging him tight and encompassing his whole body, now only a part of the Poacher and soon to be much more intertwined<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyou Blue'y, I'll have to keep an eye out for more of you in the future, can't let all the good ones go to all the rich. But if you don't mind, I think I might just have a kip. See you when I wake up, only in a different form.\"<br>\r\nThe Poacher fell into a deep sleep, tired from the effort of swallowing his prey and loaden by its weight, only waking up as the sun began to shine. Stretching his arms and yawning loudly, the Poacher looked down, noticing the lack of distention in his stomach. \"Rough night huh.\" he joked, \"Unfortunately I think you're gonna 'ave a pretty shit morning too\" The poacher couldn't help but smirk at his jokes, and rubbing his stomach noticed the lack of a familiar figure, replaced instead by light pudge - the last reminder of the Elf's existence, well... nearly the last reminder, there was one more matter to attend to. The Poacher went striding over to a nearby tree, quickly removing his clothes and preparing to dispose of the last aspect of his prey.</span></div></div>",

Few set foot in the dark woods, except the few who live in its embrace and those who profit off it, those who mutilate and destroy it; farmers who tear down the trees, fisherman who steal the water life, and worst of all, poachers, those who dare to venture into nature only to slaughter it and return with their prizes held high, proud of their murder of those innocent creature the forest does hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a section of this wood, not too far in, yet further than most gentlefolk venture, in the dead of night, a single light source floats in the dark, a lone torch held in the grasps of a wicked poacher, hauling abound, yet still living dear, whos cries had attracted attention from those who would save it, a single drow elf - Gilden Nightglade - who will stop at nothing to save the innocent creature and \"deal with\" the intruder. But where will he begin?</td>",
