Sonic then realized that it was love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered why he ran all those times from her and it was clear. He was afraid. He was afraid of the girl who constantly proposed to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was afraid that her obsession with him might doom a possible marriage. He was afraid over nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized that he needed to push these thoughts out of his head and come out with his true feelings. He told himself that he was going to apologize to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no longer going to torment her with this game of \"hard to get\". He sat on his bed and Tikal came up and asked \"Hey Sonic! Who was at the door?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked and saw Amy lying on the bed and Sonic just asked \"Could you leave us alone for a few minutes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal simply smiled and said \"Sure. No problem.\" That was that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that Sonic could never be hers because he loved someone else and she decided to support them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy woke up and Sonic explained what happened. Sonic reared his face back for the slap he would feel but the slap never came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply sat there dumb founded at what she just heard. Sonic then says \"Also there's something else I want to tell you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snapped out of her daze to hear what Sonic has to say. Sonic begins \"Amy I love you.\" With those four words, Amy was completely blown away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never thought that she'd hear those words come out of his mouth. She simply cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic thought he did something wrong and was about to say something but it looked like Amy knew what he was going to say and replied \"These aren't tears of sadness. These are tears of joy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said that Sonic felt like a burden was lifted off of him. As time passed, Sonic's thoughts were screaming \"Kiss her damn it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did what his thoughts told and they kissed passionately for half an hour. She then said something that Sonic didn't expect to hear \"Take me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply granted her heart's desire and that as they say was that.    </span></div></div>",

So let's conquer this world!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then conquers the world in the course of a week with him ruling everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero got the money he wanted but stayed by Jake's side to avoid incurring his wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was eventually freed from Zero's mind control implant but sustained serious injures and afterward joined Sonic's Freedom Fighters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic figured out how to disable the mind control implant in Amy and they never felt closer. Sonic eventually marries Amy and they have son and daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow unfortunately, dies in a trap set by Zero but killed Zero in the process. Cream and the others were rescued after the Freedom Fighters found them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliver realizes that if he leaves that there's a good chance that mankind would not survive so he stayed and married Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails and Knuckles were properly mourned a month after Issac turned on them and Shadow was mourned two days after Zero's defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge held on to a chaos emerald to remember Shadow by and she stuck with the Freedom Fighters ever since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla became the team nurse and and Cream helped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was heartbroken when she found out about Issac and even after what happened that day, She vows to change and bring him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac, now known as Lily, had sex with the new ruler of the world twenty times a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight raged on for twenty years but sadly, the Freedom Fighters were defeated by Jake's forces and executed but Kate was kept alive and forced to be Jake's second sex slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world's hope was crushed and even to this very day, No one questioned their new ruler and it was said that the dark ruling lasted for eons to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 The End</span></div></div>",
