As he nears the shed he stops and yells at the top of his lungs:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT YOU DUCKS, GET YOUR BEHINDS OUT HERE NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor stands and watches the shed door for a moment, looking for movement. Suddenly the door is flung open and out comes Dirk Duck and his henchducks: Dirty, Dangerous, Dippy and Delbert. Delbert is the brains of the operation having gone to college at the University of Oregon (Mighty Ducks).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ducks exited the shed in single file and lined up, waiting for Tor to address them. Dirk took one step forward and announced:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All present and accounted for sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you ducks, listen up. I just got off the phone and you will not believe what is about to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the ducks strained forward, waiting for Tor to tell them the news, hoping an adventure was in the works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor continued: \"First thing that happened was that dufus, CC called me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sound of that name the ducks began to growl (What? You never heard a duck growl?) They remembered the last time they had run afoWL of the Bucketheaded Knight...it had not been a pretty sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down you ducks. Seems that CC was calling to tell me he would be arriving in Galveston very soon to pick us all up...HE WANTS US TO GO TO ENGLAND WITH HIM ON AN ADVENTURE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor waited for the uproar to settle down then he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got off the phone with Nada and she assures me that CC is on the up and up...if you can believe that. Seems She is behind this little trip and we will be joined by a bunch of other Blogville citizens\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk looked around him and at his brother ducks. \"Looks like we got some packing to do, boys,\" He growled. \"Boss, this time do we get to stick something sharp into CC...just for fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor let out a laugh: \"Gawd, now that would be fun....but no....this time we are gonna play nice with the Buckethead....well at least till we see which way the wind is blowing, if you get my drift\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk grinned evilily...\" Yeah boss, we get you: Nice for now...then....POW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" Tor told him. Then he left the ducks to pack as he headed into the house to tell Mel that she was about to get that vacation she was always talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, I hope she decides to leave the dang frying pan at home, my head could use a rest.\" Tor said as he entered the house again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH Sweetie,\" He called out to Mel who was in the bedroom. \"You'll never guess where we are going......\"</span></div></div>",

Any idea of ignoring the interruption fled my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Lady!\u201d I said chirpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey back!\u201d she replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat cha want?\u201d I inquired eagerly.  I knew if Nada was calling me, there had to be some excitement in the making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cornered CC into taking me and my closet pals to see Scarlett,\u201d Nada said conspiratorially.  Chewie and Tor are coming, too.  Wanna join us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Nada, I sure as heck would like to do that.  But listen, I just got Finn in his new home, and how can I leave him now, while he\u2019s still getting used to all that water?\u201d I asked puzzedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tell ya, Lauren.  If CC can bring Advillicious and Tor can bring all his ducks, I don\u2019t see any reason you can\u2019t bring Finn.\u201d Nada answered confidently.  \u201cAfter all, a fish should do well on an ocean trip.  And maybe the ducks will like to paddle around his aquarium.  Who knows, Finn just may enjoy teasing them by tickling their feet,\u201d she concluded breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got a good point there, Nada.\u201d I answered contemplatively.  Sign me up!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkey Dokey,\u201d she hollered loudly.  \u201cYou\u2019re exactly on my way, so I\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting with swim fins on my feet and a life vest tied on tightly!\u201d I answered excitedly.  And I made a mental list of the five things I better bring just in case.  These trips have a way of turning crazy, and you never know what you\u2019re gonna need for survival!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope I don\u2019t forget to turn off the iron.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Better be a damn big ark then and he\u2019ll just have to sedate the wimp of a horse if he\u2019s scared of water. And what was that?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She IS? Bringing her cat too?  Is she duck-friendly? And <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">kidnapping</span> inviting her neighbour?  What a knockout PARTY this will be.

Anyone else?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh fantastic, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be a great asset, especially in the kitchen.  Oh, and Finn too?  Well, the more the merrier.  Remind her to turn off the iron before she leaves.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And the great Texan lady herself? I\u2019m gobsmacked.  No, I know she won\u2019t be but she\u2019ll be a great addition. Yeah sure, we could all use some lawn clippings \u2026pack plenty.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What\u2019s that?  Do I speak French? Sadly only un peu. But we\u2019ll manage, she\u2019ll soon adapt to the captain\u2019s flappage. Sheep? HOW many? Any fainting goats?  Well, it will be great to have someone from that part of the world aboard.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Another addition?  Oh that\u2019s wonderful.  She\u2019ll keep the men in order.  What\u2019s that? Oh, a few glasses of vino and she\u2019ll be fine. I better go tell my ducky dudes and get moving.  Bye.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tScarlett dashed up the stairs and gathered all the ducks together to tell them the news.

I\u2019ll bet it was on sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know if any of the other passengers have the pull to get him to change his brain about that, but I can see I need to make some special preparations just in case.  Like a suction cup for the bottom of Finn\u2019s travel bowl.  And I\u2019m thinking I better go buy a life boat, just in case we get washed overboard.  We may need more than one, what with all the animals coming \u2013 the two, four and no legged varieties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I can say is if that horse don\u2019t learn to swim, CC\u2019s liable to be in a world of hurt \u2018cause they don\u2019t make any horse-sized life boats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I think on it though, the boat looks big enough so I won't have to pack light.  And I can see how I\u2019d have the chance to stay in shape, riding my bike on deck.  Looks like there\u2019s plenty of room.  I wonder how many laps will make a mile?  And if I put Tor on the handlebars I can really get a work out!  (He just better keep that Black and Decker drill he lifted off the shoplifter outta his pants.  I don\u2019t want any scratches on my baby.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now I know what errands I have to run.  I can tell it\u2019s going to take multiple trips to numerous stores to get properly packed for this trip. Thankfully I have my backpack of secret weapons already put together.  The Girl Scout in me is always prepared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just hope EmmyLoo brings good food!  Sheep helper\u2019s all fine and good, but what about the veggies?  And the <b>oatmeal</b>?  At least Party can be rest assured his peanut butter cups will be safe from me, but I can\u2019t make any promises about who else might kipe a few of his stash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad we won\u2019t have any freshly butchered pork on board.  I wonder if Esperanza would consider shipping some Maisy to hold us over till we get across the Big Blue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDang it, time\u2019s a wastin\u2019 \u2013 I gotta get to the store!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess it\u2019s okay to forget the diet for a bit.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And who the hell is Kathy Lee?\u2019  Damask continued grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett shrugged as she observed the frowning faces glaring from the hammock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018So what\u2019s the problem with you lot?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The problem is\u2026\u2019 Defiant jumped in. \u2018While they\u2019re all sailing the high seas and having a blast, we\u2019ll be stuck in this boring hammock waiting for days and days for them to arrive.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And,\u2019 cut in Dangly. \u2018By the time they get here they\u2019ll all know each other really well and we\u2019ll all feel like strangers.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Plus,\u2019 added Daredevil.\u2019 There could be trouble at sea with pirates or dark ducks and we feel without us there wouldn\u2019t be enough reinforcements.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018So, what are you saying?\u2019 asked Scarlett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The way we see it,\u2019 said Dearly Beloved.\u2019 Is if you and all of us joined the ship now, it would be far more beneficial than just sitting here tapping our beaks.  I mean, we\u2019ve always wanted to see the big pond and you\u2019ve always fancied a cruise and a break from domestic bondage.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hmm, I see your point, but they did say they wanted to come to Nottingham for some reason.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Do we know the reason?\u2019 asked Demur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m not quite sure \u2013 something to do with Robin and his seven hoods I believe.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, we could always help navigate them back here from the ship,\u2019 suggested Diabolical.\u2019 Anyway, you know how impulsive they all are.  Knowing them they could change their minds mid-ocean and head off to that water hole in Africa instead.  Then we\u2019d all miss out.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And we could pick up Bo Peep\u2026er\u2026esperaza and her sheep on the way,\u2019 added Dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I see what you\u2019re getting at,\u2019 Scarlett conceded. \u2018But how do you propose we get out to the ship?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well perhaps we could borrow Stealthman\u2019s suit and travel the way he does.  We\u2019ve got a huge supply of batteries we could give him as payment.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Or,\u2019 butted in Dinkum.\u2019Surely we can hire a \u2018By Royal Appointment Only\u2019 helicopter or private plane.  You are supposed to be da Queen after all.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh sod it, you\u2019re right.  Where there\u2019s a bill\u2026er\u2026will there\u2019s a way and this is bloody fiction after all. I\u2019ll go call Nada and see what she thinks.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been two days since Tor got his surprise call from the Buckethead, CC telling him of the impending trip to England. Two days of frantic packing, making plans, arranging for a Pet sitter to stay will Mel's herd of animals and doing all the things needed in order to leave home for an extended trip abroad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor sat comfortably resting in his recliner, a sense of well-being suffusing his mind. He had managed to pull everything together and now they were all ready to go. The car was packed and Mel was giving last minute feeding instructions to Marlin Perkins who would be taking care of all the animals in their absence. Yup, life was good, Tor thought, all ready and no bumps in the road.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIING! RIIING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor snatched up the phone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Tor, my buddy. It's CC and I got some news for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lord, CC. What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well bud, seems Da Queen and her ducky friends are headed to the good old U.S of A. and will be joining us on our trip back to England.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor rolled his eyes....oh lord, he thought, this could mean trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so she's headed this way. So what does that mean for the trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....well...there has been a slight change in plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor closed his eyes and mumbled: \"I knew it...I knew there was gonna be trouble\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that Tor, I didn't hear you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nevermind. What is the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you see, dude, with DA QUEEN headed this way and so many other folks to pick up...well I just ain't got time to sail down there and pick up you Texas folks. But, don't worry, I'm sending an old buddy of mine to pick you guys up and get you up here in time to catch da boat to England.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor knew it was only his imagination, but he was sure, at that moment he could actually hear the trap door spring open on his own personal gallows......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...and who might this friend be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember back in our Pirate War Days, that guy that helped me out against you and Helenhighwater the female pirate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY FREAKING GOD! YOU MEAN YOU ARE SENDING THAT IDIOT, CAPTIAN CRUNCH, DOWN HERE IN THAT LEAKY ROWBOAT OF HIS???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor's screaming brought Dirk and the other ducks rushing into the living room, followed closely by Mel who was holding her frying pan just in case Tor had done something he needed Bopped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor waved his hand at them to halt and then he spoke into the phone again, his voice strained to remain calm....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that your plan, little buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but don't worry,  the Captain has a new boat now and he don't hold a grudge against you for sinking his old one...well I don't THINK he does anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor was suddenly overcome by a feeling of being sucked into a whirlpool of stupid, the same feeling he always got when dealing with CC. He let out a sigh, he surrendered. What was the use of arguing, he thought, CC was gonna get him in trouble no matter what he did....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Tor mumbled into the phone. \"We are leaving for Galveston now. We will sit there on the dock and wait for  Capt. Crunch but I gotta tell ya bud...if that idiot shows up and demands a quart of milk from each of us before we can board...I'M GONNA SINK HIS OTHER DAMN BOAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC let out a short laugh: \"I knew you would understand buddy,\" he exclaimed with false high humor. \"And don't you worry one bit, I explained everything to Capt. Crunch and he promised to be on his best behavior. Just make sure that Dan, Deb and Winda are all there on time...I don't want anyone to miss the boat, ya know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor slammed the phone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL RIGHT\", he yelled. \"EVERYONE IN THE CAR. LET'S GET THIS FIASCO STARTED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tor, Mel and the Ducks loaded up and headed to Galveston and the beginning of their adventure. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now he could see that it was indeed Deb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled: \"Well hello, good-looking!\" He yelled as Deb made her way to where they were standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VAA-VAA-VOOOM!\" The disembodied voice of Stealthman/Dan came from Tor's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWANG\" The iron skillet made that familiar sound as it bounced off Tor's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe\" Dan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWANG\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iron skillet struck again. This time in the \"empty\" space next to Tor and right on Dan's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for Linda\", Mel grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan once again became visible and Tor gave him a smug look. Both of them were rubbing the knots on their heads as Deb walked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel took care of the introductions as all three welcomed Deb to the adventure then Mel took Deb off to one side where they compared notes on the correct handling on a iron skellet. Deb discovered that they both favored the overhead delivery but where she used a wrist flip, Mel was partial to the locked wrist position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis chit-chat went on for a few minutes until finally Tor interrupted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, its time to get this show on the road,\" he declared. \"We've been here long enough\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's burning in the harbor?\" Deb asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our boat ride to Deleware\", Mel said ruefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind that,\"Tor said. \"Stealthman and I have it under control\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do?\" Stealthman said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do. We are gonna steal a plane and fly to Deleware\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah we're gonna.....WHAT? STEAL A PLANE? Who the hell is gonna fly it?\" Stealthman's voice was beginning to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fly it,\" Tor told the unbelieveing group. \"How hard can it be....the plane goes up, the plane goes down....piece of cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Tor gathered his baggage and his ducks and walked off the pier, followed slowly by three very unsure companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>*********************</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive hours later a four-seater Cessena prop plane crashed into a farmer's barn on the Deleware border!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor staggered out of the ruined barn, hay was hanging from his clothes which were torn and oil streaked as was his face. He was quickly followed by three other figures, in equally as bad a shape as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See,\" He croaked to his companions. \"PIECE OF CAKE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(THUD)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor fell over in a dead faint! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell now all they had to do was find CC and the ship!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I rode for an hour and barely broke a sweat, but once I got out into the open fields, the riding got a bit rougher.  I began to wonder if I\u2019d ever find those four vagrants.  My stomach was beginning to rumble \u2013 the Brussels sprouts had worn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave myself another thirty minutes of riding before I\u2019d turn back and call off the search.  Anyone who would steal a plane and fly it into a barn deserved to take his lumps, anyway.  And anyone dumb enough to go with the dude \u2013 well, enough said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d stopped to survey the terrain, shielding my eyes against the glare of the sun, when who should pop into my field of vision but the errant pilot himself.  Though a vision, he was not.  Hay sprouted from his head and britches, and lord a mercy, the man was <i>shirtless!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t bring myself to describe the sight of his bare, nekkid, unclothed torso.  I\u2019ll leave that job to Mel, if she ever has the courage for it.  His tie-died Grateful Dead tee-shirt was wound tightly around his left arm and there were tear streaks of grime striping his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Tor, I don\u2019t know whether to be grateful to see you, or whether to throw up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see a familiar someone I\u2019ve never met before,\u201d said Tor.  I put that sentence down to shock.  He lifted his wrapped arm and cradled it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so what happened to you, big guy?  I mean, besides crashing into a barn with a stolen plane?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cut myself bad.  Real bad.  And I was so busy keeping myself from bleeding to death I missed the atomizing transport.  After all I risked getting those guys here, they up and left me behind.  Oh, just you wait until I get my hands on that Planner Dan, that ungrateful sub-par hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Tor was punching the air with both fists, and the psychedelic tee-shirt unwound and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s look at your owie, Tor, and see if we can bandage it with something else so you can put back on your shirt.  I\u2019ll be danged if I\u2019m taking you back looking like that.  Kathy Lee may just die on the spot, then you\u2019d be in for a huge law suit.  Party would never forgive you, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s right there,\u201d Tor said, pointing to his flimsy bicep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>There!</b> Can\u2019t you see it?  It was bleeding like all get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou talkin\u2019 about this scratch?\u201d  I put my finger on a scratch that had already begun to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!  Don\u2019t hurt me, woman.  It\u2019ll probably get infected and I\u2019ll die on the high seas.  I hope someone\u2019s prepared to do a sea burial.\u201d  Tor sniffed just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed my laughter and dug into my back pack.  I grabbed a bottle of lavender oil and a box of Band-Aids, dripped the oil on the scratch and peeled the paper from a bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey there,\u201d Tor objected.  \u201cThis needs a little more something than that.  Use those.\u201d  He pulled from the box three butterfly bandages.  \u201cI don\u2019t want the edges to split and have a scar when they deliver my body to Davey Jones\u2019 locker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfactorily bandaged and re-garbbed, Tor mounted my handlebars and sang Swing Home Sweet Chariot all the way to the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m so glad I brought my mountain bike with dual suspension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel greeted Tor with hugs and kisses, and the whole gang settled on the dock to dive into hot pizza, delivered by the hottest delivery boy I\u2019ve ever seen.  Emmy sure has conneactions.  The broccoli/tofu pizza was surprisingly popular, and I ended up fighting Deb over the last slice of pepperoni.  I got three bites, she got four.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He puffed out his scrawny chest to give his words weight.....yeah right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood for a moment in silence....Mel looked sheepishly at her hubby: \"I was only gonna get his pizza recipe,\" she said sweetly. Then, when Tor did not reply, she hurried over to the gangplank of the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel was quickly followed by the rest of the group. As they trouped by the Scowling Tor he pulled first Mel, then Dan, Deb and Winda off to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He whispered to Dan/stealthman: \"I want the \"Texas contingent\" To board last, with me, we got some talking and planning to do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fell in besides Tor as everyone else climbed on the boat, then they followed him up the gangplank and over to where Nada stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to lose my temper Nada,\" Tor said quietly. \"I just couldn't let that pretty boy spoil the party. You ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Nada nodded. \" I think its about time I assigned cabins to everyone and we head to merry ole England.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor nodded and smiled....\"Sounds like a plan to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone gathered around Nada, a hush fell over the crowd as they waited to get their cabin assignments from the one who started this Adventure in the first place. As they waited Tor leaned over to Winda and whispered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me in the ship's bar in a half-hour\", he told her. \"We need to talk\".      </span></div></div>",

I wanted to know what cabin I\u2019d been assigned so I could get Finn\u2019s filter plugged in and my bicycle polished \u2013 the handlebars were in special need of cleaning and sanitizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wandering the halls I finally located the diminutive blonde in the captain\u2019s quarters.  It wasn\u2019t too hard; all I had to do was follow the voice yelling something about the wireless internet.  I finally got close enough to overhear (NOT eavesdrop) as I stood silently outside the partially opened door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Nada was saying, while cradling her laptop.  \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving port until you assure me we\u2019ve got a wireless connection on board and I have some promises of uninterrupted reception on our crossing.  I refuse to give the go ahead for departure if I can\u2019t watch my Africam.  I\u2019ve still got to see giraffes, and there are plenty of baboon arses I haven\u2019t looked at yet.  I don\u2019t intend to lose opportunities to enrich my life on a ship that hasn\u2019t entered the twenty-first century!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed open the door in time to see the captain picking her teeth with a frayed pinky nail.  \u201cThe technicians say the system will be up and running within the hour.\u201d  She sucked her teeth, adjusted her captain hat, and shrugged into her captain coat before brushing past the two of us and traipsing up to the captain seat in the pilot house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while Nada was consulting her clipboard that I felt warm breath on the back of my neck.  I could tell it was Male breath, but it wasn\u2019t until I heard the Male speak that I knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNada, when are you going to give us our room assignments, eh?\u201d  Ben asked.  Silly boy, he likes to pretend he never had any notion of his Canadian ancestry, but it shows.  Yes it does.  \u201cI\u2019d like to get settled in and see if I can find a naked mole rat or two before we set sail, eh?  All this vacation time on my hands, maybe I\u2019ll be the one to discover the secret of longevity and win one of those prizes. Eh?\u201d  There was a mildly frantic gleem in his eyes. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t have to share it with anyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNada flipped through pages and announced that Ben had been given room 4E.  He blanched just a little and said, \u201cOf course,\u201d before sulking off to find his starboard cabin and begin his scientific research, which would one day enable all of us to live long, long lives, but hopefully not naked, bucktoothed and bald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got into my cabin, I set Finn\u2019s tank on the shelf, got his filter going and surveyed the room.  Nice firm bed, shiny bathroom, silk flowers in a vase gummed to the nightstand, plenty of room for all the baggage I\u2019d packed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA circle of light pooled on the floor, spilled there by the porthole.  \u201cWell Finn, the digs are pretty nifty, aren\u2019t they?\u201d  He swam the length of his tank and flashed blue.  \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I\u2019ll mosey on down to the bar and see if I can find out what those Texans are plannin\u2019.  You think Tor called that meeting just for the fun of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn flashed red.  I could tell he knew a thing or two.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of the corner of his eye he noticed his little brother, Jabba, was snoring\u2026 IN DA CAPTAIN\u2019S CHAIR!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJABBA!!!\u201d Chewy\u2019s voice was so loud poor Jabba fell off the chair, a mess of black and silver hair.  Running his paws through his red beard he looked over at Chewy, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Chewy,\u201d he mumbled.  \u201cJust taking 40 winks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo time!\u201d  Chewy barked back.  \u201cWe got to get ready to leave the sub.  Matti promised Stavros he\u2019s have the submarine back before sunset.  Where is Forever?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSaying goodbye to Matti and Indi,\u201d mumbled Jabba.  When he saw Chewy\u2019s face he hastily added:  \u201cYou know how silly she is about the dogs.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get her,\u201d snapped Chewy.  \u201cGo and fetch that blasted hedgehog she\u2019s so potty about and let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewy went into Forever\u2019s cubicle.  She was combing Matt\u2019s hair.  Knowing they promised the cheeky Greek lieutenant to have the sub back WITHOUT ANY HAIR FROM MATTI OR INDI Chewy relented, and decided not to shout at her.  Not that he ever did, mind you \u2013 Forever was his whole life.  Chewy sighed, gave a cute squeak that he knew she\u2019d find irresistible and put on his beseeching eyes.  Forever glanced over, smiled and stopped brushing Matti.  Indi was relaxing in the corner, and came over to relieve Forever of the comb \u2013 she\u2019s already been brushed.  Forever kissed Matti and Indi on their brown noses, grabbed her denim jacket \u2013 to match those blue jeans, of course \u2013 and they walked over to the exit hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJabba had already opened it and climbed out of the grey Greek submarine.  Forever followed Chewy out, and wiped away a tear as Indi closed the hatch.  Jabba was carrying the hedgeholg \u2013 who was very prickly because he\u2019d been woken up \u2013 on his back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s the ship!\u201d  shouted Forever, and began waving frantically.  Chewy and Jabba barked loudly, trying to catch someone\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not expecting us \u2013 I wonder if they can hear us?\u201d said Forever.  Suddenly the submarine began to submerge, and water touched their feet.  Matti was taking the submarine back to Greece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d  said Forever.  \u201cCan anyone see us?  Help! Help!  CC?  Advicuss?  George?  Help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was rising, and covered their ankles\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All those peanut butter cups have gone to his brain, I can tell.  Deb and I treaded water for a minute, then climbed back on board.  Poor Deb, losing that lovely bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t take time to change clothes; I wanted to get to the bar.  Where in the heck was the bar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the bar would be no easy task, and my GPS was useless belowdecks, which is where I found myself looking for the gathering place.

All I saw was a guy in pajamas with his butt hanging out the back of them, and I guess I panicked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hit him with the skillet,\u201d Mel observed, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen merely nodded, entranced by the sight of Chewie nibbling on the dude\u2019s nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou brought an <i>iron skillet</i> with you?\u201d Teresa was dumfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.  Doesn\u2019t everyone bring one on a cruise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie was by now purring as she padded on the dude\u2019s soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think to bring one,\u201d Teresa said.  \u201cI wonder, will I need my own?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie\u2019s tongue rasped pleasantly in the dude\u2019s belly button, exposed by his untucked jammie top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry dear, you can always borrow mine,\u201d Mel offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may need to borrow one, too,\u201d I said, dripping on the carpet.

No nibbling <b>there!</b>\u201d  Teresa jerked the leash and Chewie looked up with a wounded expression before moving down to curl up between the dude\u2019s knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt he\u2019s dead,\u201d Mel said.  \u201cHe\u2019s got a hard noggin.

He propped himself on his elbows, sending Chewie rolling gracefully off her throne mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing as he rubbed the knots on his head, the dude said, \u201cDang it!

It was difficult, but she had to tell Nada the dreadful news she\u2019d learned since the rescue from the Greek submarine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are going?\u201d the dreamy eyed man asked.  Forever smoothed the ball gown over her jeans (can\u2019t separate that girl from her denims!) and, managing to avoid looking into said dreamy eyes, pointed to Nada\u2019s elegant back.<br>\r\n\u201cI have to speak to Nada,\u201d she explained.  \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d murmured Dreamy Eyes.  \u201cMost people I teach to ballroom dance have two left feet.  You, on the other hand-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know!\u201d  snapped Forever, making a mental note to as CC if there was a plank anywhere they could use for Dreamy Eyes to walk down.  \u201cBut this is important!  Top secret stuff!\u201d  Praying he couldn\u2019t see the telltale jeans underneath the ball gown she hurried off after Nada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Nada talking to a rather handsome officer \u2013 his thick graying hair brought Richard Gere to mind, but this guy was much taller.  Thinking (and hoping) maybe someone had smuggled RG aboard (at least Forever wasn\u2019t very tall!) she tapped Nada on the back.  Regally Nada turned around, and greeted Forever.  The ball gown looked pretty familiar, but it really didn\u2019t fit the girl right, thought Nada.  Reading her thoughts Forever had the grace to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Nada \u2013 I\u2019ve only got jeans with me, so I raided your closet.  You\u2019ve got some great gear, by the way.  It\u2019s just a bit tight on me\u2026\u201d Forever wriggled uncomfortably in Nada\u2019s exquisite Chanel dress. <br>\r\n\u201cSo I noticed,\u201d Nada remarked.  \u201cThat was one of my favourite dresses, BTW.  You\u2019re lucky I have such a wonderful, kind, forgiving personality.  Otherwise you might find yourself on The Plank.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad there\u2019s a plank!\u201d  Forever explained, jumping up and down and stretching the gown to its tailored seams\u2019 limits.  \u201cNada \u2013 that dancing instructor \u2013 who employed him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I can find out \u2013 why?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell he\u2019s trouble,\u201d Forever told her.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we had to use the submarine to get here.  And it\u2019s why I had to bring Chewy, Jabba and Herman.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHerman?  Who\u2019s Herman?\u201d Nada asked.  She was starting to worry \u2013 perhaps all that Greek food had pickled Forever\u2019s brain.<br>\r\n\u201cHerman hedgehog,\u201d explained Forever, touching the rather large, ugly brown brooch pinned precariously on her \u2013 sorry, NADA\u2019s \u2013 dress.  The brooch unfurled, and a pair of shining dark eyes looked out at Nada.  Herman the Hedgehog was in disguise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a mental note to donate the dress to Forever because Herman\u2019s \u201cmarks\u201d would NEVER come out, Nada jumped as Herman greeted her.  At the shocked expression on her face Herman sighed.<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you thought only DUCKS could talk,\u201d he said, accusingly.<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 \u201c Nada was too surprised to say anymore.  Forever interrupted her.<br>\r\n\u201cThat dancing instructor \u2013 you\u2019ve got to find out what he\u2019s doing here!  And who brought him on!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d <br>\r\nForever drew a deep breath, and as the side seam in the Chanel dress finally gae way announced:<br>\r\n\u201c  His name is MURPHY!!!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d missed my chance to spy on the conniving Texan contingent.  Oh well, I had a bigger moose to trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rushed to my room, but made a stop by Nada\u2019s first.  Think I had time to go find an evening gown before setting sail?  No way.  But I knew she\u2019d have a closet full and I doubted she\u2019d mind sharing.  Even if she did, it made no difference, I was a-borrowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis dress is a little short, isn\u2019t it, Finn?\u201d  I asked my floating friend as I admired the flowing red gown.  He flashed blue in agreement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter.  I\u2019ll bet Forever\u2019s in jeans so no one\u2019ll notice I\u2019m showing my ankles.  But dang, the shoes are gonna be a tight fit.\u201d  Next, Finn went into his travel cup and got stashed in the outside compartment of my backpack, then I headed down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when luck stepped up beside me.  First, I smelled the smell.  It was vaguely familiar \u2013 where had I smell that smell before?  Ohhhhh yeaaaa, Old Spice \u2013 my father\u2019s fragrance.  But most recently it had come at me from behind, just before I\u2019d been tossed overboard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard the voices.  Party saying, \u201cDo we have to go to your room?  Couldn\u2019t we do it anywhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no.  It\u2019s much more comfy in my room.  And private.  And it\u2019s got good lighting.  I like to see what I\u2019m handling,\u201d Kathy Lee replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ducked into the nearest room, only to find Forever frantically pinning the burst seam of her evening gown.  I guess I\u2019d had her wrong \u2013 she\u2019s a real lady, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can get kind of slippery and I always need to wash my hands after.  You silly boy.\u201d  Kathy Lee was dragging Party by the hand as they turned the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLauren, help me with this safety pin, would you?\u201d Forever asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my finger to my mouth and whispered back, \u201cJust a minute, I\u2019ve got a job to do first.\u201d  I pulled the iron skillet from my backpack and laid in wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a pleasant sound a noggin makes when it comes into contact with a fast moving iron skillet.  The wrist flip provides a satisfactory rebound in case of the need for a second hit.  No second hit was needed.  Party was out cold on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why did you go and do that?\u201d  Kathy Lee cried.  He was the only one who was willing to let me make bust of him!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess no one else trusts you with a glob of gooey clay,\u201d observed Forever, who had successfully pinned herself and was now standing next to me.  She cocked her head and looked Party over good.  \u201cIs that a peanut butter cup stain on his shirt front?\u201d she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy Lee stomped her foot and stuck her tongue out at Forever and me before letting herself into her room and slamming the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever and I each grabbed one of Party\u2019s arms and heaved a mighty heave ho.  The body moved not an inch, and I turned an ankle in those too-small sparkly shoes of Nada\u2019s.  Off came the shoes, then I pulled the dress up and tied it around my waist.  This was serious business, requiring girded loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, nice undies,\u201d Forever said.  \u201cAre those Victoria Secret?  They are so hard to find in Turkey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Forever, tie up your dress and let\u2019s get this guy moved before he wakes up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my astonishment I discovered I\u2019d had Forever figured right all along.  The lady wears blue jeans under her evening gown.  I have to admit though, such an arrangement of layers made it easy for her to tuck in her dress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this going to take long?\u201d Forever asked.  \u201cI\u2019ve go to get back upstairs and get Murphy off the boat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurphy?  Who the heck was Murphy?  No time to get into that now, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fair amount of grunting and groaning, we two wimmins managed to drag Party to Deb\u2019s cabin.  Her look of glee when she saw the prostrate miscreant was a delight to see.   I almost pitied the poor man.  He was in for it.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The words on the outside read \u201cTOP SECRET\u201d and she knew the hit had been made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me Mr. Clooney but I have very important business to attend to. Shall we hook up later?\u201d Deb asked but didn\u2019t stick around for the answer. She swiftly made her way out of the bar and to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb opened her door and her eyeballs almost popped out of her head. \u201cLauren, what in the world is up with that dress? Didn\u2019t you read DRY CLEAN ONLY before throwing it in the dryer? Then she did a double take at Forever. What the hell is SHE wearing? \u201cForever, tell me you are not wearing blue jeans under that gown. Girls we need to talk about fashion ethics\u2026\u201d Deb was interrupted by the groans of Party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was all tied up and so pitiful looking. Oh poor thing and for a moment Deb felt a little sympathy for him. Oh hell no she didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well well\u2026what\u2019s up party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeb help me.

Now listen to me; you threw me into the ocean and I lost my hot pink bikini and now I\u2019m a little ticked off,\u201d Deb said as she sat down and poured herself a glass of bubbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Deb you had another bikini. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou also threw my buddies into the ocean too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. Can\u2019t you ladies take a joke?\u201d Party said while ducking to miss being hit with a flying champagne glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo and now I shall seek justice. You know Party if you would have just VALIDATED my feelings I might have let you off the hook.\u201d Deb got up and went over to the DVD player and inserted a DVD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh we gonna watch some porn,\u201d Party asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whack</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch what ya do that for,\u201d Party said rubbing his lumpy head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen up\u2026here is how this going to go down\u2026The movie is a two hour instructional tape on how to treat a woman. It is narrated by a metro male type and he will teach you how to validate a woman\u2019s feelings, talk to a woman, LISTEN to a woman, etc. As a bonus he will also transform you into a metro male yourself. You will learn about all the new products out there to smooth your skin, tone that tummy, hair removal, etc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah okay Deb.\u201d Party said sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m a little sleepy so I\u2019ll try and stay awake to watch your little movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDIRK get out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuack quack,\u201d Dirk came out of the bathroom still smoking his Cuban cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh hell no, you aren\u2019t leaving me in here with this duck are you?\u201d Party started to get panicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDirk here is going to see to it you don\u2019t get sleepy and miss the instructional video. When it\u2019s over he is going to restart it until you are begging for mercy. Dirk is relentless and a horny little duck so DON\u2019T FALL ASLEEP.\u201d Deb said as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb heard Party\u2019s scream for help right before Dirk slapped tape on his mouth. That\u2019ll teach him to not ever throw women in the ocean and then not validate their feelings, she thought to herself with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A bizarre-looking man appeared on the television screen.  A metro male, he presumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWomen are like onions, gentlemen.  When you peel them, you cry,\u201d the man on the screen began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Party moaned.  \u201cHey, Dirk.  You listening to this crap?   You do want to be a metro duck, don\u2019t you?  Better pay attention, my little fowl-smelling kidnapper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up and watch!\u201d Dirk yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty glanced back at the strange man on the television and mumbled, \u201cValidate my butt.  Once I get out of here I\u2019ll validate that woman, but good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty was a mountain boy and one thing a mountain boy never does without is his pocketknife.  He engaged Dirk in some conversation as he worked his hand into his back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Dirk, you seeing anyone these days?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk just rolled his eyes and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, touchy subject, huh?  Sorry,\u201d  Party said.  He had the blade nearly through the rope, but he had to get Dirk to focus elsewhere.  \u201cHey, you know what might take the edge off your loneliness?  This ship has satellite \u2013 why don\u2019t you try to pick up some Daisy Duck on that tv.  She\u2019s pretty hot, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirk looked at the television.  \u201cThey\u2019ve got satellite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!  Go ahead, give it a shot,\u201d Party said as he cut through the final strands of rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026maybe,\u201d Dirk said as he reached for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty quickly jumped up and grabbed the champagne bucket, then slammed it down on top of Dirk.  He grabbed a five gallon bucket of orange pills that Deb had left on the nightstand and set it on top of the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Dirk\u2019s muffled squawks made Party laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun in there fantasizing about Daisy, buddy!\u201d  he yelled as he bolted out the door.  \u201cI\u2019ll show Miss Metro some validation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he hurried down the hall he suddenly remembered Emmyloo.  He hadn\u2019t seen her since he shoved her in the ocean.  Oh well, he was certain she\u2019d show up eventually.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The walk in wardrobe full of new gowns and matching shoes is out of this world.  The private gym and pool are amazing and the plasma screen television, state of the art computer and music system to die for.  And I've never seen such a well-stocked bar...hic...I really can't thank you enough.'  Scarlett smiled sweetly at CC who really was the handsomest, hunkiest man she'd ever clapped eyes on.  So eloquently spoken too. (Hey, I didn't know I could write fantasy so well) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And how is the Princess Penelope settling in?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh great. A little hungry, but then she usually is. She's all ready for dinner so I left her surfing the net to take her mind off food for a while.  She's found an interactive story on some writing site and chuckling away to herself as we speak.  Small things amuse small minds as we well know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you think of the passengers from WDC then?  Are they living up to your expectations?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes, they're all as <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">weird</span>...erm...wonderful as I'd imagined and such an <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">insane</span> ...erm...interesting bunch of people.  All the wimmins are great but I haven't seen much of Partydude yet...Still there's time yet and who knows what may happen?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC shuddered. ' That's what worries me Scarlett.  Have you noticed any strange goings on out there?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not really, nothing you wouldn't expect from such a bunch of <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">nutcases</span>...erm...nice people. Although I am a little suspicious of the Texan contingent.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tell me your concerns, my dear. One of them in particular has been known to cause a few problems in the past.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, every time I go in the bar, which is quite frequently...hic...they seem to have their heads together, whispering and smirking. It seems as if they're almost plotting something.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I wouldn't be surprised if one of them is, but he'll have a hard job convincing the others to join his wicked schemes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's just what I thought CC.  I mean Winda is such a lovely lady and she does write the Spiritual Newsletter after all.  And we all know Stealthman is really Dan who is well known for his wise philosophies on life.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, and I hear he's been performing <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hairbrained</span> erm...heroic deeds on board too although I do wish he'd get one of the wimmins to repair his pyjamas. Enough to put me off my rump steak seeing that. So what about Deb?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I don't think she's involved either really.  She just seems to want to get <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">drunk</span> erm... a nice tan but I have noticed that revolting, evil Dirk is trailing after her wherever she goes. Maybe he just fancies her or maybe he's been set up to report on her movements.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sounds to me like I need to keep an eye on someone, not mentioning any names.' CC winked at Scarlett, causing her heart to flutter.  She wondered if it would be forward of her to ask him for a first dance later on. Normally, she was quite a shy, retiring character but being away from domestic bondage was boosting her confidence no end.  Maybe she ought to ask the dance instructor to help her brush up on her tango. But then she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I nearly forgot, CC.  Forever has discovered the dance instructor is really MURPHY in disguise and we all know what that means. Trouble with a capital T.  Do you think he may have be connected with the dark side in some way?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I must investigate immediately,' replied the Captain. 'There'll be no mutiny on MY ship.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR WILL THERE?</span></div></div>",

When she looked out, she saw George Clooney snorkeling outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emmyloo! Please let me back inside! I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have thought about that before you danced with Deb!\" Emmy replied, then slammed the porthole shut. \"Damn fool thinks Party's the only one who knows how to knock people overboard,\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge knocked again. Emmy rolled her eyes, but relented. \"Okay, George. You can make it up to me by taking over cooking duties. Now swim on over to the galley. There are a lot of folks upstairs getting sauced, and they're going to need some dinner to soak up that alcohol!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmy slammed the window again and went to her bed. She wondered by her suitcase was open, but noticed the only thing missing was a pair of flannel pajamas. She shrugged, then selected a stunning blue evening gown. It hugged her size 6 figure to perfection, and emphasized her rather fabulous chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you can't even tell I popped out three kids in the last few years,\" she said. \"I am digging this fantasy thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished getting ready, and went into the hall, where she was almost knocked over by a rather rough looking Partydude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emmy, help!

Shall we go up to the bar and see what we can find out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty crooked his arm.

Now that the ship was sailing out over the open ocean, it was time to put things into motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor made his way up to the ship's bridge where he found his old buddy CC who was trying to show the Queen, Scarlett how to steer the ship....at least Tor thought that was what he was doing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Scarlett,\" he yelled as he entered the Bridge. \"That ain't the ships wheel you are holding on to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, Scarlett jumped away...\"Well, I never...\" she sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well at that rate you will soon,\" Tor retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from Scarlett, Tor stared at CC. \"Buddy, so far this party is NOT very organized.

Slowly the camera pans in tight upon the Ledo Deck and focuses on two figures, clutched together and dancing the Tango to a hot Latin tune coming over the loud speaker.<br>\r\nAs the camera tightens in on the two figures we see GEORGE CLOONEY dancing with the dance instructor, Murphy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh George,\" Murphy sighed heavily. \"You have made me the happiest boy on this cruise. I never knew you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, sweetie,\" George told the highly excited man in his arms. \"There's lots of stuff people don't know about me and you just remember, that dang EmmyLoo and Deb don't mean nothing to me\".  He twirled Murphy around in a tight pirouette then pulled him roughly back into his embrace as they danced across the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" Murphy said and he stopped dancing. \"What is that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge cocked his head to one side and listened for a moment. \"I don't know.\" he looked up in the night sky, \"but its coming from up above us, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sound became louder: \"BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurphy visibly blanched. \"Oh my God, it sounds like falling shee...............!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(THUD)(THUD) (WAP) (WAP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of sixty five sheep bodies striking the two dancers from a height of a thousand feet was sickening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n{exterior shot}{early morning} Camera is pulled back once again and we can see the entire ship as it sails through the water. <i>Hey, don't blame me.

Blood is everywhere and so are sixty five dead sheep and two dead men dressed in tuxes and grasping each other as if they had been dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh My God,\" CC exclaims. \"That there is that George Clooney, the actor feller who has been chasing all the girls on dis boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tor laughs. \"Looks like his interests was just a bit broader than wimmen, CC.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty scans the mayhem, his face is a lovely shade of green at the sight of all the blood and sheep insides, not to mention the two dead dudes. \"You think the sheep killed them when they fell outta the sky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw,\" the empty space next to Tor spoke up...Stealthman was there. \"The sheep didn't kill em, look closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nada steeled herself and bent down. She grabbed the dead Clooney by the shoulder and turned him on his side....Murphy's body moved with him...they were pinned together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that,\" Lauren yelled, \"Can you believe it. THERE'S A LONG, SHARP, POINTY THING STUCK RIGHT THROUGH BOTH OF EM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor looked thoughtful for a moment. He scratched his chin then he spoke in a very self-satisfied voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who, fellow travelers, do we know that has his very own sharp, pointy thing of which he is so very proud of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly all eyes swivel toward a now very frightened CC who had turned as pale as a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, \"Deb demanded hotly. \"What the hell have you got to say for yourself CC?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor stared at the once more fainted Buckethead and grinned his biggest grin. \"Yup, you can always count on CC to wilt under pressure\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b></b></span></div></div>",

Well, to be honest, I kinda like wearing it out on deck, as it\u2019s mighty cold when the ship\u2019s a sailin\u2019.  I could almost wish I had a balaclava, too \u2018cause my nose freezes numb.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a snow suit is no attire for a party lounge.  Even if I could have found the dance instructor, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to manage any grace.  Still, I\u2019d wanted to snuggle up to the hottie, so I\u2019d kept a lookout for him while drinking a few Bud Lights.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I want to know who spiked my drink.  Just before I passed out on the floor with sweat dripping into my eyes and wondering when we\u2019d make it to the Watering Hole, I watched Nanette tap dancing on the bar.  Who woulda known?  Still waters run deep, they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I awoke and joined the crowd on the deck, I felt quite refreshed.  Sometimes all one needs is a good knock-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may have been refreshed, but I wasn\u2019t prepared for the sight of that bloody deck and two MURDERED bodies.  No wonder I couldn\u2019t get a dance lesson.  I want my money back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few sheep still milled around, their coats bearing rusty stains.  I reached into my backpack and pulled out a bottle of Woolite, which I handed Esperanza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I dragged out an American Flag, a couple of cement blocks, and a coil of rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Tor,\u201d I said, \u201clooks like you\u2019re gonna get your sea burial, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kicked CC in the ribs until he came-to and dropped the bricks and flag on his belly.  \u201cI guess as self-appointed captain of this ship, you gotta be responsible for the burials.\u201d  To his credit, CC did a fine job and the two unfortunates were dispatched to the briny blue with only a modicum of fanfare.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jabby Thing was kept as evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCC couldn\u2019t have done such a poking job,\u201d I said to Finn.  He flashed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, we haven\u2019t seen hide or hair of that tooth suckin\u2019 captain that came with the boat \u2013 that lady who set up Nada\u2019s wireless.  And the Skipper seems to have vanished, too,\u201d I whispered to my companion.  You think they might have something to do with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn flashed blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd are those Texans finished cooking up mischief?\u201d I wondered outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn flashed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we went to find Emmy.  A whole bunch of folks were wantin\u2019 breakfast.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw CC and Scarlett having a rather \u201ccozy\u201d breakfast of chocolate dipped strawberries, Mel was helping the disgruntled Tor to a seat, wiping the tears and snot off of his hang-dog face, Lauren and Finn were seated with Esperanza, doing her best to console her about the carnage of her flock <i>which I do believe Emmy would be featuring on tonight's menu</i>, Nanette had saved a place for poor Winda.  Speaking of Winda, last night after Ben failed to open the door Nada had gone back to her room, where she found Winda curled up in the hallway, luggage and all.  Apparently Winda couldn\u2019t find her room, <i>or had failed to check the room assignments, whatever\u2026.anyway I led her to her suite, which had been George\u2019s until his untimely demise with Murphy.</i>  Chewie seemed happy to be with Scotty and the Skipper\u2026but HEY\u2026who was driving this boat?  Gawd, must I do <i>everything?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the bridge, Nada was very surprised to find Lauren enjoying the brisk morning air with Finn <i>those two really get around</i>...then at the bridge who should be there but... Deb and Partylips, seemingly over their spat  of earlier and looking quite pleased with themselves\u2026they were playing with the joystick and laughing out loud.  <i>Oh great\u2026.these two were left in charge of the boat\u2026.but, everything seems to be running ok\u2026considering.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNada turned to leave, but ran into Ben and Phyllis.  \u201cHey\u2026hi!\u201d  Both of them were a tad <i>sweaty</i>, which Nada understood immediately, indicating they had been playing an early game of tennis.  She eyeballed them for signs of any hanky-panky, but seeing none, greeted them with a stand-off-ish, \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong buddy?\u201d  Phyllis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what could possibly be wrong\u2026two humans died, no real suspects\u2026\u201d  She was cut off by Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo suspects?

Last I remember before waking this morning was doing a Coyote Ugly routine on the bar. Regardless of my bad luck at the hook-up thing, I awoke feeling confident and free for the first time in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd that my roommate hadn't returned to our room, but she was on her own after my fourth Margarita. I pulled my winter-white wool pants and pale blue shell and sweater set and showered.

Well, you know about the murder on the Ledo deck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Is it the steward and the pool boy? I had a feeling that Murphy wasn't happy with the steward dancing with his guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, no. It seems that George and Murphy were dancing on the Ledo Deck and someone ran them through with CC's jabby, sharp, stick thingie. We buried them at sea, but we have to find out who is trying to frame our dear, sweet CC. Are you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you know I think there are a few people missing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teresa's bed hasn't been slept in and her cat Chewie's bed only has tufts of hair in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Well, one thing at a time. We have to clear CC. Oh, by the way, we will be having Lamb for quite a few meals here. Esperanza's sheep had a tragic landing and none survived, Emmyloo had them dragged to the freezer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh NO! You know my story about the trip to Canada. What will I eat? I don't do lamb. I am so glad I won't have to see the carnage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will take care of that later too. Right now we have to help CC.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't understand why anyone would ever want to hurt that dear, sweet, good-looking man! Scarlett is one lucky lady! Do we have any clues at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one has seen the gnarly-nailed captain lady CC replaced, so she is the most usual suspect with a motive, but then Tor and Dirk have been acting pretty \"Get Smartish\" ever since they boarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is better than nothing.

So, I ducked into the lounge by the back door and hid behind the bar to slip into some jeans and a tee-shirt, which I had in my backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be an ideal vantage point to <i>overhear</i> Scarlett and CC whispering their nothings to each other.

At the bottom of those legs were a couple of feet, and on those feet were shoes, whose soles were stained with dried blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see that, Finn?\u201d  I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashed blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no time to consider all the implications of what I\u2019d just seen because in tromped Nada and Ben, intent on interviewing the couple.

What the heck are you doing in here?\u201d she whispered harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Nada, come on.  I got sick of eating that canned chili.  Can\u2019t a guy get decent food?

You were brought on board for one reason only, and the agreement was that you\u2019d stay out of sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, well I did my job already.  Can\u2019t I come out now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way.  There may be more to do, and I want you working behind the scenes.  Your reputation for fouling things up is pretty big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I did that job OK, didn\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because you had CC\u2019s instructions.  Even with that, I\u2019m amazed you pulled it off.  Oh my gosh, I can\u2019t imagine the mess I\u2019d have on my hands if you were wandering the ship with these kooks.\u201d  I thought I heard Nada slap her hand to her forehead.  Or maybe it was the bar her forehead hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd look, you dope.  You didn\u2019t even wash the blood off your deck shoes.

We were just discussing strategy for next year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty was too upset to care whether she had the entire starting line-up in her cabin. He started to babble. \"Deck. Boat. Brand. Nada.

At about that time he felt a warm sensation on his leg and looked down, where the stealth-dog Max was standing with his hind leg raised and generously peeing.  Dan jerked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it dog!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this Max just looked at him with those big brown Lab eyes that said, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t know how I got on this blasted boat.  But there ain\u2019t a tree or blade of grass anywhere.  What the heck do you expect me to do\u2014hold it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan pulled the table cloth off an adjoining table and relented, \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. And, Yeah! How the heck DID you get here?...Oh well, since you\u2019re here we might as well make the best of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looped the stealth-leash around the magnificent animals neck and pushed the stealth button.  Instantly they faded into nothingness (which is a little strange cause how do you instantly fade?)  Stealthman and his stealth-dog trotted up the deck heading for the bridge or the driving place or the big room on top of the ship.  Standing outside the door Stealthman waited and listened with his keenly tuned stealth-hearing.  He heard voices from inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Party, you pervert, CC said that\u2019s Scotland over there.  All you gotta do is keep the boat on this course and we will be ready to disembark tomorrow.  That\u2019s all you gotta do.\u201d Emmy pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it! When are we gonna sing \u201cI Got You, Babe\u201d?  Party sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealthman opened the door and stepped in with his dog wonder.  Party and Emmy both turned to the open door and then looked at each other as the spoke in unison, \u201cHow\u2019d that do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealthman walked up real close and personal to the two, and more personal to Emmy than Party so that he could peer down and see the girls.  He sighed and thought, \u201cOh well, can\u2019t tarry here; I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into his stealth-belt and pulled out a tube of stealth-vasoline, and with a decisive lunge he emptied the contents on the large stearing wheel.  Immidiatley Party began loosing his grip.  The wheel spun out of control.  Party\u2019s attempt to grip it only worsened the sitiation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou Dolt!\u201d Screamed Emmy, \u201cLook where you\u2019re going!  We\u2019re headed straight for the rocks.  Do something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK!\u201d Returned Party and then shoved Emmy aside and ran for the door screaming, \u201cWe\u2019re headed for the rocks!  Every man, woman, queen, dog, sheep, shepherd, actress, captain, etc. for themselves!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie had done her job.  The animal barge was safe.  Stealthman hit the atomizer button and he and the stealthdog atomized over to where Chewie waited.  Together they would watch the yacht as it headed for the rocks.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That could only mean one thing, CC would be coming soon.  Nada surveyed the group...<i>where is Ben?  Her heart fluttered when at that very moment he strode in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dan held tight to the leash as he hit the stealth button; immediately he and Max faded to nothing and became Stealthman and Stealthdog.  While havoc had rained rampant on the ship, Stealthman had been busy researching the demise of the legions of lambs and the unfortunate expiration of the two dudes.  He had an idea; all he needed was to bounce it off of the legal authorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the contingent from Scotland Yard walk into the assembly room.  They flashed their badges briefly and immediately got to business interviewing the passengers and crew.  Stealthman walked over to the chief inspector or top dude or whatever they call them in merry Old England.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, inspector dude,\u201d Stealthman whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inspector jumped around craning his neck to and fro looking for the source of the voice\u2014a real Monty Python moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cut his eyes back and forth and spoke softly, \u201cWho said that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever fear, I am a champion of the law, a doer of good, a righter of wrongs, and a warrior of justice--invisible to the masses but every vigilant and opposed to evil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you must be Superman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBatman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Phantom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonder Woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!  Don\u2019t you Brits keep up with Super Heroes?  I\u2019m Stealthman and that yellow stream collecting around your shoe comes from my hero-dog Max.  You must have been walking through grass \u2018cause the stains on your shoes set him off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes!  By Jove, Stealthman\u2026good show old man!  I always wanted to work with a super hero.  I guess you\u2019ll have to do in a pinch\u2026oh yes, bloody good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, let\u2019s cut to the chase!  I\u2019ve got some theories about what came down on this caper.  I need you to check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to do so, old man; what have you got?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealthman began to lay out his theories.  The inspector nodded yes and periodically called the home office on his radio to have the research confirmed.  Shortly the inspector could be seen patting an invisible back and shaking hands; quite an amusing image.  The inspector walked to the center of the room and addressed the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK! Attention people!  Can I have your attention?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty responded, \u201cWhy, ain\u2019t you got one of your own?  What\u2019d you need with mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inspector glared at Party but continued, \u201cListen up!  We will not be detaining any of you any longer.  The Case has been solved.  With the help of the magnificent and brilliant Stealthman we know what has happened on this ship.  No crime has been committed.  You are all free to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about my dead sheep?\u201d  Bo Peep exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the sheep.  It appear that a sub-tropical analytical vortex wind sheer collided with the sheep during their flight over here.  Since they were flying on the Harry Potter brooms and were not cleared for such vehicle, the violence of the occurrence was just too much for them.  They just happened to be circling the boat when it occurred\u2014unfortunate indeed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d blink\u2026blink, \u201cThat don\u2019t splain my sharp jabby thingy stickin\u2019 through those two dudes!\u201d  CC squealed.  \u201cYeah!  What about my jabby thingy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElementary my dear man,\u201d the inspector grinned at the simple mined Yankee dude.  \u201cThat was a matter of a double suicide.  It appears the only misconduct was the owner of the instrument of suicide was negligent in leaving it lying around.  The two lovers, distressed at being trapped on the ship with the odd assortment of personalities were just too much for them.  Stealman found a note waded up in the corner of the deck\u2014yes, suicide.  So, there you have it.  You are all free to enter England now.  The question is, Is England ready for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the crowd began to make made dashes to their cabins to gather their possessions.  It would be unfortunate indeed if anyone would stand in way of the gangplank.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw a distraught CC, but he was being comforted by Nanette.  You could always count on her to be a friend.  Her curiosity was peaked, but knowing CC was in more than capable hands was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else had gone ashore by now, it seemed Stealthman and Max had cleared things up with Scotland Yard.  That was a huge relief, but still, she felt somewhat uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruise had been unlike any she had been on before, and with any luck, would be on again.  She made a mental note not to undertake such an endeavor without HubbySpeaks along to \u2026.to what?  Oh well, he would have found the lack of velvet Smoking Jackets woefully inadequate for his refined taste.  Some how, torn jammies, bluejeans under gowns, snowsuits, tennis outfits and old television stars would not have held the same fascination for him\u2026.although she was sure he would have liked to have seen just one naked molerat and maybe Clooney and Murphy stuck together like a toothpick through a pig-in-the-blanket.  She was pretty sure he would have enjoyed the food though, lamb being a favorite of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one thing left to do now, find her way to Nottingham Castle where the lovely Queen would be waiting with new maps showing the \u201chood\u201d where Robin and his merry gangstas were know to hang.  She couldn\u2019t remember why this was important, but she supposed that forgetfulness was just symptomatic of something else she couldn\u2019t quite remember either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing down the gangplank she was surprised to see Ben, Party and Emmyloo waiting for her.  Awww, isn\u2019t that sweet of them.  \u201cHey, thanks for waiting.\u201d  It was an unlikely trio, but a welcome one.  She\u2019s one bright lady, that Emmyloo, though she had gotten kind of  googly-eyed since she and Party had hooked up, that Partydude sure was a handful.  Nada was happy he was  in Emmy\u2019s capabable hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nada, thought we\u2019d share a car with you, Da Loverly Scarlett had them waiting for us, she\u2019s sooo thoughtful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.  Yeah, remind me to send her a couple of Merit Circles.\u201d  They got into the old English car, a Bentley, which made Nada feel right at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartydude started yapping right away,  \u201cYa know, I was thinkin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uh-oh, this could mean trouble.</i>  \u201cReally!  About?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s great that we made it here and all, but exactly why are we going to look for this Robin guy anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNada shot a look at Emmyloo, who promptly responded with a knuckle upside his head, \u201cTHWUNK\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang wimmin\u2026err\u2026Sweetheart, what was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but Nada gave me the go-ahead, so I did.\u201d  Emmyloo purred back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I explain it over our dinner at Nottingham Castle, when everyone is gathered, I so hate repeating myself.  Let\u2019s just enjoy the beautiful countryside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez woman, it\u2019s raining and cold, we may as well have gone to Seattle.\u201d  Ben said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, how romantic Ben.\u201d  Nada cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCR-RACK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, good one  Partydude.\u201d  Nada could see Partydude cracking his knuckles and starting to relax now, so she lay back and fantasized about\u2026.<i>seriously, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to tell ya\u2019ll do ya?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCREECH\u2026.SQUEAL\u2026all three were thrown against the front seat.   \u201cWhat the\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGawd, driver what\u2019s wrong?\u201d  Nada asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBLOODY \u2018ELL\u2026.some arse in in the road, coulda been killed if I didn\u2019t stop!\u201d  He threw his hands into the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three rubbed the fogged up windows off and peered out into the rain.  In unison they uttered these words, \u201cADVILICUSS?\u201d  They realized then the driver had said horse, not arse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, we know this arse,\u201d Partydude blurted out.  \u201cWait, I\u2019d better get him, CC will be lost without him.\u201d  With that Partydude got out of the car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait sweetcakes, I\u2019ll help.\u201d  Emmyloo now climbed over me and joined Partydude.  They tried to mount him, quite unsuccessfully, as Advilicuss smelled peanut butter and he <i>hated</i> the stuff.  Partydude slung a rope around his neck and Advilicuss just laughed it off.<i>Thankfully we no longer had that foul smell to contend with.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Ben say to the driver, \u201cDon\u2019t wait, get outta here now!  Take us to HARRODS!\u201d  Waving \u201cbye-bye\u201d we left Partydude, Emmyloo and Advilicuss by the side of the road.

Do you really care?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwww, how sweet you are, not really.\u201d  Visions of cashmere briefly filled her head.  And to think, <i> I could have been stuck in the car with any number of errrr....ummmm... people.</i>  She giggled and put her head on Ben\u2019s strong, warm shoulder as they listened to Elvis on the radio singing, \"Lord Almighty....

The castle was gorgeous, set in the lovely green <i>wet</i> grounds.   Queen Scarlett had thought of everything, tea and crumpets, assorted Wellies for our use...as well as a huge bin of umbrellas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLed to their rooms down a very long hallway with portraits of the Queen\u2019s handsome family members, Nada\u2019s mouth was agape...which Ben interpreted to be some sort of problem requiring another nose-pinch remedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...\u201d Nada said with a nasal voice, \u201cI\u2019m not going to faint again!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let go of her nose, disappointment crossing his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir?\u201d  The footman said, \u201cthis would be your room.\u201d  He gestured to the magnificent door on the left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, thank you my good man.\u201d  Ben opened the door to find a canopied bed, gilded in silver and gold.  \u201cWOW...look at this will ya naked mole rat?\u201d  He withdrew the now soaked and shivering rodent from his pocket.  The rat hopped out of his hand and scurried in, Ben followed.  \u201cG\u2019night Nada, and thanks for the Kilt, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get some opportunity to wear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night Ben.  You two sleep tight.  See you in the morning.\u201d  She winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Madam, your room is down the hall a bit further, follow me.\u201d  As they passed doorways she heard the distinct sound of Deb\u2019s blow dryer and a martini being shaken, Emmy was sneezing, Party\u2019s room emitted the smell of chocolate and peanut butter, Esperansa was sobbing, Tor and Mel\u2019s room couldn\u2019t conceal the sound of metal on bone, \u201cTHWACK...and don\u2019t tell me you weren\u2019t thinking about...muffle....muffle..\u201d, Dan\u2019s room was obvious, a cord was winding out from under the door and plugged into...nothing <i>he didn\u2019t have a converter with him</i>, CC had left a parcel of Merit Circles outside of his, with a scribbled note; TAKE A GET OUT OF JAIL FOR FREE MERIT CIRCLE, then she smelled a really foul odor and asked the footman who was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh madam, three women came in here, one with a silver tray and the other, well...\u201d he whispered in my ear, \u201csome woman who claimed to be a celebrity...I believe she said her name was ...Kathy Lee?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNada\u2019s eyes bugged out.  \u201cSurely you jest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Madam, that\u2019s what she said.\u201d  Nada grumped and told him to \u201cCarry on then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the time she felt as though she couldn\u2019t walk another step ...\u201dYour room is here madam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you err...um...\u201d she read his engraved nametag, \u201cUh..Jeeves.\u201d  Then she had to ask, \u201cJeeves, have you seen The Defender of Light and his trusty steed Advilicuss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh madam...yes, they rode up just before you arrived.  You know them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Jeeves, he is a very special man...he has the Queen\u2019s favor you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally...\u201d  his monocle fell off his eyebrows has raised so high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed he does.

If it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all madam, they are right next door to you.\u201d  He cracked their door open and sure enough, there snuggled in was CC and Advilicuss, both of them obviously exhausted as they snored in unison, \u201cZZZZZZZ-PHEEEEEEWWWW....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well Jeeves, just one more thing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, how may I serve you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.....<i>Nada blushed a deep crimson</i>, can you tell me where the Great Windini is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, TGW, what a lovely lady.

I was sorry my handlebars weren\u2019t more comfortable.  Our entr\u00e9e into the castle certainly wasn\u2019t the most dignified, to be sure, but we\u2019d made it \u2013 even through the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever mind we\u2019d been left behind by the limos.  Water under the bridge.  I\u2019ll not bring up the subject again.  Never mind it was the middle of the night when we finally were led to our rooms.  No matter.  Who needs sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, I didn\u2019t need sleep, because after bedding Finn down in his tank (thoughtfully set up in my room), drying off and slipping into my flannel jimmies and snuggly Uggs, I was restless.  The siren call of an empty castle was too hard to resist, so off I went to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I found was that I wasn\u2019t the only one still awake.  As I scuffed down one of the halls I detected the distinct, but faint, sound of singing.  More accurately, an attempt at singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed the pseudo music to the library where I found Tor, reclining in a wing-back chair, twirling the ends of his silver mustache and singing Row-Row-Row Your Boat.  But the lyrics were a bit unique:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>All those lives were saved<br>\r\nBy the mighty Tor<br>\r\nWho woulda thought?  A hero is he<br>\r\nNo bodies washed ashore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody come<br>\r\nAnd celebrate the Tor!<br>\r\nDon\u2019t you think that surely he<br>\r\nDeserves some big reward?!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, give me a break, Tor!\u201d I said.  The poor man screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you come from?  You shouldn\u2019t sneak up on a fellow like that.  In the middle of the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to answer your question, I came from the harbor, like the rest of you.  But, unlike all you <i>Texans</i> I didn\u2019t get a limo.  Recall, if you will, the ride you took on my handlebars.  Pretend you\u2019re Nanette.  Add cold and rain, and you\u2019ll get the picture.\u201d  I raised my hands, and addressing the embers glowing in the fireplace said, \u201cBut that\u2019s water under the bridge.  I\u2019ll not bring up the subject again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had the feeling Tor wasn\u2019t giving me his full attention.  I could hear him humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTor! Are you listening to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I am.  But listen, woman, I want what you\u2019ve got in your backpack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.  I\u2019m gonna need the goods tomorrow morning, when my buddies sing my song at breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean that ditty you were shrieking just a few minutes ago?  Please do NOT tell me you\u2019re going to inflict that on anyone with two good ears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not me, exactly.  The Texans are gonna sing it as I walk into the dining hall at breakfast time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you give it up?  I mean really, man.  Show some dignity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and walked over to me, pointing at my backpack.  \u201cCome on, Lauren.  Hand \u2018em over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I figured there was at least some good entertainment in the offering, and took comfort in the knowledge that Mel still had her iron skillet.  So, I opened my backpack and pulled out the silver-plated crown, encrusted with plenty of bling-bling.  Tor held it up and admired the twinkles.  \u201cThis is so much better than Nada\u2019s furry red thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re referring to Lance\u2019s crown.\u201d I corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I remember is seeing it on Nada.  And if I recall, that\u2019s all she was wearing!  Anyway, this one is much better.\u201d  He seated the crown firmly on his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGimme the rest,\u201d he demanded.  I reached one more time into my pack and retrieved the silver chalice.  They were a matched set.  The bling-bling glittered as Tor held the cup against the light.  \u201cOh, yes.  Scarlett is no longer the only royalty around here.  I\u2019ve earned a place right next to her at the head table.  And it WILL be mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead held high, Tor turned toward the door, swiveling on his heels.  It was a lovely move, or would have been if he hadn\u2019t gotten his legs tangled.  A self-appointed king is a sad sight, sitting on his bum in the floor with his crown rolling into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wonder iffin he can do the 'Cotton-eyed-Joe'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Texan rushed downstairs and evesdropped on CC as he met up with the Queen. Tor had to hold both hands over his mouth to stiffle the laughs. It would not do to get caught evesdropping, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to CC's little speech and watching that idiot refugee from a glue factory go through his act, Tor was suddenly reminded of one of his favorite movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just like that there movie, Ivanhoe,\" He mused to himself. \"Well it would be iffin the part of Ivanhoe was played by Peter Sellers\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat almost did him in for he collapsed into a fit of laughter at the image that had sprung into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to himself quickly, the nimble Tor scurried off down the wide corridor before the Queen's guard could discover him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, after going through a rehersal of his Song with the Texas Posse, as the Texans were now proudly calling themselves, Tor slipped away once again. This time he made his way to where CC and the Nag was roomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery quietly, he eased open the door and quickly shot three Polorid pictures of the bed area of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach flash of the camera highlighted a different portion of horse and man, both flinging about in the bed, startled and surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww,\" Tor gasped, \"Now that was just nasty, but I should be able to cause some damage with these pic\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran away down the hall, Tor was quickly calculating in his head how much he would make selling the pictures to The National Inquirer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy I bet breakfast is gonna be fun, he thought as he quickly flung open his door to his room and jumped into the bed to pretend to be asleep.</span></div></div>",

Max shook real good walked in a couple of circles and lay down on the bearskin rung next to the large four-poster bed.  In just a moment the dog was making dog sounds while he slept; it had been a long hard day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan flipped the lock on the bedroom door and unbuckled the stealth-belt and flung it on the bed.  He walked to the adjoining bathroom and was amazed at the size of that thing.  In the middle was a huge Jacuzzi tub with bubbles sploshing and gurgling.  Someone had the right idea.  He began shucking his stealth jimmies and by the time he was at the tub he was ready.  In he went.  He sat back and tried to order the events of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK\u201d he mumbled out loud to himself, \u201cTor seems to think there is work for the Texan\u2019s to do in this place.  Dang if I know what it is?  One thing I do know, we\u2019re gonna half to watch CC close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan reached to the side of the tub and pushed a button.  The water began to swirl.  He continued his contemplation, \u201cThat was the most disgusting display of nonsense I\u2019ve ever seen.  Geeze, CC was prancin\u2019 around with that stumblin\u2019 horse in the pantry where Scartlett was instructing the wait-staff.  He acted like it was some sort of royal assembly.  Geeze there were three cooks, a maid, the chauffer, and the gardener.  I\u2019m gonna have to keep my eye on that delusional Yankee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan\u2019s concentration was interrupted as Tor burst into the bathroom, wheezing and mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeeze, Tor!  What the heck you doin\u2019 in here?  Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m in the middle of somethin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  You\u2019re just sittin\u2019 in a big tub of bubbles.  What you in the middle of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it, you buckethead! That\u2019s what I\u2019m in the middle of.  I\u2019m bubble sittin\u2019\u201d Dan shot back at the redneck irritated.  \u201cGive me a little privacy here!  How the heck did you get in here anyway; I locked that door\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTor patted the Bowie knife stuck in his pants, grinned and said, \u201cOh, that little thing.  That ain\u2019t no chore for ole Betsy here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTor, we need to find the ice machine,\u201d Mel blurted out as she followed Tor into the bathroom. \u201cOh, hi Dan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it, Mel,\u201d Dan protested as he guided the bubbles strategically.  \u201cDon\u2019t you think you got someplace else to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, not really.\u201d Mel replied shaking her head and peering into the Jaccuzi.  \u201cI see you been in here a little while; stuff is beginning to shrivel up a tad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d nodded Tor in agreement. \u201cWhen I sit in the tub too long my fingers get all wrinkled and stuff.  Funny how that does that.  Don\u2019t ya think that\u2019s funny like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Gawd!  Can\u2019t you give a fella a little privacy?  Both of you get on out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, lands sake!  Don\u2019t get yourself all worked up; you\u2019ll have a heart attack or somethin\u2019.  Heck there ain\u2019t anything in here that I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d  Mel grinned at the mortified super-hero.  \u201cAnyway, we gotta find the ice machine; Tor wants some frozen margaritas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDayum!  I forgot about those.\u201d Tor exclaimed after being reminded.  Then he turned to Dan and spoke in a solemn voice.  \u201cBut we have important work to do.  Since you\u2019re a little busy right now we can talk about it later.  But, we have to act quickly.  That weirdo, CC, can\u2019t be contained much longer.  Tomorrow!\u201d  With that Tor turned and followed Mel out the door.  Max lifted his eyes, snorted, and went back to sleep.  Dan sunk a little lower in the bubbles\u2026..thinking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stunning,' agreed Scarlett. 'And not a cloud in sight.  Nada had a shock when she arrived - she seems to think it's always raining here.

Couldn't figure out who was sleeping with who or what.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh well, we might be thought of as prissy in England but our gates are open to all and we won't judge people by their bed-partners.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett turned the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006002</b>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wasn't it exciting when our first guests arrived?  Emmyloo and Party sure looked comfortable in that Rolls Royce we sent out for them as a reward for helping find Advillicuss.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006003</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And trust Nada to have to take a detour via Harrods.  Never can resist a shopping trip can she?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006009</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh typical yes, but look at the set of cashmere sweaters she bought for me. Always so thoughtful is Nada.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006004</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And here's the photo I took of her and Ben arriving in the Bentley.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And from what I could see,' commented Penny. ' It wasn't just her nose Ben was pinching.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006008</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Such a shame some had to bring the tone down.  Who was it in this heap of junk?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not sure but I could distinctly hear yelps of 'YEEEEEHAAAA' coming from it.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006016</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And WHO the hell is this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, that's just Dan.  He has delusions of being a superhero but how can you take anyone in PANK jammies seriously?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett turned another page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006015</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'AWWWWW...' sighed Penny and Scarlett together. 'Ain't he the sweetest thang on horseback you ever saw?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh it was wonderful to see all the guards stand to attention and hear the fanfare as he arrived.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's certainly a very noble knight.' Scarlett smiled remembering how those steely blue eyes had melted with the warmth of his smile. 'He has the best jabby thing I've ever come across and as for his merit circles...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes, he's our hero, our defender of the light, the protector of the castle and all quacky things but I'm not sure about that horse of his,' Penny commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh don't worry about Advillicuss.  I've promised him extra carrots and a merit badge for good manners if he behaves like a regal steed. He's also agreed to move into his own private stable to quell these nasty rumours regarding his and CC's relationship.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett showed Penny the photo of the crowd screaming to get into the grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006011</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I guess they're all here now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett turned to the next page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006005</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But do we tell them about the dark caves under the castle and what lurks in there?' Scarlett asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, I think we need to establish our authority here.  Already I've overheard plans to take over the Royal seat.  That blinking Bling King needs warning what may happen if he gets too big for his pointy boots.' Penny suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006010</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay,' agreed Scarlett. 'Let's send a message to Sherwood Forest and forewarn the merry men they may be needed here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here, you'd better send this too, so Robin can see just what weird characters are skulking around the castle grounds.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Invalid Photo #1006006</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett and Penny wandered back to the castle hoping Jeeves had coped with getting breakfast ready for such a large gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope Debs has sorted out her hair this morning,' Penny mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder if CC likes his eggs sunny side up?' Scarlett pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unbeknown to them that was the least of their worries.

My brother John was a bad bad man and he is still roaming the castle. Oh and King David is still in the dungeon waiting to be let out. The castle has been disturbed by you strange people.

His stealth-dog, Max bumped into him, \u201cWoof, damnit!\u201d  It\u2019s hard to see the stealth hero stop when he\u2019s invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, Max!  What good is it to be invisible if\u2019n you go around barking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhimper\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK boy; it\u2019s just that we gotta watch ourselves or we will be detected.  Now, I think we need to change our plans.  Let Tor get his own pictures.  I got a better idea.  Let\u2019s tail Deb.  That\u2019s a much better plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax whimpered a near silent acknowledgment.  The duo ditched the Polaroid provided by Tor.  Who the heck uses a Polaroid anymore anyway?  They hurried down the hallway just in time to see Deb duck into an ancient open door.  Stealthman shoved his foot in the doorway before the door closed and the two slipped in behind Deb\u2019s behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good that Stealthman and Stealth-dog were following the silly woman.  Who the heck goes traipsin\u2019 off with a ghost in the middle of the night?  Hasn\u2019t she seen enough of those B-rated horror movies?  Some dang silly woman always goes trailing down some trail in spite of the whole dang audience yelling, \u201cDON\u2019T GO THERE!!!!\u201d  Well Stealthman was determined to keep this damsel safe\u2026cause that\u2019s what super-heroes do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group, both seen and unseen and both living and dead, descended down an ancient staircase.  As the apparition walked past the ancient torches hanging on the wall the burst into flames, illuminating the next dozen steps or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, neat trick, Casper!\u201d Deb exclaimed.  \u201cHuh, where you takin\u2019 me, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost turned and grinned at Deb, \u201cWe are going deep into the bowels of the castle where no living person has been in eight-hundred years.  It is there I will reveal the task I have for you.  Do you dare follow, mortal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck yes!\u201d Deb replied. \u201cFloat on, Casper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhimper!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Deb questioned turning to gaze behind her.  \u201cI thought I heard somethin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no sound.  Nothing except the process of rotting decay and milding mildew, whatever that is.  The air grew cold around the seemingly solitary woman.  Had she made a mistake following this ghost.  She shrugged and moved on down the staircase.  Stealthman and Stealtdog followed close behind unobserved.  Deb looked behind her up the staircase.  What she saw chilled her to the bone.  Each torch extinguished itself as they passed a short distance.  To turn back now meant she would have to negotiate the slippery ancient stairs in pitch darkness.  She had no choice but to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn she walked following the floating apparition, for what seemed an eternity they descended into the depths of the castle.  Surely by this time they were deep within the caves of the earth.  What evil lay before them?  What purpose lay in store for them?  Soon they would know for they reached the last step.  To the left and right was a decayed and unused passageway.  Against the far wall were a number of iron doors with padlocks on each latch.  Could she hear stirrings behind the doors or was it her imagination?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost who called himself Richard stopped at an ancient door.  The padlock fell from the latch and it moved with a rusty screech.  Slowly the door began to open and stopped a quarter of the way.  Deb stepped up to the door and pushed; it did not move.  She placed her shoulder against the door and shoved.  It moved slightly.  She tried again.  Except this time Stealthman leaned upon the door next to her and put his super strength into it.  Slowly the door opened until it revealed a wide and dank opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb blinked, trying to get her eyes to adjust.  Slowly she began to make out shapes and forms in the darkness.  Her heart jumped a beat!  Did she see movement?  Was something coming towards her?  Stealthman stood with his back to the wall.  Stealthdog stood outside the door ready to head up the stairs in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the blackness a raspy voice spoke. \u201cWho are you mortal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb\u2019s voice quivered, \u201cYou first, who the heck are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am John.  Brother of Richard.  I am bad; I am big.  They call me Big Bad John.  For eight-hundred years I have been held in this room, unable to leave even when the door is opened.  I am cursed to stay here until someone with real \u2018you know whats\u2019 will free me.  For my freedom I will give all the desires of your heart.  Do you have the courage to do this, mortal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, sounds like a pretty good deal.  What do I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am destined to remain here until someone will bring the flowing tail of a noble steed, the golden arrow of Robin Hood, and an iron skillet Holy Grail type thingy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can manage that Big Bad John.  How long do I have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake as much time as you like.  But first I must seal the deal with a kiss.\u201d  Big Bad walked out of the shadows towards Deb.  Hair and rot hung from his face, his teeth were black and jagged.  And to make things worse, he was naked, with his hoo hoo out front and center.  \u201cA kiss\u201d he said as he approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe so!\u201d exclaimed Deb.  The iron door slammed shut.  Big Bad advanced.  Deb backed up against the wall right into Stealthman.  Saliva dripped from the mouth of the gruesome advancing Big Bad.  Deb squealed.  Stealthman placed his arms around Deb and pushed his atomizer.  Just as Big Bad reached out for her they atomized through space, out of the dungeon room.  Max beat it up the stairs in the dark, cause black dogs can run real fast in blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb and Stealthman reatomized in Dan\u2019s room.  They were standing in the middle of the bubble bath, but that did not bother either one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gawd!\u201d panted Deb.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine too.\u201d Stealthman agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you were there!\u201d Deb blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealthdog ran in the room and under the bed.  Stealthman continued, \u201cGlad to be there.  But, Deb, what are you gonna do now?  Are you going to accept the challenge?  I get the kiss thing was just a cheap shot.  You gonna get the things Big Bad wanted?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A vague memory passed fleetingly through my thoughts \u2013 pink jammies filled with someone familiar who was putting on sunglasses and holding up a black maglight type thingy.  But the dank air that whisked by me when the door closed blew away the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered where Deb was going, and wondered if I should follow, but those questions came word-by-word so slowly that by the time I\u2019d thought them out fully, I\u2019d forgotten why I was wondering about Deb.  One foot in front of the other I stepped laboriously down the hall, past the closed door.  Each step couldn\u2019t have been more difficult to take if I\u2019d been slogging through knee-deep mud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I\u2019d had any sense, I might have felt alarmed at my entanglement in an invisible force impeding my thoughts and movement, but I\u2019ve never been known for having any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt mattered little, since once I was well past the mysterious door, I was set free and found my way to the wing housing my fellow travel-mates.  My soft bed was calling to me, the smooth sheets and warm blankets were beckoning.  I picked up my pace, and sprinted down the hall to my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I never got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half wet Deb bolted out of Dan\u2019s room and ploughed me down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy gosh, Deb,\u201d I said as we struggled to disentangle ourselves.  \u201cYou smell like death warmed over.  You and Dan been burning some creepy incense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!  But he does have a cool hot tub in there \u2013 all bubbly and everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, did I dream that whole thing, where I saw you disappear through a door three left turns and two right turns past the end of our hallway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t dream it, but I don\u2019t have time to explain to you now.  Listen, I need your help.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed my hand and pulled me behind her as she made her way to the door of Tor\u2019s room.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to get something from inside here.  Mel\u2019s not going to give it up willingly, so we\u2019ve got to steal it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteal, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Deb didn\u2019t answer, she\u2019d already opened the door and snuck in, then she pulled me in behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was dark, but far from silent.  Tor and Mel snored in a two part harmony so lovely I stopped to tap my toe to the beat of their unconscious rendition of Frere Jaques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor laid on top of the covers, his Sponge Bob Square Pants jockey shorts glowing in the dark.  In one arm he cradled his bling bling chalice and his other hand gripped tightly the bling bling crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began humming along with the snoring, and Deb whacked me upside the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep focused here, girl.  We got work to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, but what are we here to steal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat!\u201d  Deb pointed to the iron skillet Mel hugged to her chest like a teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe iron skillet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou betcha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Deb\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat in tarnation are you two wimmin doing in my room?\u201d</b> bellowed Tor, now sitting up and bouncing on the bed in rhythm to Mel\u2019s continued concerto.  He put the bling bling crown on his head and threatened us with the bling bling chalice.  <b>OUT!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never saw two ladies fly thorough a bedroom door as quickly as we.  But before it slammed behind us, we heard Tor once again harmonizing with Mel, only now they were snoring Row-Row-Row Your Boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it!\u201d said Deb.  \u201cI need that skillet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Deb, I tried to tell you.\u201d  I reached into my backpack and retrieved the iron skillet I\u2019d borrowed from Ben.  \u201cHere,\u201d I offered.  \u201cYou want this one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb took the skillet, turned to look at CC\u2019s door and asked, \u201cYou got any scissors in that thing?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Try explaining that one to the little lady the next morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice it to say that Tor was in no mood to jack around when he staggered out of his bed at the crack of dawn. While Mel grumbled and groused about midnight visitors, Tor yanked on his pants and grabbed a fresh shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Note to previous author: Who the hell told you about my Sponge-bob-SquarePants underware?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in time for breakfast, honey bun,\" he called over his shoulder as he hurried out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to find Nada,\" she yelled at his disappearing form. \"I'll see you at the Royal Dining Hall, or whatever they call the eating joint around here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor stormed down the hall yelling at the top of his lungs: \"I WANT THE TEXAS POSSE OUT HERE ASAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept repeating that call until finally, one after another sleepy-headed Texans began to gather around him in the great hall. After everyone, including the invisible Stealthman was standing around him, he began by looking hard at Deb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little missy,\" he growled. \"It looks like you have had a busy night. What other rooms have you broken into besides MINE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb looked around nervously. \"Well, uh....gee, boss it wasn't just me you know\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor crossed his arms and continued to glare at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb took a deep breath...\"Well I guess I might have been in CC's room,\" she told him as she tried to hide something behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YO, Tor,\" a voice sounded in an empty space next to Deb.\" Check out what she has behind her back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it Dan if you don't turn off that suit, I'm gonna cut the wires,\" Tor snapped at him. Dan quickly popped into view as Deb stuck her tongue out at him. Tor just as quickly,. reached around Deb and grabbed the object she held hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww,\" Tor exclaimed. \"What the heck are you doing with a horse's tail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb reddened and replied. \"That is one of the objects I had to retrieve for the ghost\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghost?\" Tor looked like he was going to burst a blood vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the one that wanted my help down in the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor closed his eyes and let out a long sigh. \"You want to start at the beginning here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Deb told Tor about her venture down into the Castle dungeon and about Stealthman rescuing her from the kissing ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Tor mused. \"What  you are saying is that all we have to do is bring that horse-tail, the frying pan and Robin Hood's golden arrow to this ghost and he will make all our dreams come true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and Deb nodded in unison. \"Yup,\" Dan agreed. \"That's all we gotta do\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeresa chimed in then. \"Well all we have left to get is that arrow, I guess since Lauren gave her the frying pan and she cut off the nag's tail\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor grinned then. \"Well hell then I say we get busy. Go hide all this stuff and act innocent and stuff. We will wait for Queeny to take us on the tour to find this Hood guy then we will strike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed then scattered to their respective room to either get ready for breakfast or hide the evidence....which ever came first!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, the fanfare involving Tor, the bling and the badly rehearsed song almost put the crowd off their meal, but in the end, even the sight of him sitting next to an uncomfortable Queen Scarlett at the royal head table couldn\u2019t keep us from eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for CC, that is.

Go get some shoes on and stop grossing everybody out.\u201d  As CC left the breakfast hall, dragging his jabby thingy along the marble floor, Tor sucked milk out of his mustache, raised his chalice and bid us all to continue eating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Scarlett choked on her eggs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Max walked patiently beside him as they surveyed the buffet line.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan leaned across the buffet table and spoke to the attendant, \u201cWhere\u2019s the grits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, the hominy grits\u2026grits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant elevated his nose and spoke condescendingly, \u201cThe oatmeal, sugar, and milk are at the end of the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan shuttered, \u201cOatmeal, what do I look like?  I don\u2019t want no oats.  You think I\u2019m a horse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoof, grrrrr!\u201d Max agreed, and he don\u2019t even like grits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant leaned in close over the table and whispered, \u201cSir, I would not use that word if I were you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oatmeal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sir, horse.  It\u2019s sort of a touchy subject.\u201d  With that the attendant motioned out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked outside in the fine morning and saw Sir Dufus on his embarrassed horse that was sorta bare assed.  \u201cHey, that horse ain\u2019t got no tail!!\u201d  Dan pointed out the window.  Heads turned toward the window.  Slowly one chuckle emerged, and then another and another.  Soon the whole room was laughing at the tailless horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> ** Image ID #1177415 Unavailable ** </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey CC!\u201d someone yelled.  \u201cWhat\u2019s you\u2019re horse\u2019s name\u2026..Stubby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice blurted out, \u201cHey, it\u2019s Sir Bare Ass and his horse Stubby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was in an uproar, holding their sides, pointing at the stubbed-butted horse.  Dan walked down the buffet line loading his plate, dropping sausages on the floor where they were eagerly gobbled up by Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled to himself, \u201cThat\u2019s one stubby horse.  How does he hold the armor on his butt without a tail? [chuckle]  I betcha it\u2019s secured with duct tape. [chuckle]\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down at a vacant table.  He put the image of the embarrassed horse out of his mind and turned to the issue at hand.  There was a golden arrow to retrieve.  This would certainly require the super stealthy abilities of Stealthman and Stealthdog.  There was much to think about.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know of Princess Penelope's allergies.  We can't have her Highness sneezing during the entire stay.\"  He sniffed rudely at Chewie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you jumped up toad.  Give the Princess these until we leave.  She'll be right as rain.\"  Teresa slapped a bottle of allergy meds into his hand.  \"And you and some of your lackeys go get our stuff out of that maze of a dungeon you stuck us in last night.  I'm exhausted.  I need a nap!  We wandered around for hours in the dark down there before we finally found the out hole.  Hell of a place you got here, Scarlett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well....  If this is straightened out....I'm going to go see if my knight needs me....er, in his time of need.  Maybe a Merit Circle will help his steed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Un huh.  You do that.  I'm gonna take a nap.

No funny business this time, or I'll sick King Tor on you!  He and I are tight, you know.  You Brits aren't the only ones with royalty around.  We brung our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her room, Teresa wandered around searching through cabinets and poking into cupboards.  She had said she wanted a nap, but now she was just too restless to sleep.  Jumping people out got her blood up and it wasn't conducive to sleeping.  She was admiring a particularly nice wall sconce when suddenly it slipped off to one side.  She was afraid it was going to fall off the wall.  In her haste to catch it she fell against the wall panel in front of her.  To her surprise, not only did the sconce not fall, the panel gave with her weight and she fell down a short flight of stairs, landing heavily on her side.  Chewie slipped into the secret passage just as it closed seamlessly leaving them once again in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teresa?\"  Sudden light flared about ten feet from her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merwow!!\"  Chewie started several feet into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanette?  What are you doing in here?\"  Teresa asked as she got slowly to her feet dusting herself off.  \"And where is here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanette giggled.  \"Here is the motherlode.  This is part of a series of secret passages that run throughout this castle.  I've been exploring them since we got here.  Well, when I wasn't...nevermind.\"  Nanette blushed furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't a cop for nothing!  These old places always had secret passages built into them.  You see it all the time in old books and movies.\"  She grinned wildly.  \"You wouldn't believe what everyone was up to last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....I gotta ask.  Have you been watching the Texans meet?\"  Teresa bit her lip.  Could they have a convert?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanette nodded, her eyes shining in the lamp light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I gotta know.

Sitting up in the bed she realized that it was hard knocking at her door which had awaken her from a nightmare.  \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, she rubbed her backside, aware that something had been poking her back all night, but alas, she was so tired she couldn\u2019t be bothered to look.  She reached the massive door, \u201cAll right already,\u201d and swung the door open to be face to face with\u2026.Mel and some faintly familiar, dark-haired woman dressed up in a white zip-up suit a silver F emblazoned across the chest, a silver cape, and completing the outfit were with gleaming silver boots.  There was an aura of \u2026.what\u2026silver glitter\u2026.that swirled around her essence.  She held in her  outstretched hands a silver box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mel.  Who is <i>this woman with you?</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww Nada honey, don\u2019t you recognize her?  Look closely.\u201d  Mel smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNada studied the face, yes, vaguely famiiar, in an odd sort of way, but still, no clue.  She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman took a step towards her, she had\u2026well, what could best be described as a halting gait, yet fluid and strong.  Nada stepped back and then BOING, her eyes popped out as she recognized the woman\u2026\u201dFOREVER?  Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision in silver and white smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell, get in here wimmins\u2026what\u2019s up?\u201d  She hugged Mel, then Forever, still stunned by the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever spoke first.  \u201cHey Nada.  Look, I never let anyone know before, but I have been given SUPERPOWERS.  Actually, when I lost my leg, they replaced it, and a whole lot more too.  I am sort of \u2026well, bionic now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d  Mell interrupted, \u201cIsn\u2019t this the greatest thing since\u2026well\u2026the discovery of Stealthman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, much better, so much more <i>appropriately dressed too.</i>\u201d  Mel commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Did you make your costume?\u201d  <i>I knew she sewed well, but damn, I gotta get her to whip me up a few gowns!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNada, yes, but never-mind my costume, I\u2019ve transformed for a reason, that\u2019s why we are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, shall I tell her or do you want to?\u201d  Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou.\u201d  Forever said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you.\u201d  Mel answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a damn minute\u2026somebody tell me what\u2019s going on\u2026I need to check something out, so spill, NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNada went to the bed and struggled to lift the mattress, dying to know what had pained her back.  \u201cOOOOMPH\u2026UGHHHH\u2026UUUUUHHHH\u2026.\u201d, the mattress was so heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForever took one finger and threw the mattress up off of the bed.  Nada was stunned, speechless at the strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool.\u201d  Mel cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh-haaa\u2026I see the culprit\u2026it\u2019s a \u2026a\u2026.a dang golden arrow!

Finally, I could take no more and I asked, \u201cWhat are WE going to do about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever shoved the silver box at me, \u201cThe answer is inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly I lifted the lid, not knowing what to expect.  Inside was a small scroll, tied up with a silver ribbon and a few Merit Circles dropped out, each one had a letter in the center.  \u201cWhaaaaa?\u201d  Nada gathered the Circles and untied the scroll.  It read, \u201cPUT THE LETTERS TOGETHER TO FORM A WORD FROM YOUR SAVIOR.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm, can I get some help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wimmins placed them on the floor, standing back to analyze them, hoping they would be like the answers on \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d, revealing the puzzle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGawd, we need Vanna White to turn the letters over\u2026.\u201d  Nada scratched her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026.how about if we get Ben to put on his Kilt?\u201d  Mel said excitedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm.

I mean who in the world gets totally nekid to take a nap in the middle of the day?  Regular folk don\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dummy!

You know, the same one that took Deb to Kissin\u2019 Bad Butt John.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure it was the same one?\u201d Tor interrupted Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, besides, how many of them could there be.  It was the same one.

But, he held somethin\u2019 in his hand that was all shiny.  I couldn\u2019t tell what it was for a moment.  And then I saw.  Yup, then I saw what it was.  I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw.  But, I really saw it.  Right there in front of\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright already! What was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck, it was a golden arrow.

We just gotta do somethin\u2019 to get that dang arrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor stared at Mel questioningly, \u201cWell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the heck did I know?

Suddenly he broke into a clearing and he discovered where the voices were coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in front of him was...well..EVERYBODY! Dang! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNada was there, standing next to Ben who was dressed in one of those sissy man-skirts, Lauren was standing to their left, grasping the handles of her bicycle. EmmyLoo was next to her with Party on her right, looking a bit dazed and confused. Deb, Teresa and Stealthman rounded out the mob. Well at least the Texas Posse was here, Tor thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Pastvoices and Mel broke into the clearing. Mel was accompanied by some chick in a silvery, glittering, very form fitting costume, replete with a long cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, nice outfit cutie,\" Tor remarked as he leered at the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even missing a beat, Mel heaved a frying pan at Tor's head. Tor, without even thinking, deftly sidestepped the flying pan and it whizzed by his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it, Tor,\" Mel yelled at him. \"Control the hormones,  this here is Forever and she is in Super hero mode as Glitter Girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" Tor mumbled. \"Sorry Forever, I didn't recognize you in that sexy little number\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever rolled her eyes and asked Mel if she could borrow a pan...just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tor could say anything else, there was a big racket and the crowd all looked to the east...Five men on horseback rode into the clearing; each dressed up in full Knight gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look who's here,\" Tor drawled. \"It's the Bare-Assed Knight and his bob-tailed Nag. Who's your buddies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC drew himself up proudly and addressed the milling crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAVE COME TO REDEEM THE HONOR OF MY STEED\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor chuckled. \"Hell boy, you're just a little late on that one ain't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so, you knarly knave,\" CC's voice was hard as mud (its CC, remember). \"I have brought some of my fellow knights to help me in my Holy battle against you dastardly Texas barbarians\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aforementioned knights spurred their horses and rode even with Sir Dufus. CC continued:<br>\r\n'<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce my friends,\" he said in a loud, yet irritating voice. \"This is Silent Knight, Three Dog Knight, Last Knight, and Good Knight. They have agreed to join me in battle for Queen and Country!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis introduction was met with a moment of stunned silence. The assembled knights looked out at the crowd with haunty,  proud stares. Suddenly the silence was broken by Nada who started to giggle. This breach in sound quickly grew into a flood of laughter and cat-calls as the large group succumbed to the collective weirdness of the motley knights and their cockamamie names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCC and the knights sat their steeds in stony silence as everyone struggled to suppress their mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY, DAT'S ENOUGH LAFFING AT MY FRIENDS!\" CC yelled at the crowd. His face was a bright shade of purple from his rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor nodded as he wiped tears from his eyes, still giggling. \"Oh man CC,\" he choked. \"Only YOU could come up with a group like this. Thanks bud, that's the best laugh I've had since I got to this place\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four enraged Knights and CC all lowered their pointy, jabby things and made ready to charge the group who were showering them with scorn. The crowd went silent. Stealthman went into 'Battle mode...he disappeared along with his stealthdog, Max. Mel hefted two frying pans and eyed the knights...figuring windage and elevation.  Glitter Girl was getting set to...well, I'm not sure what she was gonna do but I bet it was gonna be fun to watch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel threw a spare pan at Tor for that last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hon,\" Tor said absently as he dodged it yet again.<br>\r\nYes, battle was about to be joined and it promised to be a bloody one indeed. Then, from out of nowhere (that's how most of this stuff happens in this story) the great Queen, Scarlett steps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD, HOLD AND DESIST, I SAY!\" Her royal voice boomed out across the clearing. \"There shall be no bloodletting in our beloved Sherwood Forest. We must find a way to settle our differences and become friends\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat Chance,\" mumbled CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me come over there,\" Da Queen growled at the dufus knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sowwy Queenie,\" a chastened CC answered her as he and his \"knights\" lowered their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Queen I got an idea,\" Tor spoke casually. \"How about we settle this whole ruckus with a horse race...that's how we do it in Texas. Me against the Buckethead and his short-tailed horse\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen smiled at Tor. \"I think that is a smashing idea, Sir Tor,\" she beamed. \"We shall have a Royal Horse Race: Three times around the clearing and the winner shall take all. Whosoever wins the race shall keep the bling,bling crown and septer, they shall have all the things the ghosts sent them to gather and they shall have whatever reward the ghosts promised them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Tor snapped as he turned and motioned to Stealthman to bring forward his horse; a beautiful bay colored mare, a true Texas Quarter Horse complete with Texas saddle. Tor swung easily up into the saddle and wheeled the horse around to face CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay buddy,\" he said confidently to a suddenly worried looking CC. \"Time for me to show you how we do this stuff in Texas\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the race was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no contest. Tor lapped CC on his second turn around the clearing and he won handily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA MIGHTY CHEER WENT UP! TOR HAD WON THE RACE! THE CROWD WENT WILD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor jumped off his horse as he skidded to a stop across the finish line and he surveyed the field. CC was still laboring to catch up to him, the other knights were exiting the clearing with very disgusted looks on their faces. Everyone was gathered around the Queen and everyone was trying to talk at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Tor noticed Mel standing apart from everyone else and she was talking to another stranger. He was a short little bald man and he was glumly counting out this huge wad of bills...money...coin of the realm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor strode up to his sweetie. \"What's going on honey?\" He asked his wife. \"Why is this stranger paying you money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel smiled at her hubby. \"Oh this guy just happened by before the race started and he wanted to bet on the outcome, so I agreed to bet him\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor looked at the crestfallen stranger as Mel continued. \"This is Sam Body, he bet on the Bob-Tailed Nag...I  just bet on the Bay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor smiled. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tipped the cup and drained it in three echoing gulps.  \u201cAhh, nothin\u2019 like milk straight from the udder,\u201d he uttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience applauded weakly.  Ben and Nada rolled their eyes in perfect unison while tapping their fingertips together, Mel clapped with one hand, patting the bulge in her pocket, Glitter Girl had difficulty clapping with the long velvet bag swinging from her wrist.  The Texans though, they roared and cheered.  Nanette and C.L. Hanna were off away from the group, offering the horses handfuls of dandelions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bay, his job completed, stood sweating and puffing, neglected by his mighty regal.  The race had been a travesty; even I on my bike, carrying my pack and my fish, could have beaten the amour laden Advillicuss and CC.  And now the poor, defeated man stood on the fringe of the crowd, standing next to me and fuming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis didn\u2019t turn out so good,\u201d I said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine <i>you\u2019d</i> like to have the chance to be a hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redness of his hears and neck belied the nonchalance of his tepid replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know a way you can save the day,\u201d I whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned away from the group, now mumbling about merit circles and what was for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave CC the penny version of the ghost story, which explained why his horse lost his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY GOSH!\u201d he cried, too loudly.  I put my hand over his mouth to shut him up.  Not a pleasant experience, that.  CC\u2019s huffing nose dripped\u2026\u2026well, it dripped all over my hand, but I kept my palm pressed firmly against his lips until he\u2019d calmed down and was willing to speak quietly.  More accurately, I kept my palm pressed against his lips until he stuck out his tongue and licked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy precious had his tail cut off for a <b>ghost</b>?\u201d he sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, CC, what\u2019s been done can\u2019t be undone now, but you can save the day by getting the golden arrow.\u201d  A light went on somewhere in that vast cavern of a mind of his and his eyes sparked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs far as my <i>overhearing</i> has lead me to understand, Glitter Girl has the projectile of precious metal.  Is that right, Finn?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn flashed blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can manage to get a golden arrow and get it to Deb to get to the ghost, you\u2019ll be a hero, worthy of celebration,\u201d I told CC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019d have to do? Get the arrow and give it to Deb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.  Of course, there may be other Texans and a few additional stragglers with an interested concern.  It seems as if everyone want to have the desires of their heart granted them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, whatever.  Get the arrow.  Give it to whoever wants it.  And I\u2019m a hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think it\u2019ll be easy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn flashed red.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d left the group in order to return Finn to his tank, as he was again looking a bit peaked, and was surprised when GG asked me for a lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely you can get back without my help,\u201d I\u2019d said.  \u201cYou can probably run there faster than I can pedal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look,\u201d she miffed back at me.  \u201cI\u2019m a powerfully strong super hero, but I have my limits, and running is one of them.  Besides, sometimes I just need to be Forever, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t exactly know, but I could guess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we crossed the drawbridge, Forever noticed a nest of bubbles on the stagnant water of the moat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you look at that,\u201d she said.  \u201cI wish we had Galinago with us to say what\u2019s making those bubbles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the source of the bubbles became apparent when through the surface rose the heads of Party and Emmy, adrape with green moat slime.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you twooooo,\u201d I called from above, waving.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmy blushed and smacked Party.  \u201cI <b>told</b> you we\u2019d get caught!\u201d she said, as she mounted his shoulders, submerging her frolicking partner.  That was when Forever and I noticed the two of them were skinny dipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty reemerged, sputtering.  He held out his tongue obligingly, allowing a tadpole exit from the maw of man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet us out of here!\u201d Party hollered.  \u201cWe\u2019ve fallen in and can\u2019t get out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled from my backpack another length of rope and a skate board.  \u201cI\u2019ve got the tools, Forever, but we\u2019re going to need Glitter Girl for this.\u201d  It was a simple task for me to tie the rope to the wheels of the board and improvise a seat; it was a simple task for Glitter Girl to pull the seat from the moat with Emmy aboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe lowered the contraption for Party, but he refused to come up until we\u2019d thrown down his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmy, who had dressed faster than I thought any human could, held up Party\u2019s shorts and teased, \u201care these what you want big man?  First, let me recall why you\u2019re down there in this embarrassing state in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said you wanted to go for a swim!\u201d whined Party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go and blame me.  That\u2019s just like a man.  I wanted to go back and get our swim suits.  I wanted to find a swimming pool  But noooooo.  \u2018This\u2019ll be fun,\u2019 you say.  \u2018Who\u2019s around to see?\u2019  you ask.  \u2018It\u2019s not slimy, English water is always green,\u2019 you lie.  \u2018We can get back out easy, just climb the bank and dress before they all get back,\u2019 you insist.  \u2018They\u2019ll be gone for hours,\u2019 you google eyed.  How dare you persuade me to do this?!\u201d  Emmy wadded Party\u2019s shorts and stuffed them down her shirt, then snatched his jeans and ran into the courtyard, laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s gonna have to go fetch me something to put on,\u201d Party called up weakly.  And please hurry, I\u2019m about wore out, treading water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for Party, I had the solution in my backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitter Girl pulled Party onto the drawbridge, just as the others returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the heck is that sorry thing?\u201d asked  Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty stood, a sorry thing, indeed.  His chest hairs lay matted with slime, an imperfect V of green fur peeking from the opened zipper of the snowsuit.  Similar hairy patches emerged from the too-short arms and legs of the outfit.  Strands of green pond weed hung from his head like creepy lagoon locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hand out, warding off comments that were forming in the minds and mouths of the audience.  \u201cDo NOT ask,\u201d he commanded, then turned and waddled back to the castle, following the wet footprints left behind by Emmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd remained, suppressing their laughter for a few moments more.  I couldn\u2019t help noticing CC and a few others gave intent attention, not to Party\u2019s departure, but to Forever, who was absently fingering through the cloth of her velvet bag, the item contained within.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing! \u201cWhoa this is strange,\u201d Deb thought. \u201cI\u2019ll go find Jeeves and see what the heck is going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe searched high and low and FINALLY found Jeeves picking lint off the red carpet in the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeves, howdy dude. Have you seen anyone lately coming and going?\u201d Deb asked throwing her olive up in the air and catching it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadam\u2026tell me you just didn\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t do Jeeves; wanna see me do it again?\u201d Deb asked grabbing another olive out of her drink. \u201cSo have you seen any live bodies in this here castle lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery few madam and it has been a good day indeed.\u201d Jeeves replied sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? So who\u2019s here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeeves got out his pocket pc and looked up his weirdos onstar tracker thingy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell Party used his cell phone to travel back in time and uh let\u2019s see; he is standing on an ice berg waving his arms and hands screaming \u201cgo left, go left,\u201d and Emmylooloo is in her room making curtains to redecorate the castle but it seems she sewed herself into one of them and is trying to figure out what went wrong. Ah I see Queen Scarlett left the castle to attend an important meeting with master CC. Oh my, what in the world are they doing? Oh they are playing pin the tail on the horsey. King Tor is in his room google-ing information on where to find rubber frying pans for Mel. Stealthman is invisible so I can\u2019t begin to tell you where he is. Nanette, Forever, CL, Lauren, esperanza and Theresa are passing out flyers for the gala tonight. Hmm the flyers say \u201cParty at the haunted castle. Free booze!\u201d Windini is taking a nap; the poor woman is exhausted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what about Nada and Ben?\u201d Deb asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadam my tracker is rated PG-13 and it won\u2019t let me see.\u201d Mr. Jeeves said closing his pc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m bored Jeeves.

Our passage was far from silent as we were followed by the rest of the crew, quibbling and nipping at each other like a pack of hungry puppies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shone the flashlight ahead and asked Deb if she was sure she could remember how to find the ghost John\u2019s cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust follow the burnt out torches on the walls,\u201d she said, and sure enough, they led us right to the bolted door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTor and Dan came forward to release the bolt and swing open the heavy door, revealing to the crowd the grungy, stinking hairy ghost, who had promised to grant hearts\u2019 desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.L. Hannah pinched her nose and sucked in her breath.  \u201cDang, this dude reeks!\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful what you say,\u201d whispered Teresa, poking her elbow into the Tea Lady\u2019s ribs.  \u201cHe might be offended, and something tells me this is a dude we don\u2019t want to get on the bad side of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, John.  I\u2019ve got your stuff.\u201d  Deb handed over the iron skillet grail thingy, the horse\u2019s tail and the faux golden arrow, gleaming with dried egg yolk.  \u201cNow, do what you said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, woman!\u201d the ghost bellowed.  \u201cI am not to be ordered about like a serf!!!!\u201d  He shifted his eyes among the gathering and took a step back into the darkened corner. \u201cBesides, first I have to use these things to make a potion, then I\u2019ll have the power to grant you your desires before I leave this place for good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, get to it then, stinky,\u201d Deb said, clearly unconcerned with offending the oaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn scanned the empty cell, then addressed the crowd.  \u201cYou all better just go away and come back later. I can\u2019t make the potion now.  I need a fire and don\u2019t have any wood or flint here to start one.  You go away and leave that door open, then I\u2019ll go out and get what I need.  Come back tomorrow and I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a pig\u2019s eye!\u201d Deb said.  \u201cWhat?  You take us for fools?\u201d  She looked at me and I delved into my backpack, pulling from its recesses my camp stove and lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn watched in disbelief as I turned the nozzle on the stove, lit the HUSTLER lighter and made fire.  \u201cThere you go, big guy.  You can make your potion,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t make a potion without water,\u201d he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!  Here you go!!\u201d  Nanette pushed her way through the group and offered her liter bottle of Avian water.  \u201cI never go anywhere without my water,\u201d she explained.  \u201cHasn\u2019t anyone noticed?\u201d  Everyone shook their heads, including me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the bottle and poured it into the iron skillet, then placed the pan on the little stove.  \u201cHave at it, John,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost coiled poor Advillicuss\u2019 tail and placed it in the water, which was already beginning to boil.  That stove boils water like no body\u2019s business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd standing in the doorway rearranged itself periodically over the next five minutes, so everyone could get a glimpse of the simmering tail.  The odor filling that tiny cell and leaking out into the corridor was about as rank as the reeking ghost.  Nada began fanning herself with her hand, and Ben stood close at hand, watching her anxiously.  Winda stood in the doorway and faced her compatriots, then opened her mouth and blew.  Tor held tightly to his bling crown, Emmy\u2019s hair snapped in the stiff breeze, and Party just managed to grab his fishing cap before it blew into Esperanza\u2019s face.  But everyone took a deep breath and a bit of color returned to once ashen faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n John lowered his face to the skillet and took a deep, satisfied breath.  He picked up the arrow and stirred the potion with its tip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should think a golden arrow could be put to better use,\u201d observed Deb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna stir my potion with this?\u201d  John held up a finger, black with grime, crowned by a nail encrusted with nothing any of us wanted to know about.  \u201cI guess you\u2019ve go a point,\u201d Deb answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn watched his stirring intently, squinted his eyes, lifted the arrow and inspected it, then let out a roar that sent chills up the spines of everyone present.  He spun to face Deb, pointing the egg yolk dripping arrow at her face.  \u201cHow dare you try and trick me!!!\u201d  He approached her with surprising speed and pinned her against the wall.  \u201cShall I put <i>this</i> arrow to better use?  Shall I use it to gouge out your eyes?  Shall I use it to rip open your guts and watch you die in agony?  I could use some company if I\u2019m going to be staying here another few hundred years!\u201d  He teased the arrow along her cheek and bared his black teeth.  \u201cWhich shall it be?  You choose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb was having a hard time deciding on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGET OUTTA MY WAY!!\u201d  CC called as he fell into the room.  Forever\u2019s velvet pouch flew from his hand and slid across the floor.  CC slithered on his belly to retrieve it, then opened the pouch and pulled out the real golden arrow, holding it up triumphantly.  Or as triumphantly as was possible from the position of lying on his belly.  \u201cJust in time to SAVE THE DAY!!!\u201d  he crowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCC, how did you get that?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave it to him.\u201d  The crowd parted to allow passage to an out of breath Forever.  \u201cI only wanted to use it as a mantle decoration in my new home, anyway.  CC traded me some nifty merit circles, so now I have more than Scarlett!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn threw down the crap arrow and snatched the golden one out of CC\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d  CC hollered.  \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to go and cut me, you know!\u201d  He held up his hand; blood dripped from a scarlet line in his palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn dragged CC over to the iron skillet grail tingy and shook the bleeding hand over the potion.  When five drops of blood had landed sizzling into the elixir, the ghost recommenced his stirring, this time with the real golden arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is ready,\u201d he announced.  \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee it will work unless I drink it from a silver chalice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to Tor, whose attempt to step back was hindered by the press of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, No you don\u2019t!!\u201d  Tor yelled as Stealthman wrenched the chalice from the pseudo king\u2019s hand.  The bling chalice rose above the crowd, traveling over heads in invisible hands, until it came within reach of the ghost John, who took it from the air.  He poured his concocted potion into the bling chalice and gulped it down.  Tor raced into the room and snatched his precious from the grimy hands, then tripped over CC in his rush to make it back out to the safety of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn heaved a contented sigh, stood tall and began to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo disappearing yet!\u201d  Deb commanded.  \u201cYou owe us the desires of our hearts.  You promised!\u201d  She pointed her finger at the diminishing figure.  \u201cA bargain\u2019s a bargain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to tell the truth,\u201d John confessed, \u201cI slightly overrated my powers.  I can\u2019t really give you <i>all</i> the desires of your heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I\u2019ll settle for just a few,\u201d Deb insisted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea,\u201d the crowd agreed, \u201cjust a few will do.  We\u2019re not greedy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you think I am?  A genii?  I\u2019m just a ghost.  Who ever heard of a ghost granting wishes?\u201d  John gave forth a hearty laugh before becoming as invisible as Stealthman.  A hot breeze wafted through the gathering, down the corridors and up the stairs.  We heard the door at the top slam shut and knew John was gone forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a rip-off,\u201d Deb whined. \"Now I'm not going to have a better dress than Nada at the ball tonight!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She opened it and read the letter.  When she finished it, she dropped the letter into her lap and laughed.  What was the queen up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle was abuzz; all had received the invitations to the Farewell Humbug Ball.  It was a sad time, but true to the Queen\u2019s sense of humor she\u2019d come up with the Humbug Ball combined with a Farewell party for all of us who had come over on that crazy transatlantic cruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to be a formal affair, so now everyone was scrambling to figure out what to wear.  The Queen had made provisions though, a room filled with all sorts of appropriate clothing, it would be up to us to find the ones that most suited our personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nada opened the door to the \u201cselection room\u201d she saw things flying about the room.  Squeals of laughter and a general sense of excitement filled the air.  Each rack of clothing came with a name posted above it; there was one for each of us.  She perused the racks, looking for her own, but could not help but notice Emmyloo and Party were tangled up in something, which looked like a fish net.  Hmmm.  Dan\u2019s rack was filled with a huge selection of jammies, one looked like a Santa Suit, another with reindeer, and even some baby dolls!  Ben had two racks, one for him, and another tiny one for his naked mole rat.  Mel and Tor were looking through theirs, an odd assortment of pink cocktail dresses...but hey, not for me to say anything.  Nanette found some lovely flowing Christmas plaid, long skirts with different colored velvet jackets, Deb\u2019s rack held a selection of minidresses, all sparkly, Teresa\u2019s had the most beautiful gold embroidered gowns, while the Great Windini\u2019s rack had the most elegant pantsuits all trimmed in a white fur (real?), CL Hanna\u2019s held slinky numbers, while Forever\u2019s rack had what could only be described as Cat suits in various colors of velvet.  When she reached CC\u2019s rack, well she stopped in her tracks, to admire the selection of armor, as well as medal covered formal wear.  He was going to be one spiffy Knight!  Next to that Lauren was throwing on different gowns of iridescent colors, seemingly undecided on which looked the loveliest.  There was even a rack for Esperanza, though all black, as she had been in mourning since the loss of her sheep.  Finally she found the rack with her name on it...the gowns took her breath away, all in jewel tones!  Time to get one picked out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball was to begin at seven, with a wonderful dinner, some dancing, winding up with a caravan of carriages, which would take everyone to the Queen\u2019s jet for the ride home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNada thought Scarlett was being quite clever, getting everyone out before more havoc could ensue, especially in view of the past weeks of mayhem in her castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt precisely seven, two golden trumpets blared and the wide doors of the ballroom opened, letting everyone inside to admire the largest, most beautifully lit Christmas tree in the land.  The room was decorated to the hilt in gilded gold and bright red, tiny white fairy lights light the ceiling made it look as though the night sky was visible.  It truly was breathtaking, as apparent as a collective gasp could be heard upon the orderly entry.  <i>Yes, I did say orderly!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were footmen dressed in their finery to escort each of us to our seat at the beautifully set tables, arranged in a semi-circle around the Queen\u2019s throne which had been set among a scene of snow covered trees, and some decorative, silver deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeautiful goblets were now being filled with the finest wines the Queen could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as everyone was seated, a small group of golden ducks was being led to a tiny stage by Nottingham Bear.  The lights lowered and the general buzz of the group fell silent as the ducks began to sing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.\u201dOn the first day of Humbug, my true friends gave to me...<br>\r\nA knight in shining armor named CC<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second day of Humbug my true friends gave to me,<br>\r\nTwo big old suites<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third day of Humbug my true friends gave to me,<br>\r\nThree swine to dine on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fourth day of Humbug my true friends gave to me<br>\r\nFour crazy Texans<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fifth day of Humbug my true friends gave to me<br>\r\nFive cashmere sweaters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the sixth day of Humbug my true friends gave to me<br>\r\nSix Excedrin headaches<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the seventh day of Humbug my true friends gave to me,<br>\r\nSeven bottles of wine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne the eighth day of Humbug my true friends gave to me<br>\r\nEight celebrities<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ninth day of Humbug my true friends gave to me<br>\r\nNine naked mole rats<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tenth day of Humbug my true friends gave to me<br>\r\nTen exotic footmen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the eleventh day of Humbug my true friends gave to me<br>\r\nEleven rechargeable batteries<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the twelfth day of Humbug my true friends gave to me<br>\r\nTwelve wishes granted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the conclusion of this charming duck-choir the trumpeters blared out the melody announcing the Queen was making her grand entrance.  Everyone in the room stood as Queen Scarlett strode in, resplendent  in a strapless red gown over which she wore an ermine trimmed cape.  On her head was a veritable treasure chest of diamonds and rubies.  She took our collective breaths away with her regalness.  She stood at the throne, her admiring guests smiling and applauding, and finally motioned for us to take our seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was abuzz, the gentlemen looking handsome and the ladies were all knockouts in their attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClink..clink.\u201d  Queen Scarlett tapped her goblet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I have your attention.\u201d  The room once again fell silent.  \u201cMy dearest friends, I can\u2019t tell you all how much you all mean to me.  The fact that you all took so much time and effort to get to Nottingham, all for the purpose of visiting me...well, it has touched my heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads nodded, as she went on, \u201cYou all have given me many laughs, and have had to put up with some very unsavory things to be here, and even managed to please my resident ghost, not to mention the sacrifices my dear, sweet CC made for appeasing Robin Hood.  You all have made me realize just how much I am wubbed...trully wubbed.\u201d  With this, Scarlett\u2019s eyes welled up, and her voice cracked.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am so overwhelmed that you all would do this for...me.  I wanted to thank you all, by throwing this ball tonight. It is my fondest desire that each of you enjoy yourselves.  So...eat, drink, be merry!  I toast each of you!\u201d  She raised her goblet as we all raised ours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe WUB the Queen!\u201d   The crowd went wild.  Then the waiters began filing in, great silver platters filled with all kinds of exotic foods.  Everyone helped themselves, even Max, who sat at Stealthman\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the music began to play and our own CC got up and strode to the foot of the throne, bowing deeply to the Queen.  (He nearly put her eye out with his jabby thing, but other than that, he did really good!)  \u201cMy Queen, may I have this dance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett rose and took his hand, and the band played on as they took a spin around the magical dancefloor.  After the song ended, the Queen motioned to the rest of the group to join her, and they did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone took turns dancing with each other, so festive was the mood...well, until Deb decided she wanted to do the Limbo under CC\u2019s jabby thing...then things got really good.  Ben\u2019s naked mole rat managed to go lower than anyone...partially because he was the only one who could scoot around the now bent-back Tor, who was stuck!  It was ok though, CC passed the Advil and Mel whomped him on the head with her ever-present skillet and he shot out unceremoniously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt precisely midnight, the trumpets blared, and Queen Scarlett took her throne, for one last time.  \u201cMy dearest friends, the coaches are out front, they shall transport you to my plane, the time has come to say farewell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone rushed to Scarlett, hugging her, saying their special goodbyes, to her and their now, closer than ever, friends.  One by one they headed out for the ride, happy to have come, but eager to return to their families and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett waved from her balcony as the line of black limos now snaking their way out of the castle grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was farewell, but never goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
