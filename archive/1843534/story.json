He had, in his pocket, a shrink ray!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that wasn\u2019t the plan. That was just the tool, a rather expensive tool at that, one in which he invested two years of his life plus a huge chunk of his parents\u2019 fortune. He was so proud of it, he even sprang the extra cash to have it covered in gold. Otherwise, his ray would simply have looked like a TV remote control. But now it was golden!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had one overriding thought in mind during these past two years. He would someday use his invention to shrink beautiful girls down to a size that would leave them entirely at his mercy. He couldn\u2019t quite explain it, and didn\u2019t care to, but he loved the notion of teeny tiny women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis day had arrived. The invention was complete, and it was time to claim his first victim. He knew just the right girl, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy Summers. Sure, she was a strange one, but damn, she was a hottie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark strode down a hall full of lockers. The tardy bell was about to ring, so hardly anyone was around, except for a few preoccupied with rushing to their next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just as expected, among the punctual-challenged, there she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was digging deep into her locker, pulling out a couple of books and shoving them into the backpack at her feet. He could have zapped her right then and there. But no. He wanted to see the look on her face when she realized what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark walked right up to her. \u201cUm, hi there, uh, Buffy,\u201d he said, failing to sound as confident as he intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy\u2019s head popped up from her bag. \u201cHuh? What?\u201d She looked like she had been a million miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mark didn\u2019t care what she was thinking about. He only cared what he was thinking about, that this would be a glorious moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Buffy said with little patience, urging him to get to the point. She was running late, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe liked that she was looking up at him. Soon, she\u2019d be looking way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled. \u201cI--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell rang. Buffy spun around to look at a clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hell with it. It was now or never. Mark whipped out his golden shrink ray and fired it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a circuit blew, and the machine...</span></div></div>",

He now stood well short of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he saw was the back of Buffy\u2019s shoes, but both looked more like buildings. He craned his neck back and looked up, up, up, and still up some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy was no longer some ordinary high school girl. As far as Mark was concerned, she had become Buffy the Giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, no! This wasn\u2019t fair! He wasn\u2019t the one who was supposed to become tiny! She was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge shoe rose into the air as Buffy turned around. Her now-booming voice began, \u201cSorry, but I really need to--\u201d The kid was gone, so she just shrugged and gave him not one more thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did, however, notice the golden device on the floor, which is when Mark realized: his shrinking machine hadn\u2019t shrunk with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, shiny.\u201d Buffy bent down to pick up the strange item. \u201cSomeone must really like their television,\u201d she said, studying the bizarre remote control. \u201cOr, maybe not anymore, or it wouldn\u2019t be all lost-and-found-y.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was futile, Mark shouted up, \u201cNo, you big blonde bimbo! It\u2019s not a remote! It\u2019s a shrink ray! My shrink ray! Give it here!\u201d He found it much easier to sound confident when he knew the relative giantess before him couldn\u2019t possibly hear a word he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy tossed the remote in her backpack.

He felt the floor drop out from beneath him as Buffy lifted the bag onto her back, unaware of her itsy bitsy passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough some minor miracle, despite the jolting and swaying resulting from the giant girl\u2019s rapid travel, Mark made it to the top of the pocket.

He needed to do this carefully, as he didn\u2019t want to drop onto any buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that\u2019s when Buffy stopped short to look at a clock and realize just how late for class she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark toppled over the edge and plummeted into the book bag\u2019s pocket.

Buffy's gasp of surprise was lost on the tiny Mark as he spiralled into the void.  Buffy remained a giant to him, but now she herself was less than an inch tall, meaning that he was falling into a world of titans, massive beyond comprehension.

Well, he had excellent attention to detail when it come to the routines of cute girls he intended to eventually shrink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to Willow\u2019s locker was quite a hike at his diminished size, but that was fine.

He ducked behind it as the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, giant feet began clomping down the hallway, and they swiftly multiplied exponentially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed up at the giants -- particularly the giant girls. He took mental notes on which ones he wanted to shrink as soon as his machine was functional again. He noticed Cordelia and her entourage parading down the hall. They all needed to be shrunken down as soon as possible, especially Cordelia. The sight of her as a giant filled Mark with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia\u2019s enormity so angered Mark that he failed to notice the huge sneaker slamming right down in front of him, knocking him off his own little feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his eyes upward, up an incredibly long pair of jeans and beyond to Willow\u2019s adorably innocent face, way up the \u201csky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had but one thought: Of all the days for her not to wear a skirt, geez...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hated how big she was right then, but he reminded himself it was temporary.

It almost sounded like a boy\u2019s voice...an effeminate boy, but she was pretty sure it was a male voice. A glance around revealed no one. So she shrugged and continued gathering her books. Of course no guys wanted to talk to her. Not even the effeminate ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWillow! I\u2019m down here! Quickly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown?

That was a lot of energy for so small a device!  But then...  The handheld remote was the size of a pickup before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth, Mark looked up at where Buffy stood, her legs now climbing high out of his line of vision.  That stupid device had gone and malfunctioned on him!  He never should have taken construction tips from that hooded stranger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalm, he told himself.  Anger wouldn't get him out of this situation.  He may have shrunk himself to - quick mental calculation - three inches high, but at least the corridors were empty.  There was only Buffy and she filled his world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stood relatively stationary as she loaded her bag, yet even her slightest movments were awe inspiring, clearly containing power far beyond the imaginings of tiny Mark.  All he'd have to do was gain her attention, get her to utilise his device to restore him, and he'd be free to plan anew!  If he was quick enough, he could wrest the control from her and cut her down to size before she realised what was going on, and the day could still be salvaged!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreedy thoughts flickering through his mind, Mark cleared his throat.  His announcement was thoroughly drowned out by the arrival of another girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pounded down the hallway, the impacts of her massive, booted feet shuddering the world.  Her greeting was bellowed, and as the two girls conferred, Mark was awestruck, watching the two huge forms with his jaw slack.  Buffy may not have been one of the 'popular' girls at school, but she had always dressed as if she were, her clothes revealing ample amounts of tanned skin and her hair dyed blonde.  The newcomer - and how had he never seen her around the school before? He would have remembered - was nquite different, pale of skin and dark haired, her clothes tough and no nonsense, her gestures and expressions far more masculine.  She had attitude.  He would love to shrink hr down, hold the angry young woman in his hand, and teach her who was truly in charge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word, B,\" she said, slapping a hand to Buffy's shoulder.  \"You ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Faith.  If I miss one more class, I'm going to be in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble?  Girl, we're in trouble every night of our lives, and with things a little bit more scary than being sent to the prinicipal's office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark managed to eventually train himself to block out the sound of their voices, allowing it to become a dull thunder far above his head and preventing it from distracting him.  He had no time to eavesdrop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith's huge boot shifted, planting itself directly parallel and alongside the remote.  If she'd seen it, she gave no sign, but it souldn't be too long before she did.  Mark could climb his invention and get the attention of these two girls from there.  Once restored, he could add them to his collection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, their current plans seemed less than accommodating to helping him.  This 'Faith' was a bad influence.  Buffy had yet to lift her bag from the gorund, and the barn-sized accessory was all too inviting a hiding place.  Mark could snuggle up in there until he had a better moment to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, perhaps trying to get either of these airheads to help was a complete waste of time; Mark had always felt that girls were beneath him, and how could they possibly accrue the brainpower to solve his problem?  No, perhaps he'd be better off leaving them to their hooky and setting off in search of someone with a mind worth mentioning.  If he did that though, where would be best to look?  A classroom, the principal's office, or perhaps even off school grounds?  Each would be quite a trek...</span></div></div>",

Those were eyes he could not resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith held the golden remote in her other hand. \u201cWild guess here, but I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say this is a shrink ray.

See what that little bod of yours is capable of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Mark had to fight to keep his face straight, to avoid throwing up, almost.  The idea of a tiny person and a giant... <i>interacting</i> had of course been in his mind before, but he'd always wished himself to the bigger of the pair in that situation.

He recognised the childish form of Willow, smartest girl in school, and the slovenly mess that was Xander Harris.  And was that the school librarian following behind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Faith,\" Buffy announced to the small crew, turning to address them and giving Mark cause to leap aside, lest her pretty little feet crush him.  \"Somehow she's gone Godzilla on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord,\" stammered the librarian - Giles, was it?  \"I've never heard of a phenomenon like this, of any magicks capable of such change...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you wouldn't have!  Mark thought to himself.  Only my own genius can devise such a thing!  But wait, why was he talking about magic, anyway?  This was very strange indeed...  Strange enough that Mark was tempted to keep quiet, see what theories this gang came up with, and not just announce himself straight away.</span></div></div>",

Wood, heart, dust.\"  Faith mimed the dust sprinkling into the air with the fingers of her free hand after they 'exploded' from the heart fist.  Off Mark's continued blank look, she shrugged.  \"Whatever.  Point is, I'm not gonna squish ya.  We're just gonna see a few sights, shrink a few things, have a few laughs.\"  She smiled brightly, and if Mark had one weakness (besides not quite understanding which direction to point a shrink ray before firing) it was that he couldn't say no to a smiling woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments before, she had been a snarling, taunting monster bouncing him in her palm.  But with a simple curve of her lips she had become a demure saint, incapable of harming him.  So yes, he'd play along with her.  In return, she'd no doubt restore him, and then he'd be able to imprison her as a living doll for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark hadn't gotten the hang of gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, the uh, the shrink ray works just like a remote - point and click.  The settings should be pretty self-explanatory.  Of particular importance is the 'undo' button, which could come in handy if you want to unshrink something that you accidently, uh, shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing no one's doing anything like that,\" Faith smiled, rolling him around in her palm a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had all the power, Mark was starting to realise.  He'd have to make a suggestion quick, to assert some direction over the situation.  Opening with a request for normalcy was a risk, but if he pulled it off he'd be home clear, overpowering her to get his property back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slower road to returning to his original plan would be to get Faith to shrink Buffy before she got too far away - that way, she'd have no choice but to cut class with her giant captor!  It would save Mark some time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slowest approach would be to take things outside, and run through agruelling process of tests, having Faith test each of the device's settings on inanimate objects.  Mark already had performed enough tests, but he wanted his accomplice at least slightly trained before he let her go off and do her own thing.</span></div></div>",

Somethin' impressive, to show 'em who's boss now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Mark was wondering if it was time to suggest he join Faith in regular scale.

If only they could get Buffy to look down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, the air-head was striding away, heedless of the tiny school populace scurrying for safety around her.  How many would she inadvertently crush before she realised what had happened?  And could Mark live with himself, knowing that he was responsible for all those deaths?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he'd really wanted was a simple kidnapping, not a mass slaughter.  Eh, perhaps this was karma's way of messing with him for daring to think of a selfish way to utilise one of mankind's greatest inventions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBah!  He would not allow this to defeat him!  He would rise again, and all would tremble before him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis posturing was undermined somewhat as a fly buzzed overhead, prompting the inventor to yelp and dash for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what was the first step, o mighty tyrant?  Mark pondered long and hard.  Buffy, being the only regular-sized person, was the best hope for safety, but she was also incredibly dangerous to approach, not to mention Mark's crippling fear of any female in a position of power.  He couldn't stand it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, he could seek a solution to the power problem; there must be some small enough measure of energy accessible somewhere around Sunnydale High!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps one of his fellow shrunken victims could provide assistance that e hadn't conceived of?  Unlikely, given that his IQ was several orders of magnitude greater than theirs, but he was willing to entertain the chance that one of their typically moronic comments could trigger a eureka moment for him...</span></div></div>",

A millimetre, at best?  Near invisible to the casual, naked eye?  A size that Buffy would likely not notice even as she stepped on it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that; the barest movement was going to cause havoc.  Buffy took a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir currents smashed Mark away from his place, tumbling across the hallway in the girl's wake.  This, in addition to the sonic booms of each foot's ground impact was enough to drive all sanity from his mind.  He turned his rage upon the device in his hands: work damn you, work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What would you do, for a way out of your predicament?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the voice cut through the chaos around Mark.  He had no visual bearing to judge where it was coming from, if it was coming from anywhere at all.  Nothing natural could create a sound capable of being heard over current events.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Natural...  From a man that has built a shrink ray.  Do you see the irony?  Can we just skip past the incredulity and get to the part where we make a deal?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was reading his thoughts, whatever it was.  And, given the current situation, there was no way that making a deal could make things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A wise decision.

Huh... you know, a smart person would have asked to be normal size.  Or to go back in time so they could undo not only this, but me offering them a deal in the first place.  Not that it'd work, but it's still something I expected you to try to pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, whatever.  No backsies!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrink ray in Mark's hands was radiated in an unholy energy.  Once it dissipated, the gun hummed back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!  Excellent!\" Mark pointed the ray to himself.  \"Now to grow myself back and make that bitch a teensie little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device suddenly grew hot in Mark's hands.  With a surprised shout, he dropped it to the ground.  Fortunately, it remained unbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hold it, sparky.  We need to discuss my end of the deal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... you want my soul, don't you?  Well you can't have it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What did I just say about no backsies?  And no, I don't need your soul.  You're the kind of guy that shrinks women and keeps them as sex toys. You're going to hell anyway.  What would getting your soul a few hours earlier accomplish?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I meant years.  And besides, I have a better idea.  See, we're big on cruel irony down here.  And the Slayer inadvertently killing those she's sworn to protect?  It's fantastic.  I mean, she almost unknowingly ended twelve lives just walking to her next class already! So close!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what would you have me do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need you to go to the middle of Sunnydale, and let the energy flow out of your little device again.  Don't worry, I added a function to let you do that on purpose; just push all the buttons at once.  Do that, and the rest of Sunnydale will be as small as you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the size of a gnat!  How am I supposed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You can grow yourself.  Just do it out of Buffy's sight.  In fact, leave Buffy alone.  If she sees you, or anyone she actually recognizes as human in the next twenty four hours, the deal's off and you go back to being the size of a crumb.  And I'll... I don't know, teleport you into her shoe or something.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting... I didn't want my device used for this.\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWell, you should have thought of that before.  But hey, I'm reasonable.  Once you grow yourself and shrink Sunnydale, stay out of sight.  Meanwhile I'll be manipulating events so that the Slayer accidentally kills as many people as possible.  Stepping on them, sitting on them... heh, maybe I can get her to eat a few.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Once Sunnydale's a ghost town, I'll make sure she knows what she's done.  Then, I'll give you the word, and you can shrink her and do with her what you want.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrink ray floated from the ground back into Mark's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now get to work, champ.</i></span></div></div>",

Please keep the following in mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--This should function as an offbeat, standalone episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Don't do anything that wouldn't appear on a network television show. That means keep it PG-13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--It takes place sometime during the first three seasons of the show (the high school years), but it begins vague as to precisely when. Feel free to establish a specific time; just be consistent with all preceding chapters. (Ex. If Jenny Calendar has appeared, you can't use Faith.) You can even have it occur off-screen in the middle of an existing episode. The choice is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Please don't mess with the TV show's continuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Feel free to invent any new characters and let your imagination run wild. Have fun.</td>",
