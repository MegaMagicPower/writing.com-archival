Standing at 5'9'' she has lanky but fitting features that sometimes she loves, sometimes she hates. She has shoulder length brown hair that is a slightly lighter brown at the tips. She is a person to pick up a stranger when they are feeling down or left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c3/cd/fd/c3cdfdd1faf99d0276b35e9352b2ec1b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a><br>\r\nIs a hilarious human being to some, crazy to others. Standing at 5'5'' has short platinum blonde hair but that changes all the time. She really knows why her and others do their actions.

Standing at 5'6.5'' she has naturally wavy black hair. Sometimes her quiet nature comes off as her disliking new people. She has a dry, sarcastic humor to people that she feels comfortable around.

Is a very hyper fifteen year old but not in an annoying way. She loves making new friends but usually chases after the wrong people. She is popular because of her hyper and relatable nature. With her inside circle she is very empathetic and a good listener if someone needs to cry or has a problem. She is tall being 5'8.5'' with short dyed black hair but usually looks long because she wears extensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is a complicated person having two contrasting sides so it really matters what day or what mood she is in when talking to someone. Her most prominent characteristic is her leadership skills being the one to call charge in a battle or stand up for what she believes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine - Is a poetic kind soul, who can be perfectly described as ones grandma, in personality that is. Standing at 5'9'' she has lanky but fitting features that sometimes she loves, sometimes she hates. She has shoulder length brown hair that is a slightly lighter brown at the tips. She is a person to pick up a stranger when they are feeling down or left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa - Is a hilarious human being to some, crazy to others. Standing at 5'5'' has short platinum blonde hair but that changes all the time. She really knows why her and others do their actions. Before she becomes someone's friend she will probably know what they will be like to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy - A sweetheart that will help her friends in need. Standing at 4'10'' because she has Turners syndrome. She used to be insecure about it but now embraces it as an unique quality about herself. She has long black hair about the same length as Christina's being chest length. She loves everything USA and country. She loves to talk to people and will talk to anyone if they need it even if they don't say a word back. She has lost friends in the past making her extra caring to her friends when they are here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren - Likes to observe more than speaking. Standing at 5'6.5'' she has naturally wavy black hair. Sometimes her quiet nature comes off as her disliking new people. She has a dry, sarcastic humor to people that she feels comfortable around. Unlike the extroverted Amy and Katherine approaching people is difficult for her leaving her in her comfortable and chill introvert shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle - Goes by Dani. Is a very hyper fifteen year old but not in an annoying way. She loves making new friends but usually chases after the wrong people. She is popular because of her hyper and relatable nature. With her inside circle she is very empathetic and a good listener if someone needs to cry or has a problem. She is tall being 5'8.5'' with short dyed black hair but usually looks long because she wears extensions.</td>",
