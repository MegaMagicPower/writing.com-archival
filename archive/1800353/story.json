Personality-wise he's actually pretty timid and jumpy, preferring to be alone because his semblance, Berserker Rage sends him into a trance-like state of pure fury, amplifying both his physical strength and durability, but it also takes away his ability to tell friend from foe.

It weighs about six pounds, average for an axe of that size, and in crossbow form it fires dust bolts.<br>\r\nIt's his first year at Beacon Academy. He's attending in order to try and learn to control his unbridled fury and become more confident.

Now onto the chapter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Shit shit shit shit shit!!!!\" Bjorn screamed as he flew through the sky. He had just been flung off the side of a cliff into the Emerald Forest. The boy tried to orient himself for a safe landing but ended up crashing into the ground and tumbled a few yards before finally coming to a stop. \"Ow... Well this is just perfect...\" Bjorn said as he stood up and brushed himself off. He looked around and began walking.<br>\r\n     A few minutes later and Bjorn stumbled onto two grimm, an ursa and a beowulf. \"Okay, Bjorn, you've got this...\" He whispered to himself as he drew his axe from his back. The young man rushed out from the bushes and buried the axe blade into the ursa's back. The beast roared and alerted the beowulf who rushed Bjorn. He dodged just in time but a swipe from the ursa's paw hit him in the side of the head.<br>\r\n     \"Grah!\" Bjorn yelled. He could feel his semblance activating as his veins and eyes began to glow a bright blue. Bjorn threw an uppercut and hit the ursa in the jaw. The beowulf lunged but Bjorn grabbed the grimm by the arm and slung it over his shoulder at the ursa. The man rushed the ursa and began throwing punch after punch before the beowulf managed to bite Bjorn on the shoulder, sinking its teeth into his flesh. Bjorn punched the monster again and again in the chest as its grip began to weaken. It finally let go and Bjorn shoved the beowulf into a tree and delivered blow after blow to its head, killing it.<br>\r\n     He then turned his attention to the ursa which was charging at him. The ursa managed to clock Bjorn in the head with a paw swipe but the boy ripped the axe out of the beast's back before furiously hacking into its flesh until it no longer moved and began to disintegrate. Bjorn then unleashed a primal roar of victory before he heard something behind him.<br>\r\n     \"Holy shit, dude! That was awesome!\" Yelled a boisterous female voice. Bjorn spun around and saw a girl with long golden blond hair, lilac eyes, yellow gauntlets on her wrists and an admittedly generous chest. He didn't care though. All he could see was an opponent. Bjorn yelled again and rushed the girl. She dodged his first attack which ended up with his axe stuck in a tree. \"What the hell?! What's your problem?!\" The girl shouted as her eyes turned red and her hair almost seemed to engulf in flames. She readied a punch but Bjorn saw this and threw a punch of his own. Their fists collided with a loud crash before the two began trading blows.<br>\r\n     A few moments of fighting and the girl's fist slammed directly into Bjorn's chest, denting his chestplate and knocking the wind out of him. She then grabbed him by the arm and slung him over her shoulder sending him crashing into the dirt. Bjorn's veins and eyes went back to normal as he gasped for breath. \"What the hell is wrong with you?!\" The girl yelled. Bjorn shakily stood up.<br>\r\n     \"I... I'm so sorry... A-are you okay..?\" The young man asked nervously. The blonde's eyes returned to their original pure color and the flames in her hair went out as she stared at Bjorn dumbfounded.<br>\r\n     \"'Am I okay?' You tried to kill me!\" The girl exclaimed, causing the boy to flinch back.<br>\r\n     \"I'm sorry... T-that's my semblance... It makes it so I can't tell friend from foe and anything t-that moves is a target... I'm s-sorry...\" Bjorn said, avoiding eye contact with the girl. She then started... Laughing?<br>\r\n     \"Oh, man. That was one of the best fights I've had in a while! I understand what you mean. My semblance is pretty similar. My name's Yang Xiao Long by the way!\" She said. Bjorn looked up at her and noticed just how pretty she was.<br>\r\n     \"Uh- I'm Bjorn Gray... It's nice to m-meet you.\" He replied, retrieving his axe. He had gravity dust infused into the axe handle and his gauntlets so he could call it to him.<br>\r\n     \"Sorry about beating the shit out of you. How about we walk together?\" Yang suggested, trying to gently smack the dirt out of Bjorn's slightly curly silver hair (He had the kind of hair that always refused to lay down straight no matter how much you ran a comb through it). Bjorn couldn't help but blush at Yang's proposal.<br>\r\n     \"Um, sure.\" He replied, taking off his chestplate to try and correct the dent Yang had put in it. She then took the armor from him and punched the dent from the inside, knocking it out well enough. \"T-thanks...\" Bjorn said, putting it back on.<br>\r\n     The two walked for a while before coming onto a ruined fort. On pedestals stood chess pieces. \"These must be the relics Ozpin was talking about!\" Yang said cheerfully. \"Looks like we weren't the first ones here.\" Yang  as she noticed several pieces were missing. She walked over and picked up a white knight piece. \"How about a little pony?\" She giggled. Bjorn couldn't help but smile and picked up the piece's mate.<br>\r\n     Suddenly the two heard a scream as a younger looking girl fell from the sky. \"Heads up!\" She yelled before another person collided with her mid-air and the two slammed into a tree.<br>\r\n     \"What was that?\" Bjorn asked.<br>\r\n     \"I...\" Yang hesitated before a gigantic ursa emerged from the forest and collapsed, revealing yet another girl on its back. She hopped off and inspected the beast.<br>\r\n     \"Aw man... I broke him.\" She pouted, lightly kicking at it. Another young man emerged behind and hopped over the beast's leg, panting.<br>\r\n     \"Nora... Don't ever do that again.\" He huffed, not noticing that she wasn't on the ursa anymore. She was looking at a white rook piece and took it happily and began singing. \"NORA!\" The man yelled.<br>\r\n     \"Coming, Ren!\" Nora giggled.<br>\r\n     \"Did... Did she just ride in on an ursa?\" Bjorn asked.<br>\r\n     Then yet ANOTHER person ran out of the woods being followed closely behind by a giant deathstalker. Then the younger looking girl leapt out of the tree landing close to Bjorn and Yang. \"Ruby?!\" Yang yelled.<br>\r\n     \"Yang!\" Ruby cheered, embracing Yang in a big hug.<br>\r\n     \"What is going on?!\" Bjorn yelled before wouldn't you fucking know it, ANOTHER girl fell from the sky from the talon of a gigantic nevermore<br>\r\n     \"How could you leave me?!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n     \"I said jump!\" Ruby yelled back. The girl began falling and the man that collided with Ruby leapt from the tree to catch her. He caught her but ended up crashing with her on top of his back.<br>\r\n     The girl being chased by the deathstalker jumped over to the quickly growing group.<br>\r\n     \"Well, the gang's all here!\" Ruby giggled. The two gigantic grimm began to chase the group to a ruined fort in a cliffside. Ruby, the white haired girl, Bjorn and Yang fought the nevermore while the other group took on the death stalker.<br>\r\n     A long battle later and both grimm had been defeated, Ruby having decapitated the nevermore with her scythe. \"That's your little sister?\" Bjorn asked Yang who simply nodded.<br>\r\n     An hour later and all applicants for Beacon had made it back into the auditorium for initiation. Ozpin called four people at a time, assigning then together as teams.<br>\r\n     \"Ruby Rose. Weiss Schnee. Bjorn Gray. Yang Xiao Long.\" Ozpin called out. \"For the next three years you four will now be known as 'Team RWBY'. Congratulations.\" Ozpin smiled.<br>\r\n     Team RWBY were led to their dorm for the night and the four were left to get settled in...</span></div></div>",

With the new moon being just as fast as Semblance of Speed, and a full moon  being at your strongest, no matter the time of day. As a result, this makes Lupa a very dangerous adversary, capable of moving at speeds that are considered....inhuman, fast enough to dodge a bullet at point-blank range and more)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapons: Crimson Blade. Described as a large straight single-edge sword with a 4-foot blade, your weapon of choice was given such a name due to the color of it's blade. After all, you're a fan of big-ass swords. However, one of it's unique features was a function you like to call \"Reaver Mode\", which comes in the form of a lever attached to the blade's two-handed hilt. Once you pull on that lever, Crimson Blade makes this loud revving noise, as the blade begins to glow a intensely hot orange hue, making each attack more deadly from the searing heat. But like all Hunter weapons, your Crimson Blade also has an alternate form, which comes in the form of a powerful 8-foot long compound bow, capable of launching 2 foot long armor-piercing arrows. Like in it's normal form, Crimson Blade's Bow Form also has access to Reaver Mode, heating up the steel arrows to an intense temperature, becoming  a set of explosive thermal arrows upon firing and exploding upon impact with your target of choice, covering the enemy in hot metal shrapnel. (Though when you become Lupa, the Crimson Blade transforms into it's third and more violent form, The Bloody Fangs. In appearance, the Bloody Fangs is a specialized weapon known as a dagger tail whip, which  is basically a chain weapon with small sharp blades on both sides of the chain weapon. Unlike the Crimson Blade, the Bloody Fangs has more melee range, capable of unleashing multiple devastating  slashes in circular sweeping motions, both keeping enemies at bay and slicing into them as well. In other words, Lupa doesn't just use her claws as weapons)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Born into a family where half of it's members are Faunus, you were able to understand the Faunus and respected them as equals. However, your family had a powerful curse in it's lineage, which came in the form of transforming into Wolf Faunus for those who were human. But unlike your family members, your lycanthropic affliction was....different. In layman's terms, your Wolf Faunus had a will of it's own. That Wolf Faunus form of yours calls itself \"Lupa\", an alluring yet unpredictable and somewhat psychotic female Wolf Faunus who has inhuman speed, agility, and reflexes, more than the average Faunus Hunter/Huntress. Unlike you, Lupa is known to have a sadistic streak during battle, taking joy out of cutting down her enemies, obviously a side effect from having two wills inside one body. Unfortunately, due to Lupa's unpredictable nature, you're unsure of when you'll have another one of your Lupa episodes when she comes out to \"play\" as she likes to put it. Fortunately, you can always that when you start hearing her voice inside your head, you know she's coming out to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or at least, that's what you remember about it, as you walked off of the aircraft transport alongside numerous others who have been sent here for knowledge, glory, and many other reasons, carrying nothing but the stuff you've decided to take with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you took your first steps upon Beacon Academy's campus grounds, you suddenly heard what sounded like a small fiery explosion not far from you, where you then felt  what appeared to be a small vial of red Dust tap against the tip of your red sneakers. Getting slightly curious, you picked up the vial of Dust from the ground to examine it, noticing a white snowflake emblem printed onto it. You recognized the emblem as the Schnee Family Crest, the owners of the Schnee Dust Company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you abruptly heard the sound of the young woman in white, whom you deduced to be none other than Weiss Schnee, yell at a girl with black hair and wearing a black and red dress saying, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Unbelievable! This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about!\"</span> But out of nowhere, you heard the distinctive voice of your other half, the alluring yet psychotic Wolf Faunus known as Lupa, echo it's way through your subconscious, speaking out her opinion from her mentally disturbing perspective and said, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"*sigh* Weiss freaking Schnee. Nothing like hearing the rants from that spoiled bitch to make me start slaughtering. *Angry growl* Can't you just make her shut the fuck up already?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you would do your best to ignore the voice of Lupa inside your head. But for once, you had to agree with your other half, just as you heard the girl speak to Weiss, while she pressing her index fingers together timidly, and replied, <span class=\"clred\">\"I'm really, really sorry!\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"*scoffs* You complete dolt!--\" </span>Weiss exclaimed, just as you then approached the arguing two girls, obviously having enough of Weiss and her spoiled brat-like behavior, as you spoke toward the white-haired heiress and growled, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Weiss, knock it off! She said she was sorry.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"You?! What are you even doing here?\"</span>Weiss frustratingly asked, taken aback by you appearing here, attending the same Academy as her. However, the girl could see that you and Weiss somehow know each other, where you then crossed your arms and sternly answered, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"I should be asking you the same thing, Schnee. What makes you think that you, a spoiled heiress whose family owns one of the largest Dust companies with the most controversial labor force and questionable business partners, can handle the job of killing monsters?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom seeing how you outwitted Weiss, the girl couldn't help but giggle a little, just as Weiss attempted to fire back a remark of her own, only to fail as she growled, yanking the small vial of Dust out of your hand, storming off toward the Beacon Academy complex with a temper. However, as she saw Weiss walk away in an angry fit, the girl spoke to the still fuming heiress and said, <span class=\"clred\">\"I promise I'll make this up to you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"*sigh* Guess I'm not the only one having a rough first day.\" </span>She depressingly muttered, obvious a little down about making a mess of things with someone. Trying to get her mind off the subject, she then turned around and focused on you as she asked, <span class=\"clred\">\"So, what's your name?\"</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">\"....Name's Jace. You?\"</span> You answered, obviously in an attempt to make the girl feel better in making a friend.

Fortunately, you weren't hearing Lupa's voice inside your head....at least for now anyway. However, you then heard Ruby's voice next to you, obviously an attempt to strike up a conversation and to get to know you better, where she asked, <span class=\"clred\">\"So, uh....what's with you and that girl? It sounds like you two know each other.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"You mean Weiss? *sigh* Yeah, she and I do have some history. And from what you saw, it didn't exactly end on good terms, Ruby.\" </span>You answered, figuring it wouldn't hurt to enlighten Ruby some involving the history between you and Weiss Schnee. Though in response, you fired back with a question of your own toward Ruby and said, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"So, um....I don't want to sound like an ass or anything, but aren't you....you know, a little too young to be attending Beacon Academy?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming aware of your question, Ruby quickly turned her body around to face you, quickly shaking her open hands from side to side in disagreement as she replied, <span class=\"clred\">\"No no, I'm not 15 or anything like that, Jace! It's just that.....You see, even though I might look like I'm 16 or even 17, but the truth is....well, I'm actually 18 years old. People think I'm actually younger than 18....other than my sister, of course.\"</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">\"It's alright, Ruby, I understand what you're saying. From what you're telling me, it sounds like your body took a longer time to fully develop, right?\"</span> You answered, taking account of how petite her physique was, just as she nodded yes in response to your theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously seeing that she was getting a little uncomfortable from talking about her appearance a little, you decided to change the subject for Ruby's sake. From there, you became aware of the red-colored weapon sheathed behind her black and red skirt, hidden underneath her red hooded cape. Becoming just all the more curious about what she was carrying, you turned your head to look at Ruby and said, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Say, what you carrying there exactly?\"</span> <span class=\"clred\">\"Oh? You mean this?\" </span>She asked, as Ruby pulled out the red metal, causing it to rapidly transform itself into a large mechanical-looking black and red scythe with a silver-colored curved blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after you were taken a bit by surprise from Ruby's weapon, you recognized it as one of those new transforming weapons, where the only words you could mutter out were, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Damn. Now that's a big-ass scythe!\"</span> <span class=\"clred\">\"You like it? It isn't just a scythe, it's also a customizable, high-impact sniper rifle.\"</span> She answered, her mood obviously much more happy than moments ago. You couldn't help but become impressed by her massive weapon, as you displayed a smirk on your face and said, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"So, you've basically combined a scythe and a sniper rifle into one transforming weapon? *Chuckle* Well, color me impressed, Ruby!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Thanks! So, uh...What do you got, Jace?\" </span>Ruby asked, showing some of her curiosity a little, noticing your blade somewhat. Noticing her near-childish curiosity, you've decided to reveal your own weapon of choice, just as you grabbed the blade's hilt and unsheathed your sword, where you then moved your jade green eyes to look at Ruby and answered, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Ruby; Meet Crimson Blade. You can say that I'm a fan of giant swords.\"</span> <span class=\"clred\">\"Wow. Is this sword made of blood steel?\" </span>She questioned, becoming even more curious about your weapon, just as you noticed that glittering look in Ruby's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"....Wait a minute, Ruby: You're one of those weapon aficionados, aren't you?\"</span> You asked, becoming aware of the girl's love of weapons, catching Ruby off-guard and red-handed. Now knowing that you're aware of her slight obsession with weapons, Ruby slung her large scythe over her right shoulder, leaning it in an angle, holding onto her weapon with both hands while she faced you and confessed, <span class=\"clred\">\"Okay, I'll admit it! I'm a really really big fan of weapons. I mean, come on Jace! Weapons are an extension of ourselves, they're a part of us!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously seeing her love of weapons as one of her favorite things, you put a hand on Ruby's left shoulder out of reassurance and replied, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Look, I'm not mad at you or anything like that, Ruby. I mean, even I can't help but admire a weapon or two, whether it's the overall design or the damage it can dish out on an enemy. \"</span> <span class=\"clred\">\"...Thanks.\" </span>Ruby answered, her mood returning to normal. However, since she seemed so curious about your weapon of choice, you spoke toward Ruby and said, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Though, if you're still wondering about what Crimson Blade's made out of: She's made out of Coltan.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you began to walk down the stone walkway, sword still leaning on your shoulder, Ruby looked like she was in shock and awe from what you said. From there, she then looked at you and asked, <span class=\"clred\">\"Jace....D-Did you just say your sword's made of C-Coltan?\" </span>To answer Ruby's question, you stopped and turned around to face her, noticing the shock on her face, as you spoke to Ruby and said, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"...Yeah, that's what I said. Why?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Jace, Coltan is one of the rarest types of metal to even get a hold of! It's highly heat-resistant from what I've heard.\" </span>Ruby answered, obviously fully aware of Coltan's physical properties. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"That's exactly why I made Crimson Blade out of Coltan, Ruby. Watch.\" </span>You answered, as you lifted the blade off your shoulder, made the blade's tip touch the ground, and grabbed the lever on the hilt with your fingers. From there, you pulled on the lever, causing Crimson Blade to made this revving sound, as Ruby witnessed the sword's 4-foot long blade to start emanating this intense heat on the blade's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Now do you see why she's made of Coltan, Ruby?\" </span>You asked, just as you let go of the lever, causing the blade to cool down from the display of scorching heat. In response, Ruby simply nodded her head, a bit speechless from what she beared witness to. After all, she never exactly seen a weapon do something like that before until today. </span></div></div>",

Though there were of course her teammates waiting in the wings in case she needed help. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cBlake can do this no problem.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou have heard about the recent increase of Beowolves here right?\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cOh chill Weiss, she\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</span> Like a shinobi, Blake kept moving through the forest with ease. After a while she sensed something and stopped in the middle of the forest, looking around. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cThat\u2019s strange\u2026what\u2019s this presence I\u2019m sensing?\u201d </span>Before she could try to figure things out, multiple Grimm surrounded her, most of which being Beowolves. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cGuess that will have to wait for now.\u201d </span>She prepares her weapon, the Gambol Shroud, to fight. An Ursa charges in trying to kill her with brute force, but with her skills, killing it was easy. Though the Beowolves were doing something that was unheard of, they were actually working together, though Blake kept fighting, using her Semblance and skills in tandem, using the Gambol Shrouds Kusari-Gama setting, she was able to keep them at bay, but as she fought the presence she felt continued to grow stronger. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSomething\u2019s up. Blake seems a little distracted.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell she better snap out of it soon, otherwise she\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d</span> Blake continued to fight, but the wolves fighting as a pack wasn\u2019t something she was used to, and it seems it was wearing her down. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGuys, something\u2019s moving towards Blake, and it\u2019s moving fast.\u201d</span> At this time, an Ursa knocked her into a tree and she was surrounded by Grimm. She was prepared to fight but then something came in moving fast enough it was only a blur and the Ursa was cut in half. The girls as well as the Grimm turned to see what had done it, and they saw a warrior with clawed gauntlets and intense eyes. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhoa, who is that?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhoever he is, glad he\u2019s on our side.\u201d</span> Blake looked at the warrior as the Wolves turned their attention to him. A piece of the gauntlet was sent into the air and it extended into a sword, catching it in his right hand. The wolves all attacked at once, and during this attack, he seemed to be one with the flow of battle, not one movement wasted. A pair of them stayed in close, using their claws to try slicing him apart. But with a combination of the clawed gauntlets and sword, he was able to block and parry the attacks. When the opening presented itself, he sliced both of them in half. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhoa. He\u2019s good.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYeah, but who is he?\u201d</span> As more wolves move in, the warrior was finding this annoying, and moved away from the wolves a touch, And opened up his left hand, firing wolf heads in a blast, destroying a few of them. With the last one charging in, he opens up his hand again and the gem in the center glows, the wolf stopping in it\u2019s tracks, and for some reason left the area altogether. The girls were confused by this and the sword collapsed and he placed it back in the gauntlet. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cWho, are you?\u201d</span> He warrior turns to Blake, looking her in the eyes. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI am Koragg, the Knight Wolf.\u201d</span> Blake approached him. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cListen, you may have made this test a bit difficult with your presence. But you did save my life. I\u2019d like you to come back to Beacon Academy, and talk with Professor Ozpin.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cVery well.\u201d</span> The warrior leaves with Blake and meets her teammates, walking with her to Beacon Academy. Yang whispering to the others <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI think she likes him.\u201d </span>They carry on a conversation while whispering, but neither he nor Blake cared. Things at Beacon were about to get interesting.  </span></div></div>",

Needless to say it was an impressive sight, worthy of the reputation it has. Before you could wonder where the headmaster was, he and his assistant seemed to be waiting for you to arrive already <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cWelcome back girls. I see you brought back the Huntsman we heard was in the forest.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cListen, Professor, about her test-\u201d</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cNo need to worry. Ms. Belladonna has proved her skills. She passed her test. For now, you all return to your dorms. As for you,\u201d </span>he said turning his attention towards you <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cPlease, come with me.\u201d </span>He and his assistant walked away, and you followed. Blake was more curious about you than anything else, and the girls could tell as they returned to their dorms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what was, admittedly, a nice walk, you were sitting in a room with Professor Ozpin alone. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cSo, why were you out there in the Emerald Forest? Surely you could have applied here with your skills.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI used that forest to get stronger, to sharpen my skills as a Huntsman, and as a survivor.\u201d </span><span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHow long were you there?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOne month, I did bare witness to the test you had formed the teams on, and I was impressed by what I saw. One team eliminating a Deathstalker, the other decapitating a giant Nevermore.\u201d </span><span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYou saw Teams RWBY and JNPR fight? Interesting, how did you survive in the forest?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThe forest had normal beasts I could hunt to survive. Besides, it wasn\u2019t an issue for me.\u201d </span><span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cSo tell me, so why intervene in Ms. Belladonna\u2019s test?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI sensed the concentration of Beowolves, I didn\u2019t know what was going on, but when I saw what was going on, instinct took over.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cTell me, did you sense she was a Faunus, like you?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo you can tell huh? Yes, I could. But that\u2019s not why I jumped in. I protect all that I can.\u201d </span><span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cI see.\u201d</span> He looks at your face closely. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cThose scars as well as the look in your eyes tell a story of betrayal.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re right. But as for that story, I would rather not share that.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cFair enough. Now as for where you will stay, most dorms are filled up, all but one wit a pair of beds. It\u2019s next door to Team RWBY\u2019s dorm.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI see. Thank you.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cMy assistant will show you the way. As of now, you are a Huntsman in training at Beacon Academy. Welcome, Mr\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKoragg. My name is Koragg.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYour last name?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI have none, that I know of. You can address me, as Knight Wolf, is you wish.\u201d </span><span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cVery well. Glynda, please show him to his room.\u201d</span> She approaches you. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cRight away Professor. Come with me, Mr. Knight Wolf.\u201d</span> you stood up and followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Team RWBY, they started talking about you and the skills you displayed. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI wonder where that guy learned to fight. He wasn\u2019t back at Signal, was he with any of you?\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo, but he has skill, even I\u2019m curious what he\u2019s capable of.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNot to mention he looked pretty good too.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYang are you seriously going to try and flirt with him?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d</span> Blake was sitting silently and just thought to herself. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cHey Blake, you okay?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHe\u2019s on your mind too huh?\u201d </span><span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cYeah, he is.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cWell, I think he may be a Faunus, like me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cSeriously? He didn\u2019t seem to have any Faunus features, maybe the eyes but still.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cNo, he has ears like I do, but he\u2019s able to hide them in his hair.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t need something like a hat to hide it.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cExactly, but what has me curious are those scars. They don\u2019t seem to be made by a weapon, nor a Grimm, being he still has his eye intact.\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYeah, I was wondering about that too.\u201d </span>They heard something in the hallway and decided to silently check it out. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cHere you are Mr. Knight Wolf. Please, enjoy your time in Beacon Academy. You will receive a class schedule tomorrow, along with a uniform.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you Ms. Goodwitch.\u201d</span> As she walks away you walk into your dorm, closing the door. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cHe\u2019s right next door to us?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWe should welcome him to Beacon, he\u2019s easily earned his place.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cGreat idea Weiss!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cYou guys, he may not exactly be the party guy. At least let me talk to him first. Before we try that kind of thing, we should learn about him first.\u201d </span><span class=\"cred\">\u201cGood point. Alright Blake, he\u2019s in your hands now.\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cJust try to keep those hands to yourself.\u201d</span> Yang\u2019s comment got a slight blush on her face, which is something they haven\u2019t seen before. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou\u2019re blushing?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cQu-Quiet.\u201d </span>One thing is for sure, Blake was curious to know more about you.</span></div></div>",

A side benefits his body natural repairing seems to be increased permanently since he unlocked his semblance. Shutting off his body limitations grant him that powerful increases, but it also is a curse because his body still has the limitations and he suffers all the damage when he returns to normal, he been lucky so far as his body copes naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapon: Hunting broomstick, A lever action shotgun and long sword.

Normal people tend not to mind and stay away from the guy that crazy and want to pick a fight with grims with a smile on his face. Faunus they dislike mostly because your are a human most time, other time it because you smell like a freashly killed grim to often. The few that talk to him and could stand the smell where taken back by the complete and utter lack of fear or hate. More so Azure on more then one occasion cross path with members of the growing violence white fang attacking him to only beat them, help them return to a semi friendly camp, and ask if they want to try agin fighting him latter after they all ate. Why he was not poisoned or stabbed in the back was anyone guess. After one to many altercation with a town protector or just the police in general, he had a choice become a legal Hunter or life in jail.

Dire edge utilizes aura technology which allows aura to be channeled through a weapon. <br>\r\nSlicer was hired by the Atlas military to scout out Vale an determine if the rise of Dust theft is tied to White Fang activity. Slicer had spent some time in Atlas along with his Master Cleaver and his other student Aura. Slicer was chosen for the mission to Vale by Ironwood himself due to Cleaver's recommendations. While in Atlas Slicer would also encounter Winter Schnee who would ask Slicer to look after her little sister in Vale if things got too dangerous.<br>\r\nSo Slicer was dispatched to Vale his mission, Scout out Vale for information and clues about the Dust thefts.

You're the one who said we shouldn't bring weapons, Weiss!\" Ruby was on its head, holding on with an iron grip as the Grimm shook its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have been a distraction for the picnic you insisted we have. In Grimm infested woods!\" Weiss tried to jump out, only to be caught by the leg. The Grimm began to shake her like a dog with a chew toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had my scythe, the only distraction would have been how cool I looked chopping this snake into pieces!\" Ruby was flung into the air, falling back down until she eventually caught Weiss's hand, still dangling upsidedown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had your scythe, you'd be to busy polishing it to pay attention to me!\" Weiss, using her free hand, managed to snatch a stick from a tree she was hit against. She started whacking the snout of the Grimm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean? I pay plenty of attention to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last week, you said you were sick and needed to study when I wanted to go to the movies, only to find you with that scythe you love so much deep up your-\" She was interrupted as the snake abruptly threw the two away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we have this conversation later? Like, when we're not trying to die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But just know that it is your fault.\" Weiss stumbled to a standing position, tuckered out and beaten up.<br>\r\nShe helped Ruby up before turning to start running away. Unfortunatly for the couple, the python Grimm hand other plans, slithering at full speed around them, cutting off their escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHissing and opening its jaw, the snake was about to strike before a faint sound of tapping against wood and rhythmic humming drew attention away from its injured prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to the source of the noise, Weiss saw a blonde girl in white tapping a whiter cane with red tip against trees and grassy floor. It soon clicked in her mind that this girl was blind, and in the sights of the Grimm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run, please!\" Weiss shouted, \"There's Grimm here! Get out before you get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the girl continued to walk and tap her cane as she turned her face towards Weiss, curiously tilting her head. She opened her mouth, shaped in a shy smile, and began to speak.<br>\r\nBut before a single word could escape her mouth, the python shot its head towards her, jaws open and fangs readied.<br>\r\nThe blind girl turned her head towards the whizzing head of the Grimm, looking almost clueless as to what was happening. But right as its mouth was about to close around her, she jumped out of the way, causing the Grimm to bash its head into the forest floor.<br>\r\nSticking her landing with grace, the girl started running towards the shaken head, unsheathing a sliver bladed saber from her cane and sliced almost fully through the upper neck, leaving the head dangling from a chunk of red flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising itself, head flopping on its sliver of neck, the snake tried once more to strike down the blind girl, only to get its lower jaw sliced in half and the rest of its neck cut off by the girls whizzing sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own jaw agape, Weiss stood there in shock and amazement of the unexpected skill of the blind girl. Ruby, however, pouted, looking at Weiss's reaction, still leaning on her from her injuries. The girl tapped her cane towards them, feeling the ground for any disturbances.<br>\r\nBefore Weiss or Ruby could say anything, the girl placed her warm hand onto Weiss collarbone, moving it to Ruby's next, sensing their injuries. \"You two, you're hurt. Here, let me help.\"<br>\r\nBefore either could respond, a warm, golden light washed over them, causing their bruises and scrapes to fade away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was amazed - while Ruby was still pouty that Weiss so amazed - and ready to tell the stranger how thankful she was when the girl...</span></div></div>",

Give me a hand.\"<br>\r\n\"No, no. Really, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n\"No, you need help.

But after we drop her off, I'm making more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the right arm over her shoulder, Ruby helped Weiss carry the inkured blind girl out of the forest, lucky to have seen no Grimm along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the girl woke up to the sound of heels clackering along a hard floor. Clicking her teeth, the girl sound 'see' she was maybe in a nurse's office laying in a bed. But her ear's were ringing slightly, so the image was blurry.<br>\r\nThe clacking of heels became louder and louder, until...<br>\r\n\"Hi. Are you doing alright?\" It was Weiss, cleaned up from after the encounter. \"I realized that you wouldn't be able to see these after I bought them... Wait, that was rude, I...\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I love flowers.\" The blind girl said.<br>\r\n\"How did you know I had flowers?\"<br>\r\n\"I can smell them from here. They're wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the head of the bed, Weiss put the vase onto the bed-side counter. \"I just wanted to come by and thank you. For saving us.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It's what any huntress in training would do.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'retraining to become a huntress?\" Weiss sat herself on the edge of the bed. \"Are you training at Beacon?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just transfered over from Atlas. The weather wasn't to my liking.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, I came from Atlas too. My sister's actually a graduate from there.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? That's very interesting. It's good to know somebody from my home.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two chatted for seemingly an hour, talking about everything from what part of Atlas they grew up in to talking about their current studies.<br>\r\nThe time flew by for the two, before a ringing could be heard from Weiss's purse. \"Excuses me just for a moment.\" Weiss picked up her scroll and walked out.<br>\r\nFrom outside the door, the blind girl could hear pieces of her side of the conversation. \"Yes, uh huh. Okay, okay! Okay, yeah. Gotta go now, Ruby, I'll see you in a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my friend.\" Weiss walked back into the room. \"She was wanting to do a movie night, and you just can't win with her.\"<br>\r\n\"Your friend? The one in the forest? You called her Ruby, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ruby Rose.\"<br>\r\n\"Is she a good friend?\"<br>\r\n\"One of the best I've got. Sure she can be childish, and annoying, and clingly and persistant, but yiu just have to love her for that.\"<br>\r\n\"Is she... Is she anything more?\"<br>\r\nWeiss stared at her blankly. What was she asking? Did she mean...<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. It's nothing like that. Ruby and I are just good friends.\"<br>\r\nThe blind girl blushed, \"I'm sorry. That was silly of me to ask. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it.\" Weiss was about to say her goodbyes, when she remembered something. \"Hey, before I leave, I just realuzed I never got your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Angel.

Crafted by Cleaver using his peoples's aura powered technology. Utilizing a channeling device built into the hilt which channels the users aura into the weapon. Surrounding the aura channeller inside the hilt is is the dust ring, dust crystals of varying types are placed into the ring. The ring is rotated until the desired dust crystal is positioned under the aura channeler, the dust crystal is then locked into place by pressing or slamming in the locking mechanism. Afterwards the aura channeler channels the user's aura and energizes the dust crystal which then focuses the energy down the \"spine\" which hangs from the hilt and disburses the energy, while an energy field contains the disbursed energy and forms it into a \"blade\".           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Dust Crystal: Makes the \"blade\" red and super heats the air around the edge, allowing Cleaver to slice through mostly anything. When used with Cleaver's semblance a condensed heat wave is formed when the sword is swung burning anything in the arc of the swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellow Dust Crystal: Makes the \"blade\" yellow and generates a electrical current which causes a electric surge on impact. When used with Cleaver's semblance creates a arc of lighting which extends out from the \"blade\" and electrocutes anything within the arc of the swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown Dust Crystal: Makes the \"blade\" brown and crates a stone edge which increases the impact of the swing. When used with Cleaver's semblance the whole \"blade\" is converted into a stone slab which also extends outwards past the tip of the \"blade\" and increases the  range of the swing and increases the impact of the swing drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Dust Crystal: Makes the \"blade\" white and generates an edge of compressed air increasing  the cutting edge of the \"blade\", but not as effective as the red blade when cutting through tougher alloys. When used with Cleaver's semblance the compressed air extends outwards slicing through anything within the arc of the swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurple/Black Dust Crystal: Generates a black and purple \"blade\" which creates a event horizon akin to that of a Black hole around the \"blade's\" edge. Anything that comes into contact or within range of the \"blade's\" edge is pulled towards it ,distorted as time and space is warped and is ripped apart  at the molecular level upon impact (also creates gravity waves which obliterates anything it comes into contact with). When used with Cleaver's semblance a massive gravity wave is generated when the sword is swung which distorts and rips everything apart at the molecular level with in the arc of the swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Born in a village of Mercenaries deep in the woods. Cleaver's people had spread to all four of the kingdoms and were hired by either their governments or militaries, but one Kingdom would hire them more than any and this was Atlas. Cleaver had been to Atlas many times, during those times he became aware of woman with white hair and cloths, he would later learn that her name was Winter Schnee. During his time in Atlas, Cleaver had spent some of the Atlesian military bases and on some occasions had greeted Winter as they passed by each other or just had a breif chat , he would not see Winter for some time, until he received is most challenging job yet. As Cleaver was training a young deviant female named Aura he was called to Atlas for a job, he decided to bring Aura with him to show here what was outside of the village. Upon reaching Atlas Cleaver was given a job in which he was to go to Vale and find out why there is a increase of crime related to dust, but mainly to find out what the White fang are up to and if they related to the increase in Dust theft. Cleaver was to become a teacher at Beacon Academy and find out as much as possible about what is happening in Vale, Aura as Cleaver's student was to enrol as a student to find information from the students. Before leaving Winter would ask Cleaver to watch out for her younger sister Weise if things got really bad in Vale, and so Cleaver and Aura left for Vale not knowing what they would find.</span></div></div>",

It is open from abdomen down and is raggedy at the bottom.<br>\r\nMorte also wears black leather boots, gloves and pants.<br>\r\nArmor is also worn as well, worn over the the gloves are clawed gauntlets which wrap around the wrist and fingers ending in a point at each of the finger tips.The boots have armor pieces which are attached over the shins and are attached via three straps which are wrapped around the calf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemblance: Auramancy aka Necromancy(another term for Auramancy since the abilities which come from Auramancy are easily adaptable to the art of Necromancy).<br>\r\nAllows Morte to either siphon off another persons aura to strengthen his and to rejuvenate himself. In other words he can either use his semblance to weaken a opponents aura and it's defensive abilities or to aid in accelerating the healing of his wounds. The dark side of Morte's semblance is to imbue a corps with a portion of his aura as to reanimate it, the corps will have no actual ability to think and will react directly to Morte's thoughts through his \"aura link\". He can also regenerate organic tissue that is dead and severed, allowing Morte to create Flesh Golems as well as allowing him to implant these rejuvenated parts into a living person/organism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapon: Life takers/Harvesters, Two sickle like swords which can leach aura upon each hit and transfer it to Morte via channeling of Morte's aura through each sickle. Only used in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory:<br>\r\nMorte was once a member of the first few humans that were born into the world from Dust. Before Dust had been utilized as a weapon to defend humanity from the Grim threat, many humans sought a way to heal injured and critically injured people who had been injured during Grim attacks. Some even sought away to revive a person soon after they had died as to reduce the need to send the younger men into battle. The technique required was finally developed by humans with a unique Semblance, the techniques was called Aura transference or Aura rejuvenation, a process which would revitalize the body before their essence had fully departed to the after life. Unfortunately this process ended up causing less than positive outcomes, many of the \"revived\" came back with broken minds and were highly aggressive and almost animalistic. Some thought they could weaponize these \"Ferals\" as weapons against the Grim. The \"Ferals\" on the other hand were too hard to control and would cause many deaths if the ever escaped their prisons, so the art of Aura transference on corpses was deemed cruel and inhuman and was banned across many human settlements.<br>\r\nEven after the ban on Aura transference now referred to as Auramancy and even Necromancy by those who despised the art. Even with this disdain for the art of Auramancy many humans in this pre hunter/huntress and Dust powered weapons era, continued to feared death either from Grim or even natural death, so they improved on the art of Auramancy and even began secretly siphoning the auras of criminals and outcasts. These people who feared death were the same people with this rare Semblance, over time they were discovered and a massive purge was carried out across the settlements and all the people with rare Semblance were wiped out except one.<br>\r\nMorte was the one who survive the massive purge of all practitioners of the art of Necromancy and thus the loss of all the knowledge pertaining to Auramancy.<br>\r\nNow Morte wanders the world remnant feeding off of peoples auras in towns and villages in secluded areas. Over time he forgot his true name and just referred to himself as Morte, over the centuries legends of the Black robe or even the Reaper spread around the rural towns telling of a \"man\" in a Black robe appearing and disappearing every few centuries and then reappearing across Remnant. In truth Morte would go into a death like sleep when feeding became to difficult or people were becoming to aware of his existence. Now he has woken up into a world of chaos, the perfect world in which to move around freely and and feed.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morte had woken up three months ago and been wandering through out Remnant, eventually he had wandered into some unknown city, he continued to walk maybe for hours until he came upon a woman in red in an ally way speaking to young woman with green hair. He heard things like \"you didn't take it he gave it to you\", all the while the young green haired woman was trying to denied she had even taken anything, this was odd as it seemed that someone had given her something but she was acting like she had not taken anything, as if she had stolen something rather than being given it. Then it occurred to him, stealing something without even having to, have the victim give it to you...only a semblance could do that. Then that explains why the woman in red was so intent on recruiting her, recruiting her for what though?  Morte decided to figure find out, he was bored anyway.<br>\r\nMorte stood there watching them until the Green haired woman noticed him and upon seeing him her eyes widened with fear, this reaction caught the woman in the red dress's attention and she turned around to face Morte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: What do you want? This is none of your businus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: You are correct Miss, It would seem my curiosity has gotten the better of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: Curiosity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: Yes, I can not explain it but you fascinate me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red:...........well leave this nothing to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: You are correct, but I must know, what is it you want with this woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte looks at the green haired woman and sees a desperate person  trying to survive in the slums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: You stole something did you not young one? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte looks at the young woman with green hair as he says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: I have seen many people like you being forced to survive while other thrive. What strikes me as strange is that no Police are after you and this other woman does not seem to be the one you stole from. So could it be....your semblance?....Which as allowed you to steal with no consequence? Is that why you are here speaking to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte looks at the woman in red as he asks this question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: so what if it is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: that would be a very useful semblance, one that makes a person see what is not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: Yes it would, so are going to go away? Or am I going to have to make you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: I assure you that I am in no way a threat to your plans, in fact  I am quite intrigued about it. Why would you need some one with an Illusion semblance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: Your good to have guessed this here  thief's semblance with out knowing what had even happened or even how I discovered what she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: You flatter me, I have lived along time and have seen many with this particular semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: You have have you? You only sound about my age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: Have ever heard of Necromancy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: What about it? All I can guess is that it means something like control over the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: Something like that, It was originally known as Auramancy or control over aura. Now that may sound starnge as all semblances are masteries of each individuals aura in some way. Auramancy on the other hand is just not just some sort of art but requires a specific semblance a semblance which allows you to not only control you own aura but the aura of every living thing with a strong enough aura, such as imbuing a corps with your own aura to lets say revive it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: Say What? Bringing people back from the dead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: Not only that but also siphoning off other peoples aura as well to lets say increase your own life span. You did say that I only sounded as old as you even though I said I had been around for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: yes I did but some people do sound younger than they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: Yes that is true, how about a demonstration then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte notices a man walking by the ally and quickly rushes him and grabs him pulling him in. As the man squirms against Morte's grip, Morte raised his right hand over the mans face while firmly griping the man's waist with his left arm. Morte's aura began to manifest as a black cloud which swirled around his right arm down ti his hand the black smoke began to cover the man's face seeping into his mouth eyes and ears, his body began to spasm as a glow began to ride up through the black smoke wrapped around Morte's arm and into his black aura creating a soft glow within it. over time the man's body stopped moving and drooped over the arm Morte was gripping the man's waist with, Morte let the man go and the body fell to the ground unmoving. Morte looks at the two women his red eyes glowing an unnatural red, what do you think?<br>\r\nBoth women looked at Morte with wide eyes, I am not done yet. Morte then motioned with has left hand and the now lifeless body began to twitch and slowly got up. Morte then signalled with his left and again to walk forward, the mans corpse began to lurch forward stiffly as if the muscles were getting used to walking again, the animated corpse began to slowly and surly continued to walk forward towards the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: Please step aside ladies I need him to get to the back of the ally, can't have him lying so close to the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women stepped aside as the walking corpse walked right up to the back of ally and stopped. Morte then clenched his left hand and the man's body collapsed  to the ground, afterwards a black cloud leaves the body and returns to Morte. Soon after the skin of body begins to to crack and crumble and rest of the man's remains crumble into dust. All that was left now was cloths filled with dust, well now to get rid of the cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: I thought you drained him how did he move?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: I left a bit of my aura in his body allowing be to control his now dead body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: Auramancy\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Woman in red said this in a whisper as if the realization of what happened was to unbelievable to say out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: Yes, Auramancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: so will you have me? I am sure my skills would come in handy, would they not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: I was given a mission by my master, she decides who can become apart of her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: Then let me prove my self, I am more curious than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: Fine, come along thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung green haired woman: My name is Emerald miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: Fine we are going Emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: I never got your name miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte looks at the woman in red as he says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: Yours first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: My name or at least the name I have chosen is Morte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman in red: I am Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorte: well then Cinder shall we go then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder, Emerald and Morte left the city to head for the next part of the plan, Morte was more excited than he had been in decades, he could not wait for what would come next.</span></div></div>",

Body appearance: Muscler though not massively so and has along scar running across his chest and is 6.3.                        Personality: Rather laid back but has no qeulms about killing fools who challenge him without power to back it up.                     Weapon: Ky\u016bketsuki or vampire is a deadly black blade that can leech aura from its target no matter how small the scratch and can release that aura though the Demon God blade (a attack that forcibly realeses all all built up aura in 1 attack) or in his Semblance it has 3 modes.    1st is a pair tanto knives <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tanto_Kunimitsu.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tan...</a> he uses them to quickly overwhelm  his opponents with quick repeated strikes, can also be transformed quickly allowing him to slip attacks to quickly hit vital spots.  2nd is Yumi bow <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yumi-p1000624.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yum...</a> use for picking off enemy\u2019s from range his bow packs a massive punch due to its near 300 hundred pound draw weight.  3rd is his favorite is the Odachi form <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samurai_wearing_a_nodachi_\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sam...</a>(field_sword).png due to its length (being about 6.0ft tall) he holds the sword when sheathed in his left hand as he is right handed his skill with it is almost unrealistic though the weapon is very large he can draw it quickly leading to a fair share of i diots being cut down from a simple draw of his blade.         Semblance: War Demon Cometh is what earned him the name \u201cBlack Demon\u201d while in this state his body is covered in a pure black aura so intense that he barely resembles a person while in this state he craves a worthy enemy and quickly encapsulates  or kills any he finds weak. Unfortunately  for his opponents he also be to take in aura absorbed by vampire increasing his speed and power even more  and will continue doing so until he leaves this mode however if he uses it for to long he may cause damage to his body and mind takes many days to fully recover       .    History- Not much is known about him other than some more basic history what is known is that he was born into a band of thieves and brigands where he learned basic sword combat along with survival skills along side his 2 younger brothers (5 years younger) and 2 Older Sisters ( 2 and 3 years older)and due to some unknown reason left at the age of 15 where eventually a year later he came across a skilled swordsmen who helped him hone his talent with the blade after 5 years of training he finished his training and created vampire upon finishing his training his master challenged him to a duel to gauge his power it\u2019s uknown why but he then killed his master in 1 attack with a quick draw slash. After this he returned to his village at the age of 21 finding that his youngest brother was now leader (assume the other brother and 2 sisters left at some point) at this point it\u2019d be right to assume he was looking for worthy opponents as such he challenged and killed his brother believing him to be too weak to lead then he left once again searching for 1 who could entertain him someone strong enough to challenge him.</span></div></div>",

Caster is a deviant form of the Fox Faunus species, which were considered in ancient times to be Mystical and even Magical due to their almost supernatural semblances. As a species Fox Faunus were not as numerous as the Cat Faunus which are the Warriors of the Deviant Faunus village. Caster's Ancestors acted as the Wise men and Mystics of the village, their powers were invaluable in the defense of the village from Grim attacks, casting barriers to protect the warriors and summoning constructs of stone to aid the warriors in battle. <br>\r\nCaster is of this linage, trained in the art of Aura manipulation that is still to this day still used by his clan, he proved very adept at utilizing his semblance and even invented new ways of utilizing his semblance to manipulate various types of matter and is considered a genius. When he became of age he became a mercenary, instead of hunting and sometimes eliminating targets he utilized his abilities especially his constructs as tools of espionage and information gathering. One day however General Ironwood of the Atlesian military would call for his services.<br>\r\nCaster's mission is to find out if the increasing theft of Dust from Dust shops in Vale are connected to the activities of the White Fang, and so Caster left for Vale not knowing what he would find.       <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

After a while he began walking around he wondered if he should rest or walk around a bit more to get to know the layout of the City. Suddenly  he heard some commotion coming from nearby. He decided to investigate and came upon a scene were a young woman withe a massive Scythe was fighting a group of what seemed to be robbers who had at one point been attempting to rob this Dust Shop. Caster also noticed a broken window and man in white with a cane watching the fight, he seemed to be observing the fight in a calm matter, once the fight had ended Caster could see the man in white approach the young woman say something and raise his cane like a gun, a bang went off and the area was engulfed in smoke. Caster could see the man in white escaping through the cloud of smoke, after the smoke had cleared the young woman looked at the shaken shop keeper and seemed to ask permission to go after the man in white and quickly proceeded to go after him. Caster decided to follow encase the young woman needed help. Caster began to float up into the air and accelerated forward to follow the young woman, as he was following the young woman he noticed a woman in white with blond hair also heading to the same rooftop as the young woman and the man in white were. The young woman attempted to engage the man in white but he jumped of the roof and reappeared shortly after to have landed in a Bullhead transport and immediately produced a red dust crystal fired at the Dust crystal causing an explosion only for other blond haired woman to leap in action and block the the young woman from the blast with some sort of glyph based barrier. Afterwards a fight broke out between the blond haired woman and the young woman along with the man in white in the Bullhead, as the battle progressed the man in white retreated into the ship only for a unknown woman to appear and retaliate by causing explosions under the pair's feet and blocking their attacks. The battle became that of explosions and various projectiles such as beams, falling shards of ice along with pelting the ship with a mass of debris, in the end the unknown woman generated a multitude of explosions allowing the ships escape as the duo had to get out of the of the explosions. Afterwards the blond woman began to speak to the young woman, at this point Caster decided it was a good idea to speak to the to women. Caster slowly floated towards the roof and then slowly descended and began to walk towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: May I have a word ladies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlond woman: And who are you? She said suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I am caster and you are?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlond woman: Just call me Glynda. She said in a defensive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: That was a extraordinary battle, you have allot of skill, as do you young lady. Caster stares at the young woman as he says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: You handled those men very well back at the shop.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYoung woman: Ummmm..thanks..wait what? How did you know about that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I am a observer, I watched your battle after I heard some commotion coming from the Dust shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung woman: You were WATCHING!?!?! Why didn't you help me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: You looked like you had things under control, even though the man in white did raise some concern due to his calm demeanor. I only followed because I foresaw some problems with him, you were lucky you did not fight one on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung woman: Why was I lucky to not fight him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: You would have lost, and would have gotten hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung woman: How would you know? If I had fought him and won maybe he would not have gotten away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I am a tactician, Perhaps you could have won but you did not loose by letting him getting away, because now you know how some of his tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda: Excuse me Caster..but we must be going, Ozpin will want some news on the situation and to question this young lady as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Ozpin you say? A man how knows much about the world, things which were known but now exist only in legend or have been totally forgotten. I would very much like to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda: Oh, and why would you like to meet Ozpin and why would I let you a suspicious stranger see the headmaster of Beacon Academy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I think we may have much to talk about, I to know thing which have been forgotten and on a note Ironwood sent me to Vale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda: Ironwood?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Yes, Ironwood sent me, I am a Mercenary of sorts sent here to find the connection between the theft of Dust from various Dust shops and the White fang's aggressive behavior and actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda: I see...Ozpin would very much like to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Well then lets go.</span></div></div>",

After a while Glynda and Ozpin walked into the room where Caster was waiting, it was now time for him to answer some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: I hear you wanted to so me Mr Caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Caster will be fine sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: As you wish, so what is it you wanted to ask me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I have Nothing to ask but to propose working together. I have knowledge if things not many people know about, things you know as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: In what way would we work together Caster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I was employed by Ironwood to see if the recent Dust thefts were connected with the White Fang's ongoing activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Ironwood sent you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Yes, as I just mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: how did you get here? I did not hear nor see any aircraft arriving in Vale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I got here via rift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Rift?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Yes a rift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Not many can do that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Why do you think I am called Caster? Matter and energy are my tools, aircraft make too much noise when your job is information gathering and you want be unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: So you observed Ruby's fight starting at the dust shop all the way to the rooftop? Why not help Ruby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Ruby handled herself well at the Dust shop, I followed her just in case she would need help but then Miss Glynda showed up and the battle when fairly well, much information was gathered along with many mysteries such as the Mystery woman who commands fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: how did get up the the roof? Ruby can move fairly quick, I see now weapon or device on you that would aid you in keeping pace with miss Ruby and being able to scale a building so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I levitated by generating an electro magnetic field which allowed me to counter Remnant's gravitational pull. I the propelled my self forward by using the same electro magnetic field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin:.........I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Is that so surprising?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: I suppose it is, you make it sound easy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: On the contrary it took me three decades to master most of the techniques I us, I even created some of them myself. Including the art of creating rifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: 30 years is along time, but you only look like you are in your twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: That would be due to the nature of my clan, they used something that might akin to magic even though it was nothing more than advanced usage of their aura and semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Like the Glyph semblance which is passed down only through the women of the Schnee family?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: In a way, except the men and women of my clan all inherit the particular versatile semblance, with each generation expanding on the skill set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: I see...where does your clan comefrom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: That is a secret, people don't we exist because we have been forgotten. As of now I have no time to explain my origins, I have a job to do I can do it by myself or we can pool our knowledge and work together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: How would you go about aiding me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I could be an agent who gathers information for you, I could also update you on human/Faunus relations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: How would you do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Become a staff member of Beacon Academy, I have many skills to teach such as meditation, focusing techniques and many other forms of knowledge for those students how have semblances that are less combat oriented, or are just having problems using them. As well as seeing how well Human and Faunus students get along. Which could reflect the state of society, something which no doubt concerns you as it could play into how the White Fang is recruiting young angry and fed up Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: It take a while to decide Caster, I have to worry about the new batch of students coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: How is the maiden doing Ozpin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: What did you say?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: You forget I collect information, my people are aware of the events which are unfolding, the darkness which is hidden but slowly seeping in. You need me Ozpin and I am just as worried as you are. Especially about the Faunus who will become the target of human aggression the more the White Fang carry out these highly destructive activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: I see, is this your personal reason for accepting the mission given to you from Ironwood??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Yes it is, as I had mentioned to Miss Glynda I am also a tactician. The White Fang will use the aggression against the Faunus fro the human population as justify their behavior and actions, a never ending cycle will be created Humans harm Faunus, White Fang recruite these young and abused Faunus and carry out their actions fully justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: I can see that logic would work and that it is highly probable that you are indeed correct. Seeing as this is a official mission from Ironwood and that Ironwood is privy to some of my knowledge. I shall let you work with me under the guise of a Beacon Academy staff member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: As you wish, I have no problems with this arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Good, Glynda has Ruby been released?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda: Yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Good, shall we head to Beacon now Caster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Lead on Ozpin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Ok then, come on Glynda we are heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynada: Yes sir.</span></div></div>",

Caster also noticed a broken window and man in white with a cane watching the fight, he seemed to be observing the fight in a calm matter, Caster got a bad feeling about him and began contemplating if he should aid her. He decided that the risk of the young woman engaging the man in white was too dire. Caster began to levitate and propelled himself forward towards the fight, when he was close enough Caster discharged a spray of lightning causing the remaining thugs to fall to the ground.  He then proceeded to lower himself to the ground next to the young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Do you require assistance? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung woman: Thanks, but who are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I will tell you later, as of now we have one last problem to get out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in white seemed annoyed and and began walking towards Caster and the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan in white: Great just what I need another  weirdo to get in my way, any ways I got to get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in white raises his cain like a gun and fires a blast, Caster raises his hand and shields himself and the young woman by creating a barrier. Caster then retaliates with a concussive blast of compressed air which causes the man in white to fly backwards into the wall of the dust shop. Caster then caused the ground to become a wave which then moved the man in white towards Caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Now what do we do with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung woman: How did you do that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: My semblance what else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung woman: Your semblance?

What happened to Fang?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Most missions my people were given had to do with tracking down people who were creating unrest, such as creating anti Faunus groups or the other way around. We were hired by a nations Government or military to covertly handle problems that the government did not want to or could not handle themselves, rarely however were we ever tasked with any sort hunt and kill missions. Fang on the other hand decided that she liked covertly taking lives, so she adopted the life of an Assassin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRuby: Oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: It is not a problem which has effected me badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster and Ruby proceeded to talk while waiting for the Police to arrive. all of a sudden a Bullhead aircraft roared towards caster and Ruby and then proceeded to hover above them until it landed in front of the pair.<br>\r\nA woman in a red dress with black hair exited the aircraft and began walking towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMysterious Woman: Now I know why Torchwick never made it to the meeting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: You must be his main accomplice then.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMysterious Woman: what of it? You are in the way and I have no time for chitchat I am taking him with me, but first I will take care of you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mysterious Woman immediately conjured an explosion underneath Caster and Ruby, Caster managed to create a barrier but Ruby had tried to get to safety but was hit by the explosion and knocked out. Caster then caused the the ground to become a rippling wave which knocked the Mysterious Woman to the ground, he then created a ball of concussive force formed from compressed air and threw it at her causing a blast of dust and rubble to fly in all directions. The Mysterious Woman managed to get up while holding a injured arm, Caster then attempted to fire off a concussive blast of compressed air but was caught off guard by a now conscious Torchwick who had fired a blast from his cane causing Caster to shield himself, during the commotion Torchwick had managed to get to the Mysterious Woman and helped her get aboard the Bullhead. At that moment the Vale police arrived along with a Blond haired woman and began firing at the aircraft, the Mysterious Woman managed to deflect their shots with her uninjured arm long enough to allow Torchwick to take off and fly away.<br>\r\nThe Blond haired woman approached Caster as he was picking up Ruby's unconscious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlond haired woman: What happened here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I heard some commotion coming from this Dust shop while I was walking around, this young lady was engaged in combat with a group of thugs, it would seem that a man named Torchwick was leading them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlond haired woman: Torchwick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: The woman who was in the aircraft with him called him Torchwick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlond haired woman: Who was the woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Never got her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlond haired woman: I see, I would like you and Ruby to come with me to the Police station for questioning, Ozpin will have questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Ozpin you say?

After a while Glynda and Ozpin walked into the room where Caster was waiting, it was now time for him to answer some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: I hear you wanted to so me Mr Caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Caster will be fine sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: As you wish, so what is it you wanted to ask me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I have Nothing to ask but to propose we work together. I have knowledge if things not many people know about, things you know as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: In what way would we work together Caster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I was employed by Ironwood to see if the recent Dust thefts were connected with the White Fang's ongoing activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Ironwood sent you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Yes, as I just mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: how did you get here? I did not hear nor see any aircraft arriving in Vale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I got here via rift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Rift you say..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Yes a rift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Not many can do that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Why do you think I am called Caster? Matter and energy are my tools, aircraft make too much noise when your job is information gathering and you want be unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: How would you go about aiding me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I could be an agent who gathers information for you, I could also update you on human/Faunus relations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: How would you do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Become a staff member at Beacon Academy, I have many skills to teach, such as meditation, focusing techniques and many other forms of knowledge, for those students who have semblances that are less combat oriented, or who are just having problems using them. As well as seeing how well Human and Faunus students get along. Which could reflect the state of society, something which no doubt concerns you as it could play into how the White Fang are recruiting young, angry and fed up Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: It will take a while to decide Caster, I have to worry about the new batch of students coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: How is the maiden doing Ozpin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: What did you say?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: My people know much about this world, things which have been forgotten and suppressed. Knowledge which is now considered myths and legends and about the unknown darkness which is now slowly creeping in mostly unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: I see, seeing as this is a official mission from Ironwood and that Ironwood is privy to some of my knowledge. I shall let you work with me under the guise of a Beacon Academy staff member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: As you wish, I have no problems with this arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Good, Glynda has Ruby been released?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda: Yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Good, shall we head to Beacon now Caster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: Lead on Ozpin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin: Ok then, come on Glynda we are heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynada: Yes sir.</span></div></div>",

He then walked around the Academy and getting his bearings along with meeting the other staff members such as Glynda Goodwitch the blond haired woman who came with the police during the Dustshop incident, Peter Port teacher of Grim studies class and Bartholomew Oobleck who teaches the History class.<br>\r\nGlynda was also assigned as Casters  sort of guide when it came to accessing  the more secretive information and of course all that was known about the coming threat including the comatose Maiden being stored deep underground. <br>\r\nFinally the day came, the arrival of the students. Caster was present standing to the left side of the stage, as Ozpin gave his opening speech. Caster noticed Ruby in the crowd, in the same row as her was a young woman with black hair and a black ribbon, it was then he noticed her yellow eyes, a trait of the Cat Faunus. After the speech was over all the students along with their luggage were moved to another room that would serve as a mass bedroom. Caster then followed Glynda and Ozpin back to Ozpin's office, once there Ozpin began planning out the test which would take place in the Emerald Forest. Caster was tasked with scouting out the forest for any extreme dangers, Caste would report that there was some Ursai present as well as a Nevermore, Death stalker, King Taijitu as well as some Beowolves. </span></div></div>",

Afterwards the students were launched one by one over the forest and had to rely on their landing strategies to reach the forest floor safely. Once all of the students disappeared under the tops of the trees Caster was given his task.<br>\r\nCaster was to follow the students  covertly while receiving live feed from the many cameras monitoring the students movements, and to only interfere  if the situation got out of hand. Caster than proceeded to levitate upwards and the float over the treetops and then once over the forest slowly began to descend towards the forest floor. Once Caster reached the ground he began to track down each student and at the same time keeping tabs on the surrounding grim. As Caster was scouting he came upon a young man engaging a King Taijitu, Caster watched carefully as the fight progressed. Eventually the young man defeated the King Taijitu, then out of nowhere a young woman withe bright red hair popped out of a nearby tree hanging by her legs, they both seemed to know each other and immediately started walking together. Caster decided to follow the pair for a while, after a few hours of following the pair they came upon a Ursa at the same time Caster heard a Nevermore fly over head, Caster also noticed that the cameras were focused on a blond haired boy and a young woman with red hair being chased by a Death stalker.  During this the young woman with bright red hair had some how mounted the Ursa along with her partner and began to ride it in a a seemingly random direction, Caster quickly followed them until  they rode out into a open feild were Caster could see Ruby and and a group of other students including the young black haired Faunus woman, the young man with blonde hair and the red haired woman engaging the Nevermore and the Death stalker which seems to have headed towards the same area as the Nevermore was. The pair that were riding the Ursa also joined in.<br>\r\nIt was here that Caster had a choice, aid them or see if they could handle the situation.</span></div></div>",

Caster quickly ran out of the trees towards the group. He also noticed the abandoned temple in the background, Caster realized that they must have been attacked while getting their pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I am here to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby: Caster what are you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I was ordered by Ozpin to keep an eye on the students, now it is time to deal with these grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Caster first targets the Death stalker, he holds out his right arm and holds it with his left hand to steady it, four rings with glyphs appear along Caster's right arm with the last glyph ring appearing in front of his hand the rings begin to spin faster and faster until a ball of energy is formed in front of his hand. Caster then fires the the ball of energy in a massive beam which pierces the Death stalkers head and creating a massive hole. The Death stalker falls defeated, Caster tries to stand up but falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby: Caster what is wrong?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster: I was careless I was careless I did not prepare properly to use that technique, that attack took too much out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby: Don't worry we will handle the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and the group spotted the Nevermore flying towards some ruins and gave chase, as they entered the ruins the the Nevermore caused a portion of the ruins to collapse separating the young blonde haired man, the red haired woman, the bright red haired woman and her partner from the the other people who were with Ruby. Caster managed to stand and quickly ran towards the ruins, he found Ruby and her group engaged with the Nevermore. Caster was impressed with their team work, and was even more impressed with Ruby defeating the Nevermore. Afterwards Ruby and the rest of the students students chose the remaining chess pieces, it was here that Caster found out the order of events the Blond haired woman and the black haired Faununs woman who's  names were Yang and Blake had arrived first and had got their pieces, the bright red haired woman who was called Nora and her partner named Lei Ren had arrived a few minutes after riding the Ursa that Caster had seen them mount and ride off on and which caster followed to this very spot. After Nora and Ren chose their pieces, Ruby and Wiess arrived by jumping off the Nevermore, the same Nevermore Caster had seen fly over head when he saw Nora and Ren mount the Ursa. Soon after Ruby and Wiess arrived the young man with blond hair named John and the red haired woman named Pyrrah arrived while being chased by the Death stalker. The events which happened after all of these events is what Caster had come to encounter.<br>\r\nRuby, John, Pyrrah and Wiess  finally got to choose their pieces and soon after all the pieces had been taken, now they were all ready to head back to Beacon.</span></div></div>",

Here are the additional rules. And to all hardcore fans of this franchise, I am doing this for fun, I like the show too, so please don't get all uppity here please. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The girls are AT LEAST 18 years old in this story ok? as such, sex, foot fetish, and others are allowed, but NO incest, butt stuff, feces, any of that nasty stuff, keep it mild if u do a scene where they make love or something ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-after thinking this through, I am goingt o allow Shrinking, but some conditions here. 1: the smallest you can get is to the size of the foot of one of the ladies. 2: No vore. I will allow a kiss, some playful licking, etc. but no being eaten, killed, etc. and I encourage using this to comedy, or having a time where you are in the protection of the chosen woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Since they have a game in this world that has similar elements of Duel Monsters (Yu-Gi-Oh!) to them, I will add that game to the world as well. you don't HAVE to use it, just a little something extra if you want<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to create a weapon that is also a gun, like 2 sword combining or something, Bows/Arrows are also acceptable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-IF you do a team, try to make the first letter of your characters name fit in with the rule that teams sound like a color. But you don't have to do teams, in fact you can make your characters strong enough to be a one man team, but they still need help from the love interest and/or the love interests team. One last thing, if you want to have your person join a certain pre-established team, you don't have to add your letter to it. you can if you want, like say team RWBYS but whatever. just want to make it easier for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-ABSOLUTELY no one line chapters. I cannot stress this enough. and if you add, please try to add to the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Have some fun with it. </td>",
