She is now wearing a white shirt with red sleeves and blue jeans, some simple clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had plans to meet her friends at their favorite shop. She walks over to the door and was just about to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there is a loud noise behind her. Quickly turning around, she sees nothing. She starts looking around the room to find the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes of looking and she doesn't find a thing. She is at her door again and again as she was about to open it she hears it again, though this time much louder and clearer, it was coming from her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cautiously walks over to her closet. Looking down, she sees a bluish white light coming from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out her hand, she can't help it, like something is pulling her towards the closet, telling her to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting one hand on each handle, she finally swings open the closet and the bluish white light floods the room, using one hand to cover her eyes, she watches as her entire room fills with the light, as does her vision as she looses consciousness....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining consciousness, she wakes up on the floor. Getting up, she tries to figure out what happened. Suddenly, something catches her eye, she runs over to her window and stares outside wide eyed. She hurries over to her door and pauses. She couldn't believe what she had seen, was she dreaming, seeing things, there was only one way to find out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts her hand on the knob and opens the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps out into the light. Her eyes finally readjust as she just stands there, she is stunned by what she sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is in some kind of clearing with trees all around her, maybe some kind of forest, and her room, where she came out of was sitting in the middle of the clearing, it looked like it was ripped off the rest of the house and put down in the middle of the clearing.</span></div></div>",

She did not want this, though she could not deny how great this felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not all that they had in mind though, as another fell on her back and moved to her butt where it then turned itself around and latched itself onto her.

Panicking. \"I know I put them right here!\". Looking all over the clearing, she sees something not to far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the edge of the clearing was a bra, one of hers. Carefully walking up to it, she examines every single spot by and around the bra. She doesn't see anyone, anything, or more of her missing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These didn't get here by themselves..... Did someone steal my stuff while I was asleep?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the lone bra, she looks it over, nothing seemed wrong with it. She puts it on, and tries to think of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to walk away, but a sudden pulling prevents her from going to far. Looking down at the bra, 2 solid green tube like things had appeared. \"What the hell? Where did these come from?\". Grabbing them, she attempts to remove them. But they wont budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are attached to the bra themselves. Realizing this, she tries to remove the bra itself, but there was no longer a hook in the back, and whatever this bra was, it was too strong for her to just rip it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can only watch as the bra turns green like the green tubes. This is immediately followed by her feeling dozens of small circular shapes rubbing against her skin, stimulating her beyond words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!....Wh.....gah.....whats happening?\". She is suddenly forced to take a few steps towards the forest as the bra begins to pull. She struggles with all her might, as each tug sends a bigger and bigger wave of pleasure throughout her enitire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after being dragged for a few minutes, she is face to face with the culprit. A 10 foot tree was right in front of her. It was really wide with a lot of branches and leaves. The green tubes that were connected to the bra was coming from it's trunk. But the odd thing about the tree was what was in the branches. Glowing yellow orbs of various sizes with a green stem on the top of each and every orb. But this was not the strangest thing about them. In each orb, was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting these new sensations, she begins her struggle with renewed energy, knowing what could happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use. After pulling her close enough, it stopped. Her hands reach up to her head, feeling something had landed there. It was another green vine, but this one was had latched onto her head and wasn't budging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree starts to lift her up into the air and the bra detaches and is absorbed by the tree. Having lifted her up to the same height as the trapped girls, she feels a new sensation hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this tingling sensation echoes throughout her, a strange, glowing yellow goop starts to ooze from the bottom of the stem and begins to coat her. It drips down her head and eventually covers her mouth, she finds that somehow, she is still able to breathe. The goo slowly spreads over her entire body, completely covering her as it drips onto the forest floor. It starts to expand and change shape until it was a perfect sphere, with her at it's center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding her self able to move, she bangs on the wall of her prison, in vain, trying to escape. After a while, she sits down, giving up on getting out of there. Looking at the other trapped girls, she begins to think. \"I wonder whats going to happen to us. Are we just food? Something like fruit maybe? But why are they smaller than me?\". Something...odd....catches her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBubbles, bubbles had somehow appeared, she watched as they head to the top of the fruit and are sucked into the vine. This makes her notice something else, the yellow goo was getting smaller. She watched as the entire sphere shrank a bit, then stopped. It hits her, the vine is reabsorbing the goo. \"Ok, that explains why these spheres are smaller, but why are those girls smaller too? Unless....oh no\". Looking at herself, she had shrunk a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the orb had stopped again, leaving herself at 6 inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, is this as small as she gets? Or will she shrink more? Or possible be completely absorbed or something else by the tree.....</span></div></div>",

Well then I'll start\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it all started hundreds of years ago, when us nagas and you humans were at war with each other\". \"War, really?\". \"Yes, our ancestors use to hunt and eat you humans\". \"Uhh, I see,\" Karen says with a worried look on her face. \"But that was a long time ago, you see, we realized that it was too much effort to hunt you kind, though how you taste is amazing, when we could just go into the forest and find things that were bigger and easier to hunt. And over time, we formed a sort of alliance with the humans, agreeing not to attack each other anymore\". \"Well, at least it ended well,\" Karen said with a slight smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I am not done yet\". \"Oh, sorry, please continue\". \"Alright, about a hundred years after we stopped hunting your kind, one of your magic users created a certain potion. Yes that,.....immortality potion?, you know, the one that prevents us from dying or experiencing any serious pain. Well, when he created that potion, we started eating humans again\". Surprised from this, Karen jumps back a bit. With a smile on her face, she starts talking again. \"Heh, I expected that reaction, you see it started slow, only a few in the various naga villages started this again, they would eat a human, each experiencing an unimaginable pleasure, then the human would be restored at an important place, thanks to the potion, so eventually, all nagas started eating humans again, since neither of us has to worry about death. And this is where rogues come in, you see, us naga never eat people without there consent, we consider that wrong, but these rogue naga, they ignore this, they hate humans for whatever reason and do not abide by the rules that we have of eating your kind,\" she says finishing up her long story. \"Well, at least all that is in the past now, and your not a rogue naga, so there is nothing to worry about,\" Karen says as they smile at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way, my name is Karen,\" Karen says, extending her right hand, pausing for a moment, she grabs it and says, \"Karen huh, well, my name is Lilsti\".

With a loud scream, she ducks behind Lilsti, as her previous experience with them runs through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...From your scream, I guess you've seen these things before,\" Lilsti says, \"...y-yes, I hate these Latch worms\". \"You know what there called?\" \"You mean there actually called that?

They may be slow on the ground, but they can fling themselves by their threads and are faster in the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, now were surrounded,\" Lilsti says. Karen picks up a large stick and gets ready to defend herself. Lilsti pulls her tail in, away from the worms and Karen moves right next to her, ready for them to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the Latch worms start to close in, using this chance, Lilsti takes off. With the speed and agility of a naga, she quickly makes her way around the forest, taking out worm after worm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren wasn't doing so bad herself, with her large stick, she was taking out a lot of worms too. Completely fixed on what was going on around her, she did not notice what was going on with Lilsti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had taken out most of the worms, but was overconfident, to her these were easy prey, a lot slower than her and nowhere near as agile. She was paying too much attention on what was going on in front of her that she did not see the few behind her attatch themselves to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling them latch on, she looked behind her and saw 3 worms on her, she lifts her tail to swat them off, but was too late, they sank their teeth into her, sending their poison into her system. Starting to feel the effects, she starts to sway and falls out of the tree that she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing the stick straight down, she finishes another worm off. Looking around, she does not see any worms in sight, for now anyway. Then With a loud crash, Lilsti falls and lands right in front of her. \"LILSTI!\" Karen says as she runs up to her, noticing the worms on her, she quickly swats them off with her stick. She takes a quick look around and does not see anymore worms. \"Are you alright?\" Karen asks, \"did they bite you? can you move?\" \"Y-yeah, a little anyway, I see you know about their poison,\" \"yah I was bit a little while ago\" \"I see, well you don't have anything to worry about, their poison does not work as well against us and we recover from it pretty quickly\". \"That's good,\" Karen says as she waits with Lilsti for the posion to wear off.</span></div></div>",

As Karen gets up, Lilsti looks at her and says, \"thanks again for helping me, I guess I got a little too overconfident\", \"don't mention it, you would have helped me too\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation is interrupted, as a latch worm lands on Lilsti's shoulder, the worm shows it's teeth and gets ready to bite her. Thinking quickly, Karen grabs the worm. She throws it against the ground and stomps on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief, Lilsti says, \"that was close, thanks\". \"Again, don't mention it, lets get out of here before more appear\", \"alright, just give me a second\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilsti starts to collect some of the worms threads and ties them together, she then proceeds to pick out the dead worms that are in the best condition and ties them to the thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Lilsti?\" Karen asks. Still picking up dead worms, she responds, \"well, we did kill a lot of them, and I did forget to pick some apples, I figured that I would take some back\", \"....you mean you actually eat these!?\" Karen says shocked. \"Yes, we can eat them without the poison bothering us too much and we do know how to remove the poison, and besides, they taste pretty good\". \"I-I see, well, I could carry a few I guess\", \"alright, just give me a few minutes to string some up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes go by as she prepares a couple of worms on strings.

Makes sense I guess, you said that there were only humans on your world, and you humans like to keep yourselves covered up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hand the worms over to some nagas in a hut and they immediately start preparing them.

Karen now staring down Lilsti's open mouth, as saliva is already gathering, anticipating her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly puts Karen's head into her mouth and closes. She slowly starts to push her in more as her body instinctively starts to pull her down her throat and to her first stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of Karen that is already inside is covered in her saliva as she feels her shoulders slip into Lilsti<br>\r\ns mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, what Lilsti had said was truy, her entire body was feeling an incredible sensation as the walls of her throat push and pull against her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilsti has now reached her breasts. They weren't that big, so she had no problem gulping them down as well, though she did play with them with her long tongue before swallowing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeren's head finally pops out of her throat and enters Lilsti's stomach, as the pleasurable feeling continues to spread as more and more of her body enters Lilsti's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just passed her belly button, the only thing left of Karen outside are her hips and whats below them. She does pause a moment though, and stretches her long tongue out and plays with her pussy. She starts back up again and her mouth easily moves pass her ass and starts working on Karen's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more of her enters the naga's stomach as Lilsti continuously pulls her down her throat. the only thing left now are her feet sticking out of Lilsti's mouth. Lilsti lifts her head and with one push with her hand, has her feet slid into her mouth and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, \"you were delicious, I told you it would be incredible,\" she says, rubbing her enlarged belly. Karen agrees with her as she stays curled up in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilsti starts to talk, \"I could just digest you now, or I could take you into my stomach, where you will feel a lot more pleasure than you just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren tells her to make it last. She suddenly feels her hand sink into a hole at the bottom of her stomach. She tries to pull on it, but the force is too strong as it completely sucks in both of her arms. It grabs her head, and pulls her entire body into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feels something pulling on her again, she is now in Lilsti's tail, and a stange substance is coating her as she is pulled in deeper and deeper. What she is experiencing now far surpasses anything that she has ever felt before. She does not regret at all letting Lilsti eat her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pulling finally stops. On the outside, Lilsti goes over to her lump in her tail and starts to stroke it. \"All that's left now is for me to digest you and you to come back. I'm going to sleep now. See you in the morning,\" she says as she stretches and lays down and falls asleep to digest her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the inside, Karen notices something, her entire body is a lot softer than it should be. Then it hits her, this liquid, it's dissolving her! She is being digested. Now this far exceeds anything I have ever felt! Karen thinks as she is melting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms and legs dissolve completely, leaving a layer of herself liquified on the ground. She waits as she herself starts to shrink into the liquid, making it bigger. She climaxes multiple times before finally her head completely dissolves.</span></div></div>",

Though they are like rogues, as most dont get consent before capturing them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, but let's see if you can keep dodging me,\" says the bee girl. \"It can talk?\" Karen says surprised, \"of course, they are like you humans and I did say that they were smart\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A naga huh, well I probably can't deal with her on my own, so I'll target the human girl,\" the bee girl thinks as it charges at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren raises her sword as the bee girl gets closer to her. Though fortunately for her, the bee girl is stopped in  mid air. \"Too bad, but your too slow!\" Lilsti says as her tail coils around her. \"Looks like I found myself a little snack\", she says as she shoves the bee girl down her mouth and into her stomach. \"Not bad,\" she says as she pats her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren stares at her, but before she can say anything. Loud buzzing fills the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are now surrounded by bee girls.</span></div></div>",

Making her way down a hallway, she enters a door labeled, NURSERY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside are young bee girls, they look to be 5-10 years old. \"Sister Iris!\" one of them yells as they run over to her. \"Hey there girls. Wow, some of you have gotten pretty big! Sorry I have not been around lately, but I've been pretty busy\". She spends the next hour playing with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks outside, \"oh, it's this late? Sorry girls, but I have to leave soon\". They get upset and beg her to stay. \"Hey, I have important work to do, but I will be back. But before then, It's time for lunch\", Iris says as she goes over to a large single honeycomb in the middle of the room. \"Are you feeding us today?\" one of them asks. \"Yes, I caught this girl yesterday\", she says as she pats her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her abdomen over the honeycomb, she starts to push. After a few grunts, the pure amber colored honey starts to pour out of her and into the honeycomb. The last bit drips out and falls. She kneels down and catches her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back up, she turns around and bends over the pool of honey. Dipping a finger into Karen, she casually puts it into her mouth. Putting one hand on her face, and with a pleasurable look, \"wow, that is the best honey that I have ever tasted. She is such high quality\". She grabs a jar and fills it up. She closes it and sets it aside. \"Ok girls, time for lunch!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young bee girls grab bowls and dip them into the honey, filling them up. Iris and the girls spend the next 30 minutes cleaning out the honeycomb, not leaving a single drop left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris gets up and grabs the jar. \"Time for me to go, I have a few things to do. I will be back soon!\". She leaves and the girls say good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enters the queen's chamber. \"Ah, Iris, perfect timing. I have been informed of your plan. I am impressed, we will use them for a while before releasing them. This will be perfect for making our hive bigger\". Iris thanks her. \"That jar you have. Is that the girl you caught?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my queen. This is all that is currently left of her. I was planning to take her somewhere after this meeting\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. So tell me, how does she taste?\". Iris gets an idea, she motions for one of her guards and tells her something. She immediately returns with a small hand sized bowl. Iris then proceeds to pour some of the Karen into the cup and hands it to the queen. \"The honey is amazing. Some of the best that I have ever tasted\". The queen samples the girl, then quickly swallows the rest. With a pleasurable tone, \"I see what you mean. This is quite a taste, such a high quality human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may leave now Iris. The morning meeting is now over\". \"Yes. Goodbye my queen\", she says as she leaves.</span></div></div>",

We only just got here ourselves and haven't finished exploring the surrounding area and setting up, again, I apologize\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren starts to think. She goes up to Iris, \"it's fine, it's not like I'm in a rush or anything. And there is something I would like to ask you, since we won't be leaving for a few days.....I wouldn't mind helping you with your plan........</span></div></div>",

Karen, chosen one, we need your help to stop the one that threatens us all\", the king starts.

We would like to attack tomorrow\", he points out a window at a large dark tower in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did I miss that!? But I guess that's fine, I want to find a way home as soon as possible\". \"Excellent, bring it in\". A soldier brings in something wrapped in cloth. He kneels to Karen and hands it to her. She takes it and unwraps it, it was another sword. \"It is written that only the chosen one can wield it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unsheathes it, and it starts to glow, they all kneel, even her friends and the king. \"You truly are our savior!

Oh!\", she says, as a strange humming fills the air. \"The orb! It's ready!\". A pedestal emerges from the floor with a purple glowing orb on it.

Lilsti groans hard as she feels herself spread by such a large thing as Karen, acting like a human dildo as she presses harder to break the pressure of her lips.

She finally feels herself penetrated by Karen's shoulders, thrashing some as she groans again, Lilsti's internal muscles taking a hold of her body. Slowly they start to pull her in as well. Lilsti herself was hissing furiously in pleasure as well as groaning as she felt the breasts of Karen cross the threshold her lips. IT was a certainly nice addition and she was going mad with pleasure as she felt more of the human dildo pulled in. Then Karen started thrashing some in her, to cause her more pleasure. In return Lilsti started thrashing before finally giving a small scream as she stopped pushing for a moment. She instead clasped hard around what amounts of Karen inside her as well as spewing lubricants all over Karen's lower torso.

They inched their way toward her, slowly and steadily, leaving slime trails behind them. She had several minutes to watch them slowly approach, but she had been through too much. Maybe the paralyzing venom was still in her. Maybe the eggs were keeping her numb. Or maybe the load of slime dumped down her throat was drugged, too. She didn't care any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one to reach her ran a slime trail over her ankle. It was at that moment she wished she hadn't fallen forward with her legs spread wide open. Another wrapped itself around her arm. One crawled up onto her back, and at that moment she felt something fat, soft and wet pushing into her pussy. Against her will, she moaned softly as it squirmed a little deeper inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt crawled in inch by inch, sending waves of pleasure through her body. It was another big worm, and at the moment she was slightly happy about that. It wiggled deeper and her body convulsed just a little. It explored her deeper, deeper and deeper. She barely noticed all the others crawling around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf the huge white Latch Worm had disappeared insider her, and her hips were slowly thrusting up and down. She didn't even know she was doing this, or moaning. Suddenly, she felt something move deep inside her. Then again... and again. After several seconds of confusion, she realized this Latch Worm was eating the eggs out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat took care of one of her problems, so she sighed happily and enjoyed the feeling. When she felt another soft, fat nub pushing against her, however, her eyes opened wide when she remembered she had eggs buried deep inside her ass, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother large white worm, thick, long and covered in slime, pushed against her asshole. She tensed up, weakly mumbling \"No... no, no, no...\" but the worm kept pushing and eventually her ass gave way, surrendering to the fat, gooey invader and spreading wide as it entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and begging \"Nooo!\" she felt her rear opening stretch around the bug, her own body ignoring her pleas. She tried to squeeze it out, but she was just too weak. Slowly, it began squirming and wiggling into her, inching toward its goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging her head in shame, she grunted and groaned at the unfortunately fat worm's victory against her ass. It crawled forward little by little, burrowing deeper insider her like a tight, hot tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worm eating a feast deep within her pussy still excited her, but now she had several inches of a worm almost as thick as her wrist forcing its way deep insider her ass. Her body tensed and convulsed in reaction to all the squirming inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longest, thickest worm yet was crawling right toward her, and she didn't even know. Her head was hanging down, her eyes shut tight, braced up on her elbows, still trying and failing to force a huge worm out of her ass. The giant new worm patiently inched its way right up in front of her, and still she had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her fighting it every inch of the way, the long thick Latch Worm had successfully crawled its way nearly a foot inside her ass, finding its prize. Stretching its own opening, the worm took the first egg inside its mouth and swallowed it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was more than she could take. Squeezed so tightly deep inside her ass, she could feel the bulging egg, almost matured, slowly slide all the way down the length of the worm from its head to its tail outside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her head back, her mouth opened wide in a gasp of shock at the sensation, and the biggest Latch Worm of all saw its opportunity. Her moan was cut short, plugged by the invading head of the giant new worm. Her eyes opened and she realized what had happened to her, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything, the worm in her ass swallowed another egg and she was helpless. The stimulation was all too much. Her body went limp, her arms and legs spread wide, and she let them take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant new worm didn't even notice. It simply pushed inside, slid over her tongue and crawled into her throat. Her neck bulged, her eyes rolled back and she moaned and moaned. The worm in her ass swallowed one more egg, and she felt her first giant orgasm hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body convulsed. Her throat was stuffed, her pussy was filled with a squirming worm and she had a foot long bug up her ass swallowing one egg after another. She squeezed and stroked the slime covered worms in her hands and let her body orgasm over and over.</span></div></div>",

She examined the package. It had no return address but was addressed to her. She tore the cover off to see a strange tome of sorts.

She could feel her belly bump into her thighs from time to time but did her best to ignore it. Trying to get a clear view of what was coming towards her, she still kept herself hidden within the elder tree. What she thought was right. It seemed to be a group but was surprised of what she saw come out of the bushes where the slime she met came out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A goblin?\" Elenora thought as she looked at the new creature before her. It was like any other goblin you could see in fairy tales and cartoons. It was short but green in skin color. Had pointy ears, nose with long nails on both its hands and feet. This one had a tunic with a skirt wearing a pointy hat on top of its head. Wielding a small sword on its left hand and a buckler with its right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the tome that was tied at her backpack. She gave it a mean glare as she looked back to see more goblins come out of the bushes. Each one having a different top on its head. The taller one had a pot, while the one behind him had a skull cap, the next one that popped out of the bushes had a small triangular hat. There were four in total as they were carrying similar weapons. Then the one with the pointy hat spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it went this way. I'm sure.\" It yelled as it looked left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It couldn't have gotton too far.\" said the goblin with  a pot on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares! Let's go back to camp.\" said the goblin with a triangular hat. It dropped its sword to massage its feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Yeah! We caught others so it will come back!\" said the goblin with the skull cap. Elenora could guess this was the one with the least intellect. So the four goblins went back into the bushes as Elenora made sure they gone. Crawling back to her backpack, she sat on the branch in a upright position with her feet dangling. Her hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see why you fled. You were looking for help huh?\" Elenora said to her belly as the slime pushed back her left hand in response. \"But what could I do? I only have a wooden sword. They have sharp knives and I'm sure they're not gonna give your family up so easily. But they seem dumb like in any cartoon or movie I've seen. I hope it also happens here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElenora made her way down the tree with her backpack and quietly followed the trail of the goblins. A 20 minute walk later, she could smell what was burnt wood as she hid in the bushes. Taking a peek, she saw a small army of goblins. At least 30 of them. Some were doing chores like fetching water and chopping wood. Others were practicing their sword fighting while most of them slacked off. Then a goblin standing a top a mountain of barrels rung a bell to get their attention. Startled Elen hid well but it was only to gather the attention of the goblins. They all looked up to see a goblin wearing a viking helmet with horns sticking out started its speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to the capture of the slime brethen that we will sell to Tusk! We will gain fame and fortune to our name! Let us celebrate!\" It yelled as they all hollered and yelled with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be their leader. Since they're partying, it will be the perfect opportunity to get the slime out!\" Elen thought as she patted her belly. Feeling the slime in her push back. \"But we'll have to wait till dark when their drunk.\" She smiled as she looked around to see where they hid the slime. At the far east, near the biggest tree in the camp was what seemed like to be a cage. She saw two guard goblins with spears wearing trojan helmets. But like the other goblins they were drinking keg as well. It was already sunset<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see how many are in there. I'll have to wait till night fall to know just how many they captured.\" Elenora thought as night started to fall. The goblins had started a big bonfire. Dancing, drinking, merry making for all its worth. Unknowingly noticing a white and dark blue figure moving around camp. There were no archers in the guard towers and Elen easily made her way to the prison grounds. She thought she was caught when one of the goblins turned around only to fall dead asleep on the ground. She sighed in relief as she continued her way to where she thought the slime were.</span></div></div>",

The one leaning on the wall had the key as she quietly snatched it. Slowly making her way to the door, she quietly opened the large steel door. Sliding in, she slowly closed it as she the prison was dimly lit but was even more surprised by what was inside. The slime she was looking for wasn't just a family... It was a clan by what she could see. Estimating at least 20, varying from size like one inside her to one's she thinks are children that are at least a half the size or 3/4th as the one in her.They were also in different colors besides flesh, there were light blue, orange and light green.

Movement seen in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down!\" She said as one of the adult ones. The similar to the one inside her approached her slowly. Placing its arm on its belly as the slime in her pushed out, it nodded as they rushed to her.Leaving what seemed to be the elder in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey easy now! I'm gonna get you guys out. Just need to figure out how.\" Elenora said as she quietly looked through the door to see them still partying but the goblins were in a drunken stupor. Most of them were asleep as she assumed it was already late at night. Just then she felt a nudge on her thigh as she looked to see the one that went near her pushing her. Pointing to its mouth as Elen pondered what it was saying as it came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! The one in me is heavy enough! How can I fit all of you!\" She said as the clan approached her. She starts to panic into figuring out a different plan but she notices the elder one not moving with the slime. Curious she walked towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be really old and can't move huh?\" She said as it nodded. Luckily it could understand her. As the slime move towards her, she began to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I fit all of them in me? I didn't see anything I could use outside and they move like slugs.\" She thought to herself. Well the one in her didn't digest and it didn't cause her indigestion either. It wasn't really that heavy, it was just she wasn't used to having something alive. She ponders what to do....</span></div></div>",

I just hope I can still walk after this.\" Elenora thought as they surrounded her. She first started with the small slime as they seemed easiest to swallow. They made up at least 3/4ths of the clan. One by one she slowly swallowed the small. Lifting them up, they seem to keep their humanoid form, no dripping just one body. Putting it in her mouth, the small smile effortlessly went into her throat and down into her stomach. With each small smile, Elen could feel her belly surge forward bit by bit underneath her kendo uniform. For some odd reason, she was enjoying this. It was both weird and new to her. As she finished her tenth, she paused for a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take a break...\" She said as she placed her left hand on her belly. Her right hand on the ground to help her balance as she looked at her belly to see it was like she ate a basketball. Her belly stretching her outfit out quite a bit as she rubbed it, feeling the slime move with in her. After catching her breath, she started again. She moved her sash below her belly so it could stretch as she continued swallowing the slime. It took a good hour as she finish all the small slime. Looking at her belly, her jaw dropped to see its current size. It now looked like she swallowed a medium sized medicine ball. It covered her legs quite a bit as it overlapped them at its sides a bit. It totally push her kendo jacket out as it sat on her lap. She now just had the 8 adult slime as well as the elder. As one of the adult slime approached her, she looked worriedly at it. Her back was starting to ache as did her thighs,hips and knees were starting to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a sec.\" She said to the adult slime that stood before her as she went to a crawling position. Her belly and knees as well as her elbows resting on the ground as she opened her mouth. The slime did as so with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they could go elsewhere in my body.. I feel like I could burst!\" Elenora thought as the slime slid down her throat..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Elenora swallowed the first adult slime, she was hoping that it wouldn't go into her belly. Her belly had gotten so big after taking in so many small slime. So she prepared for it to go into her belly but she felt it go elsewhere. Raising her left eyebrow, she'd tried to guess where it was going  as she felt it going from her throat but staying somewhat there. She was lucky that there wasn't a gag reflex but like the others she had swallowed there wasn't any. Then she felt it center in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. it couldn't...\" Elenora dreadfully thought but she got her wish for the slime not to go into her belly. Underneath her kendo jacket she wore a sports tank top. It was used to absorb sweat and stretchable. She could feel her breasts stretch to the slime filling it so. It was an arousing sensation as she couldn't move her arms since she trying to balance herself. Bigger and bigger they grew till eventually they stopped at DD cups. She looked down to see two softballs. She shook her head,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just one so I hope the other doesn't follow.\" She thought as the next one a bit smaller that the first adult slime that went into her. But to her dismay, it did the same. She could feel her breasts grow once more to accomodate the next slime as her breasts stretched the sports tank top. They now looked like canteloupes. Elen could feel the tightness in her tank top as the third entered her mouth and with the same result as did the next one. As the fourth one had full entered her breasts,  Elen closed her mouth as she was beet red. Not from swallowing the slime but from her growing breasts. She carefully looked as her eyes went wide. They looked like large grapefruits as she unzipped her jacket to see her breasts overflowing her tank top. But she still had four more to go. Calming herself she opened her mouth once more as the fifth one entered her mouth. Flowing into her mouth, Elen prayed for it NOT to go into her breasts..</span></div></div>",

Her tank top now acting as a bra began to stretch as the slime continued to expand her bust. From large grapefruits, they grew to coconuts as her zipper began to go lower and lower but Elen didn't have the time to recuperate as the sixth one entered her mouth. It flowed effortlessly but unlike the the 5 in her boobs this one entered her stomach. Her stomach groaned as she could feel her jacket grow tighter and tighter. She was wondering if she was going to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... I'm getting too big..\" She said as the seventh slime entered her mouth. Flowing into her stomach as it increased, she could feel her massive stomach grow outside from underneath her jacket as it continued its growth. She wanted to stop but the final slime next to the elder entered her mouth and flowed effortlessly as did the others. From her mouth, down her throat and into her belly. Elenora's belly grew and grew. She could feel compressed in her jacket as her belly grew and without warning, her zipper broke! Causing her belly to jut outward without restriction. It was a sign of relief for her but she blushed as she now knew her belly was exposed. After she felt her expansion end, she tried to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. Its almost over... all that's left it the elder...\"Elenora said. From her crawling position, she tried to push with all her might. Her breasts wobbling as she landed on her butt. Spreading her legs wide as her belly quaked. Elen could feel the slime within her move about. Not only in her belly but in her boobs as well. She looked down at herself as she held her belly. Her belly now looking like someone glued kid's size bean bag to her. She never felt so heavy in her life and she couldn't believe she could grow so big. Gasping for air, she looked at the elder slime on her right side as she placed her palms near her hips, trying to keep balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder slime was at least 2 and half feet taller but was wider than the adult slime within her. It approached her as she looked worriedly at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I fit anymore of you? You're the last one.. I hope I don't burst...\" Elen said to it as it entered her mouth feeling flow down her throat, she could feel her stomach expand once more. She winced as her skin stretched to accomodate  the elder slime. Closer her eyes as she put her left hand on her belly. Soon enough it was over as she gasped for air once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God! That's over..\" She groaned as she rubbed her belly. She felt satisfied she was helping them and somewaht happy she could fit them all. Feeling them move inside of her was euphoria but she quickly snapped out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I need to escape..If I can get up that is..\" Elenora thought looking at her belly..</span></div></div>",

Once she stood up, she could feel the weight on her hips, knees and feet as she hoisted her backpack over her left shoulder. Putting her left hand underneath her belly and her right on the wall. She slowly made her way to the vault door. What seemed so close, she felt was miles away. She was sweating a lot and with each step her belly would wobble a bit as her breasts swayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. I'm so heavy but I can't give up... Who know what these goblins might do to me.\" She thought as neared the vault door. Taking a peek outside, she saw the whole goblin clan sound asleep which was her best opportunity. Elen didn't know what time it was but she wanted to hurry. But in her current state of fullness, it wasn't that easy. She approached the door as it was half open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope I can fit through here.\" Elenora thought as she squeezed herself. Luckily her stomach was mallable,as she pressed her stomach against the door. She felt pleasure as she squished her stomach against the door. When she finally got through, she staggered a bit, trying to find her balance as she nearly hit one of the sleeping goblins. Arching her back, she found her center. Wiping some sweat off her forehead,she sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! That was a close one. Just a little more and your home free.\" Elenora said to her stomach as she put her hands underneath her stomach for added support as she waddled her way out of the camp and into the forest. She kept going despite it being dark but she knew it was for the best. She didn't know how far she walked or how long as she heard the sound of a running river. Approaching it the best she could she found an large old tree with a large gap in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be a good hiding spot.\" She thought as the branches hid it quite well. She was very tired from the long walk but she was sure she was far from the goblin camp. She'd hope. Able to squeeze through the gap, she found it was very large room as she settled down her backpack and then herself. She leaned on the wall as she rested her hands on her belly. She then took her bottled water and took a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so tired.. and being this full is making me sleepy.\" Elen said as she stroked her belly. \"I'll take a short nap...\" as she closed her eyes and slept.</span></div></div>",

She began to glow a gold aura as she continued chanting her spell. Elenora couldn't believe that magic existed. Well she was in a world she couldn't understand, a world where she was brought to. SO anything was possible she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the priestess pulled a glowing orb out of her body.

Her hips were less wider as her butt and thighs were well.. less chunky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand in front of the orb and I should do the rest.\" The priestess told Elenora and she did as told. Elenora could see what she thought was a baby inside of the orb. She shook her head. They heard male voices. They must be the ones who were chasing this priestess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up! I can hear..\" as Elen was cut off when the priestess shoved the golden orb into her stomach. Elenora winced as she felt pain in her abdomen. She bent over holding her belly as both hands covered it. Then she felt it surge, pushing outwards. Elenora felt it pushed against her arms as it quicken its pace. Her belly expanded past the months as it pushed her kendo jacket outwards, a belly now noticeable. She felt a pop in her hips to accomodate her growth as she felt her kendo pants stretch as her butt grew along with her thighs to help support  her newly pregnant belly. Elen then felt warmth in her chest as she felt her sports bra stretch. Her breasts were filling with milk while adding tissue and breast fat. She moaned but quickly covered her mouth with her right hand as her left hand slid underneath her now very pregnant belly. Her breasts once C-cups grew into DD's as they stretched not only her bra but her tank top became a secondary bra as it was pushed upward by her massive swell. Elen gasped for breath..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God! I can't believe that happened!\" She thought to herself. She stumbled due to her new weight as the priestess gestured her to come to her. Handing her the bag she was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this bag are scrolls and a map. Go to the temple in the town of Aria and give them this scroll.\" said the priestess who seemed to be giving out her final breaths. Showing her a blue knotted scroll which she placed in the shoulder bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck and be safe...\" The priestess hand collapsed as Elen now knew she had died. She prayed a small prayer for you as she knew that the voices she heard might make there way towards her. Trying to find her center of balance, she slowly walked away from the dead priestess. Carrying her backpack, shoulder bag, and baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over it, Elen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elenora slowly walked her way out of the dense forest and into a path. It seemed like a path that people use so hoping to meet some people, not the one's who were hunting the priestess. She was alone in this new world but she had to carry out the last wish of the priestess. Her backpack was heavy, adding the shoulder bag didn't make things easier. The heaviest of all was the pregnancy she was now carrying. Her lower back was hurting a bit, her bra straps were digging into her shoulders, and the unborn baby was kicking out up a storm. It was a new experience for Elenora as she made her way to the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just when it couldn't get any worse, I'm pregnant with a baby that wasn't developed in me, being chased by killers, being teleported to a weird world by a tome and most all, being labeled as a \"Legendary Hero.\" Elen thought to herself as she walked the road. According to the map from the priestess, this should take her to the nearest town, Bunham. She slowly walked trying her best to coup with her kicking companion. It was a mixture of both pain and pleasure as she held her belly underneath with her left hand. Then she heard what sounded like a wagon as she turned to see a man riding a wagon with a horse pulling it. She waved to it as the man gave her a ride in the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was an old farmer by how she sees it. Wearing a straw hat with over-alls and boots. He seemed to be in his fifties as he had a white beard like Santa Clause but he was skinny. His wagon had all sorts of fruits and vegetables in large baskets. Elen sat near the one with apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tis rare to see a woman such as urself walking alone in these parts. You're lucky you didn't meet bandits!\" The old farmer said. \"And in ur condition too!.\" He was referring to her pregnant state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.. I'm new in this place. So I got kinda lost.\" Elen said nervously, both her hands on her belly. She looked at the apples but was shy to ask. The old farmer smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and eat one! It should help the little one out! By the way, the names Thadeus.\" He said. Elen took one of the apples and took a bite. It was juicy and its flavor plentiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Elenora. They call me Elen.\" She said as she continued to eat her apple. Quickly she ate it till the core remained. Eating the apple seemed to calm her occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet a beautiful woman like you!\" He said, lifting his hat. \"Your clothes seem different from what I usually see. You from somewhere distant?\" He asked. He saw her look out in the distant fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something like that.\" She said as she caressed her belly. She didn't know why but she felt at peace doing so.\"So are we near the town yet?\" Elen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeap! Just over this hill and you'll see the town of Bunham!\" Thadeus said pointing over to the hill in front of them. Elenora just prayed she would get to the place she needed to go. A lot was on her mind but she'd hope she wouldn't run into whoever was chasing the priestess. The pregnancy was taking its toll on her as she fell asleep in the wagon. The farmer turned to see her asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must've had a long day. Walking alone on this road is crazy.\" He thought as they reached the over the hill as the town grew in view.</span></div></div>",

Thadeus kept shaking her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Missy! Wake up! We're here in Bunham!\" He said trying to wake her. Elenora stirred from her sleep. Him shaking her was also causing her boobs to shake within the constricted sports bra. She grasped her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh.. Thadeus? Wha?? Sorry must've dozed off.\" She said to Thadeus as she tried to regain her senses. She looked around to see a active town of people. Well not only people but with any type of fantasy creature she may have seen in movies, book, or T.V. shows. From dwarves, elves, half-animal/ half- humans, goblins, ogres, and of course humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can guess you were tired. I mean in your state, why wouldn't you be?\" He chuckled. Elenora could see a half-man/ half-bull carrying the basket full of apples from Thadeus's cart. Thadeus also had bananas, oranges, lemons, almost any kind of fruits that grew on trees. She grabbed another apple and ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what kind of town is this?\" Elenora asked while eating the apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This a town of traders. From food, clothes, weapons, this is one of the towns that centralizes in trading.\" He said. He helped Elenora out of his cart. She leaned on the side of his cart with her bags in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you heading now?\" He asked. The half-men/ half-beast continuing their work of unloading his cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElenora pulled out a map, showing him where she needed to go. Her right index finger pointed at the place called Aria. Thadeus was rubbing his beard with his left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get to here. Do you know where this is?\" Elenora asked Thadeus who shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but I've heard of it. Its a holy city. Not many have seen but all I know is a sacred ground. What you be doing there?' He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to deliver this.\" Elen said patting her belly.\" It will be safe there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go to the town center? They should be able to hand you directions.\" Thadeus said as he pointed to the town center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I think of that?\" She thought. \"Thanks Thadeus! Also thanks for the ride!\" She said as she waved good bye to the old farmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take care of yourself now! The little one too!.\" He said smiling as she made her way to the town center. The town was bustling with people as she had a hard time moving her way to it...</span></div></div>",

No computers just people or half people running about. As bustling as the town trading point was, this place was the same. Cradling her belly, she walked towards the center desk. She wasn't used to carry extra weight. Not meaning the shoulder bag but an unborn baby. She was a bit out of breath just from the short walk, adding getting to the \"help\" desk added more fatigue to her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElen walked up to see a half-woman, half gazelle at the desk. Her head was that of a gazelle but she had long brown hair, had red rectangular glasses and lipstick on. Her body like a human woman but her feet and hands were hooves. She had a rather petite figure as she was busy reading some transcripts of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...Excuse me?\" Elenora asked the gazelle woman a bit shy and embarrassed. The gazelle woman looked at her, her ears flickering a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? How may I help you?\" She said politely which eased Elen's nervousness. Elen smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I get to Aria?\" She asked/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not \"how you get, girlie\" but where is it.\" The gazelle woman said. \"No one knows where the holy city is since its been kept well hidden. You're lucky if you could meet a priestess who actually been there. But even that won't help you.\" She said as she saw Elenora's body. \"Quite strange clothing.. Are you a foreigner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Yes mam. I need to get there to deliver this.\" Elen said as she rubbed the under swell of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she can be a help to you.\" said the gazelle lady pointing over to the bench where a woman sat. She was human at least, The woman that the gazelle lady pointed out had long red violet hair that extended down to her waist. It was tied in a criss cross ponytail. A rather stunning woman with large breasts, wide hips and slender thighs. She had a sleeve less blouse that was vertically lined, the same as her long dress that had a slit on her left leg. She had long gloves on and a staff with a star and rings dangling from the points of the star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a sorceress.\" Elen thought as she nodded to the gazelle woman. She approached the woman sitting on the bench who had her arms crossed beneath her breasts, leaning on the wall with her eyes closed. Elenora slowly made her way to her. When she reached her, the woman spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, whats taking her so long?\" The woman said. A disgrunted look on her face. Elen approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Excuse me? Are you going Aria? The gazelle lady said you were going there.\" Elen said as the lady looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I can't do that. You're lucky if you meet my priestess friend then maybe she could help you.\" The lady said as she looked at Elenora's body. \"I'd say you're a foreigner.\" Elen nodded. The lady noticed the shoulder bag, hanging on her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bag! That's Rosey's' bag! You stole it didn't you!\" The lady yelled causing the people around her to look at their direction. The lady was taller than her by at least 4 inches. She stretched her arms out, gesturing the lady to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down! She's dead, okay? She gave me this.\" Elenora said. As she handed the bag over to the lady. She looked inside to see everything was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead how? Explain everything!\" She said. Elenora told her story. When she finished, the lady had her hand on her head as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! She wasn't careful! Oh Rosey!\" said the lady as Elenora sat beside her. Patting her bag to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for your friend but she gave me this and told me to go to Aria. Will you help me?\" Elenora said. The lady looked at her and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my job anyways. Since she left it in your care, I suppose I have to choice but to escort you there. I'm Luciana.\" She said as they shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Elenora. Pleased to meet you.\" Elenora smiled. She felt a kick on her right side of the belly. She moved her hand to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we go right away?\" Elenora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know how to get inside Aria but I know where it is but first we must meet up with the other three priestesses. They have their escorts as well.\" Luciana said as they got up. Elenora slow to get as she cradled her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean \"get inside\".? Elenora asked her puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aria is protected by a magic barrier that only the priestess of Aria know how to get into. Not even the most powerful sorcery can break it. Since I doubt she taught you how we mine as well look for the others.\" Luciana said in a distraught tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea where we could find them?\" Elenora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the closest one who name it Faris should be in the next town. The town of Graphite.\" Luciana said. Rubbing a fake mustouche with her left hand while holding her staff with her right. She had a small purse on her left side that Elen now noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should get there as quick as possible. I wanna get this young one out.\" Elenora said, rubbing her belly. Luciana laughed as she looked at Elenora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most mothers enjoy their pregnancy. Well its not its yours anyways.\" Luciana smiled. \"We'll teleport there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleport? How? What are you?\" Elenora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a Time Mage. Didn't you know?\" Luciana said looking at her in a puzzled way. Elenora blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm from a foreign land so I wouldn't know.\" Elenora said looking down. Embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well THAT explains why you are dressed funny.\" Luciana said, snickering to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says who? I feel like I'm in a cosplay world!\" Elenora thought to her self. Pouting as she held her belly with both hands. Luciana pulled her staff forward and begun to cast a spell. It caused the floor to light up beneath them, creating a circle of light. Elenora was stunned by what was happening.</span></div></div>",

Elenora was a bit surprised about the magic she was casting but as she looked at her belly she rubbed its only possible in this world she was in. The baby on the other hand intensified its movement as Elenora winced as a small moan escaped her mouth. She bent over a bit. Luciana noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong with you?\" Luciana teased as she placed her staff on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The baby is really moving.. I dunno why.\" Elenora said as she stroked her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it dislikes you?\" Luciana teased some more as she giggled causing her large breasts to quiver. Elenora rolled her eyes in frustration at the tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" Elen replied as she cradled her belly. The circle brighten and created a pillar of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done~\" Luciana sang in a cheerful tone. Elenora sighed but neither of them noticed a fireball heading their way. And on impact, it exploded causing the two to be blown back as Elenora fell on her side, sliding across the floor. Luciana fell on her butt causing her large breasts to wobble. Her spell had been cancelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? A bomb or something?\"Elenora said after she groaned. Slowing getting to her feet as she dusted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was a fireball. It looked it wasn't intended to hit us but cancel my spell.\" Luciana said after she got up and dusted herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would do that?\" Elenora asked Luciana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course it was me, my beautiful white haired lass!\" said a stranger. Everyone that was in the town center was in a state of panic. Others were nursing the injured while others were escaping the town center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who??\" They both said in unison as they saw a male dressed in noble clothes. They were red and gold as he looked like someone from the medival era. He had short hair that was brown and was actually good looking. He twirled his short staff that was golld with a red globe that had a cross on top. It continued to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Eliseo! And I'm here to claim that bag that the white haired girl is carrying as well as the child of light she bears.\" Eliseo said spinning around and posing, pointing at Elenora. The girls both looked at him at disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great just what we need , an egotistical mage.\" Luciana said, rubbing her temples of her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it.\" Elenora pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.. They were not mesmerized by my charm? How dreadful.\" He said sadly. \"So will you surrender or do you prefer athe hard way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like heck we would surrender!\" Said Luciana as she tapped the bottom of her staff on the floor. Elenora took out her sword and pointed towards Eliseo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do they always choose the hardway.\" Eliseo sighed as he shrugged he then began to chant which Luciana recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's casting a summoner's spell.\" She mumbled as Elen looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summoning spell? He could do that.?\" Asked Elenora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh! Can't you see the small circles appearing around him?\" Luciana said as Elen saw several circles around Eliseo. Just as he finished his spell, they saw several orcs appear! They were gray and ugly. They had pointy ears were their jaws had pointy teeth. They wore tunics and had axes while others had swords. They snorted, burped and other things that wers disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Orcs! How freud!\" Luciana said mocking Eliseo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They may be like that but at least they're loyal. Orcs attack them!\" Eliseo ordered as one of them roar and led the charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuciana teleported around causing some of the orcs to slam into each other, knocking themselves out. Others that weren't, she used gravitation spells, time spells and force spells. Luciana was already done. Elenora on the other hand held her ground as she knocked out whatever orc came her way. By the time she was done, she was out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty good!\" Luciana said as she patted Elenora looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Elenora smiled as the tandem looked at Eliseo. Eliseo only shook his head as he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I forced to use my trump card.\" Eliseo said as he began to chant another spell. The tandem ready to take on whatever came their way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There the two saw a wicked smile creep on his face as a dark aura was felt emanating from him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....is......that?\" Luciana said as se stared at the light bluorb in front of Eliseo. Somehow Elenora felt a strange connection to it. She absent mindly placed her left hand on top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this look familiar to you my white haired girle?\" He said wickedly as her liftr hs left hand as the orb started to float to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..it couldn't be!\" Elenora said in shock, remembering the ritual that Rosey did to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.... but it is! This belong to the priestess by the name of Mist. Her companion, an elf I believe were no match for me. Luckily we had a traitor with us who used the ritual. The one the priestess of light used on you. Of course the necromancer Malice, asked me to use this as a trump card!\" Eliseo said as he laughed manically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard!\" Luciana said as she began to cast a spell but she saw Eliseo pull his staff at the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Tsk tsk tsk. You don't want me to kill this unborn? I mean it was what you were meant to protect right?\"  Eliseo said smiling once more. Luciana cancel her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl! Now white haired girlie come to me so I can take the child of light.\" Eliseo said as he gestured her to come close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElenora looked at Luciana as Luciana nodded and thus Elenora walked to Eliseo. As she reached him, he used his free hand and used it to check her cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are beautiful. Just as the legend says. Too bad it ends today!\" He said as he began to chant only to be interrupted by Luciana who had a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey moron! You're not the only one with a trump card as well!\" Luciana said as she tapped her staff on the ground. Then he was unaware that during the assault of the orcs, Luciana secretly casted a spell behind him. That spell seemed to be a wormhole! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaa???\" Eliseo yelled in disbelief as he turned to see a large hole materialize behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Elenora!\" Luciana screamed as Elenora started a sword thrust both seeing her wooden sword shine brightly! Elenora felt a surge of energy flow from her belly to her sword. As the point of the sword hit Eliseo on the chest, it exploded! Sending him into the wormhole and into the darkness. She gasped for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elen! The orb! It might get sucked into the wormhole! Grab it while I seal the wormhole!\" Luciana said as she pointed her staff at the wormhole. A spell circle appearing before the globe in front of the staff. Elenora saw the light blue orb slowing being pulled into the wormhole, she dropped her sword and dove for it. Catching it with both hands as she slid across the floor. She held the orb close to her body and somehow without the ritual, the orb was slowly being absorbed by her belly! Elenora unfortunately knocked herself out as Luciana rushed to her side after sealing the wormhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the orb? Don't tell me...even without the ritual...\" Luciana said as she looked at the unconscious Elenora. Luciana looked around the damages done by the fight and found it best to get out if there so she casg the teleportation spell. Taking them out of the area before the authorities arrived at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElenora groaned as she woke up. Placing her right hand on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last thing I remember... Was the orb! But I caught it! Where is it?\" Elenora said as she looked around. \"Where am I? And wheres Luciana?\" Elenora found out she was in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What the hell just happened? Where am I?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sees a light ahead and moves towards it. It's eyes adjust as it is now overlooking a dense forest. \"This is weird. How did I wind up in a cave overlooking a forest?...This is bad. I don't see any buildings. I'm alone\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name is Mathew, or Matt. He has Short brown hair and blue eyes, and looks like a normal 18 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, how did I get here? Think.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a normal day. He had just gotten up and had finished getting ready for school. He took his normal route directly through a park that was in between his house and his school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today was different. He passes through the middle of the park and past the fountain. He sudden pauses, he hears a voice. CHOSEN ONE. IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO FULFILL YOUR ROLE. \"What? Who's there!\". THIS WAY. COME THIS WAY. FOLLOW MY VOICE. He doesn't recognize the voice, but for some reason, he feels like he can trust it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter heading in the direction the voice had come from, he comes across a strange place. There was a very old building. It was small and looked like the forest had partially swallowed it. It was in bad shape and easily missed by someone who just passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nENTER. ENTER AND FULFILL YOUR DESTINY. He enters the building. \"If this is some joke, I'll get you for this later!\". The inside is just as bad. Vines have covered most of the floor, walls and ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing in the room is what looks like an alter in the middle. He approaches it.

A large splash near him forces him to turn back to the lake, he sees ripples in the water. \"Ok, this is freaking me out\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, directly in front of him, something begins to emerge. A head comes out of the water, it belonged to a girl with long blue hair and blue eyes, and she is staring at him. \"Ok....um, was it you making all that noise?\". She nods. With a sigh, \"whew, alright. I sure am glad to see someone else. But why are you in the water? Why won't you come out?\". She shakes her head. \"Why not?\". She backs up in the water, and her tail fin appears. \"A mermaid!\", he yells. She darts underwater, and doesn't come back up for a few minutes, but with her head just barely out of the water. \"There you are, sorry about that, I was just surprised. So, your a mermaid?\", the mermaid nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't come out, but it was you making all that noise, what, can you only come onto land for a limited amount of time?\", again, she nods. \"I see, well, my name is Mathew, but everyone just calls me Matt\". She finally says her first words. Ma-Marina\". He smiles, it's nice to meet you Marina\", she smiles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the sun, he guesses that it'll get dark soon. \"Hmmm, the climb to the cave is too dangerous, so I guess I'll sleep by this lake\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes his way to the forest, but hears Marina start to move, looking behind, he sees a worried look on her face. \"Oh, I'm not leaving, I promise I'll be right back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts to scour the forest for something he could use. he finds a few decent sized sticks that were as big as him and some large leaves. He starts to ferry them back and forth, on his last leg, he reaches down to pick up a stick, but it won't budge, he pulls with all his strength and it finally gives, sending him backwards. \"Ow, that hurt\". Looking at what was holding the stick, he only sees tree sap, he decides to test it. Finding a smaller stick, he stabs it and pulls, but the stick won't budge until he yanks with all his might, causing the stick to snap and sending him backwards again. \"What is with that tree sap? That's strong!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe assembles a simple lean-to facing the lake. \"Alright, that's done. It may not be much, but at least it's better than nothing\". Looking back at the lake, he sees that Marina had been watching him the entire time. He sits down by the edge, \"if, you don't mind me asking, why are living in such a small lake? I though your kind lived in the ocean\". She looks down. Thinking he shouldn't have asked that, she looks back up and at him. \"A-an accident. I did live in the ocean...with my people,b-but I was teleported out her by this lake, and I can't make it back before I hit the time limit....\". \"Your trapped here, all by yourself?\". She nods. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't of asked that\". \"It-it's alright\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talk until late into the night. Matt then goes to bed in his lean-to and Marina dives sinks deep into the lake.</span></div></div>",

He walks over to her and kneels down. \"Here\", she nervously says, revealing a decent sized fish in her hands. \"Oh, thanks\", he says, taking it. He immediately starts a fire, spears it, and lets it cook. He notices her staring at it, \"if you want, I can make one for you\". She immediately dives into the water and appears with another one. He takes it and does the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back, I'm going to take a quick walk\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts to think to himself. \"What should I do? I want to head out to find a town or something, but I can't leave her all by herself\". He continues to debate on leaving the forest and leaving her behind, or trying to find someway to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up on an answer, for now anyway, he heads back to the lake. He takes his fish and the one he prepared for her off of the fire. Handing her one, he sits by the lake and has breakfast. Holding her fish, she gets out of the water and sits next to him, her tail still in the water, he smiles at her, and they eat together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That settles it, I have to help her. But going by what she said, she can't make it far enough before she turns back into a mermaid. So I have to find someway to bring a large amount of water with me, great, how am I going to do that?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look around the forest, he passes by where he got the materials for his lean-to. He is struck with a brilliant idea. \"Of course! That sap!\". He also remembers the giant leaves he used, they were waxy, maybe they were water proof. Running back to camp, he takes one of the leaves and pours some water onto it. The water just rolls right off. \"It'll take some time, but I think I found a way to get her out of this forest\". Marina, seeing him acting strangely, swims over to him. \"What's wrong? Your acting odd?\". He turns to her, his face beaming. \"I think I just found a way to help you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks pass as he starts his plan. All the while living with Marina. In the time it took him to make his creation, he had also made a fishing pole, swam with Marina multiple times, and did all sorts of things, like exploring more of the forest and getting to know Marina better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on the finishing touches, he finishes it. Over a month has now passed since he first awoke in the strange cave over the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy, he spent most of his time on it, and it definitely isn't the best looking thing in the world, but he had done it. He had made a waterproof, leak-free portable tub. It was made of wood, a lot of that tree sap that was even stronger , like cement, when hardened, and a lot of those waxy leaves on the inside. \"If this work\", he says to Marina, \"you will finally be able to leave this small lake\". But it was late, they will leave tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets up early, as does Marina, and like they have everyday, they eat together. \"Ready to try it out?\", she excitedly nods. He takes it to a side of the lake that would be the easiest place to put it in and pull it out. He carefully lowers it into the lake, but he doesn't fill it all the way, he, together with Marina's help, push it out of the lake. He then takes a bucket that he made and fills up the rest of the tub. \"Now we wait\". They let a few hours pass, it is now almost noon, and there are no signs of leaks. \"Yes! It works!\". They spend a half hour gathering things they need for their trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally ready, Matt enters the lake and carries Marina out and deposits her into the tub. Going to the front, \"you ready?\". \"Yes!\", happily replying as he pulls the tub through the forest.</span></div></div>",

And he does, they finally exit the massive forest and are staring at the ocean. \"Finally! After so long!\", Matt was surprised, he hasn't seen her this excited, she must have been trapped there for a long time. He brings the tub through the beach and to the edge of the water. Picking her back up, he carries her into the ocean and lets her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to swim and dart all over the place, having been cooped up inside that small lake and then in the tub must have been hard for her. Eventually calming down, she swims back to Matt. \"I don't know how I can ever thank you for this!\". \"I already said not to worry about it, I did it because I wanted to\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lunges forward, embracing him, and then kisses him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, he says his goodbye and starts to leave. \"Wait!\", she suddenly says, stopping him. \"I have something important to tell you!\".

There is a legend that says that when the worlds in trouble, a hero from another world will appear to help us in our time of need. I think that's you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? A prophecy, but does it say how I can get back?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head. \"I don't know. I really don't know much about it, but my queen does\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't she at the bottom of the ocean?\". \"Well, yes. But I do know how to get you there.

Embracing him and giving him a quick kiss, \"I'm going to start now\". Marina places both hands on his head and pulls him down into the water. \"Now, don't fight it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly forces his head into her vagina. He starts to panic. But settles down from her stroking him. Starting back up, she pulls in more and more of him as she clears his shoulders, stomach, and waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are experiencing indescribable pleasure as his feet enter her warm moist slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaching herself, she rubs her stomach and stretches. \"This won't take long\", she tells her stomach. She then takes a quick nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up an hour later, she realizes that it's done. Inching back towards the ocean, she goes in up to her shoulders.

Stopping for a second to catch her breathe. She then takes in a deep breath, and pushes with all of her remaining strength.

Looking around, he realizes that he is underwater, and that he can both breathe and talk! \"What the hell?\".

She somehow ended up back in the meadow where she first woke up from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did I end up back here? Was it really just a dream?\". She stands up and notices something. \"....!!!W-where are my clothes!? All of that was real? This is impossible. I should be dead! How? .....wait....was it that thing I drank? Is that why I'm ok?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering herself, and still putting everything together, she doesnt see what is sneaking up on her. A long skinny tongue then licks her between her legs. She lets out a suprised and pleasant sound before looking behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a giant brown snake. Her eyes widen and was about to run, but its long forked tongue continues to lick and explore her lower region and these sensations force her to her knees.. The snake used this chance to wrap around her waist, pinning her arms to her sides in the process. with her ass and legs sticking out, it continues its assault. Its tongue continues to go over her slit and ass, occasionally sticking it deep into both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahh! N-no! Its tongue! Aahh...stop!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does stop though. But only to switch out its tongue for its dick. She feels its tongue stop and thinks that its finally over, but she then gets a surprise. She feels something big probbing her pussy. \"....Oh god. N0! Dont!....AAAHHH!\". It shoves its member inside her moist slit with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt starts out slow, at first, as if it was teasing her. But it quickly picks up speed as it starts to use its tongue to lick and stick in her ass again. It suddenly stops, and a huge amount of cum enters her as she lets out a loud high pitch scream. She can feel her stomach slowly expand as it continues to fill her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake then opens up its mouth and places it over Alice's ass. It starts to swallow, sandwiching her and still using its tongue to stimulate her. Alice doesn't struggle, she is too tired to. She is easily swallowed and as its mouth closes shut, she says one last thing, \".....great, I'm getting eaten again.....\".</span></div></div>",

She screams in surprise as it wraps around her and lifts her into the air. Before she could complain, or even scream, it forces a vine into her mouth, ass, pussy, and releases a substance inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lets her go and she stands up. \"W-wha-Huh? What just happened? That was fast!\". Backing away from the plant, she suddenly feels, odd. Her feet start to wobble and she falls. \"I-I can't get up! No, I can't move! What did it-\". Her entire body goes numb as she realizes that what it pumped into her paralyzed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large vine then snakes its way to her towards her. She can only watch as the tip of the round vine opens up. What looks like drool is dropping from it's mouth. It covers her face and slowly begins to devour her. Her head, arms, and chest are eventually covered by the vine, the moist tight insides constantly stimulating her. It finally sucks in her feet and she is inched down the vine until she blacks out and wakes up once more in the meadow.</span></div></div>",

It is getting harder for the creatures of the area to eat, let alone digest her. It seems that all the time spent trying to find her way through has made her stonger.

I own a little bakery in a town not far from here.

A single bathtub with only 1 pipe under the tub and into the floor. \"What am I suppose to do?\". She then notices a basket filled with oddly colored and shaped gems. She picks up a blue 1, and it starts to glow, then water flows from it. Immediately, she throws it into the tub and it fills up. She takes out the gem, and the blue color  had faded. \"What are these things? Some kind of magic gems? Is this how this world works?\". She puts the used gem back into the basket and picks up a red 1, and to her surprise, it slowly gets hotter. \"This must be how they heat things\", she says, tossing it into the water. The water gets just right and she removes the gem and gets in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the cabin enters the bathroom and puts a change of clothes by the door and leaves.

Right now she hasn't had anything to eat in... well, since that one fruit a couple of days ago actually. For some reason when she appears back in the meadow she is rested, and not hungry or thirsty. It's actually starting to not be much of a chore, being eaten that is. Except this time the snake has got itself a little messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I could be here all day like this?\" She said, peering down at the snake's eyes. She was sure the thing could sort of understand her, however that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now she was stuck. It had grabbed her yet again when she woke up, but this time had grabbed her feet, tail pinning her arms to her sides, but it had swallowed all the way up her body, but left her arms outside it's mouth. It's jaws were up almost to her chin, it's cheeks pressed tight under her arms, but it's tail, still wrapped around her, kept her from lifting her arms. She couldn't go in, and it wouldn't let her out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt actually felt kind of nice, the snake's repeated, dumb efforts to swallow her, though her armpits were beginning to ache with the snake's jaws jamming tight under there. Another ripple of throat muscles swirled over her, surging down her from chest to feet and she gasped. OK, that might be interesting... if it wasn't trying to eat her... OK, eating wasn't permanent but... why was she resisting this? She never got hurt, never felt anything when the snake (or any of the other denizens of this forrest) ate her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Snake.\" she said, peering around it's muzzle to an eye that stared, unblinking up at her. \"Here's the deal. You let go of my arms, I raise my arms, you eat me. I won't struggle, I'll let you eat me, and in return you help me out a bit, and I'll let you eat me every now and then if... well, take it slow, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid it understand her? Slowly the tail around her lifted, loosing her arms and leaving her resting lightly in the snake's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, guess you can understand me. OK, deal is a deal. Just take it slow and gentle, OK?\" she lifted her arms above her head and slowly felt the snake's maw open wide beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRippling gulps came once more, but weaker, slowly sucking her in. The upper jaw of the snake slid slowly in front of her face and she stared at it, fascinated at the pink, fleshy surface that slowly contained her. Further investigation was halted as she moaned, the experience of going in slowly was... rather distracting! Flesh kneaded her whole body, squeezing her breasts, hips, thighs. OK, this could get interesting! She slid deeper, light slowly cut off as the snake's mouth closed above her. The sensations were getting rather intense as the flesh pressed in tightly, squeezing and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking she gasped, waking up on the meadow, just catching a twitch inside the snake beside her before the bulge stilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMNIT!\" She gasped, making the snake jerk. \"Couldn't you have waited a couple of seconds more? God, I was close!\" She stared at the slightly confused looking snake. \"OK, open up and finish what you started mister! And this time go easy, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snake happily complied.</span></div></div>",

He could still remember waking up at home in his bed, covered by a clean sheet and a warming blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the memories of what he had not so long age, he did not have then as now. As he raised his head and gave a questioning look around from where he was lying, he saw the cattle, and some were standing, grazing their morning meal. His mind still foggy about so many things as the process he was put through tended to befuddle memories, thoughts and rational thinking. The Professor told Dan what to expect, and about how he would feel, but he never related what it was like after sleeping the night lying on the cold ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in a snug curl of his body, Dan laid there preferring to think and work his mind to remember how he got to where he had to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plight began due to greed, or after he read the summer jobs offers posted on the bulletin board at school. He, like many others looked forward to summer and vacation to find employment, as earn money to spend, buying whatever he wished was neat to own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob application was when he met Professor Haun, an oriental man, a manager of Sunrise Research, a large employer there in that small Wisconsin town. Big promises made, falsified statements about if he, Dan were to prefer residing at the research center, his pay would be increased, as then on duty 24-7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duty,\" that was the crux word, that was what got Dan to feeling lost, as almost like he had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Injections,\" immunizations the Professor said, but the injections caused more than a rash or short illness. Seven injections, some intravenous, as were two other injections being subconscious, as all hurt, but the one the Professor's nurse shot into the corona head of Dan's pretty, as pink penis was the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and that private room or apartment as promised, well that became a concrete floor and prison cell where Dan laid and screamed as the injections began to work. First happened was the sickening feeling when Dan noticed his skin changing, the color first, as then the texture hardening. The second phase caused his black skin to sprout billions of hairs, or fur as he would realize later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was that horrid night and day when he reeled in pain as his spine grew, sprouting then what was his tail. \"Tail,\" his tail, Dan's tail, a two foot long tail, it bony, as fur covered ending with a hairy switch. As much he hated to see it grow and become as his tail, he found it had its usage, offering both comfort and a manner to express his attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to stay awake, but the boredom of his cell and the weary feelings as changes progressed, some external and easier noticed, and those internal what hurt bad. As his whole body he saw covered by a thick, as black colored hide, and the black fur, plus a very bovine like tail led him to thinking he might be becoming a Anthro-bull, or a Minotaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan awoke from a short nap and immediately noticed the new bulk and weighty feel of his scrotum. As he rose to a sitting position on his army style cot there in his jail-cell, he swung his legs off the cot, and felt his scrotum roll off as it dripped, hanging then from his groin. He felt horror struck and as oddly quite horny from seeing his scrotum being bovine of size, each testicle the shape and bulk similar to a large Yam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs furred hands then cupped under his weighty scrotum, Dan felt a strange moving feeling, similar to his manly penis becoming as aroused. Dan moved his hands to where he had always touched his arousal, finding then only fur, and a inner tube. He ran his black fingers along the expanding internal tube, tracing it to where, just about three inches below his navel, he had there the protruded end to a bovine sheath. A real sheath, it having long hairs surrounding the opening, as he continued his touching of it, what it held began a movement from inside his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly at the first sight of his then, as quite uncircumcised as blunt ended pink colored cock-head inched out, coming into the light of his cell. Dan continued his stroking of the slight bulge of his internal sheath, as the touching worked to urge more of his then bovine shaped cock to rise out of its protective home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan squealed from the different as new sensations of his aroused erection moving, being tickled some by the long sheath hairs. His wrinkled pink cock had a morbid look to it, but as it continued to extend as bloat, the wrinkles became highly sensuous skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning and groaning coming from Dan's cell brought the guard from in the outer hallway to come stand as watching, looking through the iron barred window inset into the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling those new fun thrills the Professor promised there sonny? As trust me, I have seen and heard many a young fool like you sit or lying there on that cot, most liking to masturbate; as doing so causes a rush in how fast your body will continue to show more changes. If you do masturbate often, as again, some did as often as hourly, as by night and all day, they gain an educating of their new style of sexual pleasuring of brute females.\" The guard said, as he taunted Dan, while Dan continued to stroke and arouse his cock to growing longer, as gaining of girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no..., oh, oh, ah..., oh no, oh yes, more yes more,\" Dan said as he at the first bemoaned his sensations, but changed his attitude as his pink colored cock stretched long, as extended to more than what he estimated to be 18 inches or more of bold length. The dime size of the blunt end to his newer penis then tapered as grown larger as it stood stiffly extended from out its furry as hairy sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wondrous touching of furry hands to the softly sensual as stretched taunt skin of his changed penis worked to stir feeling in his scrotum. As Dan continued to stroke his furry hands along the length of his bovine cock, it began as well to leaking of a clear colored drips of pre. As the penis invoked in Dan a lusting want to ejaculate, the Guard then said, \"Let it go, but point it at the floor, as if plastered there it makes my work easier to need mop the floor, as rather than of washing the walls to clean your spent semen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan heard the suggestion and would have said something intelligible but he with feelings of indignation, then snorted out his broadened nostrils, making the sound of a bull feeling irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his snort, Dan continued his hand masturbating of his cock, feeling a surge rising in his scrotum of an impending blast of semen roaring along his inner sheath, as then rushing through as out his stoutly stiffened as bovine like cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh, oh... yea...,\" Dan yelped as his cock rose and curled upward slightly, adjusting the angle, as it expelled a blast of semen. The semen, a creamy thick as mild yellow and some white coloration, streamed from the open end to his stout cock. The harsh stream shot straightly out, flying some four feet to where it struck, as splattered on the adjacent cell wall. Dan smiled a cocked grin across his bovine muzzle, while feeling a sense of pride and glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlee from the sheer volume of what he had ejaculated, as much a sense of pride at the surged distance he shot his load. \"Yaw, yaw..., yawrooo..., ahrooo..., Yahroo!\" Dan exclaiming his pent up thrilled feeling, but hearing his voice, he knew his ability to form words had come to a quick end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you your masturbation would speed the changes, as your face gained a working muzzle, thicker lips, and longer tongue, and broadened nostrils, yup, your head is on a fast-track change to being that of you ass a Bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHear me and know this, seeing there the thick globs of yellow semen mixed with those meager white drips of white semen, yea there trickling down the cell wall. Understand this sonny, the yellow as creamy semen is bovine, but the white little pearl drips, is the last of you human male semen. Starting now and for the rest of your life, only bovine semen will roar out your pretty, pink cock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan then bellowed his dismayed feelings, as from what the Guard had said, he referring to Dan as of him becoming soon a Bull, and not as almost as bad of being a Minotaur. Dan let go and hung his head, feeling its grown weight, and his muzzle touching as his, as more muscular chest.</span></div></div>",

After arriving at his large mansion, where only he lives, if you don't count the maids he hired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey welcome him back, and he heads to his room. \"Another great day\", he says, stretching and laying back on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his maids had gone home, leaving him all by himself, but he was use to it. Having moved out of his parent's house years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large banging noise wakes him up. \"What was that?\". It happens again. \"Probably nothing\", he says, going to investigate the noise. It is coming from the kitchen. Peeking inside, no one's there. \"I knew it, there is no way someone can get past my security system\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banging noise happens a 5th time. It's definitely coming from the kitchen, but there is no one there.

What the hell? Where am I?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were trees surrounding him, somehow, he had ended up in a forest. He knew he wasn't on his property, and he starts to think of how he ended up here. \"Kidnapping? An experiment backfired?\", he comes up with many theories, though he can't prove anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it doesn't matter. I just need to find a way out of here\".

Kneeling down, he feels the water, it's cold. \"Not the smartest idea, but at least it's clear, cold, and flowing\", and he cups his hands and takes a few drinks from the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to his feet, he suddenly hears growling directly behind him. A large blue wolf was just coming out of the forest. \"A blue wolf? A new species? Or was it bred like that?\", he couldn't help it, his curiosity getting the best of him. He notices it's posture. \"If it's anything like the wolves I've studied, it's getting ready to pounce\", he thinks, and it does. He sidesteps it, and it falls in the river. \"Too predictable\". It quickly turns around, but Nathan was ready. It leaps again, only to be met by a well timed kick to it's lower jaw. \"Too bad, but I've studied various martial arts and I work out in my spare time, which I have lots of\". It hits the ground, and Nathan is immediately on it, lifting a large rock in one hand he picked up from the stream's edge, he smashed it into the beast's head. He does this a few more times, making sure he killed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter confirming his kill, he starts to examine it. \"What a waste, this would have made an excellent specimen. But, it is a wolf in every way. It was just larger than most wolves and had an odd colored coat. But, I can safely assume I'm not near my house anymore\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention is redirected behind him, he hears more movement in the direction the wolf came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns around and gets another surprise. \"You killed it? Darn, I had been tracking that creature for a while now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl with long brown hair and blue eyes entered the clearing. She looked to be around his age, and she had a great figure, but this is not what surprised him. Everything below her stomach, was a horse. She was a centauress, with her lower horse half a light brown color and a brown tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How odd, I've never seen human clothing like that. And I don't see a weapon on you. It seems that your different from the rest of your kind....What's wrong? You've been staring at me, strangely\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is at a loss for words. Standing before him is a living myth, something that shouldn't exist. His curiosity takes control again. He walks up to her side and puts his hand against her, it was warm, she was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, \"wh-what are you doing!\". \"Amazing! A real centaur, I mean centauress. I never thought that they existed, or that I'd even meet one!\", talking to himself, as he continues to examine her side. Still surprised, she pushes him away from her. \"What is your problem! Don't touch me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! I'm sorry. I let my curiosity get the better of me\". Still a bit upset, she realizes something. \"Wait, what do you mean by saying we don't exist?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe explains, in detail, all he knows about centaurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the entire world knew about us. Wait, I know as a fact that we're known. Unless, what is the name of your world?\". He's confused by this. \"What an odd question. Earth of course\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this isn't Earth. It's Rolarik. That can only mean that you came from another world! Is that legend true\". He looks even more confused, \"what are you talking about?\". She begins to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always thought it was just a legend, something that people thought up to give them hope, or something like that. But with what you just told me, there is no way your from this world, and that would explain your clothing.....But as I was saying. This is Rolarik, there is a legend that says that when we're in trouble, a person from another world will come to help us. I guess that's you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, you seem to be telling the truth, and I've never heard of real centaurs or blue wolves. So I guess I can believe you. So, what am I suppose to save you all from?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From a so called warlord. He was born with large magical powers and is able to summon massive armies using his powers. He uses these armies to overwhelm his opponents and take over one place at a time\". \"And I'm suppose to stop this \"magic\" user\". \"Yes\". \"Where is he? I must see him first before I formulate a plan\". \"I don't know, he is constantly on the move. You will have to ask the closest human town. Fortunately, there is one a few days from here. I can take you part of the way\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before that, she takes the dead wolf with her, she was hunting it after all. They walk side by side, with her leading the way, all the while, he is studying her, with the occasional poke. \"Would you stop that\", she sounds very annoyed. \"Sorry, I can't help it, I am a scientist. Right, by the way, what is your name? Mine is Nathan\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow\". \"Oh...named after a tree\". \"You know that?\". \"I am a genius, I know a lot of things\".</span></div></div>",

My village isn't far from here, that is where we part ways\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I should give you this, she reaches into a bag tied to her side and pulls out a glass vial with a blue liquid in it. \"Here, drink this\". \"What is it?\", he curiously asks. \"Call it a revival potion, everyone takes one, with it, you don't have to worry about death. If you do die, you'll just be brought back to an important place or near an important person\". \"Huh, well, why not\". He takes the vial and swallows it's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exit the forest, and there is a road. It runs along the forest line, with a forest on both of it's sides. But they get a surprise. \"What is this?\", is what Nathan thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere staring at a large man in full black body armor, except the helmet, and a large ax. Directly behind hem, there were countless demon like creatures. They were walking along the road from their right to left. He looks up at Willow, wanting to ask her about this, but something is wrong. She looks absolutely terrified. He suddenly realizes who the man is, the warlord, the one he was suppose to defeat. \"Oh, so not good\", he says, as the man takes a few steps towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, what do we have here? A centaur and an oddly dressed human. Wait, I have traveled the planet and have seen all sorts of clothes, but nothing like yours.....I see, your him, aren't you. The so called chosen one who will defeat me! Well, looks like it was just a legend after all. You don't even have a weapon\". He looks at willow, \"So I will deal with her, then I'll lock you away, never having to worry about you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snaps out of it, she knows she doesn't have a chance, but she must make sure Nathan gets away. She draws a bow, notching an arrow in it, she aims it at him. \"I won't go down without a fight!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, just how I like it! Get her!\", and some of his minions attack her. She is an amazing shot, each arrow she fires hits them in a vital spot, and they vanish. She runs, leaps, shoots, and kicks, taking down dozens of these \"demons\". She reaches back to her quiver, but she has run out of arrows, she looses focus for a second, and that was all he needs, he grabs her by her neck and lifts her up. He is a very big man. \"Out of arrows? Too bad. Though you did put up an excellent fight!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to help her! But what can I do against that monster?\". He starts to think, putting his massive intellect to use, but comes up with nothing. Lifting his hand to scratch his head, he realizes he still has the rock. The rock he used to kill the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder. Could it possibly work?\". Now he was no wimp, as previously mentioned, he has studied how to fight and works out quite a bit. He was strong and smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at the warlord, slowly choking Willow. His back was partially to him, and none of his demons were in the way. In fact, they was completely focused on Willow. He takes his stance. \"Looks like those pitching lessons will pay off!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chunks the rock with all his might. It soars through the air with incredible speed. The warlord hears it. \"What?\", he says, looking in the direction of the strange noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM! The large rock hits him square in his exposed face, completely catching him off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock hits the ground, he just stands there as he loses his grip, releasing Willow. She collapses on the ground, clutching her throat and breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stammers for a bit, then falls backwars, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis army doesn't move. They stand there, then they all vanish. He had summoned them, and when he was knocked out, they had no way to stay there. Nathan rushes to Willow's side. \"Are you alright?\" Here, hold still. I know a way to make it easier to breathe. He starts to massage her neck, causing her to relax and stabilizes her breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets to her feet, \"I'm fine, thank you\". She looks at the warlord. \"You did it. You actually did it! You defeated him!\". He looks at him too. \"Yeah, but is he dead?\". Looking back to him. \"No, of course not. He did take the potion after all. You just knocked him out\". \"Ok, but we can't leave him. He is out cold. Now is the best time to capture him!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, let me think..... I know! She rummages through her pack and pulls out some rope. This is a special rope that seals magical abilities. I was planning on using it if I came across a dangerous monster. But, he'll do. We'll tie him up and take him to my village, which is close by. I'll make sure word get's out to the human town and they'll properly deal with him\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sounds like a plan. But, let me get this straight. I came to your world just hours ago to defeat a powerful tyrant that has been terrorizing your world by hitting him the head with a rock.....\". \"Um, I guess so. I don't think anyone could of guessed that would happen\". He sighs, \"whatever, let's just get him out of here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tie him up, lift him onto Willow's back, and head into the opposite forest towards her village.</span></div></div>",

He notices that only a few have clothes, just like in most of his research on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a crash, an older centaur had dropped a bowl. He saw what was on Willow's back. They are immediately swarmed. \"Willow, is that who I think it is?\", a voice says from the crowd. An amazing female centaur appears, as the centaurs in her way move. She has long blond hair and blue eyes. She has large breasts, a white horse body, and a blond tail. \"Why is the warlord unconscious and on your back?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets a proud look on her face as she tells her fellow centaurs what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome guards take the unconscious man into a hut and use a lot of those ropes on him. Making sure that he is unable to escape. He is cheered, praised, the centaurs, who normally do not deal with humans, are making him an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, after he has been thanked so many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are throwing a huge party. The centauress from before turned out to be their leader. Her name is Selvus. \"Nathan,again, I thank you. You have saved us all from him. I have already contacted the humans and they will pick him up tomorrow morning. But for now, we celebrate\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is sitting next to Selvus and Willow in a specially made chair. Willow turns to him, \"now what? You've already done what you came here to. Are you going to try to find a way back to your world?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stops, they look at him as he thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, eventually. But this is a whole new world! And I don't have to worry about dying! Why would I want to go back when I haven't even been here for a day? I will go home, but after quite some time\". And the party resumes in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's late, the party is over. Selvus approaches him one more time that night, \"about your lodgings, normally our kind avoids humans. But you are an exception, you are welcomed here anytime and we are even willing to let you live here. You are kind, strong, smart, brave, the list goes on, you are a rarity amongst humans\". He thanks her. \"You only have yourself to thank. But back to the topic at hand. Until your hut is built, If it is alright with Willow, you can stay with her\". They look at Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses for a moment. \"It would be an honor\". \"Then it's set. I bid you 2 goodnight\", and she heads to her hut. \"Let's go, I'll show you to my home\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pass the hut where the warlord was. \"Don't worry, a spell was placed over him, he will be out for days, even with his powers. And there is also that magic sealing rope on him, and around the hut. And multiple barriers around the hut, including underground, all very strong. He is not escaping\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enter her hut, it was decent sized, the 2 of them could definitely stay there. He still has his rock, he places it by the door. \"You still have that thing?\". \"Of course! It's a trophy now. The one thing that was able to defeat the all powerful warlord, was a rock. I am not getting rid of this\". She smiles, \"I see. Makes sense\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only has a large blanket. \"I'm sorry, but we don't use things like beds. We just cover ourselves\". \"It's fine. I don't need a blanked, it's warm enough\", and he lays down. But she doesn't let him. She gets up, walks over to him, and picks him up. \"What? What are you doing?\", he asks, a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say anything. You didn't just save the planet today, you also saved me. Just let me pay you back\". He doesn't say anything else. She lays back down, pulling the large cover over both of them as she embraces him.</span></div></div>",

Looking around again, the boy sees that everything became bigger than himself, as an acorn was taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's I that have shrunk. Oh boy!\" He corrects himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, Nathan re-explored his new environment, climbing up on a tree to see everything from better advantage point. It amazed the genius about the new perspective, but he was worried that he would remain like this permanently. A gust of wind sends a large leaf into him and grasping it by reflex, Nathan is sent flying into the sky. Holding on desperately, he soon becomes confused, as the leaf twirls around, making him dizzy and he lets go. Falling for a long time, he crashes into a bunch of branches and miracally grabs the last branch from the ground. Shaking off his dizziness, Nathan starts to pull himself up when he hears voices below him and checks it out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Below him were two people, one warrior and one wizard, near a campfire. Both were female, though it was harder to tell with the warrior unless you saw her massive boobs in front and were resting for a bit. The warrior was very muscular and would of stood at least nine feet tall, if Nathan were normal sized. Wearing light green cloth clothes and brown fur boots, she cooking up a lot of beans, her remaining eye watching the pot patiently, as her over eye was covered by an eye patch. Having her black tied up in a ponytail, her giant blue armor sat near her, along with a giant sword, big as herself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, the socreceress her was holding a black staff with a purple orb on top, framed with gold and was wearing purple everywhere. On her head sat a purple witch's hat and underneath it was straight, orange hair reaching the middle of her back. Her robes was a dress, that were cut up past her waist in the middle of the sides and purple heels were on her feet. While having DD breasts nearly exposed by her dress, the main attraction was her huge butt, each cheek the size of beach balls and rivaling the other woman's bust. Currently, she was holding onto her staff, bending over, while holding her stomach and looking back at her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann, do we have to have beans again?\" The magic user asks, both her bum and dress rippling as she farted, a groan uttered from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, Mary, it's beans again so suck it up and eat, or no food for you,\" the warrior, named Ann, says, as she pulls out plates for the both of them and starts putting the brown slop onto them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is the seventh day we had them and I don't think my stomach can handle it anymore!\" She moans, another fart exiting out of her booty, as her eyes nearly rolling all the way back from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just gas, Mary! Nothing to fear! Watch!\" Ann says, lifting her ass off the tree root and ripping a massive fart from her bottom, nearly dropping Nathan to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it makes you feel better, we'll get something else at the next town or when we rob a food merchant, but for now, let's just finish it, as it's the only thing we have,\" she adds, Mary slowly, but surely, nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave pain hits the magician and she groans, as the biggest fart of the day escapes from her asshole, lifting her dress up from the sheer force and shakes some of the nearby trees. Once she's finished, she joins her awe struck companion and takes her plate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice fart and no panties? You're on fire!\" Ann says, impressed by her associate's burst of flatulence and lack of underwear, making the other bandit blush red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Nathan, he fell from the branch because of the farting and landed in a mountain of beans, but whose beans was it?</span></span></div></div>",

Her spoon dips into the food and is brought up towards her mouth, you included. Risking being found was better than being eaten, so you scream as loud as you can, but sadly, you're too small and soon deposited into Ann's mouth. Avoiding the teeth crashing down, you trough through the bean mush towards her mouth, but her tongue lifts you and the food towards her throat. With a loud gulp, you're sent down to her stomach, pushed by her powerful throat muscles, and plunge into her stomach acids. Swimming towards the surface, you struggle until you exhaust yourself and pass out. A burp exits the Ann's mouth and she excuses herself, before finishing her food, though there was a peculiar taste to it, but dismissed as a spice clump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up much later, you see that you're in a clearing of a forest, though it's normal sized, and try to remember what has happened. Trying to get up, you see that you're tied up and finally notice that you're naked. Attempting to break free, you hear the sound of a woman grunting and something wet sputtering towards the ground, before a voice speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that our guest is finally awake,\" a woman says, you turning towards the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting, more like covering a big log, was a large woman, in more ways than one. Her breasts were as big basketballs and were resting on a wrecking ball of a belly. With her rump was covering the mentioned log, the woman was wearing a white dress with some blue cloth under her flabby arms and over her belly and breasts. Her shoulder length hair was slightly curly and had a shade of violet in it, as she got up with her white staff, a cross on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cleric?\" You thought to yourself, as another woman joins her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was heavily cloaked with a ragged, large, blackish green cloth, it was definitely a woman holding a bow. She was a small thing, as she would probably reach your hips if you stood up and a few strands of long, brown wavy hair appeared in front of her hidden face, before she pushed away. The two bandits from before approach the two, though the female warrior was much slower, not without reason. Her body was slightly jiggly; her breasts obviously much bigger than before, her butt having a bit of a sway in them, and the one that literally stuck out was her belly. Her gut resembled to one that held nine month old triplets and she was carrying it with sick across her face. Once all of them were there, they all turn to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave me this gut, so take responsibility for it!\" She shouts, taking a step forward towards you, before the cleric, assumed leader to you, stops her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, Ann! This guy isn't from here, so we need to figure out where he came from and his story. Only Other Worlders can come back from the dead here, regardless if they taken the revival potion or not,\" she explains, giving you new info about this world he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you explain your situation, Mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathan Fryer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing over the details of how you came here, you tell them almost everything, except for Willow and her village, plus the mysterious flower you found. Once you were done, they stare at you before Mary talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it doesn't explain why he shrunk or why he teleported near our camp, Parrmin!\" Mary says, the cleric, Parrmin, smiles, before explaining again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He revived near us because, I was here, yet we have never met before, so it screwed up his spawn point. As for the shrinking, I assume it was caused by external forces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw these, maybe they have some to do with the shrinking?\" The cloaked woman says, pulling out the same flowers you encountered before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never saw these flowers before, but Mary, make a potion from it and test it out! Meanwhile, Ann, I say it's been a while that you had a man,\" she said, Mary taking the flowers, while Ann is stumped before grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, if you say so! It's been a while since I got laid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing around, Ann unties the your binds and once the ropes slack, you get up to dust yourself. The smaller woman points her bow at you, arrow loaded and ready to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm stupid enough to run away when my chances are almost nil. Think again!\" You said, though the arrow is still at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not actually going to have sex with a virgin like me right off the bat, is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting you over her arm, Ann walks towards a tent, presumingly her own, and she laughs heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a catch! A virgin to fuck, a bigger booty and tits, and a meal that replenishes itself! Though you made me a bit fatter, it's a good price to pay for us! Brisky! Get the booze! We're celebrating tonight!\" She shouts, you clearly confused about the meal thing, and soon all of the bandits start their feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a month, since your capture and you were worn down mentally and physically. Raped on the first day by all of the female bandits, you were eaten again, by Mary, who reluctantly caved into her comrades' demands and used the new potion on you to shrink you down. With the new potion and a large of supply for the ingredients to make it, the women abused you with it. Doing ridiculous chores, you never had any time to rest and if you managed to screw up lightly, they would punish you for it. Whether they ate you, soft or hard, or from smothering you somewhere on their bodies to farting on your body (or face when you're normal sized), it was hell for you. Planning a escape was hard, but with the things they do to you motivated you. Parrmin was unusual, as she was the only one that didn't need to shrink you down to eat you, as she could do that already, explaining the reason why she was so big in the first place. Ann would physically attack you, but when feeling horny, she would use you to relieve her sexual frustrations on you, while Mary felt bad for you, but used you for a fart cushion, tiny or normal sized. Brisky was the only one that didn't bother with you, but you could always feel her eyes on you. In fact, you could have gotten a loving glaze from them, but it must have been just an illusion from your mind going back to your maids back on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, you're gathering water as usual, the bandit gang ready to move out to a new location, when...</span></span></div></div>",

Somehow he managed to reach for it, and as his hand made contact his consciousness faded into the surrounding shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of soft rainfall filled the air, it's melodic tune awoke Nathan's senses. The feeling of cold wind against his, chilled wet skin. The smell of rain and damp, thick woods. The vague taste of earth. Then he opened his eyes and gawked at the sight of the relic he had tried to steal only a heck of a lot bigger. As he reached out to touch the tree out of curiosity a voice startled him.<br>\r\n   \"I wouldn't recommend touching that. It could end your life.\"<br>\r\nYou turn to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I needed some practice doing second so this is how I'm practicing. Anyhow, back to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Turning you see a extremely tall girl, around double your own height, looking down on you. As you look at her some very obvious things pop out, she has a pair of boobs, huge, completely exposed boobs. One is big enough to where if you were to curl up beside it, you would still be only about half of its size, but somehow they manage to fit her frame without looking awkward or sagging. Then you look down further noticing she doesn't have legs, instead a huge snake tail appears from under her tattered, black leather skirt and disappears behind the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your body freezes from your primal instincts of fear, this was something you had grown accustom to over the years of being a thief, but this was a whole new breed of that fear. The kind that as of currently screamed, \"Run and don't look back!\", or, \"Either way your doomed, accept it.\", and your body refused to move. So it looked like you were going to fall victim to a creature that shouldn't exist. She began to slither towards you, allowing her free breasts to sway with her slithering motion. Soon your lifeless remains would be scattered, and your memory dissipate into nothingness... What a way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You close your eyes and wait for the inevitable. Feeling a large, but petite and soft push against your chest, knocking you onto the ground. You cringe as you feel something touch you, then relax as you realize it's soft and warm and big pillows-like things pressing against your torso. You sit there waiting for something to happen, after what seems like years, you decide to open your eyes to see what was happening. Slowly opening them you see a soft, beautiful, young looking face, with sparkling hazel eyes with little flecks of pale pink throughout the warm, comforting eyes. You can't help but stare, they almost seem like they are pulling your attention from every other delicate, and or enchanting features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a second your eyes wander from her eyes, to her plump, soft looking lips, then to her long, silky, bark colored hair. Lastly you stare down at your chest, which has a pair of pleasantly squishy, warm, soft boobs pressed onto it and most of your body. You could feel the blood rush to your cheeks from the sheer embarrassment, you try wiggling uncomfortably to escape the situation. Then when you feel your junk touch something foreign, and soft, you realize, your completely naked... Your out in the middle of some forest, with a absolutely stunning half girl, half snake laying on top of you, while she has no top on and you're completely naked, you can't tell if it's a good situation or a bad one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're so embarrassed that even if something else lewd happened you probably wouldn't get redder. Somehow the entire time his was happening not a single word was said, somehow. You begin to think of a way to say anything... you can't. Honestly, you kinda just want to disappear and escape from the embarrassment. Her expression changes to one of worry, then with a sweet, young sounding voice she asks. \"Where'd you go? Aw... And just when I thought I had made a human friend. Wait, when could humans disappear into thin air?...\"<br>\r\n  You cut in and say with a shaky voice. \"What are you talking about... I'm still under your... boobs.\" She feels around under her where you are and grabs something you wish she hadn't, your flaccid member, which quickly begins to harden from the warm, soft touch of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You try to slip out of her grip, ineffectively. After you give in to the mind numbing feeling of your tool being harassed by her soft hand. She just rubs it in her hand playfully as you gasp and murmur from pleasure. Soon the sensation is to much for you to handle and you feel your package beginning to throb almost painfully, then she stops. \"Your back! How'd you do that? Wait I remember something important... let me check something.\" She quickly flips you on your stomach, rubbing her boobs all over you, and checks for something at the base of your neck. \"Oh, I was right! You're a mimic!\" She flips you back over and slams you onto the wet earth, again rubbing her ginormous boobs all over you. She, and her boobs, are bouncing slightly. She looks at you with a cheerful smile on her face, showing her sparkling white teeth and the lethal looking pair of daggers she had for canines. Finally you get tired of her bouncing on you and ask. \"What the heck is a mimic? Last time I checked I was a human... And who the heck are you?\" She opens her mouth to speak and the flecks of pink in her eyes turn to a deep ocean blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looks in shock at the position that you were in the gets off you. Turning and facing the other direction, she says. \"Sorry, about that. I'm not exactly normal. If I hit my head to hard a built up emotion takes over my personality... And the only way I snap out is if you ask my name. By the way my name is Sylvia, pleased to meet you.\" You stand up and dust yourself off, then looking at your extremely teased equipment you realize something, it got a whole lot bigger... It had gone limp and was drooped down to almost your kneecap. Turning and covering it the best you could, you ask the question again. \"You were about to tell me what a mimic is and said I was one, what is that... Can you finish telling me what that was? Oh, and lastly my name's Nathan, I have no reason to lie to you.\" She turns and looks at you a bit weird at the last part, but says. \"Well a mimic is a human who somehow gains the ability to change their appearance at will, normally they are impossibly rare. But there are exceptions that can be one of a kind, I heard stories of one being able to transform given parts into beast they had encountered, or the story where one learned to mimic special abilities from anything and perfectly mimic it. Those are ones who had a morphed version of the mimics power. The personality might have been bluffing, but I should look. let me see the base of your neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn showing her the back of your neck, which she quickly gasps. \"Your a mimic, but that isn't a normal stigma... Yours is shaped like a human body. How strange. Maybe we could test out what yours is all about.\" You turn as she asks and you bonk your heads together, causing her to collapse onto the forest floor, with a very heavy, dull thud. She...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Then he notices shards of glass nearby, half buried by sand. Reaching down he picks some up, to find it's the remains of a glass ball, shattered into large pieces. There are dozens all around him... then he remembers the bright lights. Are these the remains of those lights in his room? What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is low in the sky and he thinks it's a little lower than when he first woke up. And deserts are cold at night! He's wearing Pajamas, not very warming! Struggling to his bare feet in the stark landscape he stares around in panic, starting to shiver, even though it isn't cold now. Fear is starting to seep into his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne direction seems the same as another here, though there is a large dune nearby. Maybe from there he can see over the other dunes. With luck there is shelter near here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a struggle to keep upright with sand shifting beneath his feet. Sand has got into his PJs and they itch like mad, but still he shivers in the heat, fearing what will happen at sundown. Every now and then he half heartedly shouts out to see if anyone can hear him, but there is no response. Maybe an hour later, the sun dipping close to the horizon, he crests the sandy ridge and stares over the top.</span></div></div>",

How do you keep stuff inside you? Oh, I'm only twenty Cycles old, so not that big. A couple of arms at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I guess, first things first. How do I get you out without hurting me or you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I thought you knew? If I eat something that I don't want to keep I just let it drop out.

Oh, maybe they call their race 'people'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My people call themselves Humans. I... can try to throw up but can you promise to be gentle coming out?

Um, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm really sorry about this. This might be tight for you. Hang on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking his finger down his throat took a couple of goes, then... *HURK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest was as expected, and the... girl? Inside him did manage to avoid thrashing as she came up... in a torrent! Water poured from Alex's lips, along with his last meal, what was left of it, but the water pooled on the ground and slowly formed a shape as poured... PULLED itself out of him! With a grunt he felt the last bit slosh out of his mouth and there below him was a girl... made of water, barely a foot tall! Blinking she stared up at Alex in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y.. y... your a Leng! That's not possible! And, such a big one!\" She paused, blinking. \"So, do you just get smarter when you get bigger? I've never heard of a Leng being able to talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know what a Leng is, but I'm human. We talk when we're young, though it takes a while for it make much sense. Maybe a third my height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that sounds smaller than any Leng I've seen. Most are about half your height, maybe a bit taller.\" Three foot tall, Alex translated to himself. \"But no Leng has ever talked! They are just... well, animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiles and reaches a hand down to the tiny... naked girl. He blushes as he realizes she seems a perfect, if tiny, replica of an adult woman... in every detail! She grasps a finger with both hands and pulls herself upright, apparently tired by her ordeal. Alex frowns as he sees bits of the Pizza he ate for dinner floating inside her! OK, Ick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm Slen'va.\" she says, peering up at Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex. Pleased to eat you... I mean meet you.\" He says. OK, Freudian slip! She actually giggled, if a little nervously.</span></div></div>",

Not sure the ratio off hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, 'female obviously' doesn't really cover it! It seemed from what Slen'va had said earlier that this one was a little small, maybe two and a half foot tall at a guess, but what a bombshell! Her long brown hair was a bit bedraggled, and there were some ingrained mud stains on her face, but otherwise she was stunning. Clean, smooth skin. large breasts (for her size). Hour-glass shape. Long legs. Perfect heart shaped butt. If Slen'va hadn't said they were animals Alex would be in love. She seemed to be washing herself and catching fish while nervously looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Slen'va were crouched behind some bushes, peeking out at the girl... er... creature.

A little angled, but still beautiful, despite it's scowl. Her long jet black hair was tied back in a pony tail with some sort of leather strap for at least a foot.

Sunlight warms the surface of the water which is void of animals, except for one guy lazily swimming about. He occasionally dives to the bottom, grabbing a seashell from the colorful coral and pale sand. He stays under for a good five minutes and is about to go to the surface for air, until he sees something sparkle out of the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Supriseingly fast, he swims to it and grabs it. Then before even checking what it is, he returns to the surface. Sucking in the air he inspects the item. A metallic, green-silver rock with strange markings all over it, except for a flat little indent. It seemed just the right size for a thumb, almost as if calling for a finger to be placed. He pressed a thumb into, nothing happened. Then he skipped to his pinky, again nothing. Begging to grow impatient he tried his ring finger and middle, still squat. He barely placed his index finger onto it, this time a intense surge of pain filled his intire body. He dropped the rock letting it sink to the bottom of the ocean, then swims quickly towards the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He makes it to the beach and crawls onto the sand, laughing hysterically. He flips onto his back, letting the damp sand stick to him and slightly cusion his tan back. He manages to stop laughing and gets comfortable. Breathing deeply a couple times and closes his eyes, drifting into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----Several hours later-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of ocean waves crashing against the shore, with a slight whistle from the wind fills The air. Feeling the sun's warmth bake me along with the beach. The damp sand feels cold underneath me... And under my head it's really soft and warm, kinda like a squishy pillow. Finally I open my eyes to be blinded, not by the sun, but by my best friend's glowing smile. The beautiful moment is ruined when she opens her mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Morn'in Sunshine! How much did ya miss me?\" Her happy tone signified something happened... It might not be good for me. Well, joke's on her for now. She doesn't know I have a clear view of her chest, which is barely covered by her bikini. Which in all honesty is more of a string with a scrap or two of cloth attached to it. Her long, reddish brown hair is being pushed around by the wind and I can't help but notice that her tanned skin looks good with it. My train of pretty... I mean, thought is interrupted by.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you're gonna be all purvey and stair at my chest, you can get off the lap pillow that I so humbly made!\" She whines teasingly with her girly voice, that is surprisingly cute. Feeling the embarrassment rush to my face only makes me blush more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In a rush to stop being embarrassed stand up and run towards the awaiting ocean. The feeling of the refreshing water flowing past my legs entices me to dive in, which I do. Bobbing on the surface I see my best friend standing waist deep in the water her arms crossed and a pout on her face. I call out to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Casey! Come on! I know you can do it. Your not all that bad of a swimmer, are you?\" Casey's eyes get a tiny glint of anger in them and she splashes around furiously. Almost as if saying yes, but not admitting defeat. After a while she just yells.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Con! You jerk! If only I didn't grow these things, I wouldn't be a bad swimmer!\" She gropes her boobs the entire time she's talking, causing the two mountains of flesh to almost flow out of her grasp. This tantrum she is having is almost too sexy for me to handle, I can feel my entire body burning from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I decide to be nice and swim up to help her. She's startled by this. Normally I would let her stew for a while until she asked for help, then help her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll help you out, remember the way we discused on how to swim?\" She nods and grabs onto my shoulders and starts kicking lightly at the surface, I swim using only my arms so I don't accidentally kick her. Somehow we still manage to swim somewhat fast and make it to the sand bar in about three minutes. We stop to take a break and catch our breath and she asks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why do you always help me? I know we're best friends and have been since like third grade, but even before then you just helped everyone. Even now, it's summer vacation and you spent an entire week doing community service alone.\" Giving some thought to what she said I realized for some reason I always have just helped people, I never thought of it as extra. I guess I don't think much, I just act. I turn and see she vanished, panicking I shove my face into the salty waters and open my eyes. It hurts, but I manage to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It almost seems like the water became darker and she's being dragged to the bottom of the sea. I swim towards her at a almost impossible speed. I notice something even more off the moon is suddenly out, just a second ago it was roughly noon. I reach her and she's flailing about, I barely can see a vine-like thing wrapped around her ankle I try pulling it off, it doesn't work. As if it was instinct I emediately sink my teeth into it. It releases and vanishes into the dark water. Casey immediately asends to the surface, but I hear a.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Help! Somebody! Help!\" This is impossible under the water, but turning towards the cries I see a girl with a fish tail for legs being pulled by the same thing. I swim towards her, hopeing I can save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I get to her, I immediately bite the chord. After a second I realize it didn't work. Looking up at her I expect a happy or surprised face, instead she's looking at me like she's seen a ghost. I just continue to tug and bit at the chord, until I get kinda pissed and chomp into it. It releases her, but instead of retracting it coils around my neck. The last thing I feel is my chest burning, then everything fades into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Casey is at the surface panicking, Con still hasn't surfaced. She sees a person come to the surface and swims towards them, hugging them tightly and sobbing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Con! Don't scare me like that again! I thought you drowned!\" She completely ignored the fact that it's nighttime now and she was hugging a girl, specifically a mermaid. The girl manages to get Casey off her and says.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who's Con? Was he that brave man who just saved me?\" Casey stares unable to compute what happened, then realizes that he still isn't here. Casey brushes up against her tail and screams.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What was that! Something touched my leg!\" The mermaid lifts her tail out of the water a second and points at it, sarcastically saying.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, do you mean this? It just happens to be my tail.\" Casey finally figures out her situation and faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The darkness clears into the interior of a dark cave, covered in brown, seemingly dead plants. Looking around, I realize that I'm underwater still and breathing... That's not normal. In the center of the cave is a glowing green blob attached to the brown stuff and across from me stuck to the wall, probably the same way I am, is a naked girl. She isn't human though, she has tentacles for legs. Wouldn't that make her a octomaid? Oh, whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The green blob shoots out a small thread of itself, which sticks into my skin. Liquid clearly flows down it and into me. After about a minute I begin to feel a tingling sensation throughout my body and my mind slowly going blank. Almost as if this thing was erasing my memories and changing my body somehow. Suddenly, everything shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The green blob gets crushed by a bolder and I manage to escape. Looking back I see the octogirl still stuck to the wall, turning back for a second I grab her hand and yank her off the wall. Then swim as fast as I possibly can, we manage to get out of the cave and it collapses. Bobbing on the surface, I can see is the beach a mile or two away. I begin swimming towards it, dragging the octogirl with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the beach Casey has just woke up and the mermaid is sitting quietly. Casey begins to freak out for a second when she sees the tail again, but calms down and asks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened to Con?\" The mermaid just stares for a second, then catches on to how she's talking about. She pauses for a moment, then speaks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He saved me from a Caleasto, then was captured by it. It's a parasitic monster that captures something then steals it's mind and body. They tend to make their host devour others being whole and there is no record of someone surviving. Well, not as themselves.\"<br>\r\nCasey just curls up and bursts into tears. The mermaid just looks at her, saying.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Be glad he didn't survive, or we would have to be his slaves.\" Casey stops bawling and backhands the mermaid, sending her slideing a couple feet backwards. Then Casey practically growls.<br>\r\n\"If you ever say anything about Con like that you ungrateful bitch, I will have mermaid sushi for dinner! He saved your life by forfeiting his and all you say is, I'm glad he's dead! What kind of twisted, sadistic sociopath are you?!?\" The mermaid blinks a couple times and recovers from the blow to the face. She inhales deeply and says.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I Marina, of the blue blooded mermaid family. Apologize for my insensitive comment and hope he survived.\" Just as she finished Con drags himself onto the shore and says.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Casey. If you can hear me help this girl.\" He goes limp and wakes up...</span></div></div>",

Anyway, Would you like to hear it.\" She sighs while fiddling with her lab coat a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure lily.\" Nate responds while spinning carelessly in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, Let's start. Icarus was the son of a genius architect, who built a great labyrinth for a king. Inside the labyrinth the king put his grandson, who was a minotaur. He expected the labyrinth to protect his grandson, who was a bloodthirsty beast. It didn't.  A hero infiltrated the labyrinth and slew the minotaur, which grieved and infuriated the king. Who took his anger out on the craftsman and his son, Icarus. The king exiled them to a island and ordered they be killed if they were to try to escape. So, Icarus and his father found a loophole to the fact that the king ruled the land and sea. They decided to fly away through the sky. The dad made wax wings for the both of them, though with the wings he gave two rules to Icarus. One, he must stick close to his father. And um... secondly, he cannot fly to high towards the sun or to low towards the sea. Soon, they flew away from the island. But the ability to fly began to give a since of freedom to Icarus that humans should not have. He soon became careless and began towards the sun. His wings began to melt and he began to fall. His father quickly noticed and attempted to save him before her hit the water, but he was to late and got his wings wet in the process and also crashed into the sea. His father washed up on a island, alive. However, Icarus wasn't so lucky. His father grieved for his son's loss, and eventually named the island after Icarus. Um... That's about it.\" Lily quickly turned and cracked her knuckles, then began typing at astonishing rate into the keyboard. Nate just stared with a pouty look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He quietly asks. \"If Icarus's dad mourned the loss of his son... Why did my dad give me to this program and fund it?\" Lily freezes in response to the question, then she turns and says. \"Nate. In all honesty your father cares more about himself and his stuff.\" The boy just sighs sadly onto the glass and sits silently in the solid white room, waiting for the next experiment to be done to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The silence continues until Lily finally decides to say. \"Nate, you are the only reason I'm still alive. Like I've told you before my family sold me to this company... The way it feels to know your family would abandon you is, unrelentingly depressing. I would have taken my own life long ago if I didn't have you with me. Seeing you every day makes me happy. To know even though you were also abandoned... What I'm trying to say is you always take life as it comes. You don't complain about it. You don't cry over it. You act like a normal everyday kid, granted you're trapped in a box and have numerous experiment done to you a day... How do you do it?\" She presses a small button and the one-way glass becomes two-way, then stares at him with conflicted and serious eyes. Nate just smiles at her and cheerfully says. \"Because, I know that you depend on me and I depend on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And with that tears well up Lily's eye's and she begins to cry like a baby. Nate just gets up and tapes on the glass, politely saying. \"Lily, come on, we still have to finish testing the experimental serum and the time machine.\" She stops, looks up and wipes her tears, then nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lily turns towards the command board and pulls a crimson red lever. A couple feet away in the room where Nate is, a strange, neon blue liquid in a vile rises out of the floor on a pedestal. Nate quickly picks it up and says, \"Bottoms up.\" Then he tips the bottle back chugging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nate quickly puts the empty vile back on the pedestal, which quickly sinks into the floor. Lily preps the next portion of the serum test on her keyboard, quietly saying. \"For a seventeen year old your a lot braver than me too.\" A door opens up and a blond beauty walks in, with a small briefcase in hand. She places the briefcase down in front of him and says. \"I am clone 66, I will be helping you in this experiment. The serum you just ingested was designed to give you the ability to edit your body and it's functions at will. Of course it will have it's limits, which is why I'm here.\" She opens the briefcase and pulls out a small egg shaped object, which looks like it's made of solid metal. \"This is a solid lead ball, on the inside is a pocket of ice. Your objective is to swallow this whole and digest the lead and only the lead, while neutralizing the metals poison, then cough up the ice in the middle PERFECTLY intact. Am I understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nate just replies. \"I'll try my best.\" He picks up the egg and realizes it's a lot bigger than previously thought. He gulps, then relaxes. After a second he presses the lead ball against his lips and it slowly begins to disappears into his mouth. The shape of the fist sized ball can be seen sliding down his throat and slowly into his stomach. After a second he spits the ball of ice onto the table and says. \"Will that be all?\" The woman nods and walks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And as soon as the door closes behind her Nate yells. \"Get the time machine ready, we don't have much time.\" Lily blinks in surprise, but listens to what he says. The Machine rises out of the ground and gears up, he walks over to the glass and begins to shakes. As he quakes his curled up fist slowly turns the same color as the lead ball he ate earlier. As soon as the his entire fist is metallic he smashes it into the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lily just stares in shock as Nate smashes the glass, then runs towards her. Alarms start blaring at almost painful pitches. Even with all the noise he calmly says. \"Okay make it go to a time where these people could never get to me, or you. Then force it to go in fifteen seconds.\" She asks. \"What are you doing?\" He says with a sarcastic voice. \"We're staying here to clean up the glass.\" Lily blinks as she realizes that he means they're escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as she finishes he picks her up and runs towards the machine and jumps into it.

Upon opening your eyes, with a slight jerk of surprise, you see a beauty of a woman. Her pale skin was strangely alluring, though after looking a bit closer it almost seems purple. You can barely see her face past her huge pair of unnaturally perky boobs, which are suspended by a strip of black material that was just enough to hide her nipples. Her face is almost so perfect it looks like one of the old photo-shopped, picture perfect, magazine models that your mom used to read about. Hot pink lips, high cheek bones, perfect skin, and eyes that faded from a midnight purple around the edge of the iris to a bright pink near the pupil. Her eyes... Almost seem like they're telling you to enjoy her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You slowly feel a warm, hazy feeling fill your head as you stare more and more into her eyes.

And finally you get to her almost exaggerated hips, plump butt, and smooth thighs. A thong of the same black material as her boob-strap covers her slit, barely. For a second you notice a bit of movement to your right and a confused mumble, which you ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman sitting on your lap just looks over and cheerfully says. \"Oh, look who finally decided to wake up.

Like you could ever compare to Lilith the Succubus! You are nothing more that a pathetic human girl! Who will shortly add to my beauty! Be thankful!\" Lilith suddenly turns her attention towards you and asks kindly. \"Is it okay if I dispose of your old girl, no. Used trash now?\" You simply nod and continue to ogle at the seductress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lilith simply grabs the blur by the feet and pulls them into her body.

As the neck and arms vanish, and you can hear crying. \"Nate! Please! It's Lily! I know you wouldn't agree to this! Snap out of it! Nate, please! Nate!

You see several holes in the comforter, just large enough for you to easily maneuver through. Suddenly, you heard the door open and see your 13 year-old sister walk in from her shower with towels around her. Quickly thinking, you jump into one of the holes you saw earlier, but then peeked out to see what was going on. You never saw a girl naked before, and even though Eva was still your sister, this might be your only chance. You watch as she takes off her towels. Her breasts were about average size for her age, but for you they were huge. You look at her firm ass and as she turned around and walked towards you, you admire her pussy, so big in comparison to you, you could probably live in there and she would notice...You then realize that Eva is about to sit down on her bed, and possibly on you! You know you are invincible, but that doesn't mean that there won't be any pain. You look up and see her ass, bigger than houses to you, come closer and closer. Then, your attention is drawn back to her pussy as it comes by and stops right in front of you. You look at it with awe. It was even bigger than you previously thought. You walk up to it and touched it as high as you could, the lowest part of her outer labia. You look up and see Eva rubbing her breasts. Realizing she is still sitting up, you find a grip on the small pubic hairs that have started to form, and not a moment too late, as Eva just lied down. You find yourself hugging the \"ground\" (her labia) and quickly make your way towards her vagina. All of your sister's self groping must have made her a bit horny, as her outer labia parted a bit and revealed her inner labia. You squeeze yourself between the canyons that are her outer labia, wanting to reach into your sister's virgin vagina. You finally find the hole and notice how slippy it is. You stick your arm in to feel the vaginal walls. They are nice and warm, almost beckoning you to jump right in. Then, you look up and see your sister's finger coming right at you. Did she feel you, or is she just fingering herself?</span></div></div>",

Well, that was because the closest thing I had ever seen to such a thing was the cities park. Those are no where close to the real thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can still hear cars and their horns blaring in the distance. There's still the occasional waft of sewage and gasoline that drifts through. It's pleasant and peaceful--when you compare it to the bustle and grind of the city of course. So, when my parents offered to send me to a Natural Reserve, I jumped at it. Little did I know, this trip was going to change my life forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My parents both worked jobs away from home. So, this was a new experience for them. They probably hadn't been around each other for more than a week since I started school... and I'm 17. They took the opportunity to get <i>reacquainted</i>, which I didn't really mind. I mean I hadn't seen them together since they happened have a small vacation given to them at the same time. I don't recall them ever leaving their room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anyway, I decided to let them enjoy their camping trip and take a hiking trail that took 3 days to traverse. I had packed basic necessities and a few luxuries. It turned out that I was going to spend a lot more time in the woods than I expected...</span></div></div>",

I decided to enjoy the sun set until it slipped behind the wooded horizon, then set up camp about ten feet off the road. My plans quickly changed after I saw a strange glow about 100 yards off the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I quickly traversed through the trees in an attempt to see what the faintly peach colored glow was. It was a orange-pink mushroom, about the size of my fist. It gave of a  soft glow that covered the surrounding area. I mindlessly reached for it and just as I made contact with the mushroom, there was a snap. As a large whole opened up, sending me fly face first into it. An peachy glow. Something large being forced down my throat upon my face making impact. Then darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I woke up at the bottom of the hole, all of my things undamaged, a ray of light pouring down into this root riddled hole. A strange feeling spreading throughout my body. Looking down at my hands they looked a bit more peachy colored, but I paid no mind to that. I was just glad nothing seemed broken. I quickly climbed my way out using the mangled roots and realized something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the trees in the area were at least 5 feet wider around. There wasn't nearly as much foliage. And all of the trees had vaguely bluish leaves. I pinched myself to make sure that I wasn't dreaming. It hurt. This wasn't a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I dust myself off, getting most of the dirt off. Then I...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
