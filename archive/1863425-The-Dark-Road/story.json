We are currently on board the Prime X3 which is a Government ship specially designed for warfare and meetings. \"The Overseer is taking no more questions please\" I say to them and they outright ignore me. \"Excuse me Sir, What are the Government's plans?, The Queen of the Wolfkin's has denied all of your requests\" says a reporter shoving his microphone infront of the Overseer who now looks annoyed. The Overseer has short black hair and wears a pair of black glasses along with a white lab coat. \"Centauri, Get this man away from me\" says the Overseer before I grab the reporters arm and I push against it the wrong way before it snaps and I then throw the reporter through a glass wall and he crashes through before crashing down onto the weapons controls. \"Nuclear launch, Activated\" says Caroline and I blink twice before sprinting across the room to the button. \"Cancel, I repeat, Cancel\" I say. \"Launch has already been activated\" says Caroline and I look at the Overseer. \"Where is it going?\" asks the Overseer and I walk over to the controls and I plug a cable from my wrist into it. \"It seems....Its going towards a city called Nashtonville\" I say and he shrugs. \"Eh, They will be fine, They have a forcefield\" says the Overseer and I look at the News crew who is in shock. \"What you all have seen here is off the record, If you dare speak of what has happened here today you will be executed on the charge of Terrorism\" says The Overseer to them before turning around and walking in the opposite direction down the hallway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nI open my eyes before I sit up in my bed and I let out a big yawn before itching my scalp and then standing up. My room has white walls and a white rugged floor. My room is pretty empty though. I have a closet along with a desk that has my computer and then my bed. My closet is white with a slight blue tint to it and my computer desk is made out of Huk wood which is a Dark blue wood. Huk is a Wolfkin word that means Blue. Wolfkin are Wolf like people that are one of the 4 main native species of Earth 2. They have similar bodies to humans but there feet are like paws, they have tails, they are covered in fur, they have claws and they have wolf like faces. They are a kind people but they have been at war with the Sakia for thousands of years. Sakia are....odd as people describe them. There nickname is The Lurkers because they are very sneaky. My bed is made out of Huk wood as well and I have a white mattress and a blue quilt. I am 17 years old and I live in the City of Nashtonville. I have short black hair and blue eyes. I have lifted weights every evening since I was 12 so I am in pretty good shape but I am not the kind of people to go and boast and show off the people. My father has taught me martial arts most of my life to defend myself and he has showed me how to shoot a pistol and rifle and also how to fight with swords. When ever I have asked him why he is teaching me he has always replied \"You will need it one day\". Today is me and my father's final city watch. City watch is where you sit out 10 miles from the city in a sniper tower to spot any attack from Flares. A Flare is a large 7 foot tall creature with burnt looking skin and orange fire looking eyes. They have armor like skin and are always extremely hot. The only place that you are safe from Flares completely would be the Wolfkin City that was built to defend against Flares and assaults from the Sakia. When the gates are closed its impossible for any other race to gain entry to the city. Flares are stupid and there only desire is to feast on humans, Sakia, Wolfkin and Zugot's. Flares have hives as you could call them. They capture humans, Kill them, Drag there corpse to the Hive and then throw it into a pile for the king Flare to eat. They don't have a language instead they just growl, snort and grumble at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk over to my dresser and I pull out my tan shirt before I put it on and then I grab my black jeans and my black belt before putting them on. My tan shirt has a logo on the front and back with swords and shields on it. I grab my dogtags off my desk that a Wolfkin boy made for me one time when I went to the Earth 2 Capital city of Phylious. The Dogtags have my first name on one and then my last name on the other. I close my dresser before walking over to my bedroom door and I open it before closing it. to my left is the hallway that leads to my fathers room that has a white rugged floor and white walls and to my right is the staircase that has a white wooden railing and white carpet on each step. I walk down the stairs to find my father watching a documentary on The Wolfkin. \"The Wolfkin have a very unique political system that is a mix between a Dictatorship and a Democracy, The Queen of the Wolfkin takes the people's idea's and opinions and usually listens to her people, The Queen however or king has the final say though....\" says the man on the TV who is standing at the main gates of the Wolfkin City. No human has been into the Wolfkin city since the Overseer of the Government of Earth spoke to the king at the time when Earth first found Earth 2. \"Good Morning\" says my father who is already all dressed and ready to go. \"Get a to-go pack and lets go\" says my Father and I nod before walking over to the black fridge and opening it. I grab myself a can of Arctic breeze which is a Soda pop beverage and then I grab myself a To-Go pack. To-Go packs are packets that you bash against the wall before you open it and suck out the pudding like liquid with a straw. I always like throwing them against the wall harder than you need to. I throw the silver pack up into the air before catching it again and I bend down with my wrist twisted before I throw the packet across the room and it smashes into the front door with a loud <i>BAM!</i>. \"Hey!!\" says my father looking back at me and I chuckle. My father has gained a fair amount of weight over the years but he is still pretty dam buff. My father told me that in his early days he was in a body building competition but he didn't come close to winning which made me laugh. He now has a big belly though that I use to punch when I was 8 for fun some times. My father has short black hair and a black goatee on his face. He is wearing a black jacket and a black shirt along with black jeans and worker boots. I walk over to the To-Go pack and I grab my Tennis shoes before tieing them on and then I rip open the To-Go pack and I then shove my straw into it before grabbing my black leather jacket and then my father opens the door. \"Lets go\" he says and I nod before we walk outside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nashtonville is the name of the city I live in. Its not that big of a city because it is a newer one but its kind of violent. Nashtonville is surrounded by a huge grassland that is surrounded by a huge forest. The only way in and out of Nashtonville is The Galactic Highway. The Galactic Highway was Earth 2 and Earth 1's biggest construction build in history. 8 lanes of highway on each side with a max speed limit of 350 MPH. The Galactic Highway is up in the air 100 feet through most of it unless you are entering a city. It stretches all across Earth 2 and leads to every city on Earth 2. The cost of The Galactic Highway was 14 Trillion Dollars and took 82 years to build and had a body count of 3,456 from unlucky workers who died during its construction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI live in the suburbs of Nashtonville in a large blue house. Our lawn is bright green and to our left is our car sitting in the parking space. Our car is a standard wheel car that is pretty dam beat up. It is a white sorry excuse of a sports car that drains Electricity from its battery like a son of a bitch. It has a few dents in the front from when I was first learning how to drive and we haven't bothered with getting them dented out. I take another sip of my To-Go pack before my father locks the door and we walk over to the car. I open up the door and I get in the passenger seat before my father gets in and closes his door before entering a code in on the steering wheel and the car turns on before my father switches gears to drive and we begin driving down the Road to get out of Nashtonville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god this is the last time I have to do this\" I say before cracking open my Arctic Breeze can. Arctic breeze is a Cola company that has a baby Harp seal wearing a Santa Claus hat for the mascot that is seen holding a can on the can. \"Well, The Mayor picks citizens every month to watch for Flares, Just be happy that we didn't get Nightwatch\" says my father and I smile before we exit Nashtonville and we begin driving down the dirt Road to a sniper tower about 10 miles away. The tower is armed with 2 pistols and a Rifle along with a button that is suppose to set off an Air Raid alarm to let the city know a Flare invasion is coming. Every city is given a Forcefield to defend itself from Flares and other problems that may arise but it takes a good minute for them to fully activate. The tower stands 25 feet in the air and allows you to get a great view of the Grassy fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and my father reach the tower after awhile and we park the car before getting out. The other car is gone meaning the Nightwatchers either did not show up at all or they ditched out early. \"Come on\" says my father before putting his flask in his jacket pocket and beginning to climb and I follow him up the latter. Earth 2 has 2 moons and the sun here is alot hotter than Earth 1's making Earth 2 really hot in the summer. We reach the top and find the weapons rack just as we left it the other day and my father puts his hand up before letting it drop with annoyance. \"look at that, The pricks didn't even show up\" says my father and I chuckle before walking up to the weapons rack and I grab myself a revolver. \"Alrighty then, Lets take a seat\" I say and my Father nods before we both take a seat in the chairs and my father turns on the Radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good 2 hours of sitting we see something light up in the sky. \"What the hell is that?\" I ask pointing to it and my father picks up the binoculars and looks at it before shrugging. \"I dunno, It looks like a rocket or something\" he says and I take the binoculars from him and I look at it. \"It looks like a Missile\" I say and my father looks at me before taking the binoculars and looking at it. \"It is a Missile....a Big one too....\" he says before we look at each other and we turn around before my father runs over to the button on the wall to warn the city but when he pushes it, it doesn't beep. \"Uh...\" I say before he hits it again and it doesn't work. \"Oh.....Shit\" says my father before we both look back at the Missile before it flies by us in a flash and my father blinks twice quickly. \"OH!!!...Son we gotta go!\" says My father taking the other revolver and the rifle with him before he begins climbing down the latter. \"What is it?\" I ask following him down the Latter. \"Its a bomb!, A BIG BIG Bomb\" says my father and I look back at Nashtonville before climbing down faster. \"What Kind of a Bomb?!\" I ask as he opens up the car door. \"A Uranian X24 Bomb, Made by the Earth 1 Government for clearing out forests, Its not as big as a Nuclear bomb but its big and its bad\" says my father before we both close our doors and my father begins driving the car in the opposite direction of Nashtonville.</span></div></div>",

I open the curtains to see a missile flying towards me. \"OH!!\" I shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nA very loud <i>BOOM!</i> is heard behind us and I look behind me to see a large mushroom cloud forming. \"What the fuck!?\" I say before I see something flying towards us. \"Dad!\" I manage to shout before I see its a refrigerator a minute to late. It crashes into our car and we begin spinning out of control. Our car goes to the left and slides before my father manages to regain control of it but not in enough time to stop from crashing into a man.</span></div></div>",

Outside we both walk to behind the car where we find a young Asian man with short red hair and green eyes. He is wearing a black jacket that goes to his ankles like a trench coat but his jacket has a hood and on his hip I can see a Katana there and a pistol lays on the ground beside him. He coughs up blood twice before he falls limp and lets out his last breath in a dieing sigh. \"oh....Shit\" I say staring at his body before I see my father looking at someone and I see he is looking at a girl about my age who has a few drops of blood on her face. She seems utterly shocked by the whole incident and she slowly looks up at the two of us. She wears the same kind of coat that the man did along with white skate shoes and on her hands she is wearing a pair of black fingerless gloves. She has short black hair and Ice blue eyes along with a pretty face. She is Caucasian in race and she stands about 5 feet 10 inches tall. \"Are you Ok?\" asks my father and she nods slowly. \"You....Saved me\" she says and me and my father look at each other before my father turns around and walks over to the guys body before ripping open the mans jacket and searching through all of his pockets till he finds a folded piece of paper and he brings it up before opening it and reading it. \"She...Is a Target of the Soul Catchers\" says my father pointing to her and I look at my father. \"Who the hell are The Soul Catchers?\" I ask and he thinks on how to explain it. \"The Soul Catchers are an Assassination Organization, You give them a target and they will kill them, They have been around since 1730\" says my father and I look at him confused. \"Says here that a man named Sarok Magiak put a hit out on her head, We just killed an Assassin\" says my father and look at the girl who is wiping the blood off her face with her sleeve. \"Lets move out on foot from here\" says my father looking at the smoke from Nashtonville in the far distance. \"Whats your name?\" asks my father looking at the girl. \"My name is Cinder\" she says.</span></div></div>",

The fortress isn't made out of Huk wood or any other kind of Earth 2 wood, Its Oak which is odd considering the fact that it costs 200$ a log. \"What is it?\" asks a man opening the wooden door. \"We require food and shelter, We wish to come in\" says my father and the man shrugs. \"Alright\" he says and Cinder and I look at each other before we walk into the Fortress. The ground is bare and just dirt and in the center is a bonfire. The back of the camp has a female Wolfkin tied up wearing a blue robe with a gold trim and gold designs all over it. \"Why is that Wolfkin tied up?\" asks Cinder Crossing her arms and the man turns around. He has short blond hair and tanned skin. He is wearing a pair of swimming shorts and nothing else. \"Oh Her? She's the Wolfkin Queen\" says The man and the three of us freeze. \"Uh....\" says my father before gesturing the 2 of us out of the Fortress but he stops us. \"hey hey hey!, Don't worry, The situation is under control\" he says before pointing to the fire and we hesitantly walk over and take a seat infront of it. There are atleast 30 other people in here and they all seem to be drunk and stupid, plus there is only one gun in the entire fortress. \"To save there lives and ours we need to free the queen\" says Cinder and I look at her. \"Your insane\" I say and she shakes her head. \"When I cause the distraction you free her\" she says and she isn't making any sense. \"What distraction?\" I ask and she rolls her eyes before my father gets up and gestures me to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us walk over to the Wolfkin Queen who openly growls and snarls at us with her ears back. \"Oh shut up your majesty were trying to help you\" whispers my father before somehow a giant wave of fire sprays across the camp and lights the walls on fire. \"Oh shit!\" says one of the drunk men before everyone in the fortress run to the walls to put the fire out. I untie the rope around her ankles and wrists and she stands up before looking at me and my father. \"You both will be rewarded greatly humans\" she says before running towards the gate and we follow her with Cinder beside us.</span></div></div>",

She is flipping over fallen logs and sliding down hills like a master which shows how fit her species really can be and to be honest....its very impressive. \"I am a citizen of Earth one, I am from Germany and I came here on a vacation\" she says and I look at her with confusion. \"Where are all the other members of your vacation party?\" I ask and she sighs. \"Well, The man you hit unloaded an entire clip of a sub machine gun on the crowd killing everyone but me since I hid behind a box\" she says and The Wolfkin Queen stops. \"Coward!\" she shouts at Cinder. \"You let your own people die when you could have gone down with them with Honor and Dignity?\" she asks approaching Cinder. If Cinder was a little kitten she would curl up into a little ball and lower her ears before making a cute meow to try to make up for something but instead she just looks a little sad. \"Hey, Were not like your race, Humanity has one goal and that is survival\" I say and she smirks. \"Shows Wolfkin Superiority to invaders like you, You come to our world, Pollute it like your shit hole of a planet, The only reason why it is like that is because your species doesn't follow anti technology like a religion and thats what you need to do, Wolfkin believe that guns, Bombs and cars cause nothing but grief and fear, and we are right.....I saw that bomb go off and I cried....Cried not because of the worthless humans that died there, But because of the damage that bomb caused to our land, This is our land, Our Earth and you are all SCUM for coming here and taking it over like land is a slave, Land is life and without land there is no life!\" she says angrily before turning around and my father walks up to her. \"Your Highness, I understand your views but we will have to discuss this later, Our main goal is getting you to safety\" says my Father and she nods. \"Yes of course, Forgive me for.....\" she says before trying to think of the words. \"Anger spasm?\" she asks and I shrug. \"I guess so\" I say.

IF THE ALARM SYSTEM WAS BROKEN WHY DID YOU RUN? THE TOWER YOU WERE IN WAS DESTROYED FROM THE FALLOUT AND SO WAS YOUR CAR BY THE LOOKS OF IT!\" yells Nashton before the riflemen aim there rifles at us. \"YOU WILL PAY HEAVILY FOR WHAT YOU DID!\" yells Nashton before My father grabs hold of my jacket and Cinders before he throws me and Cinder through the air towards the train tracks just in time to have us land inside of a Open cart. Me and Cinder both roll across the floor before I grab holding of the doors and I look at my father who is running with the Train with Nashton's soldiers shooting there rifles at him. \"FATHER!!\" I yell putting my hand out and his hand is inches from mine but it slowly begins to draw away. \"CATCH!!\" yells my father before throwing a cellphone from his pocket towards me and I just barely manage to catch it in my hands. \"The Password is Melissa!!\" yells my father before he collapses to the ground after blood explodes from his shin. \"Father!!\" I yell and Cinder grabs hold of me in time to pull me back into the Train car before bullets rip through the steel where my head was. Cinder and I both collapse backwards and we smash our backs against the rusty metal and I look at the door before walking over and closing it before sitting down on a crate. The car is a cargo car and it is full of all kinds of boxers full of who knows what. \"Marco....\" says Cinder fixing her hair so that her bangs aren't in her eye. \"He will be fine, Don't worry\" says Cinder and I sigh hoping she is right.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Its now night time and the two moons are shinning brightly in the sky lighting up the field infront of us. I close the train door again before walking over to Cinder who is sitting against a the wall with a black blanket over her since its getting cold. This car is full of boxes that are full of blankets, pillows and some drinks and snacks. We've helped ourselves to them because we intend to jump off the train a few minutes from the next town. I turn on the cellphone my father gave me and I type in the password <b><i>Melissa</i></b> before the screen changes to a picture of my father and a Woman with long black hair and wearing glasses. I recognize her as my mother who was murdered when I was 2 by someone. I open up the notebook and I see a note titled <b><i>Son Read This.</i></b> I click OK on the buttons on the phone before a message pops up from my Father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My Son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are reading this then Nashton has tried to kill us and you are now somewhere far away from Nashton. I have not been truthful with you all this time, Your mother was not killed by a Serial Killer...She was killed by an Assassin Organization called The Soul Catchers. I have not been truly truthful about more things. The Vinichi family has been assassins since the Renaissance era in Italy and across Europe. We were responsible for killing ancient tyrants and one of our family members even attempted to kill Adolf Hitler in the Second World War. We have been a shadow in history like The Soul Catchers but when the Vinichi family began they had no Knowledge of the Soul Catchers. It wasn't until World War 2 that we crossed paths with them. They were secret assassins that were hired by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi empire to assassinate the current president of the United States and the President of Russia. Of course they did not Succeed in killing them, Instead they faded, Faded well and disappeared to not be written down in the History books, They wanted to remain a shadow, An evil entity that lurked around at Night. It is unknown how there summoning works but those that wish to contact them must say the following chorus \"Do not deceive me, Oh please do not ever leave me, My Child my child how can this be, Your eyes are empty and your heart is black from death, Sweet Child baptize thyself in blood and the tears of your foes, Sweet child...Do not deceive me...My baby...do not ever leave me\". To perform this ritual you will need the following: Wolf Blood (Wolfkin will work), A Silver bullet, The hairs of a little girl, A diamond (Does not matter the cut), your own blood in a bowl, Light 6 candles in a circle around you and finally the blood of a Virgin painted on your face. The reason why I am telling you this son is because you are not ready to take on Nashton. The Soul Catchers may have been on the opposite side of every war we have been in but they have saved our organization twice in history. If you wish to find out more about our family there is an Old woman that lives in a house in a town called Raven's rock. Go and see her and she will give you what ever you wish. If you decide to contact The Soul Catchers be Warned son, They are not fully human...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is how the message ends. Just like that. I show it to Cinder who stares at it for a moment but then shrugs. \"That little ritual thing is kind of freaky\" she says and I nod before we both decide to pack it in for the Night and sleep.</span></div></div>",

I grab hold of a handle on the wall and I lean outside of the car to see the lights of a town coming up. Its still night time and the billions of stars are still glowing in the sky brightly. On Earth 2 you can see in the Night from the Light of the Moons that give everything a blue tint. its quite beautiful actually compared to Earth 1, On Earth 1 some people haven't even seen the stars or the moon, The pollution is so horrible in alot of places that the Ocean water is grey and mucky. Earth 1 Scientists say that if they do not solve the problem soon Earth 1 will die and all the citizens will have to flood to Earth 2....I hope they solve it, Getting the government slamming there business down everyone's throats here would drive me insane. \"Alright Cinder, Were gonna jump ship here\" I say and she nods before standing up. \"Alright so....How do we do this?\" she asks and I think. \"I don't know, How fast is this going?\" I ask and she thinks. \"40 miles an hour...ish\" she says and I think about it. \" There is a lake coming up, Its our safest bet\" I say before she picks up the rifle and Pistol and walks over to the door with me.</span></div></div>",

We are walking on a dirt path towards the lights of a town up ahead. On my left is a hill that is dense forest and on the right is the same along with the train tracks. \"Oh Come on, I said I was sorry\" I say and she looks at me sharply. \"Wegen dir bin ich jetzt nass und Einfrieren\" she says to me and I shrug not having a clue to what she is saying. \"So, Whats the plan?\" asks Cinder walking backwards infront of me with her arms crossed. \"Well, I got 70 Dollars, Hopefully this is a Earth 2 town that takes Dollars not Euro's\" I say and she smiles before pulling out her wallet and handing it to me and I open it up. Her wallet is black with The Eagle of Germany on the front of it in the Colors of Germany and inside of her wallet she has 3 different places to keep your credit and bank cards, her ID Number and in the cash slot I find 20 100 Euro bills. \"You carry....2000 Euro's with you on Earth 2.....Thats fucking insane\" I say and she giggles before I hand her back her wallet. \"You have an odd name, Why did your parents name you it? isn't Cinder, Zinder in German?\" I ask and she nods but smiles. \"When I was a year and a half old my father and mother had brought me, my brother and my sister to England on a business trip, One night at the fireplace a red hot Cinder shot from the fire and actually lit my hair on fire\" she says and I chuckle and she smiles. \"My father, Mother and my uncle Nigel panicked and poured a bowl of soup on my head to put the fire out, Since they hadn't named me yet they named me Cinder for that incident\" she says and I smile. \"Whats your last name?\" I ask and she smiles. \"My full name is Cinder M Drachen\" she says and I smile. \"Cool, Whats the M?\" I ask. \"Mika\" she replies before turning back around and continuing to walk.</span></div></div>",

Jag talar inte engelska\" He says and I sigh. \"Oh great.....\" I say before Cinder steps up infront of me to talk to him. \"Hallo, Sprichst du Deutsch?\" she asks and the man smiles and says something in German before the two of them begin talking in German. After a few minutes Cinder smiles and turns around. \"Raven's Rock is only about 160 miles North\" she says and I nod. \"Awesome, Now all we need to do is find a place to sleep\" I say and she nods. \"This is Jonas, He is Swedish and has invited us to stay in his Hotel tonight with 25% off\" says Cinder and I smile. \"Cool' I say before The man begins leading the two of us down the road. The man has short black hair and bright green eyes. He is wearing a white t-shirt and a pair of black shorts and a pair of Sandals. He leads us through the town and to a hotel that by the sounds of things also has a Nightclub because I can hear Rave Music. Inside I was right. The entire club is lighted up from floor to ceiling and hundreds of people and Even some Wolfkin are dancing on the Dance floors wearing glowsticks. Cinder pays for our Rooms and then leads me down to the bar and buys both of us a Drink. The bartender pulls out a green bottle and unscrews the cap before pouring out a green liquid into two shot glasses and he hands them to Cinder before she hands me one. \"What is it?\" I ask and she smiles. \"The Green Fairy\" she says before taking a drink and I shrug before drinking it. My entire throat burns and my eyes tingle from what ever this stuff is and I look at her. \"What the hell is this?\" I ask coughing a bit and she smiles. \"Its Called Absinthe, illegal in 10 different countries due to its....side effects....Think of it as a party warm up\" She says smiling and everything begins to turn a little green and weird but I feel good so it cant be all that bad.</span></div></div>",

Im Marika!\" she says and me and Cinder look at each other before I grab hold of her jacket and I force her against the wall. \"Who are you?!\" I ask before someone grabs me by the hair and slams me up against the wall and I look to see who it is and I see its a Cop. He wears a black shirt and a pair of black pants with a red strip down the sides. he has a Utility belt on along with a bullet proof vest and he has a police hat on his head and a pair of sunglasses. He has black skin and big muscles and looks to be about 35. \"Hey!, Kid! Didn't your parents teach you not to abuse woman!?\" he practically shouts in my face and I hide my pistol with my jacket. \"Yes Officer, But...This Wolfkin has been following us for atleast 2 days\" I say and he chuckles. \"Small town boy, Now scram before I arrest you for assault\" he says before practically throwing me down the side walk and me and Cinder begin walking away. \"Hi!, Im Marika!\" says Marika to the Officer and he smiles at her. \"Hello Marika, Have a nice day\" he says before she begins following us and when I turn around I see the Cop point with two of his fingers at his eyes and then pointing at me before walking away. \"Asshole\" I say.</span></div></div>",

Her kitchen has hard wood floors along with a stainless steel fridge, counter, washing machine and cupboards. The walls are wood and the rest of the house is similar. \"So Helga, How do you know my father?\" I ask and she smiles. She has long straight white hair and a wrinkled face but other than that she actually has quite large muscles. \"I am your aunt\" she says and I almost choke on my tea. \"Really?!?!\" I ask shocked and she nods. \"What was my mother like?, My father never talks about her\" I say and she takes another sip. \"Your mother was a kind woman but she was against your father being an assassin\" she says and I still can't believe my father was an assassin. \"So what? My father is a serial killer?\" I ask and she slams her fist down on the table so hard that Cinder's cup of tea flies up into the air a whole foot before spilling down and slowly moving across the table. \"We are not scum like them!\" says Helga firmly and I nod hoping she doesn't bash my head up and down on the counter or something. \"We never take contracts that involve the innocent, We only kill the scum of both Earths\" she says and I think a bit before she continues. \"The Soul Catchers are the ones that kill the Innocent, They kill criminals as well but they kill people who are innocent as well\" says Helga before there is a knock at the door. \"Could you get that for me?\" asks Helga and I nod before standing up and walking to the door and I open it to reveal Marika. \"Hi! Im Marika!\" she says her smile huge before she raises a pistol to my face. Everything seems to go in slow motion as I quickly duck down and she pulls the trigger before everything turns back to Normal and I shoot up with an uppercut to her snout and she collapses back dropping her pistol. I go to grab it but someone else throws a knife at my hand with the blade amazingly only missing me through the gap between my index and middle finger. I quickly turn around and I slam the door in time to have a knife slide off the door and inside before the door closes. \"Here!\" says Helga and I turn around in time to catch a Katana in its sheath and I pull out the Katana. It has a black handle and scabbard and the blade shines brightly. \"Wow...\" I say before a head sized hole explodes through the door from a shotgun inches from my head and I dive away from the door before it is kicked open and I get in a fighting stance with the Katana tightly in my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfront of me stands a man wearing a tight black suit that looks to be made out of leather or something. His head is wrapped up with a black cloth of some kind while the outfit he is wearing has a hood over his head covering his hair. His outfit looks like it would choke the hell out of you from how tight it looks and all over it are symbols drawn in red that look to be Japanese from all the shows I watch. He is wearing a pair of black boots and a pair of black gloves that go almost up to his elbow and have no fingers. On his waist he has a Scabbard with a Katana in it and all along his belt he has throwing stars and all other kinds of weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly draws his katana and spins around to cut my head off but I quickly block it but he kicks me in the chest knocking me back and I trip over a coffee table before collapsing onto the ground. When I look up I see him holding a black pistol and I spins to the left before aiming it at Helga and pulling the trigger and Helga's shotgun explodes at the trigger. He quickly throws the pistol at Cinder's face who was about to aim hers at him and it connects with her forehead causing blood to begin to drip down. Marika and another person who is female come into the house the other person human and wearing the same outfit as this guy both of them holding Katana's and they charge towards Cinder and Helga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odd thing about these 2 people is....They both have Wolf tails and claws on there fingers. I quickly shoot up onto my feet and I charge towards the man with a war cry but he quickly kicks up Helga's shotgun and then kicks it at me and out of instinct I catch it and I look up just in time to get a foot to the face causing me to crash down onto a couch. The man sprints towards me and raises his sword above his head before shouting something in Japanese as he brings it down. I roll out of the way just in time as the blade stabs itself into the couch cushion and I quickly grab a Lamp and throw it at him hitting him in the head and he falls back cursing in Japanese. I run towards him with my sword ready and I go to stab him but in a blink of an eye his foot meets my crotch and I collapse to my knee tears running from my eyes from the agony before I see a glint of light from his steel and I grab the couch pillow and bring it up just as his sword stabs through it making the blade only a quarter of an inch from my face. He quickly pulls back yanking the pillow out of my hand and he throws it across the room before running towards me and I reach to my belt before pulling out my pistol and I aim it at him before pulling the trigger sending a bullet into his chest and he falls back before I turn around and I see Helga holding a Knife to Marika's neck and the other assassin on the floor holding a bullet wound in her gut but showing no pain on her face and I look at my pistol. \"Why did I not use this before?\" I ask myself before I turn around and I point my pistol at the mans face who is standing up and he is not showing any pain in his eyes either. \"Wait....\" he says and I stare at him. \"Why?\" I ask and he throws over an envelope and I reach down to it without taking my eyes off him. \"Whats this?\" I ask. \"A contract\" he says before I begin reading it and its a Contract for Cinder. \"Who is this Sarok Magiak?\" I ask. \"The leader of the Criminal World\" says Marika and I turn around to face her for a second. \"Oh so your not extremely creepy and demented\" I say and she smiles in her creepy way and I look back at the guy. \"Alright sit down and explain all of this to me\" I say and he sits down on the couch before the other two sit down beside him and me, Cinder and Helga sit down on the other couch. \"Talk\" I say after picking up my fathers rifle and aiming it at them and they begin talking.</span></div></div>",

Give me your chocolate bar!\" he says and I sigh. He has bushy orange hair and brown eyes and he is wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. \"Alright Alfred, Here\" I say with a smile handing him the chocolate bar and he takes it from my hands. Alfred is an over weight boy that has a pair of whore parents. His mother is literally a slut and his father beats him, He is 9 and I am 8. \"Good\" he says before beginning to eat it quickly and within no time he burps and I laugh. \"Whats so funny?!\" he asks and I smile. \"Alfred, Today is a great day boy\" I say and he shoves me against the fence again....For the last time. \"Why is that?\" he asks and I smile. \"You just consumed a chocolate bar that contains enough Letix-35X2 to kill 18 elephants, Now, within a few moments you will feel a numb cold feeling throughout your body which will soon be followed by the feeling of a White hot sledge hammer being shoved down your esophagus, This will last a good 10 seconds before you will loose control of your nerves causing you to twitch around on the ground like a fish out of water, Afterwards it will feel as if your spine is exploding and then this will end in a series of horrible seizures and strokes, Sadly this wont be over yet, If there is even a function left of your brain, It will explode in a chemical reaction which finally leads to your demise\" I say and I look at my watch before I see him looking funny at his body before he collapses over onto the ground screaming as blood shoots out of his mouth all over the side walk and I smile before he begins twitching all over the place before letting out one final scream and then falling stiff as foam begins leaking from his mouth. \"Letix-35X2, 700x more deadly than Cyanide and the 8th worst way to die\" I say before his ears explode with blood gushing out of them and his eyes leak blood from the cracks. \"Goodbye Albert\" I say before turning around and I see my Father Sarok standing there. \"Shade, What did I say to you about killing your enemies in broad daylight?\" asks my father. My father has short black spiked hair and pale skin along with red eyes, He wears a black robe with a green trim on it and he stands 6 feet tall. \"Sorry Dad\" I say and he pats my head. \"Its alright son, Now, Lets go and butcher this boys parents shall we?\" he asks and I get excited. \"Oh Boy!, Can use a drill press on one of there heads?!?\" I ask and he smiles and nods. \"Alright\" he says before we begin walking down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly run backwards and kick Albert in the side of the head before running back to my father to go kill some people.</span></div></div>",

The Azk-24 is a black and white camouflage assault rifle that is based off of the Ak-47 from the 20th century. It looks similar to its ancestor but it is much more accurate and has more power to it. On the top of it, it has a plasmatic scope and under the barrel it has a plasma grenade launcher for extra damage. \"That there is your fathers as well, It has plasma bullets so be careful with it!\" says Helga and I nod before aiming with it and Helga hands Cinder a silver pistol and she looks at it before looking at Helga. \"Trust me, You'll need it\" she says before she walks deeper into the trap door  and soon returns with a 4 foot long machine gun that I would expect to be on a helicopter. Its black and has lots of glowing red lines all over it along with a silver barrel and it looks to weigh atleast 30 pounds. \"Get outside!\" says Helga and we run outside to see the Cars only about 30 seconds from us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga puts the machine gun ontop of the railing before taking aim and she begins firing. The gun does not shoot as fast as a minigun do to the fact that it only has one barrel but it is shooting pretty dam fast. Each time a bullet fires it feels like my ears are going to explode but they don't thankfully. 3 of the cars crash into tree's do to the fact that the driver is dead but the other cars aren't being the bitch. The Windshield seems to have a forcefield on the rest of them and they drive faster. \"They aren't going to stop\" says Helga before rushing me and Cinder inside the house just in the nick of time because the first car crashes through the deck ripping most of it apart but oddly the car comes out the other end OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other cars do the same completely destroying the deck before the doors open and out walk people dressed in black trench coats. \"Come out come out!\" shouts one of the men who wears a black balaclava before I quickly whip myself around the corner catching them off guard before I begin shooting. The man that wanted us to come out got it right up the ass. His body jerks left and right from the bullets I shoot into him. My ears ring loudly as the others begin firing all of there bullets missing due to the fact that they are not aiming and are running behind cover. The man I am shooting is being ripped to shreds with the dirt on the ground turning a horrible crimson color from his blood. I empty the entire clip into him and he collapses forward hitting the ground like a bag of bricks. I dive behind cover just as they begin shooting at me and bullets begin to fly everywhere. I pop around the corner when they run out of bullets and I tail aim before pulling the trigger to find that its empty. \"FUCK!\" I say before switching back into cover remembering that I forgot to reload. I grab a clip off the ground and I eject the one currently in my assault rifle before slamming the clip into it and pulling a small lever forward and then backwards again before they begin firing again. \"If I don't fucking Switch around they are...\" I begin before a guy jumps to my left to shoot me and I flinch before a bullet finds its way between his eyes and I turn to my left to see Marika behind cover as well holding a black pistol and she smiles in her insane way again and I smile. \"Thanks!\" I shout over the bullets and she nods before I stand up in cover and I sprint outside along the ruined deck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are about 15 feet infront of me behind the cars but right now have there rifles propped up on the roofs and shooting at me. I slide across the ruined floorboards behind a thick wooden post and they begin shooting at me again. I find myself breathing heavily and they turn there fire elsewhere probably to Marika or someone else. I turn snap around the cover and I take aim at a man with short brown hair and a long beard and I pull the trigger and a quarter of his head rips off before he collapses back and I hold down the trigger sawing down atleast 3 other targets. The rest of them duck behind the cars again and I jump down onto the ground before sliding across the dirt. I crouch behind a steel table turned over and I look at the butt of my assault rifle which tells me my current rounds. 7 bullets. I got another clip in my back pocket and I still got my revolver just in case so I am doing good. \"HEY BOY!!\" yells a mans voice from behind the cars and I don't even risk looking over. \"Why don't you just give us the girl and we will leave you alone!\" he shouts and I chuckle. \"Whats wrong? Scared that a teenager is going to blow your brains out or something?!?!\" I ask and I hear footsteps coming from my left. I snap around the corner with my assault rifle and I smash the butt of my rifle into a woman with long brown hairs face flattening her nose. She collapses back onto the ground and I quickly aim my rifle before pulling the trigger sending a fresh bullet into her eye and I duck back behind cover. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Dammit</font>, What makes you think you can beat us?!\" he asks and I chuckle loud enough so that they can hear before I switch my rifle to the grenade launcher and I stand up before aiming it at them and I see them all standing there and they all stare. \"THIS DOES!!\" I yell before pulling the trigger and one of the cars explodes in a loud giant explosion so powerful that it sends them all flying back and the car flies into the air 7 feet and crashes onto one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sprint across the yard and I begin to fire all of my clip into them one at a time. My clip runs out and I am far from cover so I drop my gun and I whip out my revolver like a cowboy and I pull the trigger sending a bullet into one of there necks and I turn around hearing one of them before pulling the trigger sending one through his chest and he drops. \"DIE!!\" a guy screams after putting his pistol to my head before I hear a loud <b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BANG!!</font></b> about 2 feet away and I turn around to see Helga holding a Diablo-X5 shotgun. The Diablo-X5 shotgun is a black shotgun with 3 barrels together in a triangle shape. They have the ability to blow 4 people in half with one shot and Helga just blew away this poor sucker which is now a bloodied mess of fucked up limbs and organs. \"Thanks\" I say and she nods. \"Michael Trained you well\" she says before we see a whole line up of other cars driving towards us. \"We can't fight that much more, Lets go get Cinder\" says Helga and I nod before we sprint into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Cinder's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Im warning you\" I say to 2 men who are walking towards me. One of them has short brown hair and green eyes and a bushy beard. The other man has blood red snake eyes and has black scales covering his skin. He has no hair and 2 transparent fangs stick out of his mouth and behind him he has a scale covered tail and a  black metallic device on the end of it with a Laser blade on the end of it. \"Your not going to use that, We both know it\" says the man with the beard referring to my pistol I am holding. \"Yeah?\" I ask aiming it at him and he smiles before proceeding and I pull the trigger. He freezes and looks down at the bleeding hole in his chest before I send another bullet through his head but the Snake guy reaches me and tackles me down to the floor where he forces my hands and lays down and keeps his face close to mine. \"Hehehe, Little girl thinks sssshe can sssshoot Venomousss, hehehe\" he chuckles his voice like an evil whisper similar to a Snakes voice on a cartoon. \"Are you a Virgin Girly?\" he asks in an innocent tone and I try fighting against him before he digs his claws on his fingers into my wrist and I grit my teeth. \"Well then, We will have to find out if Girly doesssn't want to anssswer Venomousss\" he says before someone grabs his shoulder and he turns around to see Helga before Marco smashes the butt of his assault rifle into his face causing him to fall back hissing and holding his face. Marco helps me up and we begin running out of the house and we find Night, Midnight and Marika waiting. \"WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!?!\" demands Marco not stopping and still holding my wrist. \"We were killing the ones who were sneaking up\" Replies Night before we all begin running into the forest.</span></div></div>",

The missile that was launched at us was shot by an Earth 1 Ship and only Earth one had this kind of weaponry my people.

The servant is wearing a suit and tie and he has short blond hair and red eyes. Red eyes became a new eye color in the 25th century from Radioactive mutations. \"Is that everything Mayor?\" he asks and I shake my head. \"Please pour me some orange juice\" I say before he fetches a bottle of homemade orange juice and pours me a glass before putting it down and I nod for him to be excused. Shuri fish is a giant fish caught by Wolfkin. It is extremely toxic if not cut right and it is easy to over cook. Wolfkin are the only ones who know how to cut it properly and they have never told Humans or Sakia how to do it, What it looks like alive is it has blackish blue scales all over its body, Its a very clean fish and supplies large amounts of energy. Shuri have sharp teeth and thick ugly yellow eyes and a fat body and usually weigh 40 to 70 pounds. I pick up my knife and fork and I stab the fork into the fish before cutting off a piece of it and I eat it. I chew it before swallowing and it tastes great. The reason why I am eating this fish is due to my small victory over this small town we just invaded in a rainstorm last Night. \"Fath.....\" begins my son walking into the room but I put my hand up to stop him as I finish chewing. \"Yes?\" I ask after swallowing. \"The Earth 1 government has sent this peace treaty\" he says handing it to me and I look it over before writing in big letters \"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><i>UP YOURS</i></font>\". \"There we go, Send that back to them will you my boy?\" I ask and he nods before walking out of the room. </span></div></div>",

Shade wears a pair of black jeans and wears a black t-shirt and a black jacket. He looks like a little vampire sometimes. \"That does sound fun....\" says Vicky before they both walk towards the door. \"Father we are going out\" says Vicky and I wave my hand indicating my OK. \"Sssssarok!\" says Venomous one of my spies and I turn around to look at him. \"Yes Venomous?\" I ask to see him limping towards me. \"You know that Girl you put a hit on? Sssshe hassss a boy with her that isssss Michael Vinichi'sssss Ssssson!\" he says and I smile. \"Oh!, What a lovely turn of events!\" I say standing up and Venomous stops 2 feet infront of me. I grab a bottle of scotch out of a bucket of ice and I unscrew the cap before pouring it into a glass and I pour some of it into it before handing it to Venomous who takes a drink of it and then sits down in the black chair infront of me and I sit back down on the couch. \"Thankssss\" he says and I nod before taking a swig of the scotch. \"Alrighty, Your my lead spy and because of that, I want answers\" I say and he nods. \"Cinder is traveling with Marco and Helga Vinichi along with 3 Ssssoul Catcher asssssassssins\" he says and I think about it. \"Alright, chances of me going out into the field are....\" I say and he answers. \"They will probably ssshoot you firssst\" he says and I smile. \"Alright, Do you play pool?\" I ask and he nods before I gesture to my game room. \"Your gonna spend the next day or two here before you go out into the field, Lets play pool, Every mistake forces you to drink alright\" I say and he nods before he stands up letting out a hiss from a bit of pain. \"Did you get that checked?\" I ask and he nods. \"Morphix will kick in, in about 5 minutessss\" he says. Morphix is like Morphine except its alot more effective, You could grind up someones Nerves while they are on Morphix and they wouldn't feel it. I grab the Scotch and the two of us go to play some pool.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nThe 6 of us are traveling down the highway road that looks to have been barely used by people, Most likely due to the fact that this part of Earth 2 is pretty dead. Ahead of us is The Galactic Highway rising up 100 feet. \"This Highway was such a waste\" says Helga as we begin climbing up it and Cinder shakes her head. \"We built it for easy transportation\" she says and Helga disagree's. \"Bah!, My Father died working on this highway, He was burned alive by Boiling hot asphalt, He died in less that 20 seconds\" she says and Cinder keeps silent after that. \"Sorry\" says Cinder and Helga pats her on the back. \"its alright Cinder\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nashtonville Soldier's point of view).<br>\r\nI turn around the corner on the highway and I begin driving up towards The Galactic Highway to see 6 people walking up it. I roll down my window before grabbing my sub machine gun off of the seat and I aim it out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nI hear a car speeding towards us and I pull out my pistol before turning around and again for some reason everything turns in slow motion. The truck only seems to be going an inch a second and I can actually see the tires moving slowly. I aim my pistol at the mans head and I pull the trigger before time goes back to normal. The truck speeds past us with a sub machine gun hitting the ground and the truck quickly slows down to a stop ahead of us. \"Wow!\" says Cinder looking at me and then the truck and I smile before walking over to the sub machine gun and I pick it up. The sub machine gun is called a Nakshi, Built in Japan and used for special forces in the Police force. It is widely used in both earth 1 and Earth 2 due to its accuracy and the fact that it is small and very light. I snap the Butt of the gun up so I can hold it to my shoulder and I take aim with it. \"Sights a bit off\" I say and Midnight walks up to me with a small device and she gestures me to hand her the gun and I do. She takes aim with it before taking the pliers like tool and adjusting the iron scope before taking aim again. \"Better\" she says before handing it back to me and I aim it to find it in perfect accuracy now. \"Danke\" I say copying Cinder who smiles and Midnight nods before pointing to the truck. \"Cinder, Go see if that bastard is dead\" she directs and Cinder nods before walking over to the truck and I walk with her in case she needs help. I look back at Night and Midnight who begin talking with Marika about something in what sounds like Wolfkin but I am not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder opens the truck door to have the mans dead body collapse onto the pavement which causes me and cinder to gawk at for a second before Cinder kicks him. \"Asshole\" she says and I chuckle before climbing up into the truck. The interior is black and so is the paint on the outside. The windshields are clear and there are 2 rows of 3 seats along with the driver and passenger seat and I gesture Cinder to get in the other door so she walks around and opens the door and climbs in. I see a computerized planner sitting on the dash and I grab it before touching the screen to turn it on and I scroll through till I click on <i>Vinichi Execution</i>. I read through it and it says that my Father is supposed to be publicly executed in the next city 60 miles away in the next town at 3:30 pm. I look at the cars clock before seeing the time say 2:56 and I stare it it before it flicks to 2:57. \"Fuck!, Get in!!\" I yell to everyone before they all run over to us. \"whats the prob....\" begins Night. \"GET IN!\" I say and he does and the second everyone climbs in I floor the gas and we begin driving down the highway.</span></div></div>",

I look up at the balcony at Albert Nashton standing there with a smile on his face. This is what he has wanted since I moved to Nashtonville, Knowing that I had the ability to bring him down. \"Not Guilty, I am simply a man trying to protect his son\" I say and I look up at the noose around my neck. This entire village is standing in front of me and I am standing on a stage that stands 10 feet into the air to make sure that my neck snaps. I look down the road ahead of me and I see a black Nashtonville truck speeding towards the town, Probably not wanting to miss my execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Truck gets closer and closer and now I know its probably wanting to smash into me when I drop. The executioner walks over to the lever and Nashtonville puts his hand up before dropping it and I drop. I close my eyes expecting to meet death but instead I smash down into something and someone grabs hold of me and holds onto me. \"HOLD ON!!!\" yells my Son and I open my eyes to see Marco holding my Katana and my shirt. \"MARCO?!?!\" I ask shocked and he smiles before helping me up more onto the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mayor Nashton's point of view).<br>\r\n\"NO FUCKING WAY!!!\" I yell shooting up from my chair.</span></div></div>",

The Deutsch Milit\u00e4r is The Earth 1 Army of Germany. Germany is fighting right now for independence from the government but the Government does not want that due to the fact that 75% of Robots and Vehicles come from Germany. Germany is highly respected among the countries of Earth because they have won every war in the past 300 years but they are heavily hated in European countries now. While I was in Italy 2 months ago 2 men walked up to me and began Goose stepping with there arms up copying world war 2. Germany today uses the Goose step along with 3 other countries but our salute with your right hand in a fist across your chest to your left shoulder (Othinox: Note to everyone. The Goosestep did not originate in World war 2, It actually originated long before Nazi Germany). \"Well This explains alot then\" says Michael and we all look at him except Helga who is driving. \"Sarok Magiak could have demanded the formula's for the Nuclear bombs but your father refused so now Sarok put a hit out on you hoping to force his hand in giving him the codes\" says Michael and Marco speaks up. \"Why doesn't the government do something about it?\" he asks and I answer. \"Because they don't give a shit about anyone but themselves\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Oth: Andreas is also the name of Her older brother.

The part closest to us has wires blowing in the wind and pieces of metal falling of of it every few minutes. The metal and Asphalt cement looks as if King Kong's fist smashed down ontop of it. Below what use to be a bridge is a 1,250 foot drop into a deadly domain for brutal boulders and other rocks. \"What now?\" asks Cinder leaning over the edge slightly for a second. \"Im thinking this isn't an accident\" says my father and I turn around. \"Huh?\" I ask curiously. \"Earth 1 is probably trying to slow down Nashtonville, What better way than this?\" he asks giving a gesture with his open palm pointing at the huge gaping diabolical trench infront of us. \"Well....How do we get across?\" I ask looking at it and my father walks over to the edge and looks down before examining it more. \"Only way I see us getting by this is going down the mountain and going around, The gap is atleast 40 feet\" he says and I get an idea. \"What if we made a grapple or something and then threw it over and climbed across the rope?\" I suggest only to have it turned down in a second. \"To dangerous\" says my father and I give a sigh of frustration. \"Well father, I don't see any other way here, Nashtonville will be on our ass in less than 10 minutes\" I say and my father thinks it through. \"Your right, They will be up here in a few minutes\" he says before running back to the truck and soon returning with a rope. \"Measure this out please\" he says handing it to Cinder and she hands it back. \"Im Metric\" she says and he sighs before throwing it to me and I begin measuring it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reaches a total of 45 feet and 5 inches and when i tell my father he grabs the end of the rope and points to Midnight. \"Hey, Assassin, Can I have 2 shuriken?\" he asks before she hands him two black colored shurikens and he begins tieing them onto the rope, struggling with each one due to the very small size of them. He eventually gets the two of them on before tieing the other end of the rope to the truck's bumper and then handling it to Cinder. \"Here, You were in the army, they had to have taught you how to throw a rope\" he says and she grabs the rope about 3 feet from the edge before she begins spinning it in a vertical loop. The rope gets quicker and then she releases it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rope soars across the gap and the shurikens catch tightly into a ditch in the Asphalt. \"Wow, Im surprised that worked\" says Cinder before my father looks at it. \"um....hmm..\" he says because we will have to climb our way underneath the rope below the two broken parts of the bridge and then lift ourselves up onto the other side. \"Alright....Who wants to go firs...\" begins my father before Marika dives off the edge grabbing the rope and then quickly one hand after another she makes her way across the gap and then she lifts herself up. \"Oh...Alright then, Cinder, your next\" he says before Cinder gets down sitting on the edge before grabbing the rope and making her way across the rope not as fast as Marika but still pretty fast. One person after another makes there way across the rope with Helga almost falling twice her time over. \"Alright son, Just you and me left\" he says before we both hear engines coming around the corner and we turn around to see Nashtonville military trucks driving towards us. \"Crap, Were gonna have to double up\" he says before grabbing the rope which is now held by everyone on the other side. \"Alright, Hold tight\" he says and I grab the rope infront of him near the edge before he cuts the rope behind us. \"This is gonna hurt\" he says before running towards the edge of the cliff. \"I hope you don't kill us!\" I say as I begin running before we both jump off the cliff in sync and the rope tightens causing us to swing full speed towards the cliff. \"Shit!\" I manage to say before my left shoulder smashes into the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunt with pain but I hold on tight. I would expect the Nashtonville soldiers to stop at the edge like we did but its either that they are blind or they misjudge the length because they just fly off the edge full speed. \"OH!!!\" I scream in shock as the truck barely misses me and my father and crashes into the cliff feet beneath us. Glass shatters everywhere before the second truck smashes into its buddy and they both in complete silence begin plummeting towards the bottom. I cant help but stare as they fall far down towards the bottom soon becoming little dots. When they hit, They hit because an ear shattering explosion erupts from the two and pieces of them fly up towards us but don't come anywhere near us. \"Climb!\" says my father and I snap myself out of my gaze before beginning to climb up to the top.</span></div></div>",

Ever gotten something like deodorant spray in your eyes? You know how it burns? multiply that pain by atleast a billion times and you got about a quarter of that pain. I collapse to my knee's screaming in agony as my eyes feel as though they have been stabbed with a red hot needle and my friends are all doing the same by the coughing and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear what sounds like a Helicopter in the air and I open my burning eyes to see atleast 15 people dressed in black military gear and wearing gasmasks. They charge towards us and I manage to rise to my feet in time to have a plasma rifle barrel put inches infront of my face. \"GET DOWN ON THE FUCKING GROUND!!!\" yells the soldier and I put my hands up before he smashes his barrel into my nose and I collapse back onto the ground before he slams his foot down onto my neck choking me and I try gasping for air. \"GET HER TO THE CHOPPER!\" yells the soldier to another Soldier who is carrying Cinder before 2 other soldiers grab hold of my arms and the other soldier takes his foot off. I would try fighting back but I can't even breath from what ever the fuck this stuff is in the air right now. They drag me towards a chopper that is on the ground with its rotor blades still spinning loudly and when we get close enough I barely manage to see the Symbol for Earth one in bright blue on the side. \"Hello, Karism\" says a man standing in the chopper wearing a black trench coat and a gasmask. He hs white skin and he speaks with a german accent. \"I will enjoy seeing your execution for kidnapping my sister\" he says before giving a signal to the soldiers and they continue to bring me into the chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Cinder's point of view).<br>\r\n\"GAH!!...<i>Gasp!</i> MY EYES!!\" I scream before soldiers run up to me and one of them sprays some kind of blue spray all over my face that instantly takes the pain away and then they hand me a gasmask and I put it on and begin gasping in fresh oxygen. \"Your safe Cinder\" says my brothers voice and I look up at him. \"Andreas?\" I ask surprised.</span></div></div>",

They have tooken all of my clothing except my boxers and I find this to be bull shit. I hear a door open and close before I hear someone walking towards me before a man not much older than me walks into the light. he is wearing a black military uniform with the flag of Germany on the left side of his uniform along with a few medals. he wears a black officer hat with a 1 Gold star and 1 silver star on both sides of it. He wears a pair of black boots and on his hip he has a laser pistol. On his left arm he wears a Dark blue arm band with the Earth 1 Eagle in black on it. He has short black hair and his eyes are blue. \"I am Oberleutnant Andreas Drachen, I was given the task to track down and secure Cinder Drachen....My sister before scum like you could kill her\" he says. He looks to be about 22ish and I believe Oberleutnant means 1rst Lieutenant in German. Now many people would probably be scared of an Earth 1 first Lieutenant calling you scum but....instead I begin laughing. He stares at me for a moment while I laugh before I receive the strongest slap across the face in my life from him but I keep laughing. \"You think I kidnapped Cinder?! WOW!, Your info is fucking way off!!\" I shout while laughing and I know I am annoying him. He slaps me twice more and I spit out some blood onto his boot. \"Go and ask her!\" I shout before he turns around and exits the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later he returns before undoing my handcuffs. \"The German Government division of Earth 1 apologizes for your treatment\" he says giving me a German salute and I don't feel as though its sincere......Asshole.</span></div></div>",

He is referring to the Cocaine I have been ordered to sell to him in a suitcase. The amount of cocaine is 800,000$ worth but this idiot keeps looking at me and my body guards for some fucked up reason. \"No ssshit, Come on, Do you have the casssh or not?, If not give it back and get back in your car\" I say just wanting to go to bed now. I've spent the day selling Cocaine, Crystal meth and Shadow powder. Shadow powder was invented in 2067 and is a black powder that you inhale like cocaine. It gives a giant adrenalin rush but a major crash. When someone crashes on Shadow powder you literally cant do anything for atleast 5 hours, The whole time you feel like shit and your head feels as though it will burst, I've never done it but I have done LSD. \"One question\" says the man and I hiss. \"What?!?!\" I ask before he dives into his car and the car begins driving. \"Can you catch me?! HAHAHA!\" laughs the man and I shoot out of my chair as the two Karism members begin shooting at his car. \"You...Sssson of a bitch!!\" I yell before sprinting out of the ally after his car. The car slides out onto the open road and begins driving down the road and I run out of the Ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run up the hood of a car before I dive through the air into traffic and I land ontop of a taxi. The taxi follows the car for a few blocks before taking a right and I jump off again before sprinting down after it. I rip the skateboard out of a kids hand and I jump on it while I begin going down hill. The car is a good 60 feet away from me and is going much faster than I am. it takes a right and I jump off the skate board before Diving over the railing. I begin falling 10 feet down towards the road with cars speeding down it. I curse before I smash down onto of a speeding taxi causing me to smash into the windshield and then crash onto the road. I hear the breaks from the taxi before a man runs out to check on me. I quickly shoot up and I smash my fist into his throat before kneeing him in the head and I run to the taxi before getting in just in time to see the black car turn the corner. I turn the car around quickly before I begin speeding down the road towards it. The car tries to turn out of my way but each time I stay on its track. 20 feet, 15, 10, 5 feet!. I dive out the car door at the last second before I crash face first into the pavement causing the scales on my face to shred off revealing the pink bloody skin underneath and I scream in pain before cursing every profanity word in my vocabulary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly stand up holding my left elbow in my right hand and I stumble slowly towards the destroyed car's back door. I collapse 5 feet infront of it to have a coughing fit filled with blood before I stand up again and I pull out my pistol. I open the car door to find the fat bastard that stole the cocaine sitting there with the suitcase in his left hand because his right has a bone sticking out of his wrist. He is screaming in agony but I couldn't give a shit. I grab hold of his foot before pulling him out of the car while he screams before I rip the suitcase out of his hand. \"YOU (Smashes suitcase into his face) MOTHER!! (Smashes it again shattering his nose) FUCKING!! (Smashes again blowing 80% of his teeth out) FAT BASSSSTARD!! (Smashes it once more caving in his skull).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breath for a minute looking at what use to be a human being before I notice atleast 10 cars have stopped and the people are gawking at me with shock and I hiss before turning and sprinting up the road to the nearest ally. </span></div></div>",

Im Marika!\" she says before Night and Midnight laugh with her and I give them the finger before I turn back around to fine a creature holding a staff to my face. The staff is shiny silver and covered with hundreds of glowing blue symbols on it in an odd language The staff has a claw like opening at the top that has what looks like electricity constantly clawing at the air infront of it. The creature holding it is a scary sight. It wears a pair of black bloody robes made out of some kind of black fur and on its hands it wears a pair of shinning silver gauntlets with the same symbols on them. The boots are the same kind of metal with the symbols and on its head it wears a black helmet that covers all of its head but its face. The creatures face is flat with only slits for a nose and a mouth that seems to have no cheeks, Just a shit more of razor sharp long thin monster like teeth. Its eyes glow blood red and it has a forked tongue with 2 slits making 4 smaller pieces instead of 2 like a snakes. \"Human and Volfak!\" says the creature and my father steps forward. \"Excuse me Sakia, We wish to speak with your leader\" says my father before the Sakia makes a deep growl noise at him and my father steps back. \"Human in Sakia territory, Human and Volfak must face judgement from Sithaar\" says The Sakia before walking up behind us. \"Go!\" he commands and we begin walking.</span></div></div>",

The Sakia leads us forward for a few hundred yards before back tracking a good hundred yards and then taking a left for another hundred yards and I risk asking him about this. \"Whats up with the....\" I begin but he cuts me off. \"Traps human\" he says and he demonstrates it by throwing a large thick branch in nowhere in particular only to see it get blasted away by some kind of laser gun hidden in the trees. \"Oh...\" I say before he jabs the blunt end of his staff into my back. \"Human talk to much!\" he says and I continue walking. This whole time Marika silently whimpers seeming to shake from fear around this creature and staring back at him more than a few times. \"Whats up with her?\" I ask Midnight as we walk. \"The Sakia and Wolfkin have been at war for thousands of years, The Sakia hunt the Wolfkin and make clothing and tools out of there hide and even eat them, The Wolfkin fight against the Sakia for territory and Defense, The Sakia are considered the \"Evil\" race of Earth 2 minus the Flares, The Sakia have tried hunting Zugot but the Zugot are much more better trained and have better technology\" says Midnight before she is hit by the Sakia. \"Silence Human!\" he says with a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sakia commands us through the forest for a few hours till he leads us to a large village for the Sakia. A Sakia village is made up of large hide tents and large wooden structures that are circular and at the back of all the village stands a giant round castle made out of some kind of silver metal. The entire place looks very....odd to an extent. They seem to be a mix of Native american technology and Earth 1 Technology along with some Wolfkin technology. But DAM! are the people scary. The female Sakia do not look any different than the males except for the slight feminine shape and the two bumps in there robes. The females are crafting silver staffs and putting them together along with making rope out of some kind of odd plant and other kinds of crafts. All the Sakia in the village turn silent when they see us and they all stare with there red eyes. Hunters carrying silver bows keep a sharp eye on us. We reach the odd castle and the door slides into the wall before we walk inside. The inside of the Sakia castle has silver walls with glowing blue symbols all across the walls. The Sakia leads us through some doors and soon into a large throne room with hides hanging from the roofs and sitting on a silver throne with blue symbols all over it is a Sakia. This Sakia however is different. He has pure white fur along with blue symbols dyed onto the fur. On his face he wears a shiny silver mask that completely covers his face but has the design of a Sakia face on it. His eyes are pink through the eye holes and his robe is pure white. Beside him sits a staff similar to the one the Sakia leading us is carrying how ever his instead ends with a glass looking blade that dimly glows blue. The two Sakia exchange a few complicated long words to each other before the Sakia that led us here leaves and then we are left alone with the Sithaar sitting on his throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans....Why have you intruded on our territory?\" He asks and my father walks forward before bowing and then speaking. \"My name is Michael Vinichi Ashk'tharothik Sithaar\" says my father and he nods. \"Rakuze Surthokin'akin is my name\" he says before standing and walking down a set of stairs that glow each time he steps on them till he is a few feet from my father. \"We ask of an alliance with you and your people in the current war between Earth 1 and Nashtonville\" says my father and the Sakia stands there for a moment before answering. \"Your problems do not concern my people\" he says and my father nods before speaking. \"Nashtonville wishes to enslave your people, Sithaar Rakuze I highly recommend you assist Earth 1 because they may March on your race next\" says my father and the Sakia paces back and forth slowly thinking about it. \"What will my people earn from assisting in this pointless war?\" he asks and my father thinks. \"600 Miles of land\" says my father and I stare at him with shock. \"Would that be a 360 degree area? or just a straight line?\" asks Rakuze and my father answers with the first one. \"well....That is a great deal....What would be how you humans call it, The catch?\" he asks and my father hesitates. \"Peace with the Wolfkin, Zugots and allegiance with Earth 1\" says my father and Rakuze stares at him. \"No\" he says boldly and my father sighs. \"Sithaar Rakuze, Please reconsider this, Trading with the Wolfkin could be very profitable and having peace would allow you all to focus on farming and science\" says my father and Rakuze thinks. \"Will Earth 1 give us supplies?\" he asks and my father nods. \"Sure\" he says and I can tell Rakuze is smiling. \"Make it 2000 miles and you have a deal\" he says and all of us gawk at him for a minute before my father nods. \"Alright deal\" he says and Rakuze walks back to his throne. \"Good, Now, I will have a hunter lead you out of our territory, I will see Nashtonville in battle\" he says and my father thanks him before we are escorted out of the castle.</span></div></div>",

I get a bad feeling so I knock on the window and Marika opens it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dad! I think we have some company!\u201d I yell over the wind and he turns his head slightly to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d He says and all of a sudden, the helicopter shoots a couple of minigun turrets at us and they shred some civilian cars next to us to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a hunch!\u201d I yell and everyone holds on as the black cars go right past us. I groan from all this crap that\u2019s happening, no doubt they are either from Nashton or some other organization sent to get Cinder, but now I think it\u2019s time I make an example. I shake Helga a bit to get her attention and she looks at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got my Katana?\u201d I ask she nods before pulling out my katana sword that\u2019s in a sheathe with a strap on it and hands it to, unsure of what I will do. I strap it to my back and I poke my head into the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, got any handguns?\u201d I ask and Marika taps my head and shows me a couple of XX Revolvers. XX just basically means it\u2019s a weapon that\u2019s been seriously modified. These Revolvers have an increased round capacity of the standard 6 rounds to 9, along with a modified muzzle to decease the kick back, and its frame is made of a highly light and durable material, allowing it to last a long time, shoot even longer and can withstand and unimaginable amount of abuse. They are also in some holsters and she hands me some bullets that are latched onto a small round plate so I can load the entire revolver with loading each bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I say and I sit down and I hook the holsters to my belt and I jump on top of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon! What do you think you are doing?!\u201d My father yells, leaning his head out of the window to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust stay back and let me do this.\u201d I yell and I have both revolvers in my hands and I kneel. I look ahead and everything goes slow motion again. I see all the black cars ahead of us and the helicopter far ahead of the group, that helicopter is the leader and I need to kill it. I close my eyes and I begin thinking, all the stuff that\u2019s happened, the organization that killed my mother is helping me, a whole city wants me and my friends dead, and I can\u2019t imagine all the people who on both Earth 1 and Earth 2 must hate me for some god damn reason, and how many want that bounty on Cinders head, well after this, lets see who has the bigger bounty. Helga is an assassin; my father is an assassin, and his father and his father and so forth. I almost lost my father before, I will not again, never again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am an assassin!\u201d I yell to myself and I run forward and jump off the truck and land on a civilian car. Another stops ahead of me and I jump off onto another as the one I was on crashes. A black car comes up and a guys pulls himself out and he begins firing at me with a SMG. The bullets miss me and I aim my gun at him and fire, hitting him in the face and making him fall off. I look ahead and see some black cars ram into some civilian ones and they begin flipping and head right to me. I look past the black car I shot the guy out of and see an 18-wheeler. I jump off the last second to have a car crash into the one I was on and I land on the black car and jump off that one as it gets hit as well and I holster my left gun and I grab the edge of the semi. I hang on with my left hand and I fire a couple rounds at another black car, destroying its left tires, making it spin and flip off the highway. I smile for a second but another black car in front shoots a civilian car, making it stop and crash directly in front of my truck. I pull myself up and the truck turns around and I run off the ledge and land on top of the black car that made me lose my ride. I stay on top as four more cars come out around us and I begin shooting at the guys that pull themselves out. The ones I shoot fall out and roll on the ground as other cars hit them or just get a fresh new coat of paint. A van drives right past us and I take this chance and to reload my revolvers. Once I do, I look forward to see the side of the van open up and shoot at the wheels of another 18-wheeler that\u2019s around 10 cars ahead of me. The semi swerves a bit and begins turning to the left and while sliding and it begins to drastically lose speed while I gain more. I wait for the last second and I jump up and run along the trailer of the semi. The van that shot the semi is in front but below me and a guy pokes his head out of the other side of it with a laser rifle in his hand and as soon as he is about to aim at me, I holster my guns and I grab my katana and throw it directly at him, stabbing into his heart as he drops his gun. I land on the van and grab my katana and I place my foot on his face and push him off the van while taking my katana out. I look ahead to find a too much open ground between me and another car. I take my katana, I spin it and stab it into the roof, stabbing right into the drivers head. I twist the sword to the left and the van turns. I twist all the way to the left and I jerk to the left and I twist it right suddenly, making the van overturn and crash into another black car as I land on a black car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck\u201d I say to myself and I stand up. I look ahead to find only one more black car far ahead, in front of a long row of civilian cars, and the helicopter right over the last black car. I smile and I sheathe my sword and grab both my revolvers. I run forward and I do a front flip and again time slows down and I aim my guns forward and I put two bullets into the driver of the black car I was just on. The car swerves and flips forward and then through the air, losing speed and making more cars crash, hopefully not the pickup. I land on another civilian car and I take a few steps on it before I slide down the windshield and I plant my feet on the hood of the car and I jump onto another car. I stop and aim at the helicopter and fire a few rounds at it, hitting some guys that were trying to shoot me. I smile but it fades as the helicopters miniguns turn around and begin spinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my day.\u201d I say and I jump forward as the car gets shredded. I continue to fire at the helicopter hoping to do some kind of damage to it. I continue to jump from car to car as the helicopter tries to hit but continues to fail. I stop on the black car and I see a civilian car in front of me and I get an idea. I stand on the trunk of the car and I shoot the bumper of the car in front off. The bumper falls and rolls on the ground before it hits the front tires and the car\u2019s front jerks up. I jump up and I launch myself up off the grill of the car and I grab the rail on the bottom of the helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sarok\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see him anywhere!\u201d a soldier that\u2019s with me yells and I get pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep looking!\u201d I order and then I hear a yell and I look to see the soldier fall out and the boy climbs up. I take out a knife and I try to stab him but he pulls himself up and rolls. I try to stab him again but he sweeps my legs and he stand up and is about to shoot me but I throw my knife at him, just cutting his hand. He groans and holsters his guns and stands there. I pull out a magnum and I aim at him and I fire but he moves faster than the bullet and misses him, instead my shot hits the seat of the pilot and red paints the window in front of him. I freeze at what I\u2019ve done and I look to my right to see him standing there with a smile on his face. He puts to fingers to his head and flicks them off, giving me a \u2018see ya later dumbass\u2019 like response and does a back flip off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU MOTHER FUCKEEEEEEEEERRRR!!!\u201d I yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nI back flip out of the copter as he curses at me and I land on the top of an SUV. The helicopter spins and clips the highway and crashes downwards into a nearby lake. I jump off the SUV and on another car and so forth until I have matched my speed as best I could and I jump and slam my shoulder into the windshield of a semi with a flat face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly Shit!!\u201d The driver yells and hits the breaks while I hold on. The truck stops and I drop down and breathe a sigh of relief. I go to the back to find the others and their pick-up pulling up to me and I smile before waving to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fucking awesome!!\u201d Marika yells and I smile and I look at my dad who is very mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you be so reckless, especially with all those lives you got killed and put in danger!!\u201d he yells at me and I sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, you know as well as I that if know all about the karism, then you know they would get there target no matter the collateral damage.\u201d I say and he sighs and I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I think we should trade in our ride.\u201d I say and some of them give me a puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Cinder asks and I smile before I pull out my revolver and I shoot the lock on the trailer behind me. The doors open and a shiny black hummer H2 rolls right out and pushes our pick up off the edge of the highway. Everyone\u2019s jaws drop and I walk up to the driver seat and I find it unlocked and I sit in the driver seat, I open the visor above and a set of keys drop in my other hand. I dangle them out the window to catch their attention and my father grabs them and looks at me. He smiles and snickers for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScoot over.\u201d He says and I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI call shotgun!\u201d Marika yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late.\u201d I yell and she groans before we are all in and begin driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Othinox: We do not own the Hummer H2, At all, We are just using it in the story).</span></div></div>",

My brain was created from hundreds of years of information on the human brain, I have a slight imagination to allow me to operate under certain problems, For example, I can sharpen a piece of sheet metal enough to throw it at a hostile intruder and have it cut his legs off within a matter of seconds. I was designed that way to protect the Overseer and I am considering allowing an assassin to kill this idiot so we can get someone to run this confederation as a Democracy and not a Dictatorship. <i>Message from Caroline: CCDSRDSXXXX 1242456442245634. Hostiles are near your current area, Please evacuate the Overseer immediately from the area. Thank you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go sir\" I say and he grumbles before bringing his golf club back and smashing it into my face causing cracks to form in my vision. \"Oh!, Shit sorry Centauri\" He says. If it wouldn't cause me to be terminated I would kill him right now. \"lets Go\" I say firmly and he nods. I know he did it on purpose but the evidence wouldn't matter.</span></div></div>",

He has short black hair and white skin and looks to be asian by his eyes. \"Why is the Government of Earth 1 like how it is?\" I ask and she looks at me. Her eyes are like that of a humans except the white part is black and the iris glows dark blue. \"In the previous world war, 3 billion people were killed, There were serious threats to the Ozone layer causing the global temperature in some places to be deadly to humans. The world realized that the only way Earth 1 could be saved was to band together into a single unit and find a way to fix it. The Japanese government introduced a giant super computer based robot that had all the latest programmings and even had its own brain. The japanese said that the only way possible for the robot to work was to allow it to tap into every single machine on Earth so it could see every location. \"People rioted over this saying it was a mockery to freedom, The atmosphere got worse and worse to the point where if you went outside during the day you would be cooked alive. Humans took cover under ground across the globe, The Japanese government hacked into all the machines in the world and allowed the robot to take control of them. The robot spend 5 years building a device that helped rebuild the atmosphere. another 5 years later the Earth was livable again. This robots name is C.A.R.O.L.I.N.E. Named after the Scientist that designed her she allowed all humans to live on Earth 1 again. All the governments praised the Japanese government for saving them and for there idea they were given the role to always have a say in what goes. The entire world soon united into one big government, Those who didn't were tooken over and made part of another country that had. Eventually Caroline began building thousands of robots for jobs like Law enforcement, Fire department, Doctors and many others, But she always kept jobs open for the citizens of Earth 1. There was one problem with this, Who was going to lead the world?, Caroline asked the Japanese governments to take the smartest human in every division of science and Present Urban work. The smartest chemist, Physcist, Detective and many more were brought before Caroline and she chose who would be the first Overseer. The Overseers job was to make sure the race of man lived on and made sure knowledge never stopped flowing. I was created to be the Overseers protector, I am the most advanced and smartest robot in my field\" she says and I get another question. \"Why is this Overseer such a dick? Can't he be kicked out of the position?\" I ask and she shrugs. \"He is a genious and knows how to set strong rules, I admit he does not use his power properly but he is still the Overseer\" she says and I get one more serious question. \"Why did he launch a nuclear bomb on Nashtonville, Destroying my life and my home?\" I ask and she looks at me with her robotic eyes. \"He did not, I did\" she says and we stare at each other in silence.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"HEY!\" shouts Cinder pointing at a group of 7 black cars driving towards us. \"Fuck, The Karism again\" I say walking a few steps towards the cars. \"I have my arm fixed, Cinder Drachen, Can you take care of the Overseer?\" asks Centauri and Cinder nods pulling out a pistol before Centauri moves her fixed arm causing a few blue sparks to shoot out for a second but then the lights light up and seems to look normal. \"Can you handle yourself?\" asks Centauri looking at me and I nod before the 2 of us begin sprinting towards the cars while the others stay back to protect the asshole who caused this war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentauri charges a hell of a lot faster than I can, She reaches about a good 40 miles an hour using some kind of technology on the bottom of her boots that glows light blue. Her hands are glowing light blue as well with the one that was broken flickering every few seconds. She reaches the cars first before jumping into the air and Axe kicking the hood of the car making a huge dent before she rolls over top of the car and runs towards the next. The first car slows to a stop obviously broken and this is where I come in I guess. A man opens the door in time to receive my foot to his face breaking his nose. He has a bald head and black skin and is wearing a black shirt and a pair of blue jeans and is holding an SMG. I rip a grenade off of my belt that I got from Andreas and I throw it into the car before sprinting after Centauri who is ontop of a car speeding towards me and ripping a guy out of the windshield of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Centauri's point of view).<br>\r\nI smash my fist through the windshield of the second car before grabbing the drivers shirt and ripping him through the windshield up to my Masked face and he screams in terror. \"HOLY FUCK!!\" he screams desperately trying to grab his pistol on the dash in the car, Probability of him doing so is Impossible. I smash his face down onto my knee as hard as I can caving in his skull before a bullet hits my mask, Doing no damage. I quickly point my open palm at the man who shot me's face and then I release a charged blast of energy from my battery at him ripping him and the car door out of the car. I jump off the car before diving ontop of another where an ex experiment dives through the windshield at me. I recognize his criminal name as Venomous meaning he must have joined The Karism....So this is where he has been hiding then. he crashes into me and rips me off of the hood of the car causing me to crash onto the sand and the two of us roll across the hot sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FUCKING EARTH ONE ROBOTIC WHORE!!!!\" he screams desperately trying to claw at my eyes knowing its his best chance. I flick a laser knife out of my boot before stabbing it into his thigh. He makes a noise that sounds like a scream and a hiss at the same time as the knife burns his muscles inside his leg. I bring my fist back and I deliver a punch directly into his temple hard enough to knock him out and he collapses before I pull the knife out. I look up and my targeting system points to Marco and I zoom in on him to find him chasing after Sarok Magiak's car with all the other cars burning behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nI dive forward knowing this is my best chance at saving the Overseer. I grab hold of the bumper of the car as it speeds towards everyone else who begins opening fire on the car. The car is going about 80 miles an hour and my shoes are literally being ripped apart from the ground along with my pant legs. \"Fuck fuck fuck fuck! This is hot!\" I shout as the friction begins heating my leg up and burning. I pull myself onto the car only to see a man leaning out the back holding a shotgun. He goes to pull the trigger but I drop off the car before he can fire and I stare at the car as It begins driving by the Overseer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sarok Magiak's point of view).<br>\r\nI activate my adrenalin power to slow time down 90% and I lean out the window with my pistol aimed at Cinder Drachen. She looks at me with fear in her eyes and I quickly look back at Centauri who is sprinting towards the car, to me very slow but to everyone else probably pretty fast, I get a very sick and cruel Idea. I aim at Cinder Drachen before giving her a smile and a wink before I aim down at the Overseer laying on the ground and I pull the trigger sending a bullet into his head and making a hole the size of a golf ball before time resumes to normal. \"Riposa in pace, sorvegliante (Rest in Peace Overseer)\" I say before rolling up the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Centauri's point of view).<br>\r\n<i>DIRECTIVE FAILED DIRECTIVE FAILED DIRECTIVE FAILED DIRECTIVE FAILED</i> flashes infront of my eyes and I stand 30 feet away from the Overseer shocked before collapsing onto my knee's. My one duty in all of my life has been to protect the Overseer.....and I have failed....I have failed my primary directive.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit there for a few minutes looking at the words flashing infront of my face before Cinder Drachen walks up to me. \"I...am sorry for not being able to save him, He was to fast\" She says before my eyes turn to red and the small lights on my body turn red as well before I stand up. \"By the Government of Earth 1, You are no longer an Earth 1 Citizen, If you return to Earth 1, you will be executed!\" I say firmly and she looks hurt but I couldn't give a flying Fuck what she feels. I walk past her and I keep walking till I reach the Overseers body and I then reach to my thigh to pull out a cartridge from my thigh and I pour a glowing red liquid onto his body before rubbing my hands together fast enough to produce sparks onto the body before it begins to burn a bright blaze of blood red flames.</span></div></div>",

They lead me into a kitchen full of rotted chairs and rusted appliances but I notice that they lead into another room. I follow them again into the other room before 2 men grab hold of my arms. I force them both back into the wall causing one of them to drop my right arm that has my pistol. I aim the pistol at the man holding my left and I pull the trigger sending a bullet through his head before my pistol is ripped out of my hands and then I am punches in the face by Sarok. Another 2 men grab my arms and hold them down and I kick and shout before I am slapped by Venomous. \"SSSHUT UP!\" he shouts before Sarok walks forward wearing a black duster jacket by the looks of it and a pair of black goggles. \"So, Marco Vinichi, Hello...I am Sarok Magiak\" he says before kicking up a piece of wood and smashing it across my face and I grit my teeth in pain. \"You have cost me a good amount of men.....So, Now we must become even, What do you say?\" he asks calmly and I spit some blood at him but it doesn't make it to him. \"FUCK YOU!\" I shout before trying to fight the men again but Venomous gives me a good hard punch to the mouth knocking out 2 teeth. \"Aaack!! You bastard!\" I say and Sarok smiles before walking up and pulling my Katana out of its sheath on my back and then positioning it ontop of my neck ready to cut my head off. \"The traditional Honorable way to die would be to cut your head off, Your not worth that though\" he says before stabbing my Katana through my left hand and pushing it all the way down to the hilt. I scream in agony as he pushes it down through my hand on the floor till I feel the cold steel of the hilt against my hand. I breath quickly and grit my teeth trying to deal with the pain before he snaps his fingers and Venomous hands him a sledge hammer. \"Alright Marco, Pop quiz, How much money do you think you have cost me?\" he asks. \"FUCK YOU!!\" I shout and he smiles getting on his knee's infront of me. \"WRONG!\" he shouts before Venomous keeps my right hand down on the floor and then Sarok smashes the hammer down ontop of my right hand in the center and I feel my bones break in my hand. \"AAAAAHHH!!!!\" I scream in agony and he keeps hammering away till I can't even feel or move my hand anymore. Tears roll down my face and I rock back and forth slightly trying to deal with the pain. \"Reason for why you are with the Government, Are you a spy or something?\" He asks and I know he knows the answer. \"No!\" I say in a growl and he smiles before flicking his fingers again and a Man walks up carrying some kind of device. Its a flat pannel kind of device with some kind of metal cylinders on the sides of it. It has in red the numbers 00:30 on a screen and below that are the numbers 0 to 9. The man enters a code onto it before it begins to count down. \"You seem like a good Kid Marco, You remind me very slightly of my boy Shade.....Shame your going to be blown to bits in about oooh, 22 seconds\" he says and I give him a rage filled look. \"I will blow your fucking head off!!! YOU FUCKING SICK ASSHOLE!!!\" I scream at him and he smiles at me before all of them open up a trap door and then close it. I look up at the timer which is now at 9 seconds and I close my eyes. \"Fuck.....\" I say before it beeps loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Michael's point of view).<br>\r\nI go to open the door to the house but I hear a loud beep noise from inside before fire erupts from the door with a shock wave sending me flying through the air with pieces of the house with me and I crash into the ground.

WHAT THE FUCK!!!!\" I scream and the cat creature blinks twice with surprise. It has black fur and is wearing some kind of Respirator over its mouth. The Respirator is black with the filters glowing light blue and the cats eyes glow light blue. The creature stands on 2 feet and its robe is Midnight black with little glow tubes all over it. \"Human, Calm, be calm child\" says the cat person and I find myself breathing quickly. The cat disappears from my vision before I see 2 furry hands with claws come into my vision and they pull the devices from my eyes allowing me to move my eyes and then I hear a button click before the restraints are released and I shoot up from the table before grabbing a random object off of the surgical table and I point it at the cat person. \"Human!, Me Help!\" it says, Its voice very feminine, Hell it is a female. The Cat person has a slender figure and there fur looks soft like a cats. There face is the same as a cats from what I can tell and the ears of it are pierced with light blue glowing earrings. The room we are in is huge with hundreds of operating tables lined up. All the operating tables are black with a large white light in the center of the table and on the surgical tray are all kinds of weird tools. \"What the...\" I say before looking down at my body and I stare with shock. My left leg is made out of a black metal that has tons of glowing blue tubes all over it and my arm is practically the same, The metal has odd blue markings all over it and I reach up to find myself bald with a metallic plate in my head. \"AAAAHHH!!!\" I scream again before the cat person walks up and gives me a good hard slap. \"Shyko!\" she says and I stare at her for a few moments. \"Thank You\" I say and she nods before I look down at my parts again. \"So uh...What the he...\" I begin but she beats me to it. \"Your body, destroyed from explosion, we save what we can but alot of your body was ruined, we have given you some of our technology that you must keep safe, Your father and friends are in other room\" she says and I nod before putting out my now robotic arm. \"Uh, Im Marco....Where the hell am I?\" I ask. \"You are in the Zugoten Hospital of Yorvktrik\" she says and I stare at her before widening my eyes. \"Wait....Zugot?

He is wearing a black robe with white tubes on it and his mask's filters glow white as well.

The Wolfkin city is full of small stone buildings with 1 gigantic building that my father tells me is the Wolfkin castle, No human has ever entered it. \"How tall is that?\" I ask looking at the castle. \"A good 500 feet tall with a good 700 to 800 feet in width\" he says. \"wow\" I say. Around the city are giant 200 foot tall walls made out of a yellow stone. The wall has towers spread across it that I can guarantee has Wolfkin watching us right now. The castle thins out a little bit the higher it goes and has blue tapestries hanging down the front. Behind the City I can see a giant lake that is also protected by the walls of the city, The walls however i cannot see meaning they must go for a good couple miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marika's point of view).<br>\r\nI wag my tail as we pull up to the Wolfkin gates and I jump out the back of the truck before walking up to 5 city guards wearing black armor and holding black war spears. Wolfkin only wear there armor during a time of war, We usually wear clothing made out of the environment to blend in better, It works against the Sakia atleast. \"Huki! (Hello!)\" I say to them happily and they put there spears up to my throat. \"Gial Volfakia Hov Human's (Girl Wolfkin has human's)\" he says and I nod. \"Tarv ur Frotik vit Gothroki Kirasa, Lin vo ax (They are friends with General Kirasa, Let us in)\" I say and one of the Wolfkin walk through the gates to get General Kirasa, Considering the time she is probably asleep or mating with her mate (Having Sex) so she will probably be a bit pissed at us....and she is when she arrives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tarvo, Hod Sakter tar tromplo (This had better be important)\" says Kirasa walking up to us wearing a Night robe and by the looks of her she was in the middle of something with her husband due to the markings on her forehead and the way she smells, Though the humans can't smell it. \"Hello again General Kirasa, We are in need of a place to stay and we wish to speak to the Queen\" says Michael and Kirasa stares at him with surprised eyes. \"That is....uh...quite alot to ask of the Royal General\" she says and he nods. \"if you wish we can stay at a hotel...\" begins Michael but I stop him right there. \"There are no hotels in the Wolfkin city, Humans aren't usually allowed and Wolfkin allow Wolfkin to stay in there homes\" I say before Marco speaks up. \"Listen, I know this is probably annoying, But we will sleep outside if you wish, We just really need to speak to the Queen\" he says and Kirasa shakes her head. \"You may stay in my home, But I am in the middle of something with my husband, So I will not be able to entertain you\" she says before rubbing her eyes and Michael nods. \"Understood\" he says before she tells the guards to let them in and then she begins leading us towards the Wolfkin castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings us to a long large house with A male Wolfkin standing outside. He has large muscles and a scarred up face but I know him as General Tokash, AKA Kirasa's Mate. He doesn't look very happy right now probably because his wife was dragged off while they were in the middle of it. He is wearing a black Tokshoy and his eyes are yellow with his fur black. A Tokshoy is like a kilt except it only comes in one color and are used only for something quick to put on usually. \"Hello sir, I am sorry that you have to share your home with us\" says Michael putting his hand out to him and he turns around. \"My Name is Lykuai, As long as you....\" he begins having to think of the word. \"Don't fuck with me or my love then I....Will not fuck with you?\" he says hoping he got it right and Michael nods. \"Understood\" he says before Lykuai begins walking up the stairs and Kirasa looks like she wants to go right now as well. \"Alright, There is jug of water in the other room, Bathroom is...Well a hole outside and the fire is warm\" says Kirasa before running up the stairs. In the center of every wolfkin house there is a very large fire pit for cooking and to keep everyone warm, on the sides there are benches and the houses are made out of a yellowish white stone. \"Alright everyone, Lets lay down\" I say wagging my tail and they nod.</span></div></div>",

Lykuai is currently wearing a black robe and the two of us are going Wolfkin fishing while everyone else goes and explores with Kirasa. \"So, How does this work? We get in a boat and jab at them?\" I ask and he shakes his head before pointing to wooden logs sticking up out of the water. \"We stand on those and throw\" he says and I stare at them. \"Oh...\" I say knowing now that this will be extremely hard. We reach a wooden log that is at the shore and goes up to the top of another log in the water (4 feet into the air). Lykuai begins walking up it and I guess I have to follow so I do. When he reaches the top he begins jumping from one log to another till he reaches a good 100 meters from me. \"Come!\" says Lykuai so I can hear and I suck it up before trying to run across the logs like he did. I  slip about 20 meters from him and the log comes between my legs before I crash down onto it with my groin. \"AAAHHH!!!\" I scream holding myself between my legs and all the Wolfkin on the logs begin laughing at me before I fall off the log into the lake below still rocking back and forth from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Cinder's point of view).<br>\r\n\"So....What is this?\" I ask Kirasa pointing to a bowl with it attached to a handle. \"That is a Kyvo bowl\" she says and I look at her confused. \"Whats that?\" I ask. \"It is used as a blessing from our god, If a Soldier has it done to him by his wife there is a much greater chance of him coming back from war alive, It works on woman too but not many woman are in the army, Would you like to try it?\" she asks and I nod. \"Sure, I could use all the luck I can\" I say and she nods before walking over to a cupboard and opening it before pulling out some kind of red plant and some kind of oil. She places it all into the Kyvo bowl before putting on a pair of gloves and grabbing a red hot coal from the fire and dropping it into the bowl. The oil begins to smoke with a ashy herb smell that is rather unpleasant. The smoke is orange and black. Kirasa begins walking around me with it in her hands chanting words in what I expect is Wolfkin. She waves some of the smoke over me causing to cough from it a few times before she pours the contents of the bowl into the fire. \"There you go\" she says.</span></div></div>",

Infront of us is a very large black ship with jets on the winds and back to allow it to hover and fly in space. A large ramp is down and there are about 8 soldiers wearing black gear and holding assault rifles around us. \"lets go\" says Cinder grabbing my shirt and dragging me up the ramp practically. My jacket was burned and the Zugots managed to get me a black t-shirt and a pair of black jeans and a pair of white running shoes. My ID and everything was lost so I hope to get a new copy soon. Cinder leads me into the ship which is black on the inside as well. The room that the ramp leads to is only lit by red lights on both the roof and walls that flash on and off very quickly. The room is full of benches and the room goes a good 20 feet behind the ramp allowing atleast a hundred soldiers to travel in this ship. Everyone takes a seat and I decide to sit with Cinder on my left and Night on my right. I have a question for Night. \"why the hell do you have a Wolf tail?\" I ask looking at the tail he has. \"That is a secret\" he simply replies and I shrug before looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship takes off after a few minutes and the ground gets more and more un detailed till we pass the Ozone layer and we are in space.

There are hundreds of windows with lights inside them and there are hundreds of turrets along the outside. The color for LUNA is black. The ship lands in a harbor and the door opens before Robots run into the ship holding rifles. \"Sorry for this, But you cannot see LUNA\" says Centauri and I go to say something but we are all shot by some kind of Dart from the robots. \"WHAT THE HELL!!\" I say to Centauri. \"Don't worry, When you wake up you will be where we need to be\" she says and I feel light headed. \"I feel...Funny\" says my dad before collapsing and everything Darkens. \"Sorry guys\" says Andreas walking out of the ship and then everything turns black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes and I find myself dressed in a white pajama shirt and white pajama pants and laying on a white sofa with a Large window showing the stars of space infront of me. \"Welcome to LUNA\" says Centauri who now looks as if she has gotten some kind of upgrade. Her shins and feet seem like one part now. The bottoms of her legs have glowing blue lines around them and up the front of her legs to her knee she has 3 glowing blue squares going up. Her chest has what looks like some kind of armor that has the Earth 1 Eagle glowing in blue in the center of her chest. The armor angles down to a point at her waist area and has a glowing blue trim on some parts of it making it look pretty cool. Her hands now have glowing blue claw like finger tips with the rest of the hand black with a glowing blue circle in the center top of the hand. Her helmet has been repaired making her protective lenses over her eyes glowing blue again from when I remember seeing her on the news. On her back she wears some kind of jet pack by the looks of it and at her waist is a black armored skirt that has a glowing blue square on each individual piece. \"Thanks..., Why did you shoot me and my friends?\" I ask and she walks towards me from across the room till she is 3 feet infront of me. \"I did not shoot you, My soldiers shot you\" she says and I roll my eyes. \"Alright, Why did they shoot me?\" I ask. \"LUNA is 100% Classified, Reporters are not allowed here, Civilians are not allowed here, Alot of our army isn't allowed here\" she says and I look around. The room has black walls, black roof, black floor and it is lit by tubed lights that glow blue on the roof. On the wall to my left is the Earth 1 eagle glowing light blue. The Earth 1 Eagle is an eagle with its wings spread out.\"Why am I allowed here?\" I ask and she sits down beside me on the couch. \"You technically are not, You should by law be executed immediately, But we need you\" she says and now I have a bad feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need me?\" I ask. \"You and your father are part of the Assassination organization of Vinichi.....Correct?\" she asks and I look at her claws on her fingers. \"Yes\" I say. \"Then you can easily do this\" she says simply. \"What is it?\" I ask. \"We require to use your....assassination skills to...well kill a reporter in Manhattan America\" she says and I think about it. \"Hmm, Why?\" I ask. \"He is getting extremely noisy into the Governments business and from his searching he has found one of our heavily classified documents by hacking into our systems for 10 seconds\" she says and I look out the window. \"Why don't you kill him?\" I ask. \"I am the Ambassador and Overseer's Body Guard, If ANYONE saw me in Manhattan and kill someone it would be extremely bad for the government, We need this to look like a Murder, If you have to mutilate a corpse or dump it in a dumpster, Do it, In return I will give you pure Citizenship, 80,000 dollars and I will attempt to Locate Sarok Magiak for you and Cinder\" she says and I look at her. \"Your going to pay me, 80,000 Dollars to murder a guy?\" I ask surprised and she nods. \"This is extreme importance, With this file we could lose the war with Nashtonville, We cannot let that happen, Therefor, Caroline has given me Clearance to pay you 80,000 dollars for this mans assassination and award you citizenship of Earth 1. You will have a Duel citizenship of Earth 1 and 2 allowing you to travel anywhere you wish. Another thing we will need is, After the job is done I need you to break into his apartment, Steal the file, and Bring it to me, I will be attending a meeting with the President of the United states at the white house, Caroline will supply you with the clothing and ID you will need to get in\" she says and I am surprised. \"Got a photo?\" I ask and she hands me a photo with a 200 poundish man on it with balding grey hair and brown eyes. \"And location of Residence?\" I ask and she gives me his address and a bag with all the supplies I will need. \"Make this Silent, I promise you, If you kill this man in Times Square or something I will make sure you never see the Light of Day again\" she says and I nod. \"alright, Its a contract\" I say smiling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dam\" I say standing in Time's Square and staring at the lit up billboards infront of me. Manhattan has a population of 300 million and I estimate atleast 8 thousand people have walking by me in the past 5 minutes probably. People are running around like maniacs and some girls are laughing somewhere, This is one big shit hole in my opinion. On my way here I dived into the Ocean water and you know what? I came out with a grey filth all over me. It was like asphalt mixed with lube almost. My target lives in an apartment building 30 blocks from here. From the Traffic....Im gonna walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later I make it to my destination, A very tall 80 floor skyscraper that serves as a Apartment building. The scary thing about this is that the entire city is stacked with these things, I am glad I have lived on Earth 2 all my life. I walk inside the building keeping my bag tightly in my hands. I am wearing a black business suit to fit in with the crowds and a pair of sunglasses along with a fake black beard that Centauri spent an hour putting on to make me look older. This poor bastard I have to kill is named <i>Joseph Marren</i>, He was charged with Child Pornography 6 years ago but there was not enough evidence since Caroline tried hacking into his computer to support the governments claim but it had a virus on it that wiped the hard drive, That pissed the Government off big time. Plus he is suspected of having contacts with Nashtonville. I walk over to the elevators and I walk into one of them before clicking the top floor before I open up my bag and I pull out a fake music player before plugging it into the elevator electronic key hole to freeze all the camera's in the building. It takes 20 seconds before it beeps and then I put it away before pulling out my silenced pistol. Its black and has the Earth 1 Eagle on it, I have absolutely no idea what it is called. I load up the magazine and I look at the floors to see I am 5 floors from his apartment. I sure fucking hope he is home. I tried asking Centauri about the whole missile bullshit but she told me she would explain why they didn't stop it after I complete this task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens and I put my bag around my shoulder before walking down the hallway towards this mans apartment. I stop at the number 947. The apartment building has white walls and a brownish ugly green carpet and the doors are white with gold numbers. I knock on the door and I wait for a minute before the door begins to open and I bring my foot back before kicking it open. The man collapses back on the other end, the door ripping the door chain right out of the wall. The man is in his underwear and by the looks of his computer he was just jerking off to kitty porn (Child Pornography). \"Hello Joseph!\" I say before aiming my pistol and I pull the trigger 5 times. 4 bullets into the chest and 1 to through the eye. \"That was easier than I thought\" I say before I close the now broken door before I walk over to his computer desk and I sit down in the chair. I close his current computer screen and I look through his documents for the file. I find it labelled <i>Classified Government file for Nashtonville</i> which gives me the impression that this guy was a total moron. If I were him I would have programmed it to scramble the file without a password which I suspect he did but he didn't of course. I pull out the computer stick Centauri gave me and I plug it into his computer and I click download.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for the thing to download I decide to check out Joseph's fridge. I find a six pack of bear and a can of Arctic breeze. I take the can of Arctic breeze. I decide to not even sit in this guys chair after thinking about the shit he's probably watched in that chair. By the time I am done with the Arctic breeze the download is complete meaning I can get the hell out of here. I decide to ruin this guys reputation more so I open back the guys previous screen so when the authorities come, they can see the shit he has been up to. I exit the apartment and I head downstairs to get a cab to get to the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Centauri's point of view).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Centauri, It is Nice to meet you\" says President George Mackarthy shaking my hand and then the government politicians behind me's hands. President George Mackarthy is a older man wearing a black suit with a black tie, he has short well cut grey hair and a grey mustache, He is 63 years old, He was just elected and represents the Republican political party. \"It is nice to meet you as well President Mackarthy\" I say bowing to him since I was made in Japan. \"So Tell me, Who are you up at L.U.N.A considering for the New Overseer?\" he asks sitting down in a black leather chair and I sit down in one beside his. Infront of us is a black small circular coffee table that has his cup of tea on it. \"We are taking into consideration all of our experts but the determination is hard for the Scientists at LUNA because of what we have to look at\" I reply and he nods. \"What would that be? if you don't mind me asking\" he says. \"We look at There probability for success, Political knowledge, Scientific knowledge, Law training, Record of Success and we look at there location of interest\" I reply and he takes a sip of his tea. \"Do the leaders of Countries get a tour of LUNA?\" he asks. \"No, LUNA is like The United States' Area 51, We cannot allow reporters into LUNA or leaders because we cannot risk secrets getting to Nashtonville or any other kind of uprising\" I reply. \"Alright, The United States of America is willing to give the Government more soldiers if you wish\" he says and I nod. \"That would be appreciated\" I say before I see Marco walk into the room dressed like a Government officer. \"Centauri, This is from General Durine\" he says handing me a computer stick. \"Thank you, Return to LUNA\" I say and he nods before exiting the room and I open a compartment on my leg before sticking the stick in and then I close it. \"I have one important question though\" says The president. \"Yes?\" I ask. \"Do you Robots ever think of Taking Over?, Your kind is alot stronger than we are and alot more intelligent\" he says, That is the question that all Presidents ask and us Robots always Reply the same way. \"That would be going against our primary directive Mr President\" I say to him. \"What would that be?\" He asks. \"To protect humanity and to keep liberty and Justice for all\" I say and he nods before we both stand up to go take pictures with the News reporters.</span></div></div>",

Police think that someone had downloaded something off of the computer after Joseph's Death but they cannot be sure of it. He is suspected of being shot by a pistol\" says the Reporter before I look at Centauri who is still watching the TV so I look back at it. \"In other news The Government Ambassador Centauri Visited the White house today where the President allowed U.S Soldiers to be used in the war with Nashtonville, The Ambassador Centauri explained that Reporters would have to wait for a New Overseer to be selected before commenting\" says the Reporter while a news feed shows Centauri handing the President a medal from the Earth 1 Government that has the Earth 1 eagle in silver on it. Centauri turns the television off before standing up and walking over to a desk that has a laptop on it and she begins typing something on it. \"Your account and Citizenship has been modified, Ask of me what you wish\" she says. \"Alright, Why the hell did you launch that Thermal Nuclear Device onto Nashtonville?\" I ask and she sits down with the laptop in her hands before handing it to me and hitting the enter key before I see Security camera feed. It shows her grabbing a Reporter and throwing him through a glass wall onto some controls before Caroline notifies her and the Overseer of the Launch. Centauri tried cancelling it but it was to late. \"Again, Why didn't you warn Nashtonville?\" I ask. \"We actually did, We did not receive confirmation from the Mayor though\" she says and I think. \"THAT BASTARD!!\" I shout smashing my fist onto the coffee table. \"I was on watch that day, The emergency button did not work worth shit\" I say not looking up. \"Marco, You may have just given me a lead on a way to turn Nashton's own soldiers against him\" she says and I understand her plan. \"Can I see Cinder?\" I ask and she hesitates. \"Depends....Do you want to go to Germany?\" she asks and I think. \"Might as well, My organization....Never mind\" I say not wanting to babble everything I know to her. \"Alright, Tomorrow you can go to Berlin\" she says.</span></div></div>",

The airport looks a hell of alot different than the ones on Earth 2. This one has security robots everywhere along with the Earth 1 and German eagle on the walls. There are atleast 40 gift shops in this dam place that have the German flag on wallets, jakcets, coats, toys, bottles and all kinds of other crap that tourists from Earth 2 or america would buy. The Limo driver leads us out the front doors to reveal a giant city with very modern buildings to ancient looking ones made of stone. The Limo driver puts our bags in the trunk and opens the door for us and we climb in. The inside of the limo has black seats and a blood red floor with a skylight for people to open and also a mini bar that folds out to the left of the final seat on the left. \"So where are we going?\" I ask my father after sitting back on a sort of couch kind of seat. \"Cinder is meeting us at a mall\" says my father and I chuckle from the fact that woman love shopping. \"Its kind of a pain in the ass that everyone here speaks a language that I barely know\" I say and he shrugs. \"Many people here speak english so you could probably just speak english or Cinder could translate for you\" he says and I nod. \"Alright....What the hell will we be doing at the mall?\" I ask and he shrugs. \"After we leave Germany we are on our way to Italy to meet with my contacts at our....business\" says my father and thats the part I cant wait for, I get to meet my families Organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we get to the mall We find Cinder and Andreas sitting with another man. The man has short black hair and hilariously he has a black handle bar mustache. The man is dressed in a black suit and tie and he wears a top hat which just makes it even more hilarious. He weighs probably about the same as my father and he has a big large happy smile on his face. \"A!, Hello Tere Finichi\" says the man with a very thick German accent that I can barely understand, I thought Andreas' english was bad but this guy's is like a slap to the face to the language kinda. \"Marco this is my father\" says Cinder pointing to the man and I smile trying desperately to hold back a laugh. \"I am so glad tat du helped my daughter\" he says putting out his hand which is gloved with a white glove and I shake it. \"So, you got a Day off?\" I ask Andreas needing to look away from the guy before I make a laughing sound. \"Yes, Centauri said I must make sure you don't blow someone's head off\" he replies. \"Alright, you 3 spend the day as you wish, Us fathers are going to discuss our current situation and hit the bar\" says my father and I nod before the 3 of us walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the first one that has not laughed your ass off at that\" says Cinder. Cinder is wearing a pair of black jeans, white shoes and a white T-shirt with something in german written on it. In her ear are silver stud earrings that have a blue gem in them. \"Does he always dress like that?\" I ask and Andreas shakes his head. He looks alot different out of uniform, He wears a black hoody and a pair of blue jeans. On his hip though he still has a pistol and he has a head set in his ear. \"He wears that get up for first impressions only\" says Cinder and I nod. \"what do you feel like doing?\" asks Cinder. \"I could use new clothing\" I say looking at a white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans that the government gave me. \"alright, Lets get you new cloths\" says Cinder before leading me towards a shop.</span></div></div>",

Well guess who made the Pizza!\" I say and we all have a small laugh before the man hands us our Bratwurst in a hotdog bun covered in melted cheese, Peppers, Onions and some kind of red chunky sauce of some kind. The man and Andreas have a conversation in German before the man hands Andreas 3 bottles of beer that I stare at for a second before remembering the Absinthe. \"Is this gonna make me wear a lamp shade on my head?\" I ask and Andreas gives me an odd look before Cinder begins speaking to him in German while we walk and by the time we reach the Table in the food court he is laughing. \"You gave him Absinthe?!\" he asks and Cinder nods. \"haha, tell me, Did you see the fairy?\" he asks looking at me and I am confused as hell. \"Never Mind, lets eat\" says Andreas cracking open the beers and handing 1 to me and Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bratwurst was actually one of the best dam things I've eaten but I still prefer Italian cuisine by far. The 3 of us have left the mall to go to a lounge to watch some T.V and thankfully the damn thing is in English. Its a Group of men sitting at a table and talking about the Current Government situation and if Centauri should still be the Body Guard of the Overseer since the previous one was killed. The 3 of us are sitting on a black couch with 6 other people 3 on the other two couches in the room. They look to be about 16 to 17 and no one is talking since on Earth 1 Politics is found rather interesting. \"I mean it though!, These Damned Robots are taking us over and before we know it the entire government will be controlled by them!\" says a man on the television with a bald head and wearing a black suit and he speaks with an english accent. \"Oh don't give me that Crap George!, CAROLINE alone saved this world!, Do you know where you would be right now if the Japanese Government didn't invent her!? You'd be under the Ground crying your head off because you would know that your days are counting down!\" says another man with short black hair and green eyes and wearing a black suit as well. \"Maybe so!, But why the hell should we allow them to practically run this race?! I mean sure CAROLINE purified the air and cleansed 90% of the fresh water sources but why haven't we shut her down?!, Give her job to Humans!\" says the man with the bald head named George. \"You know what that would be like doing to all the Robots? Its like your neighbor helps you fix your fence and then you take him out back!, Cut his nuts off! and Shove them down his throat!\" says the man with the hair. \"They aren't people Dammit!, There brains and emotions are all fake!\" says the bald headed man. \"Fake eh? What makes ours real exactly?, Maybe!, MAYBE! They Were fake 130 years ago but not now!, Scientists have studied all of the Human brain!\" says the man with hair. \"It has been Quoted from Centauri, 2 years ago these exact words: \"The Emotions and pain I feel are Artificial but 100% real, I feel Failure, Sadness, Happiness, Accomplishment but scientifically they do not exist to Humans, But they exist to me\", That is her admitting that she is nothing but a Tin Can!\" says the bald man. \"You Fucking Cold Bastard!, They feel the same Fucking things you and I feel and you....AH FUCK IT!!\" he yells before grabbing the bald mans neck and tackling him out of his chair onto the ground before the screen switches to the Earth 1 Eagle in Blue with the message <i>We are experiencing Technical Difficulties, Please be patient for your daily programmings shall resume within the next 5 minutes</i>. \"Is this what Earth 1 T.V is like?\" I ask surprised and Cinder shakes her head. \"No, Just these shows, Politics don't even matter in the Government, If you even have a real shot at being the Overseer you have to be an expert in Science or Law\" says Cinder before standing up. \"Lets go\" she says before the 3 of us walk out of the lounge.</span></div></div>",

Outside the window reveals tons of other buildings in the distance and infront of a black couch is a large T.V. \"So, What do you feel like doing?\" asks Cinder before a glint of light shines in my eye and I turn my head to see someone on the roof across from us. \"DOWN!!\" I shout shoving her back before a bullet rips through the window and I feel a sharp pain in my ear. \"GAH!\" I shout before diving out from infront of the window behind the wall.

I turn my pistol before I aim at his head and I pull the trigger sending a bullet through his head and he collapses. \"Good Shot!\" says Andreas Running up to the man with his pistol pointed at him. \"He dead?\" I ask after checking on Cinder who is fine. \"Uh....He doesn't have blood....\" says Andreas and I turn to him. \"What?\" I ask. \"Its Oi...\" he begins before the man shoots up his eyes glowing blood red before he grabs Andreas and throws him with Robotic strength across the room. \"Heilige Schei\u00dfe!!!!!\" yells Andreas before he crashes into the wall causing the drywall to cave in, completely ruining the entire wall. I quickly stand up before I grab hold a large bowl of fruit on the counter and I throw it at the Android who hits it out of the way easily. I aim my pistol at it and I pull the trigger 4 times almost emptying my entire clip. His body jerks back a few times from the bullets but then he is quickly charging towards me again. \"cazzo! (Fuck!)\" I say before he delivers a kick to my face causing me to fall back onto the ground. The Robot turns to Cinder who fires a pistol 8 times into its face which does absolutely nothing. \"Fick Mich\" says Cinder before it charges but I am up in a second tackling it to the ground. I am surprised that I could even do it cause this guy must weigh a bloody ton!. I bring my Robotic arm up before I smash it down into his face crushing it down like a soda can and causing a brownish green oil to leak all over the carpet from his crushed head. \"Aaagh!, What the hell!\" says Andreas standing up with his left hand on his right side. \"Think its from Sarok?\" I ask and Andreas walks up to it before taking a knife out of the kitchen Drawer and then beginning to cut away its skin. When he is finished we are left with a crushed up head that looks like a human skull. \"This is Third Party, Not Government, This is definitely from Nashton or Sarok\" says Andreas and Cinder walks up to it. \"Im curious now what Centauri looks like under her mask\" says Cinder and Andreas smiles. \"She has a A115 Design meaning her face is based on a humans but has Robotic change.....\" begins Andreas. \"What the fuck are you two talking about?! we just about got our asses kicked here!\" I say and Andreas nods. \"Yes, Lets get back to whats important\" says Andreas. \"We need to get to Italy as soon as possible, That is where my Organization is stationed\" I say and Cinder gets a curious look on her face. \"What happened to Night, Midnight and Marika?\" she asks. \"They went back to there own Organization\" replies Andreas before looking around. \"What the hell Happened here?!\" asks my father and I look up to find him and Cinder's father in the doorway. \"Assassin, Robot\" I say. \"Alright Ill call Percival and have him get ready for us\" says my father. \"Who?\" I ask. \"You'll meet him soon enough\" he says before taking out a cellphone and Dialing a number. </span></div></div>",

The man is a priest of the Catholic church by his black clothing and the white strip in his collar. He has short brown hair and glasses that give him a Nice person look and around his neck he wears a Cross. \"I am Father Patrovi, I am suppose to lead you and your friends to the <i>colomba e la cornacchia</i> (Dove and the Crow)\" he says and my father nods. \"What?\" I ask and the Father smiles. He looks to be in his early 40's and inside his pant leg I can see some kind of swords outline of some kind, I don't think he is really a priest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was proven wrong, The guy really is a priest. Instead of leading us to some secret manhole or something he brings the 5 of us to a Monastery on the outskirts of the city of Rome. \"Uh....\" I say looking at my father who is smiling. \"You'll see son\" says my father and Father Patrovi leads us inside. The Monastery is ancient, I can tell because it is still made out of stone and wood and alot of the lights and electrical equipment looks very Old. \"Padre Patrovi!\" says a little boy running out from the Monastery wearing a red shirt and blue jeans. The boy has white skin and short brown hair and around his neck he wears a necklace with a cross on it. \"Ciao Timothy (Hello Timothy\" says Father Patrovi. The boy looks to be about 8 years old. \"Timothy, Did you finish your english?\" asks a Nun walking out of the blow Door of the monastery. The nun looks to be about 65. \"No, Can I do later?\" asks Timothy obviously in the early stages of Learning english. \"No, Back inside\" says the Nun and Timothy says goodbye before running back inside. \"Follow me\" says Father Patrovi leading us inside the Monastery. The inside is nicely lighted and warm with a good 120 children sitting at tables eating supper or doing school work. \"Who are the men and the lady?\" asks a Boy with a bald head and dark skin wearing a blue shirt and black pants. \"They are from Germany doing a report on Italy Morris\" replies Father Patrovi. \"Welcome back Father Patrovi\" says a Nun that has a hideous scar across her face. \"Ah, Hello Sister\" says Father Patrovi. \"How did you get that?\" asks Andreas running his finger up and down his face indicating her scar. \"Cooking accident\" she says and him and Cinder look at each other. \"Some cooking accident I bet\" says Cinder and she nods. \"Sister, Would you show these 5 to the Kitchen and then there rooms?\" asks Father Patrovi and she nods. \"Yes Father Patrovi\" says the Nun before gesturing us to follow and we follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nun leads us into the kitchen and to a stone wall before beginning to push at some of the stone bricks in an odd order before the wall cracks down the middle. \"Crap, How much will that cost to.....\" I begin before the wall continues to split even more and then it sucks into the rest of the wall revealing a dark staircase leading down somewhere. \"Follow me\" she says and we all begin following her down the stairs. \"Some monastery\" I say and she takes off her hood. She is an old woman and looks like a corpse in this lighting. All along the walls are weird red Tapestries that have a gold trim on the sides. Alot of them are ripped and torn but some of them look like they are brand new. The Nun opens up a door at the bottom of the stairs and then gestures us inside. \"Welcome Home, Michael and Marco  Vinichi\" she says and I walk inside after my father and I am surprised. The entire room is HUGE. We are standing on some kind of balcony over looking atleast 50 people training with each other, There are 2 stair cases 1 on each side of the balcony leading down to a dirt ground with stone walls. There are other rooms at the end of the room and there are odd open tunnels on each side of the room leading somewhere, They look like they have been around since the renaissance from how old and worn down they look. The people training below range from my age to like 60 and from the looks of it, The old guys and woman are kicking the young people's ass. \"Come on son, Let me show you and our friends around\" says my Father.</span></div></div>",

The Nun isn't actually a Nun, She is an assassin that plays the part of a Nun and Father Patrovi is one of the Guardians to the Entrance to our Organization. \"So are you in charge or something dad?\" I ask and he chuckles. \"I was, But then Leonardo took over when I moved to Earth 2, I cant just take back command of our organization unless I stay here for a year, Which we can't do of course due to the war\" says my Father. The entire place is lit by modern lights but the walls and floors are ancient. There are things on  a wall from the twenty first century here including a book that has a publish date of 2012 and there are pictures from World war 2 on the wall showing Soul Catcher members standing in line infront of Adolf Hitler doing the Nazi salute and other pictures of American pilots with them wearing The Vinichi Organization Logo on there uniforms. The vinichi logo is a gold V with a cross on the left and a Eagle on the right with a gold circle around it. On the wall it also shows pictures of all the World wars and even a picture very recent of one of the Overseers talking to a member of the organization. \"How are all these photo's intact?\" I ask. \"Well, during the Renaissance our Founder made a formula that he said would keep anything preserved forever. Sadly it stunk and tasted horribly so no one bought it since camera's did not exist back then and it smeared paintings. So he kept it to himself and hundreds of years later one of our ancestors tried it and found it preserved photo's and even the glue in books\" says my father and I cant help but chuckle. \"Wow, Thats actually pretty cool\" I say and he nods. \"Come on, let me introduce you to Leonardo\" says my father leading me down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads me through the doors and into an ancient looking office with a stone table and different paintings from the Renaissance on the walls. Leonardo is an old man with a short bearded face and balding white hair. He wears a white robe that has a red trim and his hands look old. By his desk sits a Samurai sword in a red sheath and behind him in a case is a ancient rapier, Gold in color with jewels in the handle and handle guard. \"Welcome home Michael Vinichi\" he says and Michael nods before walking up and the two give each other a friendly hug. \"Is this Marco?\" he asks looking at me and my father nods before Leonardo begins walking towards me. \"My, You have grown boy\" he says looking at me from head to toe and my father nods. \"Have you trained him?\" asks Leonardo and my father nods. \"Yep, ive taught him everything but the Killing blow\" says my father and I am curious. \"Whats the killing blow?\" I ask.</span></div></div>",

Combat Dummies today are made to be as realistic as possible. Now they use a special kind of gel, Bone, artificial muscle, Veins and blood to simulate the human body. All organs are there (of course fake but dam close to the real thing) and the Dummies purpose is to show if you actually killed the person. The dummy can bleed out and a little red light above the dummy on the wall will light up if the dummy died to let you know if a human being had died if it was real. \"Watch this\" says my father before casually walking up to the dummy and then flicking his wrist. I see a glint of steel come up from his wrist before he trusts his fist forward at the Dummies face and smashing his fist into the dummy's forehead. The Red light turns on and my father brings his fist down before walking back towards me. \"There is a knife on that glove\" I say before he holds his hand out and I see that the glove is just a normal glove. \"The blade snaps off when you smash it into the targets head, You have to really smash it too, Its only about 9 inches long and is designed to put the force of your punch on that small tip. Its almost as thin as a needle but thick enough to guarantee a kill\" he says and I look at the dummy who has a bleeding head now. \"Here put this on\" says my father handing me another version of the glove. My father helps me put it on and he shows me how to quickly snap my wrist to snap it in place. The spike would be invisible in the middle of the Night allowing you to get Nice and close to your target with this ready. \"This was most famously used in World War 2 against SS soldiers and Soul Catchers, They have there own remake of this that they consider more effective and silent but its not a competition, Were not wanting blood from them and they don't want blood from us\" he says. \"They killed your wife and my mother father, We deserve there blood\" I say and he shakes his head. \"No, I felt the same way years ago but there are more important things\" he says before showing me another dummy. \"Put it between your ring and middle finger, walk up and really smash it into his forehead, The tip wont break and it is sharp\" he says and I nod before slowly approaching the dummy pretending its Nashton and when I get close enough I smash my fist into the Dummy's forehead so hard the skull caves in slightly and I snap the spike off before my Father walks up and claps. \"Nice shot kiddo\" he says and I chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours later.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder sprints across the training field with a combat knife in her right hand towards the dummy before she jumps side ways through the air kicking the Dummy in the Chest with both feet before quickly recovering and jumping up and stabbing the knife up through the jaw and then twisting it and ripping down causing the dummy's blood to spill onto the floor. \"Ouch\" I say and she smiles while looking at me before giving me a wink and walking towards me. \"I didn't know you knew how to fight like that\" I say and she sits beside me. \"I prefer not to\" she says before looking at me. \"Listen, Marco, I may have seemed like a bitch alot\" she says and I am surprised. \"Huh?\" I ask. \"I don't think I have really ever thanked you for saving my ass in the past week or so\" she says and I shrug. \"Well Its....\" I begin to say but stop when she gives my cheek a kiss. \"Danke\" she says with a smile before standing up and walking away. \"Hey, Wanna train with us?\" asks a boy my age walking up to me and I look behind him to see 3 other boys. \"Sure\" I say standing up and we walk out to the training yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds they rush at me in all directions and I quickly look at the 4 of them to guess which one is closest. I grab the closest boy and I use my robotic arm to throw him into his buddy before I kick at the next one's shins causing him to trip forward which I use his momentum to throw him into his friend causing them both to crash to the ground. I hear clapping from somewhere and I turn around to see my father and Leonardo standing there clapping. \"Excellent Job Marco, Excellent\" says Leonardo before I hear a groan of pain from one of the boys. \"Boys, Go get some Arctic breeze while we talk with Marco\" says Leonardo and they nod before leaving and I turn to my father and Leonardo. \"Let the three of us talk\" says Leonardo pointing to the bench me and cinder were sitting on and we walk over to it to talk.</span></div></div>",

The cross is gold and 4 feet long and heavy but not heavy enough to need a second person. I carry it down the hall towards the church but I almost run into Marco Vinichi around the corner. \"Wow, Hello Padre\" says Marco and I nod. \"I was just going out for fresh air\" he says and I step out of his way so he can walk down the hall before I proceed down the hall towards the altar room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the Altar room but I notice the left door out of the two doors is slightly open so I use my foot to open it. Inside the Altar room I find all of the candles have been changed to black candles with blood red flames and on there knee's infront of the altar is someone of Darkness. He has Glowing Green hair and is wearing a black robe that has white spikes designed on the sleeves, bottom and hood of the robes with razor wire wrapped around the robes....Bloody razor wire. \"Forgive me Father, For I have sinned\" says the man his voice sad but evil. He turns his face towards me revealing a pale white face and blood red eyes. \"But so have you haven't you Padre?\" he asks and I whip the sword out of its sheath at my belt that I hide in my pant leg and I point it at him. \"Who are you?\" I ask. \"thou Shalt not kill, You've broken that commandment many times\" he says with a smile before I hear Sister Kartha scream. \"Go Padre, Or little Timothy will be long gone\" he says with a smile before turning into a ball of smoke and floating up to the roof and through the floorboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nI here a woman scream upstairs as I am walking inside and I quickly pull the dagger out of my pocket as Father Patrovi runs by me and begins running upstairs. \"Come on!\" he shouts and I follow him up the stairs where we find Nuns leading children down the hallway. \"whats wrong?!\" asks Father Patrovi. \"A Demon!, A Demon is with Timothy!\" screams a Nun and we both look at each other. \"Excuse me?\" I say before Father Patrovi grabs my sleeve and leads me down the hall before opening a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Father Patrovi's point of view).<br>\r\nTimothy is sitting on the ground playing with a toy truck and making noises while a little....girl beside him claps her....paws and claws together giggling. The little girl wears a pure white robe that splits down the middle making it more like a very long coat. The robe has a black trim and all along the coat is black razor wire. The girls hands are not hands, they are more cat paws and the claws are not biological claws, They are a foot and a half long claw shaped blades that shine in the room light. The paws are pure white in color with pink palms and her feet are hidden by a pair of black boots. Poking out of her hood are 2 pure white cat ears and inside the hood is nothing. What I mean is all it is, is Darkness with 2 glowing red eyes. She stands about 4 feet tall meaning she is probably some poor child that had what ever has happened to her done to her. I also notice the man with green hair from downstairs is here as well smiling. \"Timothy come to me\" I say to him putting my hand out. \"But father I want to play with Kia\" says Timothy and the girl giggles. \"How long do you want to play with me?\" she asks him bending down so her hidden face is close to his. \"Can I forever?!\" says Timothy with a big smile on his face full of excitement. \"Of Course!\" says Kia happily before the green haired man walks up so I am only 3 feet away from him and Timothy. \"Come Now Timothy, You must see your new home\" says the man and I step forward. \"Can Father Patrovi come too Mausso?\" asks Timothy. \"Of course\" says Mausso and I growl before me and Marco both Charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nI am going for Mausso while Father Patrovi tries to save Timothy from Kia. I reach Mausso and I raise my dagger above my head only to have it blocked...By his fingers. This dagger is Razor sharp, I know for a fact, I sharpened it 30 minutes ago. He must have Robotics or something cause it is not possible. He slaps the dagger out of my hand before grabbing my only full human arm with his hand. \"Feel the power of Suffer!\" he says his eyes glowing green causing me to gawk at him before Something blasts me back through the wall of the monastery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I open my eyes I can see in the Other room Kia leading Timothy through what looks like a window leading to a grey skied dead field that has grey dirt all on the ground. \"Your gonna have SO much fun Timothy!\" says Kia happily before they walk into the portal and they appear on the other side in the field before Mausso drags Father Patrovi's unconscious body into the portal and they appear on the other side. Mausso turns around to look at me and he smiles his mouth rotting away to reveal a skull jaw and teeth while his robes turn into ripped and shredded robes. \"primum natus\" he says to me with a voice like the grim reapers before the portal closes and then I fall unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Othinox: primum natus means \"First Born\" in Latin).</span></div></div>",

Infront of the couch is a Large black television that is showing the Earth 1 Eagle. Centauri clicks a button on a remote before the screen switches to <i>Exp. 365 546 233</i>. The screen changes to a picture of some kind of human.....no not human....some kind of scary looking thing. \"These are what we need you to find, Scientists call the <i>SERPENTS</i>, They have black skeletal bio mechanical bodies with a skeletal tail that has a 2 foot long blade on the end of it. There legs are digitigrade and they are usually found hunched over or crawling on the ground. There clawed feet and clawed hands allow them to climb on any surface from a natural glue that they can leak from there palms and the bottom of there feet. There Skin is plasma/laser proof only effected by normal bullets as well so your rifles won't be the most recent models. ONLY fire your weapons if you must, From our tests we know that they work like ants, If one attacks, They all attack so if you shoot one you have almost a 5% chance to escape from them all\" says Centauri and Cinder raises her hand. \"yes?\" asks Centauri. \"Any secret weapons on these things? Like can there teeth shoot out or something?\" she asks. \"They can spit there venom which will blind you in seconds and there blood is highly acidic\" says Centauri and I sigh. \"Great\" i say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Othinox: More description of the Serpents will come when Marco actually see's them himself).</span></div></div>",

He has his hand out to me which I shake with my gloved hand. I am now officially again a Military Medic during a time of war...Which it is. I am not a doctor, I am only taught how to stabilize a soldier in a time of war, Meaning if I see a guy get his legs blown off from a land mine I have to run straight into a wall of bullets to try to save the guy, Reason why I got this job is cause I aced my Military Medical exam. A Medic's gear has barely any protection on it. Reason being is if you were to give a Medic armor like a Government Experiment Tracking Officer which is like a bomb suit, They would be EXTREMELY slow and wouldn't be able to use any of the medical equipment. A Medics gear is a long black jacket that reaches the knee's with the countries flag on the shoulders with a white badge with a purple medical cross. Inside the jacket is a wide variety of different pockets for all the different pain killers and syringes and bandages. On my back is a black square shaped backpack with a purple medical cross in the center and on my head is a black mechanical helmet. The helmet covers most of my head except my face and over my eyes is a protective shield to protect my eyes from bullets, although a soldier could just aim down and shoot me in the mouth or something if he wanted to kill me. Medics aren't given high powered weaponry either. All I have is a pistol to defend myself and a big Knife. Underneath the jacket I wear a black shirt with a black bullet and laser proof vest that have absorption fields inside it. Absorption fields are force fields that absorb laser bullets instead of reflecting them but are damaged by normal bullets and plasma so they are kind of useless. My gloves are fingerless and my boots are black. \"So what rank am I?\" asks Marco walking out wearing a pair of camo pants and a grey shirt. \"Your the bitch\" says Andreas and Marco gives him the finger and I cant help but laugh. \"Your a private for now\" says Andreas now being more serious who is wearing his uniform. His uniform is midnight black and is made up of a black jacket that hangs half way down to his thighs with the pant legs having a blood red stripe down the sides. On Andreas' shoulder is the German flag with the Oberleutnant rank above it. He wears a black officer hat and a pair of black boots with 2 lines around his sleeves in blood red as well. On his chest he has 4 Medals over his heart and on his left arm he has a black arm band with the Earth 1 eagle in blue. \"Whats up with the Uniform?\" asks Marco. \"Im not getting changed yet, We don't leave for an hour, I might as well stay in this\" he says and Marco and me look at each other. \"Oh...\" says Marco and Andreas smiles. \"You all have fun, I have to talk to Centauri\" he says and me and Marco walk into the ship to get a drink from a fridge and relax inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Crap!, I completely screwed the ending up by making it seem it was Marco's point of view, Crap, It is now edited, I apologize for the confusion).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Interesting\" says Cinder beside me and I look at her and away from the window that is showing the endless Forests of Earth 2. \"What is?\" I ask. \"The Wolfkin have a version of Heaven called Volksaagar\" says Cinder while reading a book and I smile before the ship begins to land in the middle of the woods. \"This is it\" says a soldier named Jack, He has black skin with a bald head and brown eyes. Me and everyone else but Cinder is dressed in Infantry gear for the Earth 1 military and we are all wielding assault rifles. Soldier gear is made up of Forest camo pants, black boots, a bullet, plasma and Laser proof vest that weighs a good 20 pounds and a forest camo jacket underneath. On my head I am wearing a helmet like Cinders except over my face I have a protective mask on that covers everything except my eyes which are covered by the visor of the helmet. The assault rifle is a ATX-67 which is black, light and very accurate with fully automatic and semi automatic functions. The rifle can be used as a sniper rifle but is not recommended for that job. Cinder is the only medic here and is wearing the lightest gear out of us all except a Scientist who is wearing absolutely no armor at all....idiot. The scientists name is Mark Dremori, He's from America and was one of the scientists who worked on the Serpents. He has short white hair and looks to be in his early fifties, He is wearing a grey shirt and grey shorts with black boots as if he is going on a safari or something and on his left hip he has a pistol in its holster. \"Lets go\" he says pointing forward with his hand and we begin walking as the ship takes off slowly and then flies up into the air. \"Shit its hot out here\" says Mark before looking at Cinder. \"Medic, Do you speak english?\" asks Mark and Cinder gives him an annoyed look. \"Yes...\" replies Cinder. \"Good, Im assuming everyone speaks english, Now first things first, We have to go 7 miles east to Mannarov cave which is where the serpents have fled to, There numbers have probably grown and they may be hostile\" says Mark before we all begin walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you expect to communicate with the Serpents?\" I ask Mark while we walk. \"Not a single clue, Sorry\" he replies. \"Oh great, So were walking into a hive of pissed off creatures that will most likely eat our intestines while we scream and bleed out\" says Cinder and Mark turns around while walking to face me and Cinder. \"Thats what you are for\" he says and Cinder gets a pissed off face. \"I am not a Damn medical genius, even if I was It is Impossible to save someone who has there intestines shredded all over the floor while in the middle of battle!\" says Cinder and Mark goes to say something else but trips on a Huk tree root and stumbles backwards before turning around to see where he is going only to have a black tail stab through his chest and out his back. The tail has a razor sharp bladed tip with the rest of the tail looking like a creatures spine only black. \"What the....\" begins Cinder before Mark's body is ripped in half with half of it flying to the left and the other half flying to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding infront of us is a Serpent. It has Midnight black skin and is crouched over and hiding in the shade of a giant Huk tree. It has a long tail with multiple spikes along the top of its tail that look natural. Its feet are clawed and shaped like a 4 legged animals, I forget the term Centauri used. It stands about 6 feet tall and is hunched over. Its mouth has no lips allowing its blood stained thin monster like teeth to show. Its nose is simply 2 slits and its eyes are located more to the side of the head. Its head is not perfectly round, it goes back and ends in a spike. It wears no clothing but it does not have breasts or even nipples and none or hidden sexual organs. Its mouth slowly drools a transparent drool onto the ground and 2 longer teeth that look like fangs sit in the top row of its mouth. I hear a hiss behind us and I turn around in time to see another one of the things fly through the air in a great leap at Andreas and before I can even aim another one tackles me to the ground. Not a single shot was fired from any of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can feel this things tail wrapped around my legs and pinning my arms down with its clawed hands and surprisingly its pretty strong. It runs its bloody claws up and down my red \"demonic\" arm before making a very loud scream causing my ears to feel like there gonna explode before it stops and I feel something crawling up my arm. I look to my right to see some kind of Centipede like thing crawling up my arm only about an inch in length and tiny. It crawls up my shoulder and I try jerking my head away from it but it crawls to my ear. \"OH SHIT!!\" I shout when I realize what its about to do, and it does. It begins crawling into my ear and causing an extreme pain in my right ear. I fight against the Serpent ontop of me and I manage to jerk my head to look at it to see its head coming down and it smashes into mine. Everything turns dark as I lose consciousness.</span></div></div>",

I look around and to my left I see Andreas and Jack, but I don\u2019t see Marco or the other two soldiers that were with us, David and Chris I think. I look around to see we are in a massive chamber that seems to stretch ten stories high and wide, along with various tunnels, openings and cracks all over the walls and roof. Andreas begins waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhhh.\u201d He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. Andreas, wake up.\u201d I yell silently and he shakes his head awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he says and I groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got ambushed and now we\u2019re captives.\u201dI say and he looks around to find jack but not the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d he asks and I nod my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t kno-\u201c I begin saying but we hear something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go you ugly fucks!\u201d I look in front of me to find one of the other soldiers being carried by two other serpents by his arms and he\u2019s trying to fight back and the other soldier is being carried as well in the same fashion but he\u2019s calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris stop or they\u2019ll kill you!\u201d David says since I now know the one freaking is Chris and the other is David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go! Let me go-Cahhh!\u201d Chris yells but one of the serpents sinks its fangs into his neck and injects its venom into him and in seconds, his eyes roll back and he foams at the mouth before falling over dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris!\u201d David yells and he manages to pull himself away from his captors\u2019 and pulls out a knife and charges to the one that killed Chris, but he doesn\u2019t get far as a tail impales him, twice as big as the one that killed Mark. The brings him up to the face it is connected to and I see it\u2019s the Queen. The Queen looks the same as the normal ones but is alot taller and has a disk instead of a point on the back of its head. It stands 15 feet tall and looks extremely strong. It opens its mouth and bites off half his face, finishing him. The queen throws the body away and it walks over to me and leans down to face me. I shudder at the gaze it gives me and it slowly opens its mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, I\u2019m gonna die. Damnit! I never got to tell Marco how much I love him.\u201d I think to myself, knowing it could be the end. I hear it give off a snarl, then I hear a loud crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nI slowly open my eyes to find myself stuck to a stone table, with some type of transparent material holding my arms and legs to it. I begin to struggle and then one of the serpents comes over to me and looks at me directly before it opens its mouth and now I get mad. I grit my teeth and my eye turns red before I use all my strength and bust my right arm restraint, while also punching the serpent as well, dazing it. I grab my left restraint and break it off and I fling my demonic arm up and stab it into the serpents throat, killing it. I break off the rest of my restraints and I jump off the table and I stumble, disoriented a bit. I look around a bit to find my new ATX-67 assault rifle, my XX revolvers, and my katana. I grab my katana and look at it a bit to make sure it\u2019s alright. After looking at it a bit, I quickly turn around and slice the head off a serpent coming up behind me. Its head slowly falls off and see the green blood it leaks out. I grab the rest of my weapons and I begin making my way through the serpent made holes, and judging by how many tunnels there are and the type of rock, we are probably in a mountain. After running for so long, two serpents come out from the front and charge me, still making me mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut of my way!\u201d I yell and I roll forward, narrowly avoiding their tails and I stab one through the mouth and out the back of his head with my sword in one and my demonic arm with the other. I pull them out and I continue forward and I see a dead end. I groan and I am about to turn back and run but I find my way out swarming with them. I back up to the wall and find the wall makes a hollow noise, there is another room on the other side. I turn around and I pull my right arm back and I hit the wall, busting it down and crumbling. I jump down and find myself in a room that\u2019s ten stories high and wide with a massive serpent in the middle looking at the wall. The serpent looks the same as the normal ones but is a lot taller and has a disk instead of a point on the back of its head. It stands 15 feet tall and looks extremely strong, so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the queen. It turns its head to me, revealing Cinder, Andreas, and Jack all stuck to the wall and the bodies of the other soldiers near them on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarco!\u201d They yell at me and I yell back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys!\u201d I take a step forward but I am tackled to the ground by a serpent and it tries to bite me but I kick it off me and I jump onto my feet. I grab its tail and I swing him around, crashing him into some more of his friends. Another serpent comes up from behind me and bites my collar bone but its robotic so it\u2019s fangs break and I take the chance to grab its head and I snaps its neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarco look out!\u201d Cinder yells and I turn around only to have a big clawed hand grab me by the throat and lifts me up. The queen brings me to its face and snarls at me but I hear words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2026 are you\u2026 here?\u201d she says in low voice and I wonder how I can understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, how can I understand you?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe\u2026 insect that burrowed into your head\u2026 has given you\u2026 the ability to understand us. Now\u2026 why are you here?\u201d she explains and asks again and I groan at the pressure on my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were sent here to find you, and find out what to do with you as I see fit\u2026 I want you as our allies in the war we are fighting.\u201d I explain and she gives a look of what I can tell as confusion and I get a massive headache as the insect begins to move slightly. The queen must be reading my mind through the insect. The pain stops and she looks at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow has our blood\u2026 not melted\u2026 your arm\u2026 and blade?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy left arm is a curse, the thing it\u2019s made of is something not of this dimension, so your acid can\u2019t effect it, and my sword is made to last through the toughest conditions.\u201d I explain and she tightens her grip on me and snarls angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo\u2026 you kill my children\u2026 and ask me to help you!?\u201d she angrily says and I groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou killed my men as well, and almost me! Besides, I can protect you from your creators.\u201d I say and she looks at me with a wondering look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d she asks and I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFight in my war\u2026 and I\u2019ll have my armies and organizations protect you from the government that spawned you, allowing you to have freedom.\u201dI say and she looks at me closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure\u2026 the other species knows of us\u2026 and our intentions\u2026 so my children won\u2019t come to any harm.\u201d She says and I nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d I say and she drops me and I gasp for air as I am on my hands and knees. She leans close to behind my head and says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetray me\u2026 and I will make sure you\u2026 diiiieee.\u201d She says and I chuckle as I stand up and look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already have thousands of other people trying to find an kill me, my family and loved ones, join the club.\u201d I say and I go to the others and I grab the giant chunk that\u2019s holding Cinder against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that? Did you just get the serpents to agree to something?\u201d Andreas says and I struggle to get thing off Cinder without hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019ll fight against Nasthon.\u201d I say and I pull off the piece and me and Cinder land on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you understand her?\u201d Cinder asks as she stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA centipede sort of crawled into my head and connected to my brain, so know I can understand her and she can read my thoughts but can only read my thoughts whenever I am really close to her.\u201d I explain and she looks at me with a pained look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must have hurt.\u201d She says and I smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t good either.\u201d I say and she laughs a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon let\u2019s get the others and get moving.\u201d I say and she nods before we get the others.</span></div></div>",

Venomous cannot crawl on walls don't worry, His back has the ability to adjust unlike humans to allow him to crawl and his legs allow him to leap farther than most humans\" Centauri replies putting the file down. \"Why does the government do these horrible things? people wouldn't be uprising if you told people what was going on and stopped these experiments\" I say. \"The Government does this for one VERY important reason, There are diseases, Plagues everyday that sweep across Earth 1, If we didn't experiment on creatures with these virus' our entire population would not exist due to KBK\" says Centauri. \"Whats KBK?\" I ask. \"KBK was and is still a heavily contagious virus that we fear will sweep to Earth 2 some time and infect the Wolfkin and Sakia who do not have the tolerance for the chemicals required for vaccination, The disease effects the brain and causes people to turn into Murderous monstrosities that kill people, This started in Brazil and wiped out 3 billion people in North America a few years ago and 4 billion in Europe along with another 8 billion in Asia, Many fear it and many have no clue what it is, we vaccinated it awhile ago and we got the vaccination FROM an experiment so we saved the entire human race again essentially\" says Centauri and the three of us stand up. \"One more thing, Sarok Magiak is an experiment, His brain allows him to judge other peoples movements to tell him what they are going to do next and some how he has gained very fast reflexes\" she says and we nod. \"Sarok will be dead in the next 4 hours\" says Andreas and Centauri stops us again by putting her hand up. \"Im promoting you Andreas to Hauptmann (Captain Rank in German) and Marco I am promoting you to Sergeant and same to you Cinder\" says Centauri before gesturing us to leave so she can get back to her work.

I reach the window and I smash the butt end of my rifle against it shattering it before climbing inside. The house is well lit and has red carpet with decorated stone walls and there are green tapestries on the walls. 4 Guys kick open the room door all of them holding SMG's but they aren't quick enough. I aim my assault rifle and I pull the trigger sending 3 bullets into each of there chests before I grab a grenade off of my belt and I pop the pin with my mouth before sprinting out of the room and throwing it down the hallway just as a door is opening. The grenade explodes and the door is blown off its hinges into the person opening and I run down the hallway to see a man laying dead underneath it. I am now in the front door room.

I hear something role across the floor before I hear Cinder scream out \"Granate!!, Granate!!\" and we both sprint in opposite directions from the table just as it explodes sending shards of metal everywhere and causing the shock wave to knock me off my feet. I manage to make it behind a pillar which begins getting ripped apart by bullets and I look over at Cinder to see Venomous sprinting towards her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Cinder's point of view).<br>\r\n\"CINDER!!\" yells Marco and I turn to look at him just as someone crashes into me from behind. \"HAHA!!, hello again CINDER!\" says Venomous keeping my arms down onto the ground. \"Now you little....\" he begins before I bring my knee up into his crotch and he freezes before I smash my helmet covered head against his getting him off of me and when he tries to get up a bullet zips by and crashes into his chest causing him to fall down limp and dead. \"Fuck you\" I say to him before another bullet Zooms by and I duck behind a normal wooden table. \"Come on out Whore!\" says a girl about my age with short black hair and black bags underneath her eyes. She is wearing a school uniform and she is holding a black shotgun. Her uniform is black with a green skirt and her socks are white with black shoes. She fires at the table and a hole bigger than my head explodes out my end of the table an inch from my head and I roll out of cover and quickly aim at her and fear shows in her eyes before I pull the trigger and a bullet makes a nice bloody circle perfectly between her eyes and she drops like a rag doll to the ground. I quickly run up to her and I grab her shotgun before running through the door she came from which leads up stairs. I sprint up the stairs quickly and I open a door to see the men that have been firing at us the whole time. They notice me and go to turn but I pull the trigger sending head sized hole through his chest and he falls back into the other ones who Andreas runs up to and finishes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nI smash my fist into the stereo to shut the christmas songs up and then I look up another set of stairs that leads to 1 set of doors. \"He's up there\" I say and the three of us begin walking towards it, Andreas keeping his assault rifle locked on the door. We reach the doors and I look at Andreas and we both nod before we both kick the doors open at the same time and we walk inside to find Sarok Magiak sitting at a large hand crafted Huk wood desk waiting for us with a Cigar in his hand. \"Cinder Drachen, Captain Drachen.....Marco Vinichi......Nice to finally meet you off the battle field\" says Sarok taking a puff from the cigar before blowing out the smoke. \"Fick dich\" says Cinder which I think means Fuck you and Cinder smiles. \"Pishov na khuy\u0306 tezh suka\" says Sarok and we all look at each other. \"Its Ukrainian for Fuck you too bitch\" he says blowing out smoke before chuckling. \"Now, You wish to kill me....Yes?\" he asks and I walk forward with my pistol aimed at his head. \"No shit\" I say. \"You killed my General and Colonel, You killed my Daughter and friend.....hell you've even fucked up my home.....So I would like to say 1 thing before you pull that trigger\" he says and I stare at him. \"What?\" I ask. \"Fuck with my family, and I fuck with yours, you will be sorry, so very sorry for taking Shades papa away and for taking him away from me by pulling that trigger\" he says before smiling and then he draws a pistol with Lightning fast speed but I am faster. Time slows down as my adrenalin kicks in again and I aim at his arm and I pull the trigger and the wheels on his chair cause him to spin around in the chair which would be fucking hilarious in any other situation. Sarok looks at me after spinning and he smiles. \"Very good boy....Very....very good....\" he says shaking his head slowly and I see sadness on his face before he stands up, His robe drenched in blood. \"Alright Marco Vinichi and Cinder Drachen\" he says before walking out from his desk and infront of us before taking a deep breath and taking another puff from his cigar. \"spokiy\u0306no\u00c3\u00af nochi\" he says calmly before Cinder raises her pistol wielding it with both hands and then she pulls the trigger sending a bullet through his heart and causing a gush of blood to spray onto the floor behind him before he drops to the ground dead. \"Gute nacht ficker\" says Cinder before turning around and walking out of the room and Andreas takes out a phone to call Centauri.</span></div></div>",

A fucking human? Why don't you go back to a fucking factory and become an Arctic Breeze can Already!\" I say growling and Kirasa puts her arm out to stop me from charging at the robot. \"Nitari!, Silence or I will report your behavior to Takinari!\" says Kirasa and I growl silently. \"May we be civilized?\" asks Centauri and Kirasa nods before we all pay attention to the map. \"Now, Nashtonville has tooken over Victoria Hill, I was thinking that you both would send in your troops in with stealth along with the Zugots, When you destroy the jammer our fighters will move in and airstrike the settlement\" says Centauri and I growl. \"Why can't the Sakia do it?!\" I ask giving her a glare and I can tell i am getting on her nerves. \"The Sakia are doing another Job, Now, If you will get your snout out of your ass maybe we can do a job successfully\" she says and I growl before the 3 of them walk out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Da hell is her problem?\" I ask and Kirasa sighs. \"Nitari has always been racist, Angry and jealous of everything everyone else has, She wants my job because in the end my opinion over rules hers, if she doesn't get her way she complains and gets angry, Last week she stomped another Wolfkins head in for giving her a bad look....The only reason she is in her current rank is because her family are high up in the Royal system\" says Kirasa before I see Cinder talking to Rashi the Zugot that healed me and gave me the robotics at a camp fire so I walk over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again Rashi\" I say and she looks up at me and nods. \"Hello Again\" she says calmly. \"So, You and your fellow Zugots will be the ones saving our asses in a way eh?\" I ask and she nods. \"You could say something like that\" she says and I nod. \"I hope to see you after this war Human, Good Luck\" she says before giving me a bow and walking away and I take a seat beside Cinder. \"Well, Day after tomorrow Cinder....Battlefield\" I say and she nods. \"Lets not get killed\" she says.</span></div></div>",

I see Wolfkin soldiers watching the tree as it falls from the trenches before they begin sprinting in the exact opposite direction I am. \"OTHER WAY!!\" I yell to my fellow soldiers but they completely ignore me so I follow the Wolfkin towards the Tree as it falls towards me now. What happens is odd though, It magnificently spins on its stump towards the way I was heading and it collapses full on to the soldiers I was just running with and I shake my head slowly surprised before Gun fire erupts around me and I duck down beside a Wolfkin Archer holding a black bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Cinder's point of view).<br>\r\nI slide across the ground into a trench as bullets fly by me and I collapse down against the wall of the trench before I hear jets fly by over head and followed by Multiple explosions in the distance. \"Hey Germany!, Get your head out of your ass and help me!\" shouts a soldier with a British accent and I look at him before running over to him. He's been shot in the left shoulder and the bullet wound is bleeding rapidly. \"OH SHIT!!!\" yells the soldier staring behind me and I turn around to see a Helicopter spinning around in the air causing the soldiers that were controlling the guns to be ripped out of the chopper from the force. The back of the helicopter is on fire and its spinning this way out of control. \"FICKEN!\" I say before throwing my pack off and ripping out the Force field and I activate it just in time as it crashes stopping a giant piece of metal that would have killed us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kirasa's point of view).<br>\r\nI bash a human soldier across the face with my shield before stabbing my sword deep into his chest and he screams in pain till I rip the blade out the side decapitating another. One draws a gun at me and I throw my shield at him causing it to cave his skull in before I kick another one in the groin and I stab my sword up through his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Centauri's point of view).<br>\r\nI fly through the air the rockets on the bottom of my legs keeping me at a steady speed of 200mph. I see a Nashtonville tank firing its guns up at helicopters and other airborn vehicles and I fly towards it. I land ontop of the tank before pulling a black metal pipe bomb off of my leg and I plant it ontop of the tank. \"ROBOT!!\" yells a soldier aiming his assault rifle at me from behind me and I raise my left leg before turning on my rockets on that one leg to full power and I grip the metal of the tank. The flame melts his barrel and burns his face so quickly he dies before he hits the ground. I click a button on the pipe bomb before flying straight up into the air. The pipebomb explodes sending pieces of the tank flying in all directions with one piece coming 4 feet from me. I see another tank and I fly down towards it.</span></div></div>",

The Zugots however simply sing happy songs in there language and rock back and forth together and some humans are listening to Electronica music from there countries. At the fire I am at Centauri is sitting at a table and talking to Rakuze and Kirasa with an Angry Nitari sitting back beside me and staring at Rakuze. \"So...Nitari...Are you wanting Children?\" I ask her after awhile and she turns her head to look at me. \"Yes\" she replies before picking up a stick and throwing it into the fire. \"What are you planning on naming your child when you have one?\" I ask and she rolls her eyes. \"I want a son, And I will name him Lykoth (Pronounced Lie-koth) which means Vengeance\" she says and I think for a minute. \"What if its a girl?\" I ask and she growls. \"If my child is a girl I will kill her\" she says and I stare at her. \"Im not kidding, Now fuck off\" she says before I stand up and I walk over to a table set up with Marco and Andreas sitting at it. \"Hey\" says Andreas and I take a seat. The two of them are strip cleaning there rifles. \"Hey\" I say back before Marco looks over at Nitari and then me. \"What did you two talk about?\" he asks. \"Nitari says she will kill her child if its a girl\" I say and they stop cleaning and look at me. \"Wow.....Cold\" says Andreas and I nod before pulling out my pistol. \"Clean this please\" I say handing it to Marco and he smiles before beginning to take it apart. \"Lets see how everything goes\" says Marco and I nod.</span></div></div>",

The two of us smile at each other before we walk up to our friends and they congratulate us. The past year has been a living hell up until now. Many members from all species have died, Nashtonville has shot down hundreds of helicopters and other airborne vehicles and Earth 1 is beginning to become drained. The only reason me and Cinder got to marry is because we might be killed in the last 2 Cities we need to conquer. Durzai City and Nashtonville. Durzai city was Earth 2's biggest city with a population of 200 million people and 8 skyscrapers that made World records. It was one of the first cities tooken over by Nashtonville and everyone in it was killed and thrown into giant piles of rotting corpses. Nashtonville isn't doing well however either. They are out of food, Money, Water, power and workers. What they have built however are giant walls of collapsed buildings hoping to keep Earth 1 out when we get there. Durzai is a Wolfkin name meaning Strength and Courage. I found a ring for Cinder while me and Andreas fought in Lynori city, I found a jewelry store and used the cash register to buy it, Then I proposed to Cinder 2 weeks ago and here we are. \"Proud of you son\" says my father patting me on the back and I smile. Cinder is wearing a white dress and a pair of white shoes and I am wearing a black suit with a red tie. The suit is a bit dirty but other than that it is in great condition. Most of the guests here are people we know from the Earth 1 Army and a few other guests are from the Wolfkin army and Rashi from the Zugot army. I invited Rakuze the Sithaar but he refused telling me he had no interest in a human's wedding. \"Congratulations!, Don't fuck with my sisters head!\" says Andreas smiling and I smile before the two of us head over to the room with the food and drinks. The walls in both rooms are white and the floors are wood. Theres not much here, we got everything we could to make it a wedding but resources on Earth 2 right now are strict, The Government has stopped all exports and in ports which has not effected the Natives but has effected Earth 2 citizens that aren't part of Nashtonville. Earth 1 is PISSED at Earth 2 in General causing all Earth 2 Citizens to be forced into what are kind of like Concentration camps. The only difference is that they don't purposely torture people like the Shutzstaffel (The SS soldiers were the ones who controlled Concentration camps in WWII)did in World war 2, What the Earth 1 soldiers do instead are cram 13 people into one cell and only feed them ever 2 days, Everyone is being interrogated to be rooted out if they are Nashtonville spies which then they are executed. Andreas has worked there once in the past year and has managed to root out 5 spies bringing him to Major so he is doing pretty good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone begins dancing while music begins playing and I smile. \"Be back in a few minutes\" I say to Andreas and he nods before taking a bottle of scotch and pouring himself a shot. I walk up to Cinder who is talking to Marika and Midnight at the edge of the dance floor. The Soul Catchers showed up 2 months ago and are assisting Earth 1 against Nashtonville, My father asked our organization to come but they refused saying its pointless to risk the Organization dieing out. Unlike the Soul Catchers who have an estimated number of 3000 members our organization only has a couple hundred. \"Shall we dance?\" I ask Cinder and she smiles before taking my hand and we both walk towards the Dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Venomous' point of view).<br>\r\nI've been to multiple weddings. Usually it involves me stabbing the bride, Poisoning the groom or blowing the Best Mans head off with a sawed off shotgun, Not this one though. \"Hello Night\" I say leaning against the wall beside him and he sighs. \"Will I need to decapitate you Venomous?\" he asks not looking at me and I smile. \"No, That will not be needed, I ssssimply want to talk to Marco and Cinder\" I say while I watch Cinder and Marco dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes I let Cinder dance with her father before I take a seat beside Andreas who has had by the looks of the bottle 7 shots. \"Treat my sister well Marco\" Says Andreas looking at me and I nod. \"Ill guard her with my life\" I say before a scale covered hand is placed on my shoulder and I look up to see Venomous. \"Fucking he....\" I begin to shout before he puts his hand over my mouth quickly. \"Ssss......Let me sssspeak\" he says before taking his hand off and taking a seat on in a chair beside me. \"I thought you were dead\" I say to him and he smiles. \"No, Close but no\" he says and I keep my hand on my pistol under my jacket. \"I came here to say sorry\" he says and Andreas chuckles. \"You came to say sorry when you were one of Sarok's right hand men?\" asks Andreas and Venomous ignores him. \"Take good Care of your wife Marco Vinichi, For you only live once\" says Venomous smiling at me. \"I hope I never see you again\" I say to him. \"You wont, But our families will run into each other here and there\" he says before standing up and walking away from us and I turn around to look at him but he has vanished into the crowd. \"Im gonna live through this dam war\" I say and Andreas nods before pouring me a shot and I take it happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I look around the camps making sure no one heard it before I open it up and I see stacks of pipe bombs and laser weaponry that Centauri uses during battle. I begin handing everything out to my followers while taking a plasma pistol and a canister of rocket fuel for myself. \"Remember, Kill them all\" I say to them and they nod before I close the trunk and we begin moving towards the Sakia section. All of the Sakia are asleep right now so this gives us the upper hand. I stab my knife into the canister causing the chemicals inside to begin reacting and I then throw it at a group of Sakia tents. The canister explodes with an ear shattering BOOM!! causing a giant explosion and destroying 20 Sakia tents and all the Sakia inside. Lights turn on around the Camps and people begin rushing out of there tents. If were gonna do this we need to do this now. Me and my followers begin opening fire upon all the stunned and half asleep Sakia warriors as they struggle to get there weapons and get out of there tents. One throws a spear towards me and I jump to the left before pulling the trigger on my plasma pistol. A green light shoots across the field and splatters across his chest and he falls back screeching as it burns through his body...slowly. I hear someone behind me and I turn around just in time to pull the trigger directly at Centauri's face. She is unphased by it, Her mask not even being damaged, Instead she grabs me by the neck and slams me down onto the ground before raising her fist and bringing it down into my snout. She then throws me across the camp site into something hard which causes me to yelp and drop the pistol. Before I can react her wrist gun is pointed directly at my face with the laser sight glowing between my eyes. \"Stay down!\" she commands and I obey while smiling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\" I say under my breath as me and 30 other soldiers walk down a road in Durzai city. Alot of the buildings are burnt and charred from when they were set on fire and there are airplanes and helicopters crashed all over the place, and worst of all, There are thousands of dead bodies. Piled 3 stories high in each pile lays hundreds of dead humans, All ranging from babies to elders. The streets are splattered with both dry and fresh blood and everywhere you look there are corpses laying on the ground. 3 fighter jets fly overhead and are soon followed by helicopters carrying soldiers. Our mission is to secure a Weapons factory that Durzai city was in charge of. Turns out Durzai city was the second biggest supplier of Earth 1 Weaponry, The other being L.U.N.A itself. Nashtonville could not locate the weapons because the government base is located underground which we suspect still has Earth 1 scientists hidden inside. So since Nashtonville couldn't find the weapons they massacred everyone in the city and burnt most of it to the ground. How the Scientists are still alive is purely luck, The day before Durzai city was attacked they restocked there supplies and are now waiting for us to come and help them. From what Centauri tells me they are doing perfectly fine and have found ways to entertain themselves the past year they have been stuck down there. Its a good thing that Nashtonville never found them because if they had and broke in they would have access to Earth 1 weaponry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few soldiers vomit and make comments on the cruelty of Nashtonville while we walk through the streets but it doesn't get anywhere past that. Cinder is with another group approaching the hidden latter that leads down to the Government base from the south and Andreas is back at the Facilities interrogating Earth 2 citizens again. \"No hostiles in the city, stand down\" says a Fighter pilot on the radio before everyone relaxes. \"I wonder why Nashtonville has abandoned the city\" says a Soldier behind me and I look around. \"Most likely cause there army is dieing out and they are on there way back to Nashtonville for a final stand\" I say before pulling out my locator and I see the base is just up ahead. \"Were here\" I say before walking towards a sidewalk in what use to be a city park. I lift up one of the concrete squares to see an almost endless drop. \"Found it, Its in the city park\" I say on the Radio and almost instantly Centauri flies up and lands a few feet away before walking up to the hole and looking down it. \"500 meters\" she says and I look back down. \"Holy shit\" I say before picking up a baseball sized rock and dropping it down before putting my ear down near the hole and after awhile I hear the echo of it hitting the ground. \"Wow, We have to climb down that?\" I ask and Centauri shakes her head. \"Copy me\" she says before getting down on the latter. Centauri kicks her feet out and loosens her grip causing her to fall down the latter quickly and eventually disappearing. \"Alright men, down we go\" I say before getting onto the latter and doing what she did. I rocket down the latter the top getting smaller and smaller and I wonder where the hell I am going. The latter suddenly disappears and I find myself sliding down a slide slowly flattening out from a straight vertical drop and now becoming horizontal. The slide ends at a steel ground and I fly across the room and into some kind of padded wall before hitting the ground. \"Get up!\" says Centauri grabbing my Bullet resistant vest and yanking me out of the way just before another soldier hits the wall and then she grabs him out of the way. This lasts till everyone is down the slide and then we all look around. The roof is about 80 feet tall and infront of us is a giant steel door with a control panel to the left of it. Centauri walks up to the control panel before pulling out a cord from her wrist and plugging it into the Control panel and 4 seconds later the door opens revealing 20 scientists wielding plasma rifles They go to fire but see Centauri and lower there weapons. \"Its about time....\" says a female Scientist before they all walk out from the steel door. Deeper into the base I can see work tables and computers with doors leading somewhere. \"We need to escort you all out of here, we will come back for the weaponry after Nashtonville is destroyed\" says Centauri and I would have expected her to command us to haul out 80 crates of rifles but this is even better. \"Thank god\" says a Man with short white hair and glasses and I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we all get outside we find Soldiers everywhere of all races waiting for us and a ship waiting to take the scientists to LUNA. \"Mission complete\" says Centauri which I hear on my Radio as well and I smiling knowing its time to take out Nashtonville.</span></div></div>",

It is long and wide with 8 thick monster truck like tires on both sides. It is Midnight black in color and all over it are Plasma, laser, 75 caliber, 50 caliber machine guns and who knows what else all over it. \"Oh shit\" I say before it begins to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nI floor the gas pedal while Andreas, Cinder and 8 other soldiers control the guns and open fire on the buildings of Nashtonville and all the soldiers we see. \"HAHA!!! 4 WHEEL DRIVE?! HOWS ABOUT 16 WHEEL DRIVE FUCKERS!!!\" Yells one of the soldiers while firing a 75 caliber cannon at the buildings. The truck we are in has armor thicker than a tanks and it stands a giant 10 feet. It is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide and is controlled by a joystick. We crush Cars, Send tanks flipping over and even crash through an entire 2 story house with no effort at all from this big beast of a machine as we drive. I look forward at the Nashtonville capital building and I smile knowing I will finally get my victory for what Nashton has done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Andreas' point of view).<br>\r\nI turn the mini gun turret forward and I begin firing at a group of Soldiers firing missiles at us and I begin pulling the trigger causing them all to get ripped to shreds from the bullets. I get out of the Mini gun seat and I climb up onto a cannon that we haven't used yet and I take aim at a tank driving towards us. When I pull the trigger the vehicle we are in is blown back from the force of the cannon and the tank is completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Centauri's point of view).<br>\r\nI crash through Albert Nashton's office window and I aim my wrist gun at him only to be blown back outside from a shock rifle one of his soldiers was using and I begin falling towards the ground. \"Warning Raise altitude, Warning Raise altitude!\" says my systems before I crash through the roof of a house and I crash through the second floors floor and I crash down onto a kitchen table. \"Damage Critical, Battery leakage Critical, Warning Warning warning warning\" says my systems and I struggle to sit up before I stand up slowly and then I try to move my right arm but it sparks and shuts off. \"Dammit\" I say before sitting down in a chair and I plug my cord into the wall to keep myself from shutting down. The sky is on its way to dusk and its beginning to rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\n\"IN COMING!!!\" yells one of the soldiers before a tank crashes into the side of the vehicle causing it to flip over and fall into a fountain. All of us fly across the interior of the vehicle and we slap against the wall before water begins to flood into the interior. \"We need assistance!\" I say onto the radio. \"We are here\" says Percival on the Radio and I am surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nashtonville soldier's point of view).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHA!! we got them!!\" I yell running over to the armored vehicle as it begins raining hard but I notice all my fellow soldiers have stopped and are staring up at the building tops. I look up and I stare with shock when I see hundreds of people wearing black coats on one side and hundreds of people wearing white robes on the other, All of them holding assault rifles and staring down at us. \"Fuck me\" I say before they begin opening fire on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Night's point of view).<br>\r\nI aim down at the Nashtonville soldiers and we all begin firing at once. My coat soaks up the water like a sponge from the Rain and the Soldiers below us begin falling rapidly. Some try taking cover but there is nowhere to hide when you have people shooting at you in all directions. Within seconds the 1 hundred soldiers are laying dead with there blood now running down the road into Sewer drains. Me and all the other soul catcher look up at the Vinichi's and all of us just stare at each other before nodding we give them a bow and they give us a salute before we all turn around and begin walking away in the Rain. For the first time The Soul Catchers and the Vinichi's have killed the same people, And we love doing what we do because were damn good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nI open the hatch of the vehicle to find all the Nashtonville soldiers lying dead on the ground full of bullet holes. \"Percival?\" I ask on the radio but he is gone. \"Come on, Were not far from the Capital building\" I say before helping everyone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance is heavily guarded\" says Cinder looking at the lobby which is full of soldiers waiting for us. \"What do we do?\" she asks and I think before looking around the bodies. \"I got it\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nashtonville general's point of view).<br>\r\nI pace back and forth before I hear a loud <i>BANG!</i> and I turn around before seeing a missile fly towards us. \"SHIT!\" I shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\nThe lobby to the capital building explodes sending glass flying everywhere infront of it and causing a fire to ignite inside. \"Stay here, Nashton is mine\" I say and everyone protests but I silence them. \"Let me\" I say firmly and they all sigh but nod before I sprint towards the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run inside the Nashton capital building before I look at the elevator finding it destroyed so i sprint to the stairs. 2 Soldiers run down the stairs and I use my Demonic arm to blast them back with an invisible force through a window before I begin sprinting up the stairs with my pistol in my hand. I turn the corner and time slows again before I fire 2 rounds into a soldiers head and he collapses before I begin sprinting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>45 minutes later.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crash through the top floor door and I begin sprinting down the hallway towards Nashton's office, his soldiers' blood all over me from the fighter and I turn the corner before grabbing a soldier with my Robotic arm and I throw him out the window causing him to fall to his dead. I press my back up against the wall before loading in my last clip and I turn the corner before my adrenalin kicks in again and I send a bullet through 3 soldiers heads. I sprint down the hallway quickly before I kick open Nashton's door revealing him sitting at his desk. \"Hello Marco\" he says with a smile and I seethe with anger.</span></div></div>",

That would be just great.\u201d I say and he grunts in disproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that-\u201c he begins but I stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you did, without fear of a higher power means no one can be afraid of getting caught unless someone wants to be a vigilante.\u201d I say and he gets pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough.\u201d He yells quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is pointless, either way, one of us isn\u2019t leaving this room alive.\u201d He says and stands up. I get ready in case he tries anything and he does. He kicks his desk at me and it slides at me, where I throw my gun into the air and as soon as the desk gets close, I raise my arms into the air and I slam it down onto the desk, breaking it in half and flinging the pieces top both sides of the room. I grab my gun as it comes down and I aim it at him but he managed to pull out some laser pistols and aim them at me as well. I quickly take a look at my surroundings to see it is two stories high and two stories wide as well with not much furniture in it, mostly just a few chairs and a sofa. I look up to see some lights hanging that illuminate the room. I smile and lower my weapon, confusing Nashton. I suddenly jump to the left and I aim my pistol into the air and begin shooting out the lights, with the help of my adrenaline rush of course. The lights all shatter, darkening the room and having broken, hot glass rain down onto the floor. The room is now pitch black except for the lightning that thunders and briefly lights up the room through the massive stain glass window that\u2019s as high as the room itself. Lightning continues to light up the room briefly every few seconds. Nashton tries to find me but he only sees me a second before I disappear and he just misses and wastes ammo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fucked with the wrong family Nashton, now you will pay for everything you\u2019ve done to me, my love, my family and my friends!!\u201d I yell and he looks to try and find where I shouted from but he can\u2019t find me. I come up from behind him with my sword scraping against the ground, making sparks fling out, and I cut his back. He groans and turns around and shoots at where I was but I am already gone. I come by again and cut his face, he does the same thing again and we continue this charade until his entire body is cut up pretty bad. Since he\u2019s weak and breathing hard, I take a closer look around the room and notice a chandelier high at the top of the ceiling, and what looks like some construction catwalks just outside the window, along with a rope hanging to the base of the window from another catwalk above the window. I smile, knowing that if I\u2019m going to kill Nashton, I\u2019m going to make it an example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour reign of terror will end Nashton, with your death!\u201d I yell and he looks around but when he looks in front, I appear and I kick him to the window. He groans and stumbles back where the rope hits the back of his neck. I close the distance between us and he tries to shoot me but I grab his wrist and I break it, making him drop his gun and yell in pain. I bring my right knee up and I hit his stomach, making him bend over and cough. I quickly grab the rope and I wrap it around his neck a few times and I disappear before he can stab me with knife he pulled out from his pocket with his good hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done too many things Nashton, none of them good! I will make sure that everyone\u2019s death will not be in vain! I will kill you Nashton!\u201d I yell and he is about to try and get the rope off but I appear behind him and I grab his shoulders and throw him to the window, making the window crack and slamming him against it. I go right up to him and I break his other wrist so he can\u2019t use it, and I slam my arm against his neck, making the window crack even more. I close my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIl signore non mostra misericordia sulla vostra anima. Pu\u00f2 egli giudicare la punizione per le vostre azioni. Pu\u00f2 egli vegli su coloro la cui tormentata dalle vostre azioni! Requiescat in pace... vi mostro! (May the lord show no mercy on your soul. May he judge your punishment by your actions. May he watch over those whose tormented by your actions! Rest in peace... you monster!)\u201d I yell and I take my arm off and I take a step back and I kick him, breaking the window and sending him flying out the window down a 15-story drop as he yells as he falls. The rain begins hitting me and now I want everyone to know what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!\u201d I yell at the top of my longs, as lightning lights up the entire sky, to get everyone\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Cinder\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nI stop shooting because I heard a loud yell and I look to where it came from and see Nashton\u2019s building, along with someone falling and someone standing at the window. I use some binoculars to see its my husband at the window and the body stops falling in midair and I look to see its Nashton with a rope around his neck and he\u2019s not moving at all, suggesting the rope and gravity severed his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVittoriaaaaaaa!! (Victoryyyyyyy!!)\u201d I hear and see Marco yelling it with his sword in the air. I smile and look back at the soldiers I was fighting and I see they are dropping their weapons. I hear more people cheering and I begins to smile even more and chuckle, knowing that this torment is finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Marco\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nAfter I yell victory in Italian, I give a sigh of relief and I notice the rope beginning to strain. I hear a crash and notice the catwalk above that\u2019s outside falling and it goes past me. I watch as it falls and notice a rope being pulled with it, not Nashton\u2019s. I follow it and it goes right to a loop of rope that I stepped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCazzo (Fuck)\u201d I say before I am pulled with it, dropping my sword and lifting my gun from my holster. I continue to fall, past Nashton\u2019s dead body and there is nothing I can grab on. The roof of a four-story building with a hole in it comes close to me and I bring my arms up and I crash through the roof, making me break the guard I have up with arms, then my shoulder hits the floor and I continue to crash through the other floors until I land on my back with a devastating pain. I give off a groan of pain as my vision blurs but I see something coming down on me. I yell in pain as a couple small steel pipes lodge themselves in my robotic arm and leg. I grab the pipe in my arm with my demonic arm and I rip it out and chuck it. I then grab the one in my leg and take it out as well but both my limbs are now unable to move but the pain is still there and hurting. I lay back and my vision continues to blur up until I see something reaching for me. I take its hand, which is cold, and it helps me up onto a chair. My vision clears up a bit and I see its Centauri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d I say wearily and she blinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is it done?\u201d she asks and I can tell she is damaged pretty badly. I am about to say something but a body falls right at my feet and through its mangled face, I can tell its Nashton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d I say and we chuckle a bit. I quickly stop from the pain and I look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCentauri\u2026 I still hate you for what you did\u2026 but everything happens for a reason, whether it\u2019s the will of the lord himself, or fate itself. Let\u2019s just agree to do everything we can to keep the peace, alright?\u201d I ask and she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright but I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019ll live after this, people still want my head.\u201d She says and I chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll deal with that.\u201d I say and she looks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d she asks and now the pain is starting to be too much to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026 trust me Centauri\u2026 just\u2026 trust me.\u201d I say the last part under my breath before I fall unconscious because of the pain.</span></div></div>",

In other news the votes for Centauri's termination has come in leaving 84% of Earth 1 citizens feeling she should be terminated...\" she says before continuing and Centauri shuts the T.V off. \"What is your plan?\" she asks looking at me and I know I am suppose to save her, Even though she kind of ruined my life, But she has laid her trust in me so I need to help. \"Well....\" I say thinking and she sighs. \"You don't have a plan....Do you?\" she asks and I nod. \"I have one, But its unlikely\" I say and she looks confused. \"Tell me\" she says and I suck it up and tell her. \"If Earth 1 Signed over Ownership of you to Me and we made you an ally with the Wolfkin, Zugot's and Sakia then Earth 1 would not have any right over your fate\" I say and Centauri stares at me for a second. \"Ill have to....talk to Caroline\" she says before exiting the room and I lean back against the cold black metal wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns in about an hour holding a paper thin box which she opens on the table and pulls out a piece of paper and a pen. \"Whats that?\" I ask. \"My ownership form, The last person who signed this was my Creator, When you sign this my directive switches and I must then protect you and those you love\" she says and I pick up the pen before looking at her and then I read it over. It states that she is not a slave and must be respected with the respect she gives me and it tells me that every week she must be ordered to go to the nearest government office for an upgrade, It also shows me all of her codes. I press the pen to the paper and I sign. \"Thank you\" says Centauri and I nod before handing her the piece of paper and she takes it before walking out of the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Marco's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Thank god its over\" says Cinder who is sitting beside me on the bed. We are in a spaceship hovering over Earth 2 which serves a magnificent view of the giant planet. The Overseer is offering land to Citizens of earth 1 on Earth 2 as more payment for Centauri's mistakes, She is being Replaced by 2 Robots named Apocalypse and Stellar which are similar to Centauri's model but not as advanced full. They don\u2019t have the ability of Free will and free thought that Centauri has but will serve as excellent guardians for the Overseer from what Centauri has stated. I asked what Centauri will be doing and she has said that it is up to me, She can guard my family for as long as my family wishes or I can dismiss her, If I dismiss her then she must look after herself and get her upgrades herself. She will pretty much be a rogue robot which are extremely rare since the government never likes giving up there toys, so as much as I want her to become truly free and not shackled to me, I don\u2019t want her to be totally cut off from the government so I think her current situation will suffice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, It\u2019s finally Over\" I say looking out the window at the giant Ocean on Earth 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you more than anything, And in a weird way I am glad all this happened\" I say and she looks slightly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?, Millions of people have been massacred by the Government and Nashtonville so....\" begins Cinder but I stop her with a passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean it like that, I mean I am glad that I met you\" I say with a chuckle and she smiles before the two of us begin kissing passionately and I lay down ontop of her and she wraps her arms around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slip my hand underneath her bra to massage her left breast and she lets out a moan of pleasure while we kiss. I break the kiss to so I can look at her breasts as I undress her. I take off her bra and I begin massaging both breasts, eliciting another moan from her as  she squirms under my actions. I stop and she breathes heavily as I begin unbuckling my pants while she does the same leaving the two of us in our underwear. We kiss again but after a few seconds I begin kissing down her body. I reach her thighs and I smile before slowly removing her panties. She lifts her legs up to allow me to take them off easier before she removes my boxers and I pull the blanket over us. The two of us begin kissing again with each of us rubbing in between the others legs. I rub her pussy lips gently till she begins getting wet while she strokes my rod. I lay down on top of Cinder and I ready myself for the initial penetration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d I ask and she responds by shoving her tongue back into my mouth. She soon breaks it and she looks flushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it.\u201d She says and I slowly push into her. I reach her hymen and I give her a kiss before I thrust forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mutter Ficker!!!! (Mother Fucker!!!!)\" screams Cinder at the top of her lungs before she digs her nails into my shoulder as I gently bite her neck, causing a slight bit of pain for the both of us but mostly her. I allow her to let the pain ease up before I begin thrusting slowly at first, hearing the enticing moans as she cries out in pleasure under me as I kiss her. Our tongues wrap around each other as I begin speeding up, making her cross her legs and arms on my back. The two of us begin breathing faster and faster as Cinder lets out a few quiet moans from the pleasure. I begin thrusting faster as my climax begins coming up and she locks her hips around me as her pussy locks around my cock as I begin jack hammering as best as I can into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ich bin Cumming!!\" shouts Cinder her hips rocking as I reach my climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh god!\" is all I can say as I blast my cum deep into her pussy. She moans loudly as I shoots ropes of my thick cum into her, our juices mixing together in her warm love tunnel. My orgasm soon stops and we both continue to pant, my head resting on her breast as I feel the rapid heart beating of her that slowly comes to a slow steady beat. I roll off of Cinder, sweat dripping down my forehead and I smile before the two of us kiss and then I grab her where the two of us cuddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too\" she says back and I rub her stomach, source of where are love will soon be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready for what\u2019s gonna come later in nine months?\u201d I ask and she smiles before giving me a quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith you at my side, we can overcome anything that anyone can throw at us, even ourselves.\u201d She says and I kiss her before we hold each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night my love.\u201d she says and falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night.\u201d I say and fall asleep.</span></div></div>",
