You sat back in your desk and sighed as the realization hit you, there was no more drive, no spirit, it was just toil to stay alive and that was it. You heard the familiar buzzer your company's clock gave off when it was quitting time. Sighing again you stand up and start heading for the elevator so you can head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" you freeze as you hear your boss' voice, turning around he walks up a small smile on his lips. \"How's everything going?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine....no problems\" you reply really unsure of why he was talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a favour\" he says, the smile on his facing growing. You prepare for the inevitable phrase \"you have to work unpaid overtime, I need you to come in early\" that sort of thing and even prepare to sigh. Your boss however holds out a pair of basketball tickets \"here, my wife got me these so I could take someone to a game since, for some reason she thought I was into basketball. I couldn't just refuse her, so I'm giving them to you\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....thanks\" you reply taking the tickets and just staring at them for a few seconds. \"Hey wait who am I supposed to...\" by the time you were done the sentence your boss had rune off and you were left there. You get into the elevator and examine the ticket, it was at the local stadium tonight, however who were the \"Toonville Tornadoes,\" you shrug thinking it must be some sort of advertising gimmick and walk out of the elevator as it reaches ground level. You head home, a simple apartment, one bedroom, small living room like area and a kitchen. It wasn't much and it certainly wasn't a palace but it was home. Getting changed out of your work clothes, and into something more casual, just a shirt and a pair of pants you head out for the basketball game, although basketball isn't exactly your favourite sport you figure that you might as well enjoy yourself. Running out of your apartment and to the bus stop you're just able to make the bus heading to the stadium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the stadium you rush in as you hear a buzzer, quickly giving the guard your ticket you race past him just finding your seat in the stadium as the lights go off. You look around for a second confused until two spotlights focus on one side of the court and you realize they were introducing the teams. You didn't pay that much attention as your home team was introduced, all you knew about them was they were just your average basketball team and that was it. Your head however perked up as the other team was introduced as you didn't know anything about them, thankfully your boss got average seats so you weren't just looking down on them from the rafters. Everything seemed normal until the last member of the team walked out onto the court, and you couldn't help but stare as you saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the fact that it was a girl that made you stare, it was a combination of factors. To start off she looked like she was half the size of everyone else, maybe 3'4\" if that. Second was her appearance, as she was covered in what looked to be tan fur from the top of her ears to the soles of her feet. Her ears had to be about a foot long, much longer than her blonde hair, they were held out of the way behind her, tied together by a purple band of some kind. Her face even looked different, a small pinkish nose in the center instead of a normal one. The ref blew his whistle and both sides had their players stand for the jump and suprisingly the rabbit or bunny or whatever she was girl stood facing a guy twice her size. The whistle was blown and she leapt up grabbing the ball out of the air and landing on her feet before jumping up just as high again, letting the ball go. Your eyes as well as everyone else's followed that ball as it flew through the air and with a swish, landed in the basket. The entire stadium, you included erupted into cheers as every player on the court and the ref stood dazed for a second before the game resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the game went along in much the same fashion, amazing basket after amazing basket was scored one after the other. It was a complete blowout, you weren't a huge hometown fan but even the people who showed up in the town's colors were smiling as they got out of their seats and walked out of the building. You were completely blown away, in fact for once in the last couple of months you felt that something interesting was happening. At the very least you felt that you had to go talk to this girl and congratulate her. It wasn't that hard to separate from the rest of the crowd and head to the back entrances of the building, since there were only two exits. You near the doors for a while rubbing your hands to keep them warm in the nippy winter air. One by one or in groups the players started to come out, although that was after thirty minutes. Finally she stuck her head out the door, literally she stuck her head out and looked around, although she somehow missed you before walking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...excuse me\" you say, her body freezing as she hears your voice, she turns around as you walk forward and this time she definitely notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello\" she says a small frown on her face turning into a smile as she realizes you're not a reporter, even though she has to look up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was one hell of a game you played, I've never seen basketball like that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...thanks, most people who talk about my game, normally don't compliment me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it because you're a girl?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partially, well that and, how I look\" she replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bend over so it's easier to talk with her \"the whole bunny thing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" she replies. \"So is there any other reason you followed me back here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...not really, just to congratulate you on a game well played\" you say. She nods and seems to think for a moment, \"have you ever taken on a professional before?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....no\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile grows bigger \"would you like to? The stadium's still open, so we could have a one-on-one\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took on guys that were all bigger and better than me, how am I supposed to take you on?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared of a little girl bunny?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the basketball court, yes I am\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smile breaks into a huge grin \"well you're at least honest\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're that free, you want to go have something to eat? I'll pay\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but you should at least tell me your name\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, nice to meet you....\" you trailed off unable to remember her name when it was announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lola, Lola bunny\" she replies. You stand back up and start walking, you assume she starts following you as she quickly sidles up next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you go to dinner with every fan who offers?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the ones who offer, which you're the first\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly, \"so why aren't you going to celebrate with your teammates?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs \"they think I'm a show-off, most didn't even want to let me on the team in the first place\" she replies. You nod, the rest of the walk becoming quite silent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael\u2019s eyes roamed the computer screen, profiles ont the website in front of him flying past him although each was scanned in turn. The profiles ranged from the simplistic with usernames like Kelly12 and a picture of the woman\u2019s face to the downright lascivious. What a woman with the username MILFMistress; her picture looking as would be expected, was doing on a normal dating website was beyond him. Page after page flew past him as lead after lead turned up empty, most of the women who interested him either hadn\u2019t signed into the website for several months or were so obviously manufactured it was insulting. Sighing in defeat he collapsed back into his chair, with a swivel of the mouse his cursor was on the red X to shut down the page when \u201cping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMouseGirl would like to chat\u201d the textbox appeared in the centre of his screen, the usual flashing red NO ad green YES buttons sitting beneath the text. He took a moment to examine the woman\u2019s profile picture and he had to admit it confused him. Every profile he\u2019d seen on the site so far had either the person\u2019s face, or if they were trying to attract attention a close-up of the body, but MouseGirl didn\u2019t. Her picture was of a large blue bow on top of something black with the edges of what he had to assume were two large black circles just fitting into the picture. He took a few moments to think about it before deciding to throw caution to the wind and clicked yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another ping and a small chat window appeared in the bottom left corner of his screen. It didn\u2019t take long before \u201cping,\u201d MouseGirl sent her first message and the chat began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there \uf04a I\u2019m pretty new to the site, and you seemed like a nice guy so I thought you\u2019d like to chat.\u201d Michael was a bit taken aback for a second by the brutal honesty\u2026or naivety of whoever he was taking to, but he wasn\u2019t about to fail their expectations of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so highly of me, although I\u2019m pretty new to this site myself\u201d he replied, his mouse flicked up to open a new tab \u201cmore info couldn\u2019t hurt\u201d he muttered as he looked up the girl\u2019s name and subsequently her profile. Several clicks and keystrokes later he had her profile up and it was\u2026blank, rather where there should have been information were instead miniature lock icons. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t she want people to see\u201d he muttered, the site had a privacy feature, but this was the first time he\u2019d ever seen it used. \u201cI wonder if\u2026.\u201cping\u201d\u2019 the sound drew his attention back to the chat window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing on the site?\u201d the question caught him off guard as he knew why he was on the site but it was a bit embarrassing. \u2018Better to be honest from the start\u2019 Michael thought as he began to type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOriginally, I didn\u2019t really have any interest in the site; my parents actually went behind my back and made this account because they thought I had been \u201clonely\u201d long enough. Since they went to all the trouble I decided to give it a chance. Why are you on this site?\u201d He was left waiting for almost an entire minute for her reply but when it arrived it was a full story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026it started out with our dates, simple things like the fact he\u2019d pack a nice lunch and we\u2019d have a picnic ad that was it, but that was the only date we\u2019d ever had and there\u2019s only so many times you can eat tomato sandwiches and sit on the same hill before it gets boring. When he finally did start taking us out for other dates he\u2019d always bring his friends along with us. He never seemed to understand my hints that we should be alone! After that he started to be late for our dates and after that began to forget them entirely, I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore so I broke up with him!!....\u201dsigh\u201d\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had to pause for several seconds as he read the entire story, he hadn\u2019t exactly expected something this serious and wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to react to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, I can\u2019t say I really understand what you\u2019re going through as I\u2019ve never really been in a relationship before. But since you seemed to do everything you could to keep the relationship together it\u2019s really his fault, and if he\u2019s foolish enough to let someone like you go then that\u2019s his loss. I\u2019m sure once you find that guy who truly appreciates you then you\u2019ll be happy together.\u201d He had to admit that the reply was cheesy, and he probably overstepped his bounds given that they hadn\u2019t even known each other an hour, but she seemed nice enough and\u2026.\u201cping\u201d there was her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMouseGirl would like to make you a \u201cprivate\u201d friend, do you accept?\u201d Michael only took a moment to pause before accepting, the acceptance he knew would open up her entire profile to him, and his to her. Looking back to her profile he was surprised by a few things he saw, but the most intriguing thing was her real name. \u201cMinnie Mouse\u201d he muttered to himself, it was certainly a unique name as Mouse wasn\u2019t a last name he\u2019d ever heard before. Besides her name the only other noteworthy piece of information was the fact that they lived in the same city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPing\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were a younger man\u2026.is 30 years old too old for you?\u201d He had to take a while to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs 23 too young for you?\u201d Michael replied as he honestly didn\u2019t mind the age difference, but it was a two-way street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026No, I don\u2019t mind\u201d was Minnie\u2019s quick reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t either, why do you ask?\u201d He had an idea, but considering how little they really knew of each other he wasn\u2019t exactly entertaining that thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo reason\u2026what would you ideal date be?\u201d Minnie\u2019s question wasn\u2019t exactly out of left field given what she had told him about her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026if I had the chance to meet the right woman I\u2019d start off by taking her out to a movie, her choice. After that I\u2019d take her out to a nice restaurant and show her a good time. Finally I guess we\u2019d just go take a stroll through the local park under the moonlight.\u201d He had to admit that it was as stereotypical a date plan as was possible, but it was the only real plan he knew of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.Are you free on Saturday?\u201d Michael physically pushed his chair back as he read the question; the meaning behind those words was plain even to someone as dense as him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.are you implying what I think you\u2019re implying\u201d he replied hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did say that I was looking for someone new, and you seem quite kind. You listened to me tell my sob story and you haven\u2019t tried to push me or been rude in anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael pushed back from his computer as he thought the proposal over, on the one hand they\u2019d barely even met each other, he had no idea what he actually knew of her and didn\u2019t even know what she looked like. On the other hand the only real thing he\u2019d lose would be time, well that and like\u2026$120-$150, ok the money loss bothered him but nothing was ever gained without first taking action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does 5:30 sound to you? Although you wouldn\u2019t happen to have a car would you?\u201d he replied. He hated asking that question but he still didn\u2019t have a vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe time sounds fine, and I have a car. I know your address from your profile so I\u2019ll pick you up, see you Saturday \uf04a\u201d With that reply Minnie signed off and Michael was left sitting there for several moments. \u201cI guess I have a date\u201d he muttered to himself as he fell back into his chair. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robert couldn\u2019t help but sigh in relief as the cool autumn breeze wafted over him. It was one of the few positives of walking to work; however it was also a harbinger of the snow to come. The dreaded white flakes turned his normal five minute stroll into a half an hour trudge as no one ever thought about those who had to walk in winter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBzzzzttt\u201d the sound of the streetlight turning on startled him almost as much as the flash of light right in his face; there was no way it was that late was there? He had been asked to stay back to get some extra paperwork done, but it had proceeded smoothly and he was uninterrupted as he worked. With a shake of his head and an exasperated sigh he continued on, nothing he could do about it now. Slowly his pace increased to a slow jog as all he wanted to do now was get home and relax until \u201cWAGHHHHGHHH\u201d the scream came from his left, cutting through the stillness of the night he watched as silhouettes appeared in the windows of the homes neighbouring the one the scream originated from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral moments later the door to the home burst open and a woman came running out sobbing hysterically, she barrelled past him the two of them almost colliding. As she rushed past he saw something strange, it looked like she had a\u2026beak? Looking back to the house he saw a male figure back-lit in the doorway before \u201cslam\u201d it the door was closed abruptly. Turning to face the direction the woman had run off in he felt a gnawing in the pit of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018you should go help her\u2019 his consciousness spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019ve got nothing to do with this\u2019 Robert chided himself however just saying that felt\u2026wrong. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to regret this\u201d he mumbled conceding to his conscious. He took off after the woman the sound of her sobs the only thing he needed to follow. He found her sitting on one of the park benches quietly sobbing. As he now had the time to examine her he was able to see she was a woman of above-average height with a slightly hourglass figure. Her outfit was composed of a simple light blue t-shirt and a midnight blue vest and a skirt. The light blue vest hugged her modest chest while the skirt accented her wider hips. However there were a few things that bothered him as he stared at the woman. She seemed to be covered head to...webbed foot in bright white plumage. Well she wasn\u2019t completely covered in white plumage; her long slender legs were covered in the same orange material that made up her feet. Further adding to her very \u201cduck-ish\u201d appearance was the fact she had a beak extending about 2 inches from her face. The only normal thing about her was the ponytail that fell down to her shoulder composed of her white hair, the colour of her hair being the obvious abnormality of that attribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem\u201d her head snapped up at the sound and to his surprise she hurriedly made to wipe away the tears. \u201cMiss are you alright?\u201d he asked taking a seat next to her on the bench. After several seconds and no reply he decided to press forward \u201cI heard a loud yell and next thing I know you\u2019re barreling past me in tears, who exactly was it that was yelling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonald, he\u2019s my boyfriend\u201d she replied hesitantly, her voice low as her eyes darted around the park like she expected him to pop out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem a bit\u2026nervous, is there a problem?\u201d Robert didn\u2019t exactly want to get involved but considering her actions he couldn\u2019t just leave her as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO, no Donald might yell and stomp around but he\u2019d never go any further than that\u201d she replied although whether it was to convince him or herself he wasn\u2019t entirely sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so\u201d he replied leaning back on the bench \u201cso I know we\u2019ve just met, but I\u2019m Robert\u201d he said sitting up and smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaisy duck\u201d she replied demurely. His eyebrow rose at her last name, but it kind of explained her\u2026unique physical features.  here were several moments of silence as the two of them sat there. Neither seemed willing to make the first move until the sound of a garbage lid falling to their left startled both of them. Robert looked down as he felt a weight settle on his side, Daisy pressing against him, her fingers digging into his shirt. She looked up and with a gasp quickly pulled back \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright\u201d he replied smiling gently at her \u201cI know this isn\u2019t really my place, but you seem really jumpy. Are you sure nothing\u2019s happened?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO\u201d she yelled in reply bursting from the bench \u201cnothing happened and it never will; I already said that. Donald, Donald would never hurt me\u2026he wouldn\u2019t\u201d her voice became quieter as she spoke however she couldn\u2019t meet his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing Robert could do after a reply like that. Feeling around in his pocket he pulled out a card and after a several seconds of searching in his coat he pulled out a pen \u201chere\u2019s my number and address, I know it\u2019s not exactly much, but if something ever happens\u2026\u201d he trailed off as he held out the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was quite surprised as despite her insistence that there wasn\u2019t and never would be any problems she took the card from his hand and placed it inside a shirt pocket. \u201cThank you, not many people would stop and pay attention to a girl crying by herself let alone help someone they didn\u2019t know like this.\u201d He was surprised as her beak which itself being surprisingly soft pressed against his cheek for a moment. He just had time to reach up and touch his cheek and she was already gone, running off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.I guess that\u2019s that\u201d Robert muttered to himself, hopefully she\u2019d never need to use the card that he gave her. Whether he was thinking that simply because that meant her relationship was well or because he honestly wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d handle another meeting with Daisy he couldn\u2019t say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head he jogged back home, the one-bedroom bungalow was to him quite spacious, the front door led to the entranceway with the kitchen straight ahead and the living room to his left. Sighing he pulled his shoes off and turning down the hallway to the right walked past the bathroom to his bedroom. He collapsed onto the bed and simply lay there for several moments as he let the events of the day wash over him as he finally had time to take everything in. He flipped over and stared at the ceiling for several moments before letting out an exasperated sigh. \u201cI got involved in some sort of domestic problem I had nothing to do with, and I even gave the woman my home address. That is s going to come back and bite me in the ass later I just know it\u201d he muttered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing he got up and headed for the kitchen \u201cnothing I can do about it now, I\u2019ll just deal with that when and if it comes to anything.\u201d Slowly Robert got back up and headed for the kitchen, after preparing a few simple sandwiches he quickly devoured them. Not having anything better to do he plopped himself down on the couch in the middle of his living room and watched a few hours of television. Glancing at the clock on the wall he realized that it was fairly late. It didn\u2019t take long to walk back into his bedroom and get changed into his pajamas as well as crawl into bed. After several seconds of adjusting his position on the bed Robert yawned tiredly and reaching over to the lamp extinguished the light.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacob was just enjoying his dinner, the restaurant which he was currently attending was what he\u2019d like to call a \u201cmiddle-class\u201d affair as while certainly not a 5 star restaurant there was an atmosphere to the building, one of calm and relaxation as the patrons simply enjoyed their meal. The calm however was broken by a comical yell, Jacob\u2019s head snapping up from his meal as it reverberated through his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards the source of the sound he noticed something unusual about the patrons sitting at the table, a male and female pair, the man dressed in a suit-jacket and a black shirt, with matching dress pants, the woman was dressed in a long sky-blue dress with a slit on the side revealing long legs purple heels around her long swan-like neck was what looked like a cowbell necklace, both patrons wore white gloves but that didn\u2019t seem too out of place. The only words he could use were the woman was a cow, and the man was a dog.  Normally this would be meant as an insult but in this case it was meant literally as the woman had the horns and face of a cow while the man had the ears and face of a dog. These weren\u2019t the only differences from a normal person however as both had what he could only describe as \u201cink black\u201d bodies, except for the cow woman\u2019s muzzle and the dog man\u2019s snout which were both cream coloured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog man seemed to be apologizing about a spilled bowl of soup, the cause of the yell from earlier. The waiter while glaring daggers at him from what Jacob could hear was assuring the man in response that it was an accident and that it would be no trouble to take care of it. The dog man didn\u2019t seem to accept that answer however and went to pick up the bowl the soup had been spilled from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was something that could only be described as \u201ccartoonish\u201d, as reaching for the bowl the dog man slipped in a puddle of soup, another comical yell leaving his throat as he slipped and toppled backwards. Yet as he slipped there was a much louder sound, a loud \u201crip\u201d and then silence as all eyes of the restaurant had fallen upon the cow woman, her dress lay in the dog man\u2019s hand, she being left in nothing but a matching purple bra and panty set as well as her heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he hadn\u2019t been able to completely hear the earlier exchange Jacob, the entire restaurant, and probably those on the street heard what was said next. Vitriolic wasn\u2019t a good enough word to be used for the furious tirade that left the cow woman\u2019s mouth, several people that had been nearby and had stood up to help physically retreated as she went off into her furious tirade. Finally she was escorted to the back, presumably for the restaurant to figure something out about getting her home without having to walk mostly naked down the street and like that it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaiter, check please\u201d Jacob called, as while the incident had certainly been interesting, it had killed his appetite, surprisingly it was the waiter who had been helping the couple that came up to his table, the man\u2019s cheeks flushed crimson as he silently handed the check to Jacob. In a few seconds the debt was settled and Jacob headed for the exit, just catching a glimpse of the cow woman leaving through a back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back home he passed his neighbours place, the large 2 story home didn\u2019t look much different than any other on the street, except for the large bay windows which provided a glimpse into living-room of the home and the hedge walls separating it from the homes on either side of it. Looking up he saw a light on in what Jacob had to assume was the master bedroom, the owner of the home had always been a mystery to him, whether due to scheduling or sheer coincidence the two had never met despite being neighbours for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging Jacob turned and walked back to his own home. Walking in the front door he followed his nightly routine, showered, brushed his teeth, and got ready for bed, a quick look at the alarm clock indicated that his alarm was indeed off as the next day was Saturday, one of his two days off. The light of morning came all too quickly in Jacob\u2019s eyes, the thin shafts of light penetrated through his bedroom window and his eyes, groaning and sitting up he took a glance at the clock which read \u201c11:30.\u201d He was caught off guard at how late it was, as he had gone to bed fairly early the night before, but it was a day of rest so he wasn\u2019t overly concerned. Getting dressed in a pair of black shorts and an orange t-shirt his hazel eyes scanned his bedroom and finding nothing out of place he let out a small sigh of relief and headed downstairs. \u2018Let\u2019s see am I running low on anything\u2019 he though as he headed into the kitchen to prepare breakfast, a simple bowl of cereal. Checking the cupboards and fridge his rations weren\u2019t low but he could do with a bit more fruit. Resolving to get some, his black coat soon slid over his arms and he was out the door, taking but a moment to lock it behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a spring to his step he headed out, walking right past his neighbours house he froze in his tracks, as there was something wrong. Spinning on his heel he saw something he had never expected to see, on her hands and knees in the dirt, a trowel in one hand and a basket of bulbs sitting behind her was the cow woman from yesterday. She was dressed in a gardener\u2019s garb, a large straw hat adorned her head, jeans and a t-shirt covered her body while a pair of thicker gardening gloves and brown boots covered her hands and feet respectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe honestly wasn\u2019t sure if he should say hello as he was sure she hadn\u2019t seen him, but considering what he had seen last night he wasn\u2019t sure if he could maintain the conversation without it becoming awkward. Steeling himself he stepped forward, the cow woman\u2019s head snapping up as soon as his foot hit the grass causing him to freeze again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re the man who lives next door\u201d her voice when not ripping someone a new one was quite pleasant, quite beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think we\u2019ve honestly missed each other for years, unless someone else has been living in this house the past few years\u201d Jacob replied, leaning forward he saw that besides the woman\u2019s larger than average eyes they were\u2026black, either that or her iris was such a dark colour as to look black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance then, I\u2019m Clarabelle\u201d she said standing up and offering a gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob and the pleasure is all mine\u201d he replied, missing the slight blush that crossed Clarabelle\u2019s face as he took her hand. \u201cSo, planting some flowers? I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll look a lot better than that hedge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarabelle\u2019s face twisted at the mention of the hedge \u201cyes, I\u2019ve been meaning to replace that for years, but it\u2019s so expensive, so I thought adding some flowers would brighten the yard up a bit, make it less\u2026closed in\u201d she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need a hand?\u201d the words were out of Jacob\u2019s mouth before he really realized what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that would be just wonderful, I\u2019d love some help\u201d Clarabelle replied, a small smile spreading across her face. \u201cI already have the places I want to plant the flowers marked, if you could just dig a hole big enough for the bulb that would really help me out\u201d Clarabelle said offering up her trowel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d Jacob took the instrument and began to dig, the dirt thankfully was easy enough to move, and he quickly had first hole dug, reaching back for a bulb his hand met Clarabelle\u2019s and he pulled back \u201csorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no it was my fault\u201d she replied as the bulb was passed over. From there they developed a rhythm, with Jacob digging the holes and Clarabelle planting the bulbs behind him. The two of them working quite quickly, and in an hour and a half they had every bulb planted around the yard, Jacob falling back as he wiped some sweat from his brow. </span></div></div>",

She sniffed before asking, \"Fish nuggets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've recorded Downcat Alley,\" You said. You still were unsure how to feel about so many shows being similar to human shows, but having cat puns in the titles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie hugged you, letting you enjoy the feel of her body. Sure it was kind of furry a cat's, but still as soft as a human woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a good roommate!

Maybe work at the police force?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie stared at you for a few moments before looking upwards and tapping her chin with a finger. \"Hn... The enforcers are always looking for more help. I doubt you'll get a higher spot than a coffee go-fer and carrying a ton of papers each hour<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, lifted her hands into the air, and shrugged before saying, \"Eh, I can pull some strings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll accept it. I mean, it would help everyone out,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie looked at you with a gentle smile and let out a slight giggle. \"I hope that's the case. I mean, there's also the possibility you might be targeted by criminals like I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I do have some training to help me fight back, run, or to do anything that'll ensure we all survive,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Callie replied. \"I'll see what I can do tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded before you began to eat your fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day when Callie came back, you had made breaded fish nuggets and had gotten her favorite shows recorded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another day of good news! I got you a job at the Enforcers! Lieutenant Felina Feral will pick you up tomorrow and show you the ropes. Usually, it'd be one of someone of a lower rank, but her uncle, Commander Feral, is really mad at her , so she's grounded for a few weeks,\" Callie cheerfully announced as she entered her apartment. She sniffed before asking, \"Fish nuggets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've recorded Downcat Alley,\" You said. You still were unsure how to feel about so many shows being similar to human shows, but having cat puns in the titles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallie hugged you, letting you enjoy the feel of her body. Sure it was kind of furry a cat's, but still as soft as a human woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a good roommate! I just wish you could've been my assistant!\" Callie happily said. \"Now let's just relax, Y/N!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelina Feral picked you up and was driving you to work. You were dressed in polo shirt and pants, as well as a 'trainee' badge <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drove, Felina said,\"Alright, You'll mostly be getting me coffee, shifting through papers, delivering papers, and so on. Mostly because we'll be in the boring section of enforcer HQ. You'll also be working with others when the situation calls for it. Chances are that'll be it'll just be a boring day. But in the event that it isn't, any skills with a weapon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stun pistols and rifles. Stun grenades... Some training with clubs,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelina frowned and uttered, \"Hn. Well, it's good that you are able to defend yourself, but you do realize that we sometimes deal with dangerous things that might mean you'll have to take a life. True, it'll usually be a blob monster of Viper's, or a darkling of Dark Kat, but you think you can handle it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, but I will have to see a counselor, afterwords,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you recognize that problem and are willing to seek help. Good answer,\" Felina commented wit a smile. \"Stick with me and I'll show you the ropes.</span></div></div>",

That's how i can get back in contact with him.\" With this new idea in mind, i began holding onto his paw as he lifted them both up into the air and onto his desk where he let them rest. Now looking at them with great intent, he asked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, if you're on one of my paws, please...lick it.\" Psych didn't even need to tell me to do that, i just gave it one great big lick, savoring the taste as much as i could while also letting Psych know i was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam! It is you! I can't sense your body anymore, but i can still feel your saliva. Please, keep licking my paws. Lick them and kiss them and do anything else you want to do with them Adam! Just don't leave my side.\" This was the first time I've seen Psych so happy, so i happily went to town on his paws and started licking, kissing, and even fucking them after i took all my clothes off. I wanted to make sure Psych stayed this way for as long as i could, so i didn't hold anything back. I rubbed my whole body all over his paws, stroking my dick and forcing it all over the pads on his paws and even climbing onto of his toes having my way with them up there. Psych was so happy, even when i came all over his paws. And i know he felt that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen i slid down his paw and onto his leg, still leaking some cum along the way. Psych felt that and knew where i was because of it. Then he offered a hand for me to climb onto. So i slowly crawled over to it, licking it once i was on it. He then lifted me up to his face while looking at his hand with deep intent before saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, i just want you to know that I've always had feelings for you, and i want to do everything i can to make sure you don't come to any further harm. So I'll list some options for things you'd like me to do, and I'll do them for you. And since i can't hear you, you just lick my lips once for the first answer, twice for the second, and three times for the third one, alright?\" Psych was even going to let me lick his lips? This felt like the greatest day of my life. I wondered what he had in store for me...</span></div></div>",

Now that the two of you are in college, you decided to move in together as roommates, rather than subject him to the rough furs and humans in the college dormitories. Life has been good with him. He's responsible, and takes care of a lot of the chores around the apartment. But you've noticed he's been acting strange lately: blushing when you ask him something, being extra nice, and yet he avoids you away from home, his face glowing red whenever he does see you outside. Does he...have feelings for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(f/m) Name: Akiko Hayashi<br>\r\nSpecies: Arctic Fox<br>\r\nAkiko was always the beautiful, smart girl out of your reach. She always kind of liked you, but was afraid to say so since other men were always offering themselves to her and breaking up later. But now, you have nowhere to go. You were fired from the one job you had, and tried to scrape together the money to pay rent. But by the time the payment was due, you moved yourself out, rather than wait for you to get in trouble with the law. You spent two awful and grudgingly slow days on the street, trying to find someone who'd hire you. But while you sat on the park bench, Akiko saw you, and decided to make conversation since it'd been forever. She was heartbroken by your troubles, and decided to let you stay with her until you could get back on your feet. Only now, she might want you to stay...</span></div></div>",

And it all started in elementary school, when Kai was sitting on the floor, crying because a group of human boys had insulted him non stop all recess. The other furs on the playground didn't stop the boys, and just let him get hurt by their words. You walked up to him slowly, and he looked up at you with suspicion through his watery eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Nao?\" He said, rubbing his eyes. \"Don't talk to me, you're just another human like those meanies...\" Kai said, turning away. You kneeled down, touching his shoulder. \"No, I'm not like them. Don't listen to them, they don't know how awesome you are! And you know what, I'll show you I'm not like them. I'll be your friend forever and ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you and Kai had grown up together. You went through the awkwardness of middle school, the stress of high school, your first jobs, your first car (and first wreck), and now you even lived together, all with him by your side. He was an incredible friend, but you had never expected him to feel this way about you.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nThe two of you were planning to go to this concert for months, and now you were finally going! You drive down the freeway, with him in the passenger seat, to the other side of town where the event is being held. He looks down, as though he's deep in thought. The orange dog was a lot like you in size, as both of you were average height and really skinny. Since it was a concert you both knew was going to involve lots of sweating, he wore a white tank top and shorts, his curled tail pressed against the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made you wonder: what was he thinking about? Lately he'd been like this, not talking quite as much. Whenever he did talk, he was either really nervous or overly nice. You focus on the road, deciding you might ask him after the night is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand with Kai in the darkness, and all around you are the excited murmurs of everyone else. The lights raise up, and the music begins to play. The crowd, including you and your friend cheer as the spotlight shows the dj. The lights start to flash in different colors, and you look at Kai under the lights, smiling with joy as the buildup begins. You both throw your hands up to the sky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're both drenched in sweat. It was a good thing you both decided to wear the minimal clothes. You decide to fill the empty silence as you both walk to the car in the huge parking lot. \"That was awesome! Just as epic as I thought it'd be.\" You say, smiling at him. \"Especially that one song that was all: 'Bom bom bom boom bom bom'\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can't help but smile at your attempt to sing the song. \"Heh, yeah...it was awesome.\" You see his tail perk up for a moment, but then it droops right back down again. He seems to be thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence lasts until the two of you get to the car. The doors close with the usual thunk. You both click the seat belts in. You're about to start the car, but then he stops you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nao...tonight was absolutely amazing...and...I think you're...\"</span></div></div>",

How many other times had she come to similar dark and dreary stores just like this one in the hopes of finding something legitimately magical? Sure, she had occasionally found something with a tiny spark of magic within, but those were few and far between. Far more common was the random bits and bobs that likely never had any connection to anything magical at all. With a muted sigh, she reminded herself that few people believed in magic anymore, and most of that small fraction were fringe weirdoes at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes whirled past as she found herself looking over the odds and ends filling the dusty shelves. It was taking long enough that she was starting to consider leaving without a word. Just as she had almost made up her mind, the stooped old raven returned, clutching an ill-maintained box in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d she rasped with a twinkle in her eyes. \u201cA rather unpleasant young man came in ranting about quite a number of things. Oh, you should have heard the peculiar things he kept talking about as if they were real.\u201d A cackle quickly turned into a coughing fit that took quite a while before she could continue. \u201cNow where was I? Ah, yes, I think it might be exactly what you are looking for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the box down on the counter, her stiff fingers struggled with the latch. Sarah wasn\u2019t very hopeful, but she couldn\u2019t stop the tingle of anticipation from spreading through her body either. After several nerve-wracking seconds, the latch finally came undone, and the lid of the box was eased back revealing\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within the box lay a small amulet. Its circular shape was dotted with a variety of gemstones and twisting between them was swirls and characters from an extremely old and rare language. The most telling part was that the tingle of anticipation the busty bovine had been feeling bloomed into an electric jolt that raced throughout her body. That feeling was well known to her, but she had never experienced quite so strongly. She reached out with trembling fingers, her eyes locked on the worn gold. Just as she was about to touch, the box was shut with a snap. Sarah yelped as her fingers were almost caught. Scowling, she looked up at the store\u2019s owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a twinkle in the old raven\u2019s eyes as she said, \u201cAh, ah, no touching. Not without talking price that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrice wasn\u2019t much of a concern to Sarah, but the outrageously inflated price the raven led with made Sarah balk. The allure of the power contained within the trinket was overwhelming though, so she began a lengthy process to haggle the price down to a more reasonable point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the store with her hard won amulet in hand, Sarah could feel the steady thrum of power flowing out of it. She wasn\u2019t even wearing it yet, so she could understand the story told by the Raven. Something this powerful could have an effect on the world around it even without someone channeling it. She could hardly resist the urge to put it on, but knew that there was risk to diving in without doing some tests first. So she hurried back to her car and drove away, heading for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the elevator, she darted across the hall and through the door. She then walked straight up to what appeared to be an ordinary wall within her home. A flutter of her fingers and a little trickle of power caused the hidden door to ease open, letting her into her inner sanctum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, she stood over the table, bleary eyed but overflowing with anticipation. She had run through every test she could and found no trace of a curse or anything else harmful. Reaching out, she plucked the amulet from the armature where she had conducted the latest tests. She then slipped the golden chain over her head and pulled her hair free, letting the chain settle against her neck. Releasing the amulet, she felt the warm metal slip down between her breasts to be almost hidden in the canyon between.</span></div></div>",

Every muscle in Sarah\u2019s body tensed and she was blinded for what felt like an eternity. Blinking her eyes and shaking her head, she instead found that not even a second had passed. In that moment though, she knew how much had changed, how much more power she could draw on now. A wave of her hand and a few quiet words and everything in her lab was cleaned up and back in its place. A smile crossed her face as she thought about what was within her reach now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chirp from her phone brought her back to the present. It was a text from her lover asking if they were still meeting up at the club tonight. After confirming that they were, Sarah retreated from her lab and sealed the door behind her. A quick snack and shower later, she swapped her casual clothes for a nice and tight club dress and was back down the elevator to her car. Pulling out onto the street, she weaved her way through the traffic across town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah skipped past the line waiting outside, drawing plenty of annoyed glances and aggravated comments. She didn\u2019t spare a moment\u2019s thought for that though. The bouncer looked irritated for a moment \u2013 squaring his shoulders and opening his mouth to go through the whole \u201cback of the line\u201d warning. Then his eyebrows shot up into his hairline as he saw just who she was. The big rhino turned much more sheepish as he apologized to Sarah and let her through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping in the door, Sarah stepped the side to let her eyes adjust to the dim light. The music thumped in her ears as she saw the center stage and the current performer: a curvy snake currently winding her way up the pole. Her tail flexed and pulsed in time, promising plenty of exquisite pleasure from the pressure. The snake was also making sure that plenty of attention was on her breasts, heaving with every motion as they were barely contained in the thin and wispy top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention away from the stage, Sarah sashayed across the room, attracting plenty of attention herself along the way. The bouncer at the VIP section was much more cordial to Sarah, greeting her and admitting her with a smile. She thanked the lion before taking a seat at one of the empty tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ordering a White Russian, Sarah spared a glance around the room. She spotted a few others she recognized and they raised a glass or tipped their head if they saw her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, I wasn\u2019t sure if you were going to make it on time,\u201d a very familiar voice said from behind Sarah, bringing a smile to the bovine\u2019s full lips.</span></div></div>",

She'd just moved into nexus city and some of the locals told her to go around and check out nexus park. They said it was lovely, until nightfall that was. Jade giggled, figuring they were scared of the dark or something. The sun was setting and Jade was not planning on leaving for another hour or two. The way the air felt on a late summer night was amazing... Not quite hot, but not cold either... It was always so soothing. A few minutes passed and Jade checked her watch, 8:46. Meh, she could be out here another hour or two. She had nothing going on so it was no skin off her back! Jade continued on for a bit, until she heard a bit of rustling in the foliage. \"Mur?\" She questioned, stopping and putting a finger to her lip. \"Oooor maybe going home right now isn't such a bad idea...\" Jade quickly began to turn around, only to run into a hulking figure towering above her. It seemed to be a large wolf, but it was bipedal and much taller than even the average human, standing maybe around... Seven and a half feet tall? It's maw dripped saliva onto the ground before her. Jade was filled with terror, unable to move, unable to speak. What was this ungodly creature? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast snarled, dripping more saliva. Then it howled, loud and high. The the beast reeled unto her, falling towards Jade, ready to snatch her up and do god knows what with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh-Ah-AHHHHHHHH!\" Jade cried out, closing her eyes and turning away. The beast howl continued but was cut off shortly after. The beast whined and growled low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay down, keep right there.\" A low voice spoke, blunt and hard, as if the man was struggling with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade merely continued to cry in response, curled up on the ground. She heard a few blunt *WHACK*s followed by a dull thud and low growling. Soon it faded away, replaced by deep breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Miss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man from before asks, placing a hand on her shoulder. Jade shivers visibly and quite badly. She was obviously very shaken up. She opened her eyes through tears that fogged her vision and looked up. The figure looking down upon her was blurred and fuzzy but she could just make out the man, green top, black pants and... A black face? Jade rubbed her eyes some more and looked back to the man. The man had dark grey fur all over his body, only covered by a green hoodie and black pants. Seven grey, white tipped tails swung behind him. Looking further up to his face Jade found it resembled that of a... A fox? Dark green eyes in the skull of a fox mixed with that of a mans. Black hair covered one eye. The natural not warm not cool air grew cold and Jade began to shake more. Her eyes twitched and her mouth opened as if she were about to scream. Then it all stopped and she fell over, losing a grip on what was going on.</span></div></div>",

Groaning and stretching to relieve his tired muscles he was about to return to the document when \u201ctap tap\u201d someone tapped him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey workaholic\u201d turning to face the voice Michael came face to face with Evan, his co-worker and friend. Evan unlike Michael was adored in a more casual outfit rather than business-wear. Michael\u2019s white shirt with black dress pants, polished shoes and a suit jacket was a stark comparison to Evan\u2019s much more casual outfit of  long-sleeved black shirt and matching black jeans, a pair of sneakers adorning his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas there something you needed Evan?\u201d Michael asked, his voice while friendly held a hint of annoyance, while it was true he could be called a workaholic it was only because he held a certain standard to his work, one which sadly few people in his department wished to maintain, as demonstrated by his friend\u2019s choice of attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, your shift ended 15 minutes ago Mr. brown-nose\u201d Evan replied smugly. Glancing down at his desktop\u2019s Michael found that it was indeed 5:15. Chuckling slightly in embarrassment Michael quickly saved and closed the document he had been working on before grabbing his suit jacket from his chair and slipping it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Evan, I owe you one, I might like working here more than someone like you, but I don\u2019t like giving any more time than I need to, same as everyone else\u201d Michael said clapping the man on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh, so does this mean we can finally go get a beer together? Maybe check out a few girls and if the night goes well\u2026\u201d Evan let the sentence trail off but Michael knew his friend\u2019s implications all too well. Evan couldn\u2019t exactly be called a womanizer, to be one of those you had to actually have success with a woman, but Evan was the most \u201cappreciative\u201d man in terms of the female form Michael had ever met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, I don\u2019t need alcohol to have a good time, and I\u2019ve got no interest in going bar crawling, nor picking up some random woman who\u2019s too drunk to realise what we did last night\u201d Michael replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Seriously man I know it\u2019s rude to ask but are you gay or what? You turn me down every time I ask to go drinking\u201d Evan replied, his eyes narrowing as he looked Michael up and down like he was trying to find some distinct characteristic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah I just have a head on my shoulders, that and I don\u2019t want to end up in jail because some chick regretted her actions the night before, you want to risk that be my guest, but I\u2019m heading home\u201d Michael replied. Pausing for a moment Michael quickly opened and reached into the middle drawer of his desk, his key card in his hand as it exited the desk. \u201cSee you on Monday Evan\u201d Michael stated as he turned and walked towards the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you on Monday Michael\u201d Evan replied as a sigh exited his lips although as he walked away Michael was sure he heard his friend mutter \u201cwreck my fun, only losers go drink out on their own\u2026\u201d the rest fading from his hearing as he exited the office his department used and made it out into the main hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming to himself Michael walked briskly to the end of the hall \u2018alright, I have plenty of time to get to the bus\u2026and I\u2019m 15 minutes late\u2019 Breaking into a sprint he skipped the elevator as they were only a few floors up and bursting into the staircase catapulted himself down 3 stairs at a time. Rushing past the building\u2019s secretary he sprinted down the street, his bus coming into sight as he rounded the corner. Watching it start to pull away, he began to wave and holler like an idiot hoping to catch the attention of someone on the bus. He was sure someone saw him as the bus driver turned to face his direction, then turned back and the bus pulled out into traffic. Michael was sure he felt a vein pop out of his head, due to the way the city\u2019s transit system worked there wouldn\u2019t be another bus for a full hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Guess I\u2019m walking home\u2019 he muttered to himself, while it wasn\u2019t a mile trek or anything, it would still take a good 20-30 minutes to walk home. Sighing in defeat he began his trek as block after block of pavement passed under his feet, he tuned out all but the most important features around him, the traffic lights he needed to keep focus on and the sounds of traffic, just in case some idiot driver decided a pedestrian wasn\u2019t worth the few extra seconds of waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the cityscape began to change, buildings beginning to spread out as he moved from the city proper to the suburbs, grass appearing beside him instead of concrete as the buildings eventually stopped all-together as he walked past a children\u2019s park. The park being made up of a large expanse of grass for kids to run around and play in, a sandbox area with some jungle-gym equipment, a swing set and see-saw as well as a few benches scattered around so parents could watch over their kids, this late at night the place was completely deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAHHHHH!!!\u201d The shrill piercing scream came out of nowhere, Michael although he wouldn\u2019t admit it jumped several feet into the air, his head whipping to where the sound was coming from. Of course it was coming from the park, but that wasn\u2019t right, as far as he could tell the place was empty, everyone having heading home to eat. Yet he could still hear the sound of crying, from the pitch he had to assume it was a young kid probably female. Looking around he couldn\u2019t help but sigh \u2018this better not bite me in the ass\u2019 he muttered before taking off for the playground at a light jog. Spending a few minutes searching Michael finally found the little girl in one of the play-structure's tunnels, what surprised him was the fact the little girl was a Mobian as he could count the number he'd seen in person on one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outfit was ordinary enough, a bright orange dress with a blue tie, orange and yellow shoes and white gloves, aright the gloves were a bit strange. She was a little lop-eared rabbit girl. Orange fur covered her eyes, the tips of her ears and streaked down the back of her head starting at her forehead. The rest of her head and ears were covered in cream-coloured fur except for around her mouth and small brown nose. Looking down at her legs and arms he honestly couldn\u2019t tell if they were simply covered in a very fine fur or she had skin but he wasn\u2019t going to touch to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to not have noticed him so as gently as he could he coughed into his hand, the little girl\u2019s ears and head swiveling to face him revealing her tear-stained cheek and reddened eyes. \u201cHey there\u2026I\u201d he never got a chance to finish the sentence as she suddenly leapt towards him latching onto his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I lost my mommy\u201d she wailed pitifully, her breaths coming in small hiccups as her fingers dug into the fabric of his jacket leaving him at a loss for words or what to do. The obvious thing would be to hug this little girl, tell her everything was going to be okay, but from the sound of her voice she couldn\u2019t be any older than 8 years old and considering whoever took care of her was probably freaking out right now, he really didn\u2019t want to do anything that might be \u201ctaken out of context\u201d and used against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept crying, tears streaming down her face he knew it was cruel not to provide some comfort, his hand gently falling on top of her head as he began to gently pet her. \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright, we\u2019ll find your mom\u201d he said as soothingly as possible, and much to his surprise she stopped crying, after a few last sniffles anyways. Gently crawling out of the tunnel he felt her grip his hand tightly as if the little girl expected to lose him too, shrugging to himself as it\u2019d make keeping an eye on her easier he knelt down to look her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t asked yet but what\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Michael\u201d he stated, knowing this was the easiest way he\u2019d get her to cooperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m Cream\u201d she replied, it was definitely a different name but he\u2019d certainly heard worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCream, do you know where you live?\u201d Michael asked. A wordless point was all he got in reply, thankfully it was towards his suburb rather than the city, his suburb was do-able, trying to find her mom in the city would have been next to impossible. \u201cAlright, just hold onto my hand and I\u2019ll take you home, although I might need you to help me a little alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-ok\u201d she replied, whether the nervousness came from realizing she might be in trouble or the fact that he wasn\u2019t someone she knew well was unclear to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set off in silence which continued until they actually started to have houses passing on either side Cream speaking up and giving vague yet helpful directions like \u201cturn left\u201d which Michael would usually have to have clarified by her pointing where she wanted them to go. What surprised him was how well-behaved Cream was, she didn\u2019t tug, shout, or pull she simply led him to the best of her ability. After ten minutes and travelling several blocks the two reached a cul-de-sac, Cream getting slightly antsy. Smiling Michael gently pushed her forward Cream running to the house on the exact opposite end of the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJogging to catch up Michael just heard the sound of a ringing doorbell, by the time he reached the door he heard the sound of heels on tile for a moment before the door was yanked open revealing a rabbit woman who looked just like Cream except for a few differences, her ears were longer and thinner, rather than orange markings a single tuft or orange fur sat on top of her head and she wore a lavender dress with a crimson vest covering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy!\u201d Cream shouted as she raced forward, the woman quickly scooping her daughter up, tears on the edge of both mother and daughter\u2019s eyes as they embraced.</span></div></div>",

He was surprised when he felt a strong grip on his arm; looking back he noticed one of Cream\u2019s mother\u2019s slender gloved hands wrapped tightly around his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you stay for dinner? It\u2019s the least we could offer\u201d Her voice despite being pained moments before was now soft, gentle and warm. Maybe it was the fact that both mother and daughter had turned to face him, tears threatening to tumble down their cheeks at the slightest agitation but he couldn\u2019t say no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, if you\u2019ll have me\u201d Michael replied, smiling softly Cream\u2019s mother gently lowered her to the floor and nudged down the hall \u201cgo get washed up for dinner\u201d she said softly, Cream running off to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up Cream\u2019s mother led Michael through an archway into the home\u2019s living room and presumably the kitchen. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gotten your name?\u201d Michael asked as it felt a bit strange referring her as only Cream\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m Vanilla, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet an upstanding young man like yourself\u201d she replied a small smile gracing her lips. Michael couldn\u2019t help but blush at the compliment; turning away he focused his attention on the living room. A large black sofa sitting next to the wall they had entered from, a large white brick fireplace taking up the entire wall opposite the archway with a large bay window taking up the western wall, an entryway on the eastern wall presumably leading to the kitchen, a large plasma screen TV in the north-eastern corner of the room caught his attention as they didn\u2019t seem like a TV family. Looking to the beige walls he saw nearly every space that would have been open on the walls was taken up by picture after picture, all of them happy times between Vanilla and Cream, playing together, swimming, simply cuddled up together, yet there was one major element missing from the picture, a male rabbit, or a male of any Mobian species for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing not to step on that landmine Michael silently followed into the kitchen, a gentle gesture from Vanilla pointing him to the table. Sitting down he couldn\u2019t do much but watch as Vanilla set about preparing dinner, rummaging around in the fridge she pulled out lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, celery as well as some buns, butter, and a large carton of juice. Not the most fancy meal but it would certainly suffice. Walking over to a black granite counter Vanilla pulled out a cutting board and began to cut up the salad ingredients. Not having much else to do he watched Vanilla for a few moments, her movements surprisingly quick and precise as she sliced the produce into smaller and finer bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see many mobians on Earth\u201d Michael spoke up during a lull in her cutting, worried that he\u2019d cause Vanilla to cut herself if he spoke while she was concentrating. \u201cMost still stay on Mobius despite the fact you have humans over there as well, I know Dr.Robotnik was a human, but we\u2019re not all bad are we?\u201d He asked, while he knew it was a touchy subject he could count the number of Mobians he\u2019d seen on one hand and while it seemed like humans and mobians got along there was always this tension in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Most mobians like to stay on Mobius, it is our home planet after all, as for anything to do with Dr.Robotonik, I don\u2019t think anyone holds your kind responsible for his actions\u201d Vanilla\u2019s eyes stayed focused on the carrots she was currently cutting, so Michael wasn\u2019t entirely sure if what she was saying was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why\u2019d you come to Earth then?\u201d The question left his lips before he\u2019d really given it much thought, while he was certainly curious it was probably a private matter. \u201cActually\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were looking at the pictures on the walls, so I\u2019m sure you noticed someone was missing from all those pictures\u201d Flinching Michael braced for impact as he\u2019d done exactly what he\u2019d planned not to do \u201cCream\u2019s father wasn\u2019t the\u2026nicest of men, he wanted nothing to do with Cream so I wanted nothing to do with him. We moved here and I\u2019ve raised her alone ever since\u201d Michael relaxed, that wasn\u2019t as bad as he\u2019d been expecting, he expected some cartoon or drama level event this was a bit more grounded than he had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve done an excellent job raising her on your own\u201d Vanilla didn\u2019t stop cutting but Michael was sure he saw Vanilla\u2019s ears physically swivel to face him. \u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful little girl, polite, obedient, calm\u2026.a little too trusting I\u2019ll be honest but that\u2019s a relatively minor fault. All in all you\u2019ve been a wonderful mother, you should be proud.\u201d Vanilla physically froze for a moment before quickly finishing cutting up the ingredients and sweeping them into a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you to say\u201d she replied her back facing him as she tossed the salad, grabbed some plates and turning back to the table began to set it. Michael couldn\u2019t help but notice that there were tears on the edge of Vanilla\u2019s vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVanilla I\u2019m sorry I\u2026\u201d He was silenced by one finger gently pressed against his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I\u2019ve ever cared about is being a good mother to my little Cream, and you told me I\u2019ve raised her to be a wonderful little girl, I\u2019m happy\u201d she stated softly before sitting down. \u201cCream, dinner\u201d Vanilla called Michael preparing for Cream to come barrelling into the kitchen but when she arrived she simply walked in, a strange blue creature no bigger than a doll with a blue body, and yellow arms, legs, and the top of its head floating in after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheese this is Mr. Michael, he\u2019s the man who saved me\u201d Cream said as he and Cheese made eye contact. He was about to correct Cream on the fact his last name wasn\u2019t actually Michael when \u201cglomp\u201d Cheese was suddenly wrapped around his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao.\u201d Freeing his face Michael glanced over to Vanilla, her gaze directing him to Cream for some sort of explanation or translation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheese says thank you for helping me get home, and that you\u2019re a very nice man\u201d A small smile graced her features as he handed Cheese over to Cream, the little bunny surprising him again as she jumped up into his lap, her fur tickling his chin as she sat with her back pressed against his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmmm, I...\" Michael was at a bit of a loss for words, Vanilla was sitting right across the table and Cream had just sat herself down in his lap, that of a total stranger\u2026ok so that trust was more of an issue than he first thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCream\u2019s a bit too young to fit in the seats, she needs either a book to act as a boost or someone\u2019s lap\u201d Michael could see a small grin on her lips as well as hear it in her voice \u201cwhile Cream is a very trusting little girl she\u2019s never taken to anyone this quickly\u201d she stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking mortified as she seemed to realize what she had done Cream\u2019s whole body deflated, her ears drooping down as she looked up towards him \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, I just thought I could sit in your lap\u201d she said, a gentle quiver in her voice tugging at Michael\u2019s heartstrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing internally Michael gently stroked Cream\u2019s ears \u201cit\u2019s alright with me if it\u2019s alright with Vanilla\u201d he replied turning the tides if slightly back on her. A simple nod earned a happy squeal from Cream as she got comfortable in his lap, he pulled his chair in so Cream could actually reach the table and leaning over her he grabbed some salad and 2 of the buns and the 3 of them began to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3\u20264 of them if you were counting Cheese who\u2019d grabbed himself a bun were silent for several minutes as they ate, the only sound being that of cutlery and the quiet chewing of food. \u201cCream you and your mother went to the park to play today, is there anything else you like to do?\u201d Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael missed the small smirk on Vanilla\u2019s face as Cream turned to face him \u201cI like to pick flowers for mom, watch TV, colour, play with Cheese, and read\u201d she stated proudly earning a small grin from Vanilla and from Michael as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell how about we read or colour after dinner then?\u201d Michael replied, rubbing Cream\u2019s head earing a giggle from the little bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be lovely, it\u2019s very kind of you to play with Cream\u201d Vanilla spoke up earning a dismissive wave from Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay thank you Mr.Michael\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but grin as the little bunny wrapped her arms around his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem Cream, now let\u2019s get back to eating\u201d He replied. Looking up at Vanilla he noticed she was staring at him, a gentle smile on her face as her eyes guided his vision down. Glancing down he found that he was gently petting Cream\u2019s head with his free hand, a gentle hum escaping the little bunny as she enjoyed the attention. Glancing back up to Vanilla she giggled softly before returning her attention to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of silent eating Michael felt a tap on his arm \u201cMr. Michael I\u2019m full\u201d Cream stated her legs swinging off the edge of the chair as she waited for him to let her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Vanilla for permission she softly nodded telling Michael Cream could be excused. \u201cGo play Cream, Vanilla and I will clean up the dishes and then I\u2019ll read to you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, thank you Mr. Michael\u201d Cream surprised him by standing up and gently kissing him on the cheek before hopping off the chair and racing off to play.</span></div></div>",

You worked mostly during the day, but occasionally the night shift when someone called in or when a new exhibit was being put in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such exhibit was the Heart of Venus. It was a large heart-shaped gem that had its own glow. When you helped put it into an enclosed exhibit, you somehow cut your hand on the gem, despite it not having any sharp edges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, you went to lunch. As you ate, you let your mind wander, idly making a wish to have someone love you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, the Heart of Venus was magical. Your blood was all the price it needed to grant your wish. It waited for someone to touch it to grant your wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day or two, a certain gem thief learned about the Gem and decided to make it hers. On a whim, she had a fake of it crafted. It lacked the innate glow and wouldn't stand up to a close inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a disguise, she scoped out the museum and learned the best spots to sneak in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo came the night that Rouge snuck in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping to the ceiling and other spots above both eyesight and cameras, she thought, <i>'This museum pretty basic stuff. Bet they didn't think I'd come by and steal a heart-shaped gem. Come on! my favorite clothes have a heart motif! ...Then again, the only interesting thing this place has is the Heart of Venus.'<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Rouge got to the spot where the Heart of Venus was. With an evil smile, Rouge waited until the guards left the area. She put little devices on the Cameras to have them repeat footage. Then, she glided down, carefully opened the exhibit, and switched the Heart of Venus with the fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting back above the average line of sight, Rouge removed the little devices on the cameras and headed for the roof. Once there, Rouge looked at her newest acquisition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Well. A heart worth billions. almost like me. Let mama give you a kiss before I go back and put you in my personal museum,\" Rouge muttered before she kissed the heart. The Heart of Venus glowed, adding in a love for you to her. she had no idea what your name was, but she knew what you looked like and wanted you. After putting the Heart of Venus in a large pouch, Rouge went back inside to find out where you were.</span></div></div>",

She didnt know who this boy was she desired nor why she desired him to begin yet she didnt care. She loved mysteries and it's hard to turn down trying to solve the mystery of the man you love yet never met.<br>\r\nSadly, the security guard (she somehow knew the boy was a security guard as well) was nowhere to be seen. Guess he wasnt on shift. Not wanting to leave empty-handed (not counting the Heart of Venus), she had a Plan B. After hacking the cameras with old repeated footage, Rouge searched through one of the computers in the museum's database for employee info. It didnt take long for her to find the name of the mystery man she admired as well as his age, hobbies, interests, family, and most importantly his address. With that information in her possession, what she needed to do now is plan for the right moment to strike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n................\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came. You woke up groggy and achy cuz you had loads of trouble sleeping last night. It didnt help that the AC in your apartment was out cuz the landlord forgot to get it fixed, so you woke up in a burning hot and sweaty mess to boot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say it was a crap morning. You hated everybody and everything at the moment. You felt like giving the middle finger to every single person you come across today. Even your cat who thankfully didnt understand the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot soon after forcing down your pent up anger with some cereal, your smart phone went off blaring System of A Down at high volume!<br>\r\nAfter your ears stopped ringing you took a look at the Caller ID. It was your boss, the museum's chief of security, Mr. Huntersen! You immediately answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Mr. Huntersen!\u201d you announce like youre up with the chickens!<br>\r\n\u201cNewbie, we got a situation!\u201d there was urgency in his gruff stern cold voice.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Chief?\u201d you said on full alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Heart of Venus is missing! Someone snuck in and stole it!\u201d The Heart of Venus?! The freshly new exhibit?! STOLEN?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho stole it?!\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cDont know,\u201d Mr. Huntersen answered, \u201csomeone messed with the cameras. By the time we reset them, it was already gone. Not only that, someone also pried into the database. Damned if I know what they did there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered the phone and muttered an 'Oh shit' under your breath. You hadnt even worked there more than a month and already shit went down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat aint all,\u201d Mr. Huntersen continued, \u201cjust talked with the Director. His uh, biggest investor\u2026 the one who donated the Heart of Venus to the museum found out and she's pretty pissed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that sucks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEven worse\u2026 turns out the investor happens to be the President's daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spit out your coffee after hearing that news despite not drinking coffee to begin with! Doubting what your ears may have heard, you needed to clarify.<br>\r\n\u201cPresident's daughter...\u201d you squint your eyes, \u201c...as in THE President's daughter? As in the President of the United State's daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d he clarified, \u201cBig Daddy's darling little brat, Sara.\u201d Well crap. If there was any person with a major rank you didnt wanna piss off, it was the daughter of one of the very few remaining leaders of the free world! You wont be surprised if the museum decides to fire the entire security staff just to save face! This will look good on a reference. And just when it looked like you were finally making good money too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know your shift doesnt start until later this afternoon, newbie,\u201d Mr. Huntersen states, \u201cbut you might wanna get your ass over here ASAP before all the media hawks show up. And bring a set of earplugs. I heard Sara's screams can rupture eardrums.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm on my way, Chief!\u201d *click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDAMN IT ALL! How could the museum's security team screw up THIS royally bad?! It's gonna be nightmarish once it's all over the news. But it's not like it's YOUR fault! YOU werent on shift when it happened! They cant blame you for incompetence! You werent there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you finished your bowl of cereal, dash into your room for a quick change of clothes,  rush out the door, quickly groan irritated at the notice on the door from your landlord that there's gonna be a last minute scheduled power outage tonight, and rush to your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and put the keys into the ignition...</span></div></div>",

For a moment, you thought a mistaken had been made, as it looked like the heart of Venus was still there. But you saw that the exhibit was a glass fake, as the real one was made of precious gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have no idea who could have done this,\u201d your boss answered as Rogue appeared within a small group of G.U.N.

For a cat girl, you thought she looked kinda cute, but you weren\u2019t too fond of the Tsundere feel she gave off.

Which one of you was watching this spot from the security room?\u201d Sara loudly asked, roughly poking any guard as she passed by. \u201cWhich of you thought that fake glass thing was my donation?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stepped in front of you, something happened to the real Heart of Venus in Rouge\u2019s secret Gem hiding spot. It glowed like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s eyes glowed. Her furious expression turned to a playful smirk. She looked around before she said, \u201cYou know what? I think I can forgive this place if this guard can show me around town for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever annoyance Rouge had towards Sara was now hate. She thought,<i> \u2018No one steals from me. I steal from them!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara then faced away from you and backed herself into you, making sure that you definitely felt her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Back off away him!\u201d Rouge yelled as she stomped towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blonde cop said, \u201cYeah, He might very well be the thief or an accomplice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you two?\u201d Sara asked with a glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d move, but one of your fellow guard mouthed<i> \u2018Get her mad and us fired. You\u2019re dead\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Topaz, Sir,\u201d The blonde cop answered with a salute. \u201cI work with Rouge, and she is a special agent of G.U.N.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara glared at the two before she asked one of her secret service guards, \u201cWas he here last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am,\u201d The Secret Service guard answered. \u201cI\u2019d advise you to step away from him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked disappointed as she stepped away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSara, I have a suggestion,\u201d Rouge said, getting the cat girl\u2019s attention. \u201cLet me interrogate him for a day. I have expert knowledge of who could have the skill to steal the Heart of Venus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you stole it and you\u2019re trying to take him for yourself!\u201d Sara exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if he falls for me, then it\u2019s probably because I\u2019m a mature woman who knows what she wants and you\u2019re a growing girl who merely has a lot of money and power,\u201d Rouge replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sara and Rouge began to glare at each other. You looked at your boss for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps he can choose if he should be interrogated by Sara or Rouge,\u201d Your boss happily said, getting both Sara and Rouge to glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Traitor!\u2019 </i>you thought.</span></div></div>",

If anyone you know of could be capable of making it disappear, it was her! Letting her pretend to interrogate you would more than likely get to the bottom of this mess!<br>\r\nHowever, Sara suddenly seems generous enough to forgive her prized possession being stolen after being introduced to you. And she's the daughter of the freaking President! And making friends with the daughter of the President no doubt has it's advantages. And keeping HER happy would keep your employment happy. And youre sorta holding back the urge to stroke that cute long cat-tail of hers. And there were plenty more upsides to this decision that it was take an entire CHAPTER to explain why this choice was a better idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, with all due respect, Officer Topaz,\" you speak up, immediately causing Rouge and Sara to turn their heads to you, \"while I do respect your authority and the authority of G.U.N.... I feel the lovely daughter of President Tammany holds higher authority, in my opinion. So I choose her to interrogate me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!\" upon hearing those words, Sara mockingly at Rouge and gave her with the most childish mocking smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just how exactly does she have higher authority than us?\" the bat thief-pardon me, REFORMED bat thief objects, \"she has no legal or judicial power whatsoever. Being Daddy's little girl doesnt really give her any of those privileges at all.\"<br>\r\n\"It gives me the privilege of stealing your boytoy,\" you could overhear Sara sputter under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if that's your decision,\" Topaz was willing to accept said decision, \"Ms. Tammany, should you gain any information related to the burglary, do not hesitate to relay it to G.U.N. immediately.\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry,\" Sara smiled, \"I wont leave out ANY details!\" She winked over at Rouge when she said that.<br>\r\nWith that, your fellow security crew sighed in relief as Mr. Huntersen pulled out a cigar about to light it. Too bad the museum director smacked it out of his hand!<br>\r\n\"How many times have I told you not to smoke here?!\" he stated.<br>\r\n\"You said not to smoke while I'm on duty,\" Mr. Huntersen replied as he pulled out ANOTHER cigar, \"I'm NOT.\" Like a boss. YOUR boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let's get a move on, Mr\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMcWilliams\u201d you answered Sara, \u201cWilliam McWilliams.\u201d Yep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Will,\u201d Sara smiled your way before turning her head to the director, \u201cI'll be having Mr. McWilliams show me around your town. I trust you WILL begin searching for my precious Heart of Venus immediately, yes?\u201d<br>\r\nThe director nodded obediently, \u201cAt once Ms. Tammany! The police report is filed and I will spare no expense hiring the best detectives out there to track it down!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Sara was pleased by that answer, \u201cnow if you'll excuse us. Guys, properly escort Mr. McWilliams to my limo.\u201d And right on command, three of Sara's body guards escort you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAAGHH!\u201d<br>\r\nAnd by 'escort' I mean they immediately grabbed you and bent your arms behind your back while gripping you by the neck and shoulders so you wouldnt budge as they DRAGGED you toward the limo! Rouge looked like she was about to step in, but Topaz stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont move,\u201d the bodyguard grabbing your neck whispered, \u201cdont talk, dont blink, dont breathe, dont look at Ms. Tammany, dont even look at me.\u201d  You got tons of stares by everybody there. Especially Rouge who eyed you suspiciously the whole time. That gem thief left you feeling uneasy, but then again, being dragged off like a wanted fugitive left you feeling uneasy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the guards reached the Sara's personal limo, they crammed you in the back of it like it was a squad car. Speaking of, immediately after shoving you in there, they handcuffed you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou try to remove those, they will shock you,\u201d warned one of the bodyguards right before slamming the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about the rude welcoming,\u201d Sara apologized with a smile, \u201chigh level security for a high level VIP. Cant be too careful what with daddy having way too many enemies that wanna sabotage his efforts to making the nation great again!\u201d<br>\r\nYou put on a forced smile and pretend the cuffs arent aching. \u201cI-I-I understand. Guess it comes with the territory.\u201d On the plus side, at least the limo's very comfy and luxurious. Aside from the surround speakers booming some boy band song at high volume on all sides of you, there's a little wine bar in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you care for a drink?\u201d she offers you, \u201cI've got some of the finest imported champagne right here in this drawer.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d you politely turn her down, despite possibly NEEDING it, \u201cI'm not a drinker.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNeither am I, I hate the stuff!\u201d she was awful quick to chuck a bottle out the window! \u201cit's finally nice to see a professional well trained officer that actually resists the horrible habit that comes from alcohol.\u201d Well, youre not exactly an 'officer', but you dont object to the title she's giving you. \u201cI cant say I've seen you at the museum before. I'd remember being properly introduced to you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I've only been working there for a few weeks,\u201d you answer, \u201cI'm still getting used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA few weeks?!\u201d Sara seemed a bit offended, \u201cand they never bothered to tell me?! Hmph. First they somehow lose my precious Heart of Venus, now they dont even have the common courtesy to alert me of new staff so I can properly welcome them in private?!\u201d Was that really her business? Not that youre arguing, of course! \u201cWell, I'm gonna have a word with your superiors much later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease dont, Ms. Tammany,\u201d you pleaded with her, \u201ctheyre really good staff! I probably wouldnt be half as good a security guard if not for their training.\u201d<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow and curled her lip, pretending to give it some thought, \u201cWell\u2026 I suppose I'll let it slide. Surely, it's their training that'll get my Heart of Venus back.\u201d So far so good. As long as Sara's in good temper, your crew and your career are gonna be just fine. Thinking back to your training on dealing with distraught high-level clients, one rule you remember is to keep them talking. Find out their interest and be interested!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I've been curious about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious about what?\" Sara's cat-ears twitched, ready to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Heart of Venus,\" you say, \"well, I only learned a little bit of info from it, but I never had to time to properly research it. I mean where did it come from?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you asked!\" score! \"It was actually a gift that daddy got me as a high school graduation present. Back when he had his old job, he discovered it during a dig at an archeological summit in Cyprus. He said it was found under the ruins of a grand hotel in Varosha.\"<br>\r\nAnd that was the part where you got interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Varosha?\" the name peeked your interest, \"isnt that that one city that got completely abandoned in the 70s?\"<br>\r\n\"Why yes it is,\" she nodded, \"it's a real shame, too. It couldve made a real luxurious resort from the family business. Not to mention, lots and lots of priceless artifacts were sitting right there under the ground beneath it. Raging from ancient Greek, Roman, a few Persian things... they even found remnants of an ancient holy blade that King Richard may have used during the Third Crusade!\" HOLY SHI-no, better not. Very improper. Still, that's incredible knowledge for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" you couldnt help but be swept away by such sheer epicness, \"all that in one abandoned city?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" she said with a smug prideful expression.<br>\r\n\"Do you think there still might be more stuff like that over in Varosha?\"<br>\r\n\"Most likely,\" she said. WHELP. Now you know where YOURE going on your vacation! Youre getting yourself a holy sword!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, look at me going on and on,\" Sara sighed, \"I'm sorry to bore you with that anecdote.\"<br>\r\n\"You didnt bore me at all,\" you said with stars still in your eyes.<br>\r\n\"It's still early in the day,\" she changes the subject, \"I feel like checking out what this city has to offer. Hey Will, youre from here arent you? Surely you know all the sights to see. Is there anywhere nearby that's worth seeing?\" Ok, now it was time for YOU to peek HER interest. The fate of your source of employment and future career may very well rest on your attempt to excite her. Best not screw it up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment of a good place and decide...</span></div></div>",

Your arms were barely lifting the multitude of bags. She even bought some weird backpack that allowed her to hang more bags on your back. All of which was clothes, shoes, and video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This trip is going great!\" Sara said before her stomach growled. She looked back at you and innocently asked, \"Are you hungry?

Then screams followed by 'beep beep boop's and a monotone 'TARGET ACQUIRED: COMMENCE APPREHENSION!' And that's when you see the robots storm the place yet AGAIN.<br>\r\nYes, again. This isnt the first time your town was attacked by robots. You kinda lost count after the 48th.

One in particular, considering dang near every single one of the robot invaders have his patented trademarked cartoony face imprinted on them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it couldnt have been Dr. Eggman, he's still locked up in Helheim, a top profile maximum security prison island that since it's founding over half a century ago has NEVER had a successful prison break!

This mall and everything and everyone inside is now in the custody of the Eggman Empire!

And they STILL denied him parole!!\"<br>\r\n\"So you think the best course of action is to just randomly kidnap hundreds of innocent people who have nothing to do with your problem and use them as extortion?!\"<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE!!!\" she stamps with her arms to her sides straight as a plank, \"see how the stupid president feels when HIS stupid loved one is held up like a prisoner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omelette!!\" you give her that tone again, \"for the last time, you need to cut this out! You have to face the fact that your uncle is in prison for a good reason. You wanna take over the world, the world doesnt wanna be taken over, THAT'S what happens to you!\"<br>\r\nAs usual, Omelette's angry expression quickly turns to sadness, like she's moments away from crying!<br>\r\n\"B....But Will! How would YOU feel if they locked up your mom?! You cant possibly tell me that if she were an evil super genius like Uncle Eggman was that YOU wouldnt do the same!!\"<br>\r\nYou inhaled and exhale and softened your tone, \"Well... I guess if I knew the kinds of things you did, I'd probably think of doing the same. But I know mom wouldnt want me throw my life away doing this. And I know your uncle wouldnt want you to throw your life away doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didnt reply to that. She just stared back into your eyes silently staring. You could only imagine the kinds of thoughts that were rushing into her head that moment. But you didnt wanna push her.

A major dilemma of NATIONAL proportion has occurred in your place of work and if you arrive late, the dilemma could end up getting much worse. And being fired may be the LEAST to worry about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes as the bat who was smirking back at you. Maybe she knew you were desperate and could tell right away you werent gonna refuse her 'generous' offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and caved. \"Alright. Where's your ride?\"<br>\r\n\"Right over there,\" she pointed over to the wicked stylish painted white GP motorcycle that obviously wasnt intended for driving on the street or highway with a picture of a cool bat logo and the word 'ROUGE' written in purple feminine cursive. You were no fan of riding motorcycles. The thought of gripping one of those for dear life going 80+mph with G-force hitting your face and the wind wrecking your eardrums made you feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pretty, isnt she?\" Rouge asks, noticing the tense stare you were giving her ride, \"she's not only gorgeous, she's faster than lightning. She'll go 0-60 in less than 3 seconds. But dont worry. Her seats are extra cozy so you wont get a rash.\"<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard as the bat mounted her beloved bike and patted the cushion behind her. \"Dont keep her waiting, hop on!\"<br>\r\nIgnoring the voices in your head telling you not to, you jumped on the bike and scooted up close against Rouge, trying extra careful not to pitch a tent! Sadly, the seductive tone in her voice, the pleasant smell of her perfume, the warm feel of her gentle skin, and the adrenaline rush from the inevitable fast and incredibly dangerous ride was making it easier said than done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you have an extra helmet?\" you asked just as she turned over the engine.<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" she answered as she revved, \"youre just gonna have to hold on tight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JEEZZZ!!\" she had to scare the beejeezuz out of you by popping a wheelie just before zipping down the street!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth and holding back the urge to scream, you rushed down the freeway at tip top speed, gripping as tightly as you can to the bat girl in a desperate attempt not to fly off the bike! You lost count of the number of cars you passed constantly switching lanes back and forth, outrunning the cars privileged enough to use the carpool lane! You dare not count the number of times Rouge came so close to ramming into the cars in front of her just before zipping out of the lane at the last second! Really pissed off loads of drivers. Tons of honking and screaming and a few threats. She even intentionally revved her engine up close to the ears of whom you believe was the driver of a Triad car, spooking the hell out of her. You'll never forget her threat in broken english saying \u201cIf I catch you, I carve off your fucking nutsack and make nice new handbag for sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually what felt like eternity despite only minutes passing, Rouge exists the freeway and speeds off toward the museum in record time. Good news is that you werent late. Bad news is, actually you kinda were. Several black cars and a news crew were parked outside. Not a good sign. The motorcycle ride comes to a stop.<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d Rouge announces as you hop off the right. Youre still a little dizzy and your ears were ringing and the thoughts of having your nutsack carved into a handbag still flooded your mind, but youre fine.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d you sighed, \u201cI owe you one.\u201d<br>\r\nShe smirked and winked, \u201cYes you do\u2026 but we'll discuss the payment plan next time. Good luck!\u201d With one more eardrum shattering revv of the engine, she sped out into the distance and in the blink of an eye she was gone. You know you havent seen the last of her. You'll be lucky if you've seen the last of that Triad driver!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that scenario aside, you march your ass toward the side of the building away from all the commotion and meet up with the chief of security who was currently smoking a cigarette with impatience as loud unintelligible high-pitched screaming could be heard from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Mr. Huntersen looks your way and tosses his cigarette.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, boss. My car broke down and I had to bum a ride-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah yeah yeah,\u201d he cuts you off, \u201cjust get inside and get ready.\u201d The two of you stepped inside just in time to see every single employee, security guard, and even a few investors lined up in single file as a cat girl in a fancy executive dress march up and down the row chewing them out!<br>\r\n\u201cNot even one week! NOT EVEN ONE WHOLE WEEK!\u201d repeats Sara, the daughter of our beloved leader, President Tammany, \u201cHow does that possibly happen?! I once kept it sitting in my purse for almost a month and nothing ever happened to it! This museum has it locked up tight behind bullet-proof glass and air tight security and it just vanishes in a couple of days?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou have our most sincere apologies, Ms. Tammany,\u201d the Director grovels, \u201cwe cant possibly fathom how the Heart of Venus could just slip out of our fingers after all the expenses we made to ensure it's safety!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCant fathom it, huh?\u201d Sara sneered, \u201cbecause I can fathom at least a dozen ways a museum like this one can somehow lose a prized priceless historical artifact! Helga, if you were me, would you continue investing in a museum like this one if it up and lost your most beloved treasure in a matter of days?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTsk, I wouldnt,\u201d answered Helga, Sara's personal bodyguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in perfect timing, Sara's eyes turned to yours. Then Helga's eyes turned to yours. Then EVERYBODY'S eyes turned to yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d Sara asked the staff.<br>\r\n\u201cWill McMaster, ma'am,\u201d you introduce yourself, \u201cI work security night shift when a new exhibit is introduced.\u201d<br>\r\nSara looked at her watch then to you, \u201cWhy are you so late? I told this museum I wanted EVERYONE who's a part of this place to show up here before I did!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, ma'am,\u201d you apologized as she marched your way, \u201cmy car suddenly broke down and I had to hitch a ride with a fri-an acquaintance.\u201d Her eyes continued locking on toward yours as she got closer, \u201cUh\u2026 um, a-anyway, I was assigned to watch the Heart of Venus during my night shift for the past few days,\u201d you explain as she continued toward, her stare getting more and more intense, \u201ch-however, I wasnt working the shift the night the Heart of Venus disappeared. I...\u201d geez that stare of hers! \u201cI-I-I had to take the night off because of a f-family emergency. Had to visit my dad at the hospital. H-he got in an accident in his pickup. H-he's fine, just a couple of leg cuts and scrapes. The pickup was totalled though.\u201d She finally stopped her march, but only after her pearly aqua-colored eyes were inches away from yours! \u201cA-A-A-ANYWAY, I wasnt here during the robbery, so I couldnt witness it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, must Sara be so pin-drop silent? It's really creeping you out!<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she DOES finally break the silence after almost a whole minute by...</span></div></div>",

This is about the security guard and how he wasn't around to protect my treasure!\"Sara yelled before getting in your face. \"Just how do I know you aren't in some plan to steal it and sell it on a black market?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-check with the hospital. I was with my dad for half the night,\" you replied, scared of the furious cat girl. Were it not for her anger issues, you'd be tempted to ask her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will...

Now I get to punish you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-er uh,  Miss Sarah?\" Topaz spoke up. \"You don't have that power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can lean on those that do have that power!\" Sara replied with a nasty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the right to a trial?\" Rouge asked, hopping a little to make her girls jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM THE PRESIDENT\"S DAUGHTER AND I AM UPSET!\" Sara yelled at the Bat treasure hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that means no political power,\" Rouge muttered. \"So lay off him. It's bad enough he has to worry about his dad. Don't ruin his job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can ruin whoever I like! They lost a very valuable treasure!\" Sara growled as she and Rouge glared at each other.

You glared at him for being a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go check Will's home for either the treasure or hints to it,\" Sara ordered. Some of her secret service henchmen saluted before running off. She then looked at you and said, \"Until we're sure you didn't steal the Heart of Venus, you can't go home. I do hope you have some place in the meant time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her expression softened a bit before she said, \"But if you get on your knees and beg, I might let you stay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sister, but if he's staying with anyone, it's me,\" Rouge retorted.</span></div></div>",

Plus, she actually showed some compassion for your dad and his horrible predicament!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for the offer, Rouge,\" you turned your head to her and thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Buuuuuut...' \" Sara impatiently adds with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really appreciate you helping me out of a jam for the second time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Buuuuut...' \" Sara gestures her hand, emphasizing for you to hurry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I wont be a burden on you!

And what dismay it was. She stared coldly at you but each nanosecond she glanced over at Rouge, her face gave a hint of murderous bloodlust. It was almost as if she was planning out that bat-girl's 'suicide' in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all due respect, Will,\u201d she cooly spoke through her gritted teeth, \u201cI think it'd be in your best interest you stay with me where it's guaranteed to be safe at tightly secure. All I'm asking in exchange isnt that much to demand.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey cat-girl! You heard him!\u201d Rouge spoke up, \u201che's made his decision. He's gonna be safe and sound with ME, not YOU.\u201d<br>\r\nYou can hear cat-girl growling under her breath, but thankfully no bloodshed result. Not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave his entire home searched THOROUGHLY,\u201d she ordered her agents, \u201cdont leave a single thing unturned.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait! Can I at least go back and get some of my things?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she shot you down, \u201ceverything stays exactly where it is until we're sure youre not an accomplice!\u201d Damn. Your privacy was gonna be thoroughly violated all because of a stupid missing jewel. Guess it could be worse. At least she didnt order Helga to give you a cavity search!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do that,\u201d Rouge intervened with a smirk, \u201cleave searching his person to me! This way, Mr. McMaster.\u201d Sara's eyebrow twitched, again contemplating the bat-girl's 'suicide'.<br>\r\n\u201cSomething funny?\u201d Helga noticed your boss let out a chuckle.<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, not at all Ms, uh...\u201d Mr. Huntersen read her nametag, \u201cWhateverthehellyourlastnameis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Rouge left, you heard Sara give one last order:<br>\r\n\u201cTighten up the city boundaries,. Make sure she doesnt THINK of leaving town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Rouge got the pleasure of leaving that place with a sly grin, she was clearly not happy having to put up with that girl any more than you were. By the time you reached her lovely motorcycle, that sly facade faded and was replaced with an irate glare.<br>\r\n\u201cUrrggh\u2026 what an absolute pampered privileged pain in my hard-working tax-paying ass!\u201d she couldnt help but vent her frustration, \u201cI'm really sorry you had to put up with that spoiled brat. She's had it in for me ever since she found out I was let out early thanks to daddy's First Step Act passing.\u201d You'd tell her it wasnt a problem (it really was), but you were too interested by the last statement she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoure a reformed criminal?\u201d you ask as you hopped on her ride, \u201cwhat were you locked up for? If you dont mind me asking.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was mainly for petty thievery. Nothing really major,\u201d Rouge hopped on right in front of you, \u201cbut I did my time and learned my lesson. Now I'm working with the very same people that busted me, busting jerks way worse than me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's\u2026 really assuring,\u201d you say as she revved the engine, \u201cI'm really glad it all worked out for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep! The only thing I'm stealing nowadays is hearts!\u201d *ZZOOOOMM!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was still as hectic and possibly law-breaking as the first one, but you didnt feel nearly as scared for your life. Maybe it was seeing Rouge stand up for you when nobody else did that lifted your spirits a bit. You were feeling despite the fact you were zipping through heavy traffic, sneaking through car by car while their horns were going and drivers were cursing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened to your dad?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d suddenly Rouge cut your train of thought, ignoring the honks and horns.<br>\r\n\u201cYou said he was in an accident. Was it really bad?\u201d wow, she was listening.<br>\r\n\u201cH\u2026 he said it was,\u201d you answered, \u201capparently there was a really big police chase at Station Square that went wrong and one of the huge armored cars lost control and ended up plowing through a line of cars at a traffic stop.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAw geez, I heard about that!\u201d she gritted her teeth, \u201capparently someone hacked into the controls of a few armored vehicles prior to the first national bank robbery. We're still looking for the jerks involved. Topaz thinks one of our guys might be a mole, but danged if she knows who.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHope you find the ones responsible soon,\u201d you cheer her on, ignoring the dude in the semi's pagan sacrificial threat.<br>\r\n\"And I hope your dad recovers real soon,\" she cheered your pa on, \"maybe he can clue us in on a lead once he's out of the hospital. There might be a brand new Silverado in it for him.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I'll ask him,\" you couldnt help but smile, \"dad always had a thing for Chevys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there,\" the reckless joyride didnt last long before Rouge reached the big fancy apartment complex she was staying at.<br>\r\nRouge's finds her designated parking spot, then the motorcycle comes to a roaring stop and the two of you hop off her miniature behemoth and head toward her apartment room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just this way,\" she walks toward the direction of her room and you follow her. It wasnt long before she squinted her eyes and immediately rushed toward a particular door with an eviction notice on it. Her room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell?!\u201d Rouge snatched the notice right off the door, \u201cEvicted?! You gotta be kidding me, I just pai\u2026 what?! Being a hazardous risk against public safety?! What the hell's that even mean?!\u201d OH DEAR.<br>\r\n\u201cTheyre evicting you? What did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm really sorry, Will!\u201d Rouge turned to you and smiled, trying to hide her panic, \u201cthis is just a slight misunderstanding. Please wait here. I'm gonna go have a talk with the management.\u201d Then she dashed off, muttering curses under her breath that everyone in a 10 mile radius could hear. You sighed hard. You had a bad feeling about this. For all you knew, this coulda been one of Sara's last minute bits of revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you stand there and wait patiently for your bat host to come back and hope that it's not to ask you to help clear out her things.<br>\r\nYou wait a while. Not long, but a while. But you got bored pretty fast. Maybe you should call your dad and let him know youre up. That's what you wanted to do, but you remembered you left your phone back at home! Fortunately, this place has a payphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUNFORTUNATELY, someone's already using it. And she was loud. She seemed to be arguing with someone in Chinese. It didnt matter that you couldnt understand her, it still interested you enough and you couldnt help but wonder what the discussion was about that made her sound quite perturbed!<br>\r\nYour interest turns a whole 'nother direction when you realize her thick accent sounded familiar. It almost sounded exactly like that one Triad driver that screamed she was gonna carve your nutsack into a handbag for her sis in engrish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also worn the same shades, the same black jacket, had the same dragon tattoo across her chest, smoked the same brand of cigarette\u2026. Damnit, why the hell is that stupid Disneyland song playing in your head?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aint got time to question what she's doing here of all places. You'd best get out of sight before she considers acting on that threat!</span></div></div>",

Taking brief walks across town at night. So calm, so relaxing, so wonderful to look up at the stars as well as the street lights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the nightlife is great...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREEZE! PUT YOUR HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!\"<br>\r\nWhat the? Cops? Youve just heard someone shouting to nearly your direction. You try to ignore it, thinking that they werent talking to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU! You sir! I said freeze!\" Again, you hear that voice! It must be a cop, but why are they after YOU? What did you do?<br>\r\nNonetheless, you raise your hands up in the air as a shadowy figure appears from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.... what seems to be the problem?\" you ask it. This figure steps a little closer to the light, allowing you to see more of the person approaching you...<br>\r\nShe aint that bad looking. Long flowing blue hair, hazel eyes, strapless blue tank top under a yellow jacket, blue pants, boots, yellow gloves, weilding a big red gun. Her face is still shadowed, but so far you like what you see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmelita Montoya Fox,\" she introduces herself, \"Investigative Services Division... keep your hands where I can see them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what's the problem, offic-\" you immediately shut up when she steps even closer into the light, revealing her true self... her face is anthropomorphic! Her skin is furry. Reddish brown with tan markings! A gold earring's sticking out in one of her pointed ears. And of course you dont fail to notice a long red bushy tail behind her! She looked, for a lack of a better term, rather 'foxy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um..\"<br>\r\n\"Im looking for certain suspicious looking people,\" Carmelita answers (ironically!), \"You fit the description. Hands behind your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W w w wait!\" you interrupt, \"Suspicious looking people?! What about y-\"<br>\r\n\"I said hands behind your back!\" she points her gun toward you! Not wanting to push your luck with this fox-woman, you do as your told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands are behind your back while Carmelita begins to pat you down. Strange... isnt she supposed to read you your rights first? And what's this b.s. about suspicious looking people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" you actually overhear her whisper when she finally stops patting you down, \"now turn around and spread your legs.\"<br>\r\nThis just causes you to look at her strangely, \"Uh.. ma'am, I think you might have the wrong guy, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she stops you in mid-sentence. \"Sir, this is mandatory procedure. Unless you'd rather be taken in for questioning, spread 'em!\"<br>\r\nThis is getting too weird, and this fox-lady seems to be getting too close for comfort! Mandatory procedure, your ass! She isnt even giving any logical reason to suspect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost as if... she's hiding something!</span></div></div>",

She then began to pat you down once more.

I don't even think you have a reason to do this!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she unzipped your pants and slipped her hands in to begin a a slow handjob, she asked, \"Do you have a permit for a weapon this big and dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-weapon?

She then began to quicken her pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you continue to resist, then I'll have to bring you in to HQ,\" Carmelita replied, sounding both aroused and annoyed. \"Then I can continue to confiscate any and all weapons you might have on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, she added, \"Then again, I might do that anyways. Better safe than sorry with potential criminals, right?

You were now standing in the middle of a small apartment room. No cop cars in sight (especially ones that appear out of nowhere!) Just you and her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoure standing in my apartment room,\u201d she answers nonchalantly like it was no surprise to her whatsoever that the location around you just changed completely!<br>\r\n\u201cH-How\u2026.\u201d you squint your eyes and try to soak this in, \u201c...er\u2026 WHY am I in your apartment room?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tell me, trespasser,\u201d her voice sounded a little threatening, \u201cI never gave you permission to just walk into my home.

After what seemed like hours and quite frankly, what with the sudden jump of locations, who knows how long time has passed\u2026 Carmelita lowers her gun and puts a finger to her chin in a cute but mocking thinking pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...\u201d the fox-cop who's apartment room you inadvertently trespassed in pretended to ponder, \u201con second thought, it would be an awful waste to shoot such a nice looking criminal without giving him a chance to pay his debt to society.\u201d Youre not even sure what crime you committed, but as long as it meant you werent getting your balls shot off, it's just FINE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Carmelita call you and you gave your undivided attention, \u201cwould you like me to overlook this offense and let it slide?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-yeah, absolutely!\u201d you dont question, you just agree.<br>\r\n\u201cThen come over here,\u201d Carmelita walked away and sat on the edge of her bed\u2026 that you coulda sworn was on the other side of the room a minute ago!<br>\r\nNevertheless, you walked over to her and her bed as she removed her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghh...\u201d she groaned and stretched her arms, \u201cToday's been a total workout for me. I'm so achy. Could you do me a favor and rub my shoulders?\u201d She wants a shoulder rub? Something tells you she's gonna want much more than that later, but comparing to getting your nuts blown off, it's a shoulder rub she'll have!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sure thing, Officer Fox\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 MONTOYA Fox,\u201d she corrected as she moaned.<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Montoya Fox,\u201d you obediently reply as your hands were about to embrace the back of her warm furry shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen for a split second, everything around you flashed. Literally FLASHED. If you didnt know any better, you'd swear that the whole apartment room was replaced with one of those tv test patterns during that flash! First the sudden arrest and 'thorough' pat-down by an odd fox-cop, then a sudden magical warp to the inside of said odd fox-cop's apartment, now that!

She's also breathing... no, panting awful hard as she's patting down your rod!<br>\r\n\"Uh, listen Ms-\"<br>\r\n\"Officer,\" she corrected.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Officer... Montoya, was it?\"<br>\r\n\"Montoya FOX,\" she corrected with a heavy breath.<br>\r\n\"Ok, Officer Montoya Fox,\" you squint your lip, \"this has been fun and all, but I think I need to get going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre free to go when I say you are,\" Officer Foxy stated, \"and not a minute sooner.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, I dont know what kind of game youre playing with me,\" you get tired of this, \"but this isnt the right night, maybe next ti-HEY, that hurts!\"<br>\r\n\"Stop talking and get on the ground!\" she impatiently ordered and her grip got a bit tighter.<br>\r\n\"L-Let go of me!\"<br>\r\n\"Get on the ground, shut up, and just close your eyes!\" she continued, panting much heavier, \"if you hear any moaning, ignore it!\"<br>\r\n\"I said.... LET GO!\" you struggled to break out of her grip, but the damn fox-woman had a leg lock like a grizzly bear in heat and... oh dear god, is she seriously humping your leg?!<br>\r\n\"I've got you now, Cooper...\" she closed her eyes and whispered, \"told you I'd get you....mmm...one way or another...\"<br>\r\n\"Who's Cooper?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrute strength wasnt enough to pry this estrus cop off you. You had to improvise. Fortunately a long fuzzy idea quickly came to mind and to easy reach! You grabbed her long warm furry tail and gave it a nice squeeze!<br>\r\n\"EEE!!!?\" she let out a loud high-pitched squeal on contact, quickly releasing you from her grip with a flinch! You took that brief moment to dash off, zipping your pants back up as you ran! She quickly shook herself out of it and as soon as she spotted you running, she was furious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How DARE you put your filthy hands on my tail!\" Carmelita gave chase, \"COME BACK HERE!!\" You ran down the street not looking back as that cop chased after you. It wasnt likely you could outrun her however. You were getting pretty tired while she was antsy and had plenty of police training! Your only hope would be to make her lose your trail.<br>\r\nYou dash down a dark alley hoping to find cover, but instead you just find filthy trash cats and alley cats. Carmelita quickly spotted you climbing over a wall and hopped from a trash can then leaped right over that wall! Of course you didnt notice her incredible acrobatic abilities until she had already leaped off that wall and pounced directly at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short but painful roll, you were pinned to the cold gritty ground by a furry blue-haired vixen glaring daggers into your eyes and panting like a wild dog in heat! As if the rather feral look on her face wasnt terrifying enough, she grabbed you by your chin and pointed her pistol to the side of your head, ready to fire if you make a sudden move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tells you this isnt police protocol, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's nowhere you can go now,\u201d her voice suddenly sounded springy as she warned you, \u201cjust hand yourself over nice and easy, Cooper.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cM-My name's not Cooper-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIT IS NOW!\u201d she growled, poking your head with the pistol. You breathe slowly and try your best not to make sudden movements while she's still on top of you and pressing a gun against your skull. Your instincts were to treat her less like a person and more like a hungry mountain lion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to stare too hard when she reached into her jacket and pulled out something.<br>\r\n\u201cPut it on,\u201d she ordered. ...Is that a Zorro mask?<br>\r\n\u201cPUT IT ON!\u201d she roared off the top of her lungs. You quickly put on the silly Zorro mask like a good boy. Carmelita eyed you with even more intrigue than before\u2026 like she was the world's biggest Zorro fangirl! You'd make a 'Z' with your finger if you werent scared she was gonna bite it off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not gonna waste my time questioning you for all the actions you committed,\u201d she spoke like she was reciting a script, \u201csince it's obvious youre guilty. I dont think jail's appropriate for you, Cooper. Instead, I'm gonna show you what it's like to have something precious stolen from YOU.\u201d<br>\r\nShe finally lowered her gun but only to use both hands to unzip both your pants and hers. Whoever this 'Cooper' guy was, she was about ready to push her little fangirl fantasy of him to a whole new level with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like attempting to escape would be pointless and incredibly painful at this point. It might be in your best interest to let this estrus fox cop hurry up and have her way with you. It'd be an outrageously bizarre way to lose your virginity, but in the long run, it's certainly better than OTHER ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr if youre still feeling up for defying certain doom, her tail's within reach. One more good long tug should give you enough time to break for it again\u2026 and risk her wrath if you screw up for the second time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice is yours, 'Cooper'!</span></div></div>",

Everything else that happened since then paled in comparison to that extraordinary night. Nothing worth mentioning happened since. Just wake up, go to your job at the theater, print out the movie tickets, rip off the stubs, make a little popcorn, sweep up the ginormous mess in the movie rooms cuz none of the fucking slob customers knew how to pick up after themselves, maybe sneak in a movie or two on your downtime, all this while trying to hide the hickey mark so your coworkers wont get nosey and ask who marked you, then go home, eat, and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even sleep was a challenge of you. Mainly cuz your mind was going in circles trying to comprehend the night you got stopped by a hardass anthro fox-cop with a lovely bushy tail who made out with you and then raped you. You could tell yourself that you hallucinated all of this, but even if you had such a stubborn mindset, you couldnt explain the stupid Zorro mask you were still holding on to (as well as the hickey. It still kinda hurt when you touched it)! For some reason, you couldnt get rid of it. It's like a keepsake for one of the biggest WTF moments in your life! Although to be honest, you woulda rather had a bit of her nice nuzzly fox tail fur so you could make a cute furry key chain with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the keepsake, you hadnt felt like going for another late night stroll. And you loved your late night strolls! What, did she scare you out of one of your favorite pastimes?! Were you worried you were gonna get hassled by her again? ...Or maybe you were just shy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought about her, you also thought about that computer voice you heard as she soon as vanished from the face of the earth. Paradox Fantasy. An 'Alternate Reality Simulator', did it say?<br>\r\nYou spent over an hour lying in your bed staring at the ceiling fan pondering that name. Mixed thoughts swelled up in your mind. Something told you that you mightve picked up something you really shouldnt have.<br>\r\nSpeaking of, you glanced over at the Zorro mask you left on your shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Think she might be wanting it back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhaled in deep thought, trying to decide whether or not to go out there and have your late night stroll that was overdue. What are the odds you'd even run into a bushy tailed anthro fox again?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her face was riddled with regret. With grief. With the painful realization that she passed the point of no return. Despite not even knowing who this fox woman is, you managed to wager that she had just committed a major taboo that she couldnt recover from all because of her bizarre obsession for this 'Cooper' guy. It almost made you feel bad. ALMOST, because what she did next sorta fixed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew it!\u201d you hear her mutter under her breath just before she pinned your wrists down and resumed hammering down on your sensitive dick, still recovering from the ravage previously! Carmelita gritted her teeth as if holding back some emotions as she glared down at you while slamming up and down with added force!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh...what are you-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShut up and keep thrusting, Ringtail!\u201d she demanded. 'Ringtail'?<br>\r\nYou dont question it and presume bucking your hips despite the fact they were getting a bit sore. Well, not a little sore. VERY sore!  It hurt pushing in to squeeze your cock deep into the depths of her foxy vagina and it hurt pulling out to jerk your little guy out! Seriously, you were tired and getting a charlie horse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita didnt really look like she was enjoying it much either. The expression in her glare looked like she was in deep thought with each pant. Then you saw a tear run down her eye. She was actually crying. Perhaps your suspicions were right. Maybe she knew deep down that pretending you were this Cooper guy and raping you wouldnt fill this 'Cooper' void in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you wouldve felt some compassion for her if she wasnt hurting you while doing this! Honestly, your pelvis was aching like hell! Less said about the pain in your groin that the pleasure was barely overshadowing by a tiny bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarma\u2026 please\u2026.\u201d you groaned, \u201cstop\u2026 it's\u2026 hurting!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUnnggh\u2026 I wont\u2026 unn\u2026. listen\u2026. to your pleas of\u2026 mERcy!\u201d she was struggling just as you were, but she wasnt giving up, \u201c...CooOOOOOper!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cArgh.. seriously!\u201d you gasped, \u201c...why are you grr even doing th-this with mmmee-!!\u201d<br>\r\nShe pointed her gun at your head, verbally demanding you to shut up!<br>\r\n\u201cNot!\u201d Pump. \u201cAnother!\u201d Pump. \u201cWORD!\u201d PUMP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forced rhythmic thrusting at gunpoint seemed to go on forever. It seemed like hours passed even though it was most likely just seconds. Every part of your body was giving out except your dick. It took far longer than you hoped for your friend between your legs to finally build to an orgasm. Even then, Carmelita's vag clamped down uncomfortably around it as your seed spewed deep inside her regardless of whether or not she was compatible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxy cop let out not a moan but a quiet sob as her body shivered from a forced orgasm of her own. She may have been satisfied, but she was not happy.<br>\r\nYou collapsed danger near motionless, exhausted from such a bitter agonizing end as Carmelita finally lifted herself off you and put her pants back on. Your vision was blurred from the exhaustion and it was a tedious chore just to keep awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from what you saw was a blurred image of a certain blue haired vixen staring down at you with tears in her eyes. She most certainly had tons and tons of thoughts racing through her head, but danged if you knew what any of them were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after staring at you silently (not counting the heavy breathing) for nearly a millennium, she reached into her jacket again. You couldnt make out clearly what it was. It appeared a golden necklace with a glowing green jewel attached to it. The jewel gave off awfully bright green glow which made you feel uneasy. Definitely not an ordinary necklace, you assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita looked over at the necklace then over to you, as if pondering an idea. She leaned toward you, her fingers trembling. They trembled even more as she brought this odd glowing necklace closer to you.<br>\r\nThen she quickly backed away, taking the glowing necklace with it, as if she had second thoughts. Then she gave quick glances at it and you, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hesitant. VERY hesitant. With no energy left to move, let along run, you remained lying there barely conscious, awaiting whatever this fox woman has in mind...</span></div></div>",

After making sure the necklace was secure, she stood up and walked away, making sure to shake her rump at you. Before she left the alley, Carmelita said, \"Keep it on or else, Cooper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good hour or two before you both had the energy and courage to leave the alley to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the safety of your bathroom, you looked at the necklace. Somehow, it shrunk around your neck. Yet, it didn't feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling around it led to terrifying find. There was no clasp or lock. It was smooth, save for the jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnifes, hammers, and chisels were out. No way were you going to risk killing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to a doctor might be a choice, but you worried about that anthro-fox cop. She raped you on a whim. Giving her reason to get mad at you was too risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the next few days, you wore it. Anyone that asked about it, you said it was something you're just trying for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a couple of weeks after, you were relaxing after work when all of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

Not a tiny ounce of sound or noise in the distance whatsoever. Absolute silence. You couldnt even hear your own heart beating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was because the whole world around you stopped moving. Time itself mustve froze because everything came to a sudden halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything but the necklace around your neck, of course! It glowed brightly, completely unaffected by the time freeze! Or maybe it was behind the time freeze! You wanted to look down to observe the eerie glow, but you couldnt move an inch. You even attempted to mentally ask yourself what was going on because you couldnt so much as think! You were frozen solid, mind and body! What the hell did that crooked fox-cop put on you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, what you COULD do was listen. You listened to the whispers echoing all around you. All of them had that incredibly familiar feminine latin accent that from weeks ago! None other than Carmelita herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately her whispers were difficult to understand even if you could ponder what she was saying. She was speaking in an unfamiliar language, possibly chanting some kind of ancient spell!<br>\r\nAs she whispered, the um.. 'mark' she left on the side of your neck began to glow the same color as the necklace! No sooner did they both glow, the world around you went completely white. Incredibly bright white. Absolutely nothing to see but the absolute brightness that may as well have been the great beyond!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did I die?' Is what you would wonder if you could. For all you knew, you COULDVE died. You used to think that death itself would be a completely foreign experience beyond what anyone, including you, would comprehend! Was THIS experience foreign enough?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was or not, your life as you knew of it would most certainly be over. However, what would soon become of you... it wouldnt be anyone's idea of Heaven or Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like as little as a few seconds or as long as a thousand years (time itself was unreadable at the moment), Carmelita's whispers finally stopped. It went quiet again. Then the absolute bright white universe you turned absolutely black. It felt as though time finally resumed, but you were slowly fading out into unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you finally fell into the deep sleep, you overheard one last whisper from that familiar voice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God forgive me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You slowly woke. Whatever old memory of your old life was completely gone. No late night stroll, no cop rapist hassling you, no enchanted necklace, NOTHING! All you remembered was everything of you CURRENT life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now...</span></div></div>",
