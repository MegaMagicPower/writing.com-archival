Selena left her dumb pony show on... I guess I can watch something else.\" You flipped through the channels, not wanting to spend a second on your sister's girly cartoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you had sat down and gotten comfortable, Selena came in with her dumb cat in her arms, dropping him on his feet as she saw you. \"Hey!\" Your sister ran over to you stomped on the ground. \"I was watching that! Turn it back or I'm telling Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the rules, Selena!\", you responded. \"If you're not in the room, you don't get to complain if the channel's changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little sister stared up at you with a scowl until her eyes started watering and she took a deep breath. \"MOOOOMMMYYYYY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish soon ran into the room to see her daughter standing there crying while her son was sitting on the couch. \"Jack! What did you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything!\", you insisted. \"She's just mad cus she left the room with her dumb shows on! You're the one that made the rule!\" You were really upset. Your sister always did this. Any time she didn't get her way, she'd cry and throw a fit until your mom intervened, and usually at your expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sobbing as she picked up her kitty up off of the ground. \"I... I went... to go feed Ian... and- and- Jack took the remote, and I didn't get to watch all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish sighed and knelt down to both of your levels. \"Jack, could you please be a good big brother and share with your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pouted a bit, thinking that you should hold your ground, but you sighed as you realized that Selena probably wouldn't stop throwing a fit until you gave it up. \"Fine.\" You slid off of the couch and handed the remote to your sister. \"Here you go... little brat...\"<br>\r\nSelena's crocodile tears quickly vanished as she stuck her tongue out at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish suddenly pulled out her phone and read through a text message. \"Kids, I have to go meet up with Aunt Vivian and your cousins\", your mom said a she quickly grabbed her purse. \"Miss Barbara is right next door if you need anything. Please be nice to each other while I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try\", you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mommy\", she said as if she wasn't crying her eyes out just a minute earlier.<br>\r\nAs she left and locked the door behind her, you went into your room while Selena was left alone with her cat in the livng room. Your sister scowled at you as you walked back to your room. \"My shows are dumb, huh?\" Her eyes started to glow a bright pink as she grabbed the remote. \"Let's see how much you like your stupid cartoons when you get a closer look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, you heard a knock on your door. When you opened it, Selena was standing in front of it with the tv remote in her outstretched hand. \"Here you go, big brother!\", she said cheerfully. \"I'm done with the tv, so you can have a turn now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena nodded and pranced over to her room... or at least she began to before you walked into the living room. Once you got there, she peeked out from behind the corner. And watched as you turned the TV on... and vanished in a small burst of light! Selena jumped out from the hallway and laughed as her big brother had disappeared! \"It worked! Now my dumb nerdy brother's gone! And he's never getting out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Don't be silly, kitty!\", Selena said as if she could understand her pet. \"The only way he's coming back is if he flips the channel to something i like... and he's way too stubborn to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were shocked and confused as your surroundings suddenly changed and you fell on your butt!</span></div></div>",

That's when you remembered, \"Selena\" That little brat must have done something to you. \"When I get my hands on her, but first I gotta figure out where I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately begin to look around trying your best to find a road, a sign, really anything to let you know where you were. \"Come on there's gotta be something, some sort of clue.\"You think before noticing what looked like a wooden sign. \"Bingo!\"You slowly approach the sign before seeing something you never in a thousand years thought you would see..........the sign read \"Gravity Falls.\" \"But.....but that's.....that's a cartoon.\"You were beginning to freak, how on earth could this be real? Before you even had a chance to try and process the new information a rustling sound could be heard from infront of you.......and it was moving closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who.....Who's there!?\"You scream backing up against a nearby tree.

You cry out as you rapidly descend, thinking that you'll soon be splattered all over the ground of... wherever this was! As if fate was looking out for you (or possibly a mischievous little devil), a clean, metallic surface suddenly materializes beneath you as you plummet, your fall being broken as you're tightly squeezed into a medium-sized beaker on a hot plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately feel the heat as it quickly gets to work melting your malleable body. \"I would have been better off if I splatted...\", you whimpered as you were soon reduced to nothing but a liquid, with only your eyes floating inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit there, you notice a red-haired boy pass you by before turning back. \"Hello?\", he said as he looked closely at the strange goop in front of him. \"I do not recognize this... whatever it is...\" He spoke in an odd accent and wore a thick pair of glasses, gloves, and a labcoat. You weren't sure where you recognized him from (though, you would have if you had payed attention to the show's opening).

As your eyes spun around from dizziness, he looked on in amazement. \"Whatever this is, it is clearly alive! I should study this specimen further...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears stung at the words \"study\". Your cousin had already done plenty of studying and experimentation on you. To say the idea of someone else poking and prodding examining you made you uneasy was an understatement. You were melted, contained, in a strange place, and being held by a strange boy. You were scared out of your mind.</span></div></div>",

When you opened them up, you were greeted by the sight of a skateboard quickly descending! You didn't even have a chance to scream before you were completely flattened by the weight, the skateboard's movements dragging you behind and causing your malleable body to get caught under the wheels, wrapping around them as whoever was riding continued rolling along. \"What the hell? There's something on my wheels\", said a boyish voice before he stopped and lifted his skateboard up, seeing a pinkish-brown sludge stuck to the wheels. \"Gross! How am I supposed to get this gunk off?\" The \"gunk\" slowly began to move and an eye emerged and blinked. \"Aaaah!\" The boy dropped his skateboard and stepped back, more curious than afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you dropped to the ground, you were able to get a glimpse of the kid that had landed on you. He was wearing a orange shirt and a pair of blue shorts. His skin was an odd yellow color, and his hair seemed to blend in with it and had nine spikes on his head. ...Bart Simpson? But he was a cartoon character. There must have been some kind of mistake. Maybe you could figure it out if you could reform. You began to ooze out from underneath the skateboard, managing to get into a sort of blob shape... before Bart's hand suddenly reached down and grabbed you, squishing you in his grip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! This thing's alive!\" The yellow boy squeezed you in his hand and released, laughing as your eyes would bulge out with each crushing motion. \"Man, you must've come from the power plant\", Bart said as he stretched you in his hands. \"Wonder what kinda stuff a little gooey dude like you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were mentally panicking right now. If you could just reform, you might be able to get some help, but Bart just saw you as some kind of weird creature to play with, and it didn't look like he had any intention of leaving you alone. What was he going to do to you?</span></div></div>",
