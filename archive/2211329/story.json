If one were to describe his hair style as a combination of the characters in MHA, one might decline his hair as a combination of Hanta Sero's and also Izuku Midoriya's, for Gavino's hair is short and also somewhat wild. He stands at 5'9, and has a somewhat muscular build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino is your average student. He is a person looking to be a hero like many others amongst his grade and amongst his class. At the age of 9, he had messed up in life due to accidental use of his <b>Mass Changer</b> Quirk and most kids had either feared or insulted him since. Gavino has grown to be a shy, lonely, and depressed man for his age. Though under that is a determined, funny, and energetic teen waiting to show the world what he can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing wise, he wears white shirts and also blue or black jeans normally. He wears white socks and also old worn down shoes of a brand long since forgotten. He doesn't comb his hair or even put hair gel in it, as he would say it gives him individuality compared to everyone else, even though he's already unique since he was born with two Quirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Family:</b> (They will not be making appearances in this interactive.

I thought you said he never comes this way!\" A Japanese male student exclaimed. \"Why is he coming here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why is he in a new uniform?\" A Japanese female student asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino was consciously aware of the five students that were hiding in a back alleyway until he passed. He was tempted to flip them off and brag about his new school. Sadly, that cocky and arrogant attitude left a while ago, so he couldn't bring himself to do it. He'd rather go to a school like UA where no one has heard of him and become a student there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wait, he is a student at UA. He smiled to himself as he walked to the train station so he could catch a train that would take him to UA. He knew he could have just copied a teleportation Quirk, like that Kurogiri dude's Warp Gate, but he felt that he should approach his new school like he already goes there, and also was an average student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino made it to the station and smiled as he boarded the train that would take him to UA, or at least closer to UA. As he looked for a place to sit on the empty train that was basically empty, he then reminisced on how he built up the guts to ask to enroll into UA via a entrance exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\"><i>Flashback (Two Weeks Ago)</i></div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gavino sat in the chair that was right in front of the principal of UA, Nezu, who Gavino believed was a rat, dog, and bear hybrid mixed into one. The Rogear (the name Gavino gave to whatever Nezu's species is) was currently looking at the file for Gavino, and was slightly in awe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Young man, I have to say you are very impressive,\" Nezu complimented. \"I have never seen a Quirk as powerful as yours until today, besides maybe All Might's and Midoriya's.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"T-thank you sir,\" Gavino thanked.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nezu then frowned. \"Though if I may ask, why does this file have some Quirk information crossed out?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gavino then looked down at the ground. He knew he'd have to talk about it. He didn't want to at all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well... I wasn't born with my Perfect Copy Quirk alone...\" Gavino admitted. \"I... was born with what seemed to be a good secondary Quirk, but it only causes problems. Which is also why I tend to wear gloves that don't have holes like knitted gloves. Prevents me from using it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You speak of your other Quirk like it's a curse,\" Nezu noted.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It might as well be...\" Gavino looked at the ground, remembering the day from his fourth grade year, and shuddering as he remembered the scene.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gavino then explained his Quirk, Mass Changer, to Nezu. He told him about the accident that labeled him as a outcast in his school district, and also made him loss what little friends he had. Nezu nodded and listened.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, we all have are dark moments in life, and it's clear you''ve had your midlife crisis early,\" Nezu assested.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gavino nodded. \"Besides from wanting to get away from those rude pricks, and their... crap, I want to try and become a hero and assist as many people as I can! UA is maybe the place I could get the most benefit out of to achieve that goal, and also because I've heard rumors of a very disliked kid in one of the classes. I've been wondering about that for a while and I might be able to help the kids by replacing that student.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nezu considered it for a moment, and then came to a decision. \"Okay, Mr, Heroesworth. I'll see what Eraserhead and the other teachers will say about you, see if they'll consider the removal of the student who've you heard rumors about, and then I'll make a decision whether to welcome you to UA.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"When you talk to the teachers... could you leave out the bad details of Mass Changer? I just... want to start off fresh for a first time,\" Gavino asked.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't worry. I'll just say you have a second Quirk that you'd rather keep a secret and I work things out from there,\" Nezu said. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>From that day, Gavino waited 1 week and 5 days and recovered confirmation of one thing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Welcome, to your Hero Academia, Young Heroesworth!\" A skeletal man said while looking into a camera and also opening his hand out wide. Gavino cried tears of joy that night, and was happy beyond what he's experienced before.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Present</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, are you a student from UA?\" A male voice called out. Gavino turned and saw a boy with green messy hair a freckles decorating his cheeks right under his eyes, who was followed by a girl with brown hair. Both wore a outfit similar to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yeah!\" Gavino said. \"Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" the green haired boy said. \"I'm Izuku Midoriya. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ochaco Uraraka. I'm in the same class as Deku,\" the brown haired girl introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, I'm Gavino Heroesworth. I'm a transfer student from outside of UA,\" Gavino introduced. \"Um... Do you happen to know where Class 1A might be located since you both go to UA?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're the transfer student Mr. Aizawa told us about?\" Ochaco asked. \"Then that means we're classmates! We're also in Class 1A.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Gavino wasn't excited if their teacher told the class about him. But he wasn't excited if they knew about his history, though they didn't know from what he could tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We're honestly kind of glad that you' do arrived when you did,\" Izuku followed. \"Mineta was getting more bold with his perry attempts everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having you would probably be better than having Mineta,\" Ochaco informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino didn't know what the feeling he had in his chest currently was, but he knew it was something to do with feeling wanted, instead of unwanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train stopped after several more minutes of travel and Isuku and Ochaco got up from their seats and made their way out of the train. Gavino grabbed his stuff and he followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way onto UA grounds, Gavino being awestruck by the place, <span class=\"chunter\">Izuku</span> looked at <span class=\"cbrown\">Gavino</span> and said...</span></div></div>",

Izuku rubbed the back of his head with a goofy smile on his face. \"We would if Kacchan didn't nearly accidentally kill All Might, who is in the infirmary for the time being. So we have the day off,\" Izuku explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, somebody nearly killed All Might?!\" Gavino exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but All Might can't really dodge or do all the incredible things he did when he was the Symbol of Peace, since now he's basically Quirkless,\" Izuku informed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino nodded. He wondered if All Might was still able to use his power, but now he had confirmation that All Might couldn't. But, Gavino then had an idea that he'd need to test at a later date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of walking they made it to the dorms for Class 1A. Gavino then opened the door and said, \"HAHA, I AM YOUR-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to say, \"HAHA, I AM YOUR NEW TRANSFER STUDENT!\", but he was then sprayed in his eyes by a grey liquid which resulted in Gavino saying, \"AH! MY FUCKING EYES!\" He then put his hands to his eyes as he fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku and Ochaco stared wide eyed at Gavino in shock as he sprouted off a bunch of cuss words, and they looked up and their jaws hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, there were holes in the walls that each had a grey substance on them, and also holes in the floor. The room was filled with half of Class 1A and they all were standing still. Currently Mina, Hanta, Denki, Toru, Tsuyu, and also Kyoka were holding what appeared to be spray guns filled with the same grey substance, with Mina currently holding her spray gun at where Gavino's face was and her eyes were opened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent besides Gavino's strands of cussing, which made Tenya appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what is going-JESUS, WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?!\" Tenya questioned as he saw the situation. \"Is that a person on the floor?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet damn well I'm a person!\" Gavino growled. \"And I'm going to find whoever the hell sprayed Acid in my god damned face, and I <i>will</i> make them pay in <span class=\"cmaroon\">blood!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina then eeped and she immediately ran for the back door exit, along with Denki and Hanta. The other three girls just stood there in shock with the mouths opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I hate regenerating eyes, fuck!\" Gavino exclaimed as he stood up and ripped out his eyes from their sockets, two new ones appearing. A glow in his hands and the eye balls he held were gone. He looked around the room and asked, \"Who was the asshole who wants divine wrath struck upon them?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... he has a regenerations Quirk, what appears to be super strength if he can rip out his eyes without screaming or just great mental control, and also a violent nature,\" Izuku mumbled as he started writing things about Gavino in his Quirk Analysis notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Maybe we should calm down before we do something rash, kero,\" suggested Tsuyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, but I want an apology from the asshole who basically bleached by eyes,\" Gavino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I'll go get Mina,\" Kyoka announced as she went to find Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino stretched and rubbed his eyes. \"Damn, that hurt like a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you have a regeneration Quirk?\" Tsuyu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Gavino answered. \"I have a Perfect Copy Quirk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect Copy Quirk, can copy regeneration Quirks,\" Izuku mumbled while he erased what he wrote and replaced it with a new analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is he okay?\" Gavino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Deku just does that. He's trying to break that habit, so just deal with it until he breaks the habit,\" Ochaco said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's... kinda weird and cool since he looks like he's writing something about Quirks and mumbling about Quirks,\" Gavino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know Midoriya was writing about Quirks?\" Tenya asked Gavino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, judging by the way he's moving his pencil, he's writing about how I can copy regeneration Quirks while trying to guess what other Quirks I can copy,\" Gavino answered while also watching Izuku's hand, calculating the strokes and lines Izuku's made with that pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku rose an eyebrow in surprise as that basically sums up what he was writing. \"Add that I have two Birth-Quirks, one that none of you will ever know, and the other which is Perfect Copy and also allows me to copy another extra Quirk every 2 years,\" Gavino informed. Izuku was just writing about the two years equal one new Perfect Copy Quirk when he realized something and the whole room shouted spit at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WERE BORN WITH TWO QUIRKS?!\" The room exclaimed at Gavino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino looked at the ground and heard a door open.

Kaminari and Sero were as well but they were hiding behind a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino could already tell based off of the look on Mina's face that she was the one who sprayed his eyes with acid and pretty much destroyed them. Gavino's eyes narrowed as she walked up to him, and the room became deathly silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one spoke for a minute, with Gavino staring at Mina and Mina staring at Gavino. It was roughly 10 minutes since this awkward silence began that Mina sighed and said, \"I'm sorry for burning your eyes... and destroying them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino found the apology somewhat laughable, but he's had more laughable moments in life. So with he simply held out his hand and said, \"Apology Accepted.\" It was as Mina shook his hand that Gavino added, \"Just never do that again, and also never do whatever the hell you did to this room. It looks like a fucking mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Mina looked around and saw that she did kinda destroy the room, with everyone else that was partaking in the event that resulted into the walls being destroyed by acid. \"Yeah, maybe we should do this outside instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or never in general, and maybe, I don't know, use water,\" Gavino said sarcastically, the two of them ending the handshake. \"I mean, who the hell uses an acid Quirk and doesn't think about the safety of others and the area they are in. Oh wait, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina just stared at him for a moment and then asked, \"Do you have anger issues?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you carefree and potential deadly should you choose to use your Quirk the wrong way?\" Gavino countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Mina said. \"Oh, I don't think we've introduce ourselves. I'm Mina Ashido.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gavino Heroesworth,\" Gavino introduced. \"Now, I got some exploring to do.\" Gavino then walked off faster than anyone could see, and he went up a set of stairs that Iida had appeared from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a speed Quirk. Good to know he can copy those,\" Izuku muttered as he mumbled about Gavino's Perfect Copy Quirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder why he left to go up the stairs,\" Kaminari said as he and Sero approached the rest of Class 1A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably to find his room, since he is the new student,\" Iida suggested logically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he just doesn't know how to talk with people and is rather shy around people, maybe in a large cluster like this, kero,\" Tsuyu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't really seem shy,\" Mina said. \"If anything, he's like one of those kids that do things they shouldn't do but knows when to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU AREN'T!\" Gavino shouted from up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And potentially a hearing Quirk,\" Izuku mumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, we shouldn't judge him from his first appearance and also act. He did just have his eyes destroyed,\" Ochaco said thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that Ochaco?\" Mina asked, a teasing smile spreading onto her face. \"You like him already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were pairing her with Midoriya,\" Tsuyu whispered to Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina then whispered back, \"It's called teasing for a reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, kero.\"<br>\r\n______________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Gavino was sitting on the fourth floor in a corner, mumbling the word crap repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino was scared that he already fucked up and getting his reset done correctly. Did he already make them think he was weird? Did they already make fun of him? Are they trying to figure out his curse he called a birth Quirk? Gavino was scared out of his mind, and he was sure he fucked up any chances at getting friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could live with people fearing him, but all he really wanted was a actual friend. Maybe he could be friends with Izuku and Ochaco and everything could try getting better from there. But with the amount of uncertainty around his future, Gavino silently prayed to the Greek/Roman God of Prophecy known as Apollo that he would get a good future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino eventually got up and sighed. This was already weird for him, and now he had to find a room to be able to sleep in. He didn't know if any were occupied and some people were downstairs so knocking wasn't a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, how am I supposed to find my room now?\" Gavino mumbled to himself, trying to think of a solution.

You mean your singing?\" Jiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Gavino said, looking at the ground, as he never really makes eye contact with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want it to be a secret? It sounds good,\" Jiro complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino was shocked by this response, and he remembered what happened when he first started singing English songs in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>*6 Years Ago*</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Nobody Likes Me by Deuce (At 4:13 on Spotify)</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nobody likes me, no one likes me.

Don't care, what you think. Uh huh, I don't, nu uh. Now it's, much too late to say, your sorry. Don't care, what you think. Uh huh, I don't, nu uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino then hummed the rest of the music, until where the song would end which he randomly guessed. Gavino smiled, as he then rounded the corner of the small intersection of roads that he walked so he could go to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then saw his school's bully, and his egotistic cronies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino knew many words for being 9. And of the many words he could have thought, he thought, 'Fuck.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you look at that,\" the bully said. \"The foreigner is singing a stupid song that probably was meant to reassure him that everything was going to be fine in his sad excuse for a life!\" The bully laughed, and so did his cronies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone. I didn't do anything to you, have I?\" Gavino said, only to flinch when the bully stepped closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" The bully shouted in his face. \"Nobody cares about your opinion, much less about your stupid song!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the record, I was singing a song about how nobody likes me, called 'Nobody Likes Me'. And also, leave me alone. I'd rather be on my way than-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" The bully interrupted. Gavino's eye twitched in anger, but he immediately calmed himself. \"I don't care if you were singing about how you feel lonely! So shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino looked at his hands, which had gloves on them. He then grabbed his right hand, and took off the glove. \"I'll give you a fair warning. Leave. Now.\" Gavino warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully's muscles then grew to four times their size. \"Make me you damned foreigner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino's anger got the better of him, and Gavino thrusted his hand at the bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany tears were shed. From the bully's family, and also from Gavino himself. Not because of regret, but because of the pain he received when his parents found out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>*Present Time*</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino shuddered, and he grimaced. That wasn't one of his best days, maybe the worst. He hated the Quirk he had, and he wanted to take back that day, and change everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's leave it at, I sang a song once and... I did something bad because of an insult from someone,\" Gavino looked away, and looked at fencing on the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you honestly sound great when you can sung in English,\" Jiro said. \"Honestly, I think I might want to check out the band you were singing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino looked up at Jiro, and looked at her face. Gavino could read faces pretty well, and he saw she was being sincere and truthful. \"Well, they're the band called Hollywood Undead. And that song was from the album called, 'Five'. The song was 'Nobody Watching',\" Gavino informed Jiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should you me a few of your favorites, and maybe I could show you some of my favorites. There also English, so I think you might know the bands,\" Jiro said as she held out her hand. \"I'm Kyoka Jiro by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino looked at her hand and smiled as he looked back up at her. He grabbed her and (with his glove still on) shook it. \"Gavino Heroesworth. Just call me Gavino though, it's easier that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro smiled and they let go of his hand. \"So, do you know where your room is?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I was unsure of where my room would be, and I didn't want to accidentally open a door and find someone else's room, and I also wanted to avoid accidentally seeing someone change,\" Gavino admitted as he rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro sighed but smiled. \"Let's go find Iida. He can help you find your room,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino smiled, and not half-heartedly. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked down the stairs, and Gavino got situated into his new room. His stuff came later that day, and Gavino set up his room. He was doing a recount of today and smiled. \"I guess I achieved a friend,\" he mumbled, before he fell asleep, waiting for tomorrow to come.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day proceeded normally for Gavino as he woke up from sleep in his new room, in his new school, with his new friends(?) with a question mark. Gavino had gotten up, got dressed and went to get breakfast, brush his teeth, deodorant yadayadayada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Gavino didn't expect was a breakfast made by his fellow classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first found out about it as a smell of sugar and syrup invaded his nose, waking up Gavino almost fully as he defended the stairs. \"If my sense of nose-blindness can not work for once and I can actually smell for once, please tell me that my nose isn't lying to me like a little bitch and there are pancakes in the kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis non-religious prayers were answered by memes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe descended the last flight of stairs and he looked into the kitchen of his class's dorms. Sure enough, a student who he learned was named Rikido Sato was making pancakes in the kitchen. Almost the whole class was there sitting at one large oval shaped table eating and also talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There room for another student?\" Gavino asked as he walked up to the table, causing everyone to look at him. Minus Sato however, for he was concentrating on the pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's the new kid!\" A male student named Eijiro Kirishima exclaimed as he saw Gavino. \"Yeah man, there's still room for you! Come on, take a seat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino was still slightly surprised at how opened his class,ages were since the transition to this class from his other shitty class. \"Well, I guess I will.\" Gavino sat down in an empty chair next to Kirishima and Izuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're ready to taste Sato's pancakes,\" Kirishima said as he rubbed his hands together and closed his eyes excitedly. \"You haven't even heard of heaven until you've ate some of them! Oh, and I'm Eijiro Kirishima.\" Kirishima held out his hand to Gavino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gavino, and I'm pretty sure that I'm going nowhere close to heaven anytime soon with how the world's decided to be on me,\" Gavino joked half-jokingly, and also half-seriously. \"But, if these pancakes can make one ascend to such a place even temporarily... well, I'll take some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class just stared at Gavino for a minute. \"Nowhere near heaven?\" Kaminari questioned as he lowered a newspaper he was reading. \"Why would you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino fell silent, and felt his body heat up in the way it does when he gets nervous or embarrassed. \"W-well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to do with your past?\" Izuku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes.\" Gavino admitted. \"And also some blood, a bottle, a corpse, and also my sanity deteriorating even further than it already was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blood?!\" Izuku asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bottle?\" Jiro questioned, not seeing the purpose of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A body?!\" Denki exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sanity deteriorated?! What the hell happened to you?\" Kirishima asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life, memes, and my damned American songs,\" Gavino said truthfully. \"And I regret a shit-ton of things, but I also regret nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure those both cancel each other out,\" Momo Yaoyorozu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">And I'm so high I can't feel my face. Cause me and weeds go together like Charlie and J-Dog</span>,\" Gavino sang in English as a counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the name of the song of that verse?\" Jiro asked immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up in Smoke, by Hollywood Undead,\" Gavino replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo was just confused. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is why I sing to myself, by myself, with no one else. I might as well skip breakfast at this rate,\" Gavino said, keeping the last bit to himself and under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should wait a bit before we... talk, about these things with Gavino. He did only just move in and joined the class,\" Izuku suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a great idea Midoriya!\" Tenya Iida said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Gavino had his suspicions, but he felt trapped under the pressure that was placed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Kirishima and Gavino,\" Sato began, with the two looking at him as he came over to the two students. \"Breakfast is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed two pancakes onto both of their plates. Kirishima gained stars in his eyes as he stared at the pancakes and he immediately dug into the pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino was slightly concerned, but also taking amusement from it. Kirishima looked so out of character. Gavino didn't care much and he poured syrup onto his pancakes. He cut them into small pieces with his fork, and took a bite of a pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino froze and didn't move. He then fell backwards and his head hit the floor, along with his chair. Everyone was startled by the <i>thud!</i> that came from the chair and Gavino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, is he okay?!\" Ochaco reacted, saying what everybody though before they could vocalize the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to him Sato?!\" Kaminari exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! The pancakes are all the same!\" Sato protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they heard a low-pitch squealing sound that erupted into a higher pitch as Gavino's eyes widened and he gained a smile even larger than All Might's. His chair suddenly righted itself and stood onto four legs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino reacted instantly and began eating the pancakes and savoring the flavor of the pancakes. \"MY GOD, IT'S SO PERFECT!\" Gavino exclaimed. \"OOOOOOHHHOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... T-Thanks?\" Sato said, confused by the reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino wasted no time in eating his pancakes and asked, \"Is there going to be seconds for those who ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're suppose to be in class in an hour, so I don't know...\" Sato answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you school schedules!\" Gavino mumbled. \"I need more perfection like that in my life if I'm to live any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire class heard that as Gavino wasn't quiet enough to keep it to himself and a few of them laughed/chuckled. Gavino placed his dish into the sink and then went off to do the rest of his pre-school things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any thoughts so far on the new kid?\" Kaminari asked, wondering what everyone thought about Gavino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's kinda weird to be honest,\" Mina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like he has a personality disorder, burdening his lifestyle and life in general,\" Tokoyami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's interesting,\" Izuku said as he continued to scribble notes into his new page meant for Gavino and his Quirks, and also his Hero Costume and any other information he could get on Gavino. \"I don't have much besides the fact he has a Quirk he doesn't like, and also a Quirk that could rival All Might in his prime if the right Quirks are Perfect Copied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, he's probably just needs to let off some steam,\" Jiro said. \"I heard him singing in English on the roof yesterday, and he honestly brought out the emotion of the song he was singing by just singing. Plus, he's seen things that he'd probably want to unsee.\" Jiro looked off towards the area Gavino went off to. \"I'm kinda wondering what happened to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not our place to intrude!\" Iida said, being a buzzkill like normal. \"If he chooses to share his past, then we will wait until then. Until then, we will not ask him anything about his past should he not want to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Iida, you're always such a buzzkill,\" Kaminari said. \"Wonder why you're still Class Rep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaminari, that's too far,\" Momo said. \"Iida just wants Gavino to have a good time here, and probably get him settled in... probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we better start getting ready, school starts in 30 minutes,\" Sato said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody immediately cleaned and got ready for their next day at UA High. Meanwhile, Gavino was already at the door and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>They should try and get ready earlier than now, they might be late</i>.'

Gavino sank into his desk shyly, and everyone else sat into their own seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir homeroom teacher, Eraserhead, walked in. \"Hello class,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Aizawa Sensei,\" everyone but Gavino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome.

Why don't you come up and introduce yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino got up and tried to keep a straight face but also blank. He walked up to the front of the room. \"Hi, I'm Gavino. Nice to meet you all. I don't expect any of you to bother me or be my friend. Hate me, say mean things to me, beat the shit out of me, I don't care if you do it,\" Gavino said, which confused and also surprised the other students. \"But know, I intend to rise in the ranks, and I intend to prove my worth, regardless of what happens to me.

Along with the scars and burns on that same student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Later<br>\r\nClass 1A Dorms</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino now sat in the living room of his class's dorms, humiliation on his mind and also now wanting to die so bad that jumping off a roof wouldn't satisfy that need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino was now also in clothes, in a fresh causal black t-shirt with Dragon Ball FighterZ's logo on the front, black jeans held up by a black belt, and also white socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino also decided that since he probably couldn't go back into the school for a day until everything calmed down, he decided to wear something he wore as tribute to the one character he would want to be a apprentice of, and only one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went up to his room and walked into it. It was rather plain. He had a bed, a desk with a laptop, a few posters, and the other essentials. But, there was another desk, with a bandana on it. It was more like a head band, but Gavino preferred to call it a bandana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino grabbed the bandana and wrapped it around his head, right around his forehead and right above his eyebrows. He smiled as he finished tying it, and he went back to the living room. He frowned to himself as he checked the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wild goose chase he was forced to be chase in lasted a while, so currently it was 9:37 am. On a normal day, he wouldn't be in here until around 4 pm. But, due to his cowardly and embarrassed behavior, he was here early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he decided to start his work out, which was something he neglected to do when he was younger (20 push-ups, 30 sit-ups, 30 jumping jacks, and repeat ten times, followed by a large sprint that he wanted to be a mile long) he heard the front door to the dorms open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino sighed and looked up. He tensed up as he saw...</span></div></div>",

He looked at the door and took a few deep breaths. He was still wearing the casual clothing he wore earlier because he always seems to feel weird if he's meeting someone without wearing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door and saw Mina giving a smile as she stared at him. \"Hey! Can I come in?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino shook his head. \"Using my second Quirk here isn't a good idea. I think it's best if we went somewhere else and used my second Quirk,\" he said. But he actually pulled her into his room and closed the door and locked it. \"I have a Perfect Copy Quirk so I can teleport us out of here and somewhere else so we don't damage the facility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina tilted her head in confusion. \"Why do you say that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because my Quirk changes the mass of a living object so that they can be a giant in terms of height, or as small as a action figure,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina raised an eyebrow. \"Do you have any control over your Quirk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... it took a lot out of me to keep Izuku's muscles from becoming inhumanly huge,\" Gavino revealed. \"I have a place we could go so we don't get caught since I did a lot of exploring a long time ago at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino suddenly became misty like Kurogiri as he copied his Quirk. \"We're going to a old military base from the rise of Quirks, back when Quirks were first being found and introduced in the world.\" He then made a portal and engulfed Mina as they teleported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina saw what he meant when they were done teleporting. They were in a large area, littered by buildings covered in moss and plants. Luckily, the area had a smooth pavement that felt pleasant to touch. There were at least 5 jet hangars from what Mina could count, and each of them were roughly the size of 4 three bedroom apartments put together in a scare formation, but also 5 stories high with a dome roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you must've been lucky to find this place,\" Mina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! And the thing is, this is surrounded my miles of woods! No one could find us if we're here,\" Gavino said, losing the mist. \"And... thank you again for helping me. Seriously, no one has ever tried to help me before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina smiled. \"Don't mention it! It's what friends are for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... thank you for being my friend,\" Gavino thanked. He started walking towards one of the hangars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does your Quirk work?\" Mina asked as she walked by his side while looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It manipulates the mass of living things, like humans, and allows me to add mass or decrease mass, or making them a giant or an ant, or making a part of them grow or shrink,\" Gavino said. \"So if I were to make a part of you grow, like your hand, your clothes could be fine, but if I made you a giant, then your clothes would rip and you would end up naked. If I shrunk your whole body, you would be tiny, but also naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina then processed the information as they entered the hangar from the large opened gate. The hangar was empty, luckily, so they would use this hangar. \"So... would it be better if I stripped and I did this naked?\" Mina asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino almost choked on his saliva that was building in his mouth from getting nervous and was swallowing when she asked that question. \"Jesus! Why were you so blunt about it?!\" Gavino questioned. \"I'm technically a stranger! You'd be stripping in front of a stranger who could just make your hand bigger and we could experiment like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina was already taking off her shirt though, and she took it off and Gavino swore that this night might end with more than one victory as he looked at Mina's breasts, while she still had a bra on. Mina smiled. \"I'm trying to help you, so I'll help you in a way that's not limited,\" she said while taking off her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino looked away before she realize he was staring. \"Why me?\" Gavino mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina heard it however and smiled as she has stripped completely naked. \"Okay, I'm ready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino looked at Mina and immediately blushed and looked away. \"You didn't have to strip naked!\" Gavino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina walked over to him and smiled. \"I want to help you the best way I can. This is the best way.\" She grabbed his hand and took off his glove and pressed it onto her collar bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino sighed as he activated his Quirk and she started to glow pink and she gained a pink aura from it. They both were surprised by the aura and Gavino let go, but it lingered. \"Woah! This looks cool!\" Mina said, but Gavino saw that his Quirk was already in affect.</span></div></div>",

This is illegal as is, and I don't want it to become any more illegal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina sighed as she stood up before they realized she was as tall as Gavino, who was one of the tallest of the class. \"I think you miss calculated my height,\" Mina said with a smile as she giggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did...\" he said as he made her her actual normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina smiled as she bounced on the balls of her feet. \"That was fun, wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit...\" Gavino said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina smiled as she had a idea. '<i>Thank god that Mineta isn't here or in UA anymore. Otherwise, I might regret this idea</i>,' Mina thought before she grabbed Gavino's still ungloved hand and put it on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino immediately blushed that it was noticeable and he looked at her as she gained the pink aura again before he took his hand away. \"Wh-What the hell?!\" Gavino questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina smiled as she looked at her breasts. Gavino, though unpervertedly, looked as well and they saw they were growing. They just kept staring before...</span></div></div>",

And she knew that Momo was stacked, so to have her breasts be the same size as Yaoyorozu's means she could probably be a bit like the Vice Class Rep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mina felt turn on by that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay! I-I think we should be done for the night,\" Gavino said as he stopped staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but why?!

You can still help me... so let's just continue it tomorrow,\" Gavino explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina sighed and nodded. \"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino then looked at her... upgrade. \"We should probably go ahead and get you reverted as to not raise suspicion about what happened,\" Gavino suggested as he stepped towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Mina said as she put back on her pajamas, though her top barely fit and showed a bit of her stomach and her breasts. \"I'll be fine. I'll just need a wardrobe upgrade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Gavino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive!\" She said with a smile. \"Though maybe for a later night you could try to learn how to make clothes using Yaomomo's Quirk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino thought about it for a minute. \"Umm.... sure. I'll try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Was Mina's response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino became a bit misty again as he teleported them back into UA. \"Well, you should probably go,\" he said. \"Or I could teleport you to your room really quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina shook her head as she...</span></div></div>",

He then remembered that this was UA, and then he remembered last night. Or was that some bizarre dream the buried deep down pervert part of him sent him. Regardless, he had to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked downstairs again and saw that today, everyone was eating some more casual breakfast items, which was namely cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top of the mornin' to ye laddies,\" Gavino said in an Irish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Gavino, confused at first but saw it was him and they all said good morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go burn in hell, shithead,\" came Bakugo's greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you fuck your mom, then I will,\" Gavino retorted, causing Bakugo to nearly spit out the water he was drinking as he was already done with his breakfast and he was drinking water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugo swallowed the water first before yelling at Gavino, \"WHO THE HELL IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD FUCKING DO THAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell in their right mind would dramatize their own son by beating him and isolating him from other kids his age?\" Gavino retorted, with Todoroki looking up at that with a surprised look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugo just blinked. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino sighed. \"I'm talking about this class's Sasuke over there,\" Gavino said as he pointed at Todoroki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a Sasuke?\" Todoroki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fictional anime character who might be the God of all Emo Anime Characters. If this were an anime, you'd fit right in that category since you seemed emo before the Sports Festival,\" Gavino said as he grabbed a bowl from a cabinet. \"Now, to we have any oats? I want to make me some oatmeal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't, we ran out on Sunday,\" Kirishima said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SON OF A BITCH!\" Gavino said. \"At least tell there is something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are eggs...\" Yaoyorozu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works with me!\" Gavino said. He then kept the bowl and grabbed some eggs and started to make scrambled eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs was at that moment that Mina decided to come down, but she tried to sneak out of the dorms immediately and head to class without breakfast, having fully gotten ready today and had her uniform on, despite it being tight and she felt like it was gonna leave a mark on her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the world of My Hero Academia! This is an adventure with the most random and fun plot that you can make your own story! Luckily for you, you have two Quirks as you were lucky when you were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Quirk must haves:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1. Mass Changer</b><br>\r\nThe user can alter the mass of a human, whether it's their part or their entire body. In doing so, the user can either shrink the person they are affecting, or make the person they are affecting bigger. This however only affects human skin, and will not effect clothes, electronics, accessories, liquids, or anything amongst the sort. Though the only thing that can be altered liquid-wise would be breast milk (in your own path, expansion or shrinking does not need to happen, but the Quirk Mass Changer must be mentioned with a reason why you are not going to use it). You've also been told that it makes girls/guys (depends on your character's gender) more attracted to you and love you the more you use it, though they believe they are doing it willingly (you may pair yourself with any female character in Class 1A, 1B, the Support Course, the League of Villains/Villains in general, civilian characters (Inko, Mitsuki, Rei Todoroki, and also Melissa Shield) (Eri is included, but must be more tame and friendly with her since she's 7 years old), and also pro heroes/pro hero teachers). It has no affect on your character's gender (if you're characters a guy, it won't affect another guy character).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2. Perfect Copy.</b><br>\r\nFor those who choose not to use the first Quirk, you may rejoice as you were given a Perfect Copy Quirk! This quirk allows you to perfectly copy 1 quirk perfectly, and adds another to the total that you can learn and \"forget\" (in Pok\u00e9mon terms, you can learn how to manipulate water but then find another Quirk to use and forget it, but you can remember it later) for every two years you've been alive (2 years equal 1 quirk, 4 years equal 2 quirks, and etc.)! You have no restraints on what Quirks you can copy (actually, you do, but more on that in the rules), and this is also the reason why you are in Class 1A in this story. You are also 15 by default.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules for this story:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1</b>. If you chose to use your Quirk, Mass Changer, you are free to use it on anyone if your character builds a bond with that character to the point the character you're using your Quirk on is comfortable with you and sees you as more than a friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A simple guild line to follow for this is the following:</b><br>\r\n1: Acquaintances. 2: Friends. 3: Best Friends. 4: Something More. 5: Dating. 6: Doing Anything With Each Other (No Turning Back).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2</b>: You may have your character dating multiple people of their opposite gender. I don't care whether you call it a harem or a polyamory, or if it's two people your character is dating. I really couldn't care less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3</b>: The Quirk Perfect Copy can not copy the following Quirks: All For One, Rewind (Eri's Quirk), One For All, Disintegrate (Tomura Shigaraki's Quirk), Super Intelligence (Nezu's Quirk), or Acid (Mina's Quirk). You can however copy any Quirk other than those, and also Quirks that belonged to deceased people (Nana Shimura is an example). Also, specific Quirks I will allow some to make up on the spot as long as it's not overpowered. You're already overpowered as is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>4:</b> You may make up your own arcs for this story for your path! As long as it's somewhere in the MHA universe/Earth, I'll allow it. We can't have them going into space, besides a Moon Base if one chooses to make one, but that's as far as I'll let you guys go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5:</b> Murder is allowed. But please let it correspond with the plot of your arcs. We don't want random murders to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave I covered everything? Hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(2/8/20: Another author has asked me why Mineta was removed for all of these things, and I realized (after a while) that others in Class 1A are somewhat useless and also that some aren't going to be useful at times, like Koda and Aoyama for their examples. So you can replace any character from 1A if you want! I'm alright with any reason you choose!)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now! Start your story in the wonderful world of My Hero Academia, where you have special rules to follow so this story isn't insane! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Author will now gives a shout out to Maria777 for the Mass Changer Quirk idea, and also for the reasons for Mass Changer's limits!</b></td>",
