I've got all the dogs I need, and I can always use another servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Servant'?\", said Cynthia. \"What do you mean, 'servant'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her, Amanda gestured, and Cynthia's clothing vanished, instantly replaced by a maid outfit.

Cynthia stood to attention, her arms at her sides, unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to get you ready to travel\", said Amanda. She drew up her right sleeve, to reveal a charm bracelet on her right wrist. The \"charms\" appeared to be small figures of men and women. Amanda held the bracelet over Cynthia's head. A small ring materialized, linking the bracelet to the top of Cynthia's head.   Cynthia began to shrink. As she shrank, her body took on a golden hue. Within a few seconds, she was just another \"charm\" on Amanda's bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to clean up\" said Amanda, She gestured, and all of the girls' clothing, whether still on their bodies or scattered around the house, turned to dust and blew away.  She waved her hand, and a dog carrier appeared in her hand. she set it down on the kitchen floor. Without warning, it swelled up and around the sixteen dog-girl, trapping them inside itself, before shrinking back to its original size.  Amanda picked up the dog carrier and walked out the back door of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the carrier, the dog/girls found themselves in a dark but comfortable space.

As you may perhaps have guessed. I'm what you might call a sorceress. Yes, magic is real, although your world doesn't seem to have an native magic-users.  As for why I transformed you all into dogs, well, humans that have been transformed into animals are high-demand luxury items in some realities.  Of course, it's hugely illegal in all the civilized worlds to transform people against their will, so that's why I like to raid realities like yours. where there's no one who will detect magic in use. Anyway, there are people who are willing to pay high prices for transformed humans, and who aren't too particular whether they were volunteers or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why us, though?</i>, thought June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my - 'fence', I think you would call him - placed an order for sixteen young girls who had been transformed into different breeds of dogs. No idea what he wants you for - pets, familiars, breeding animals, who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Breeding animals\"?</i>, thought Caroline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly\", said Amanda. \"I don't ask. Don't worry too much.  Even I have my standards. I would never sell you to someone who might eat you or sacrifice you, or even abuse you. Also, to save you some time and effort, I'll tell you now: The spell I used on you can't be reversed. Even I couldn't do it, if I wanted to. And you can't be further transformed. You're dogs for the rest of your lives, so get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why us, particularly?</i>, thought Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And why did you pose as a babysitter?</i>, asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No especial reason\", said Amanda. \"I could have just taken sixteen girls at random, but I like to have fun on these jobs when I can, and Stacy and her parents were easily manipulated.  Seriously, Stacy, did it never occur to you to wonder why someone who had been hired to watch you just let you go off to a party without saying a word?  It was just gravy that there were all the girls I needed at the party, with a spare to take as a souvenir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But what about our families?</i>, thought Violet.  <i>We'll be missed!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you won't, actually\", said Amanda.  \"The spell I used re-wrote people's memories, changed all records and transformed any personal items. No one will remember you, and there's no evidence left that you existed.  It's not as thorough as re-writing history, and any first-year magic-user would spot it instantly, but it'll do for a world like yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What have you done to my sister?</i>, asked Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia?  She's one of my slaves, now.  I always keep a few of them in 'charm' form when I travel in case I need them. When I get her home, I'll restore her to her new human form, and set her to work.  Don't worry - I've brainwashed her so that she'll be overjoyed to be my slave and truly believe that a life serving me is the best possible life imaginable. Also, I've stopped her aging, so that she'll be physically eighteen forever.  You should be happy for her - she'll be eternally young and beautiful, doing work that she finds rich and fulfilling.for as long as she lives, which may well be as long as <b>I</b> live, which may well be forever.

I love you too, but just wait till we get home for you to do that.\" As you and your \"Master\" keep walking, something in the back of your mind tells you that this wasn't right.

Ok, hold on, we're almost at a bathroom area for you. You never thought about going potty in a long time and you really do have to go.

You gotta go potty don't ya?\" Ugh, might as well go you think, and just as you sit down like you would on the toilet, you have this urge in your gut that this wasn't the spot. 'Where is the spot?' you think to yourself. Right then and there you put your new nose to the ground, and soon found the perfect area. You then squatted and went. After that, you smelt  it and for some reason, that felt natural...<br>\r\nAs soon as you got home, every scent in the house flooded your nose... What a rush, and what smells!!!

Just you and me for a whole month!!!\" <i>Yeah... I wish it was over already</i> Stacy thought to herself again. \"Meooooooooowwwww\" cried a cat on the fence, trying to grab the attention. It was Dottie, the neighbor's cat and she liked to visit often, but tonight was gonna be a little different... A growl pretty low was building in Stacy's chest and only Amanda and the cat noticed. The growl grew and soon the cat leaped off into the yard... A crucial mistake. Stacy never really minded cats, but tonight, Stacy felt as if Dottie was teasing her and she .needed to get rid of her. The cat quickly climbed up the tree and cried for 'help.' \"Get out of here Dottie!!!! This is my house! My yard! My territory!!!!\" She heard herself say the last word and jumped. \"Oh!! Oh I...\" She looked down and blushed, feeling embarrassed. \"I think I need to go to the restroom... Please excuse me Amanda...\" She raced all the way to the room... What happened there?</span></div></div>",

In an instance, Stacy suddenly became thirsty. Normally, she would just go into the kitchen and get a Diet Coke, but for some reason the water in the toilet seemed more appealing to her. Stacy absentmindedly starting licking her lips, and as she did, her tongue became longer and flatter, the perfect tongue to lap up all that nice, cold toilet water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stood there for what seemed like an eternity.

What the heck was I thinking?!?!?!?!</i> She shut her eyes pretty tight and fell backwards. She starred at the white porcelain toilet, afraid to get up and do the same thing she just avoided. Stacy unnoticingly lolled her tongue to the side and breathed as if she ran out of breath. She knew that she just couldn't stay in the bathroom any longer unless she wanted Amanda to come bursting any minute, so she slowly made her way off the floor. Shaking, she tried to avoid contact with the water, but in vain. For minutes she stared at the steady water that lied inside the toilet bowl. <i>Man that water looks good... So cool... Probably refreshing.</i> She thought, but then she shook her head and tried to resist another urge to get any closer to the bowl. She shut her eyes again, and lost her previous though, but when she opened them again, the thoughts came back with a vengeance!!! <i>Go ahead!!! What's the problem? This water is the same as the bottled kind... Go and drink up!</i> She wrinkled her nose and felt as if she could smell a fresh spring nearby. This made the toilet water more appealing to her, and she came closer... and closer... \"Ugh!!! Not again!!\" She said almost a little sloppy. She closed her eyes and this time she managed to exit the bathroom. When she opened her eyes, she was in the hallway, and smiled with her young hanging on the side. <i>Yes!!! Finally in of the clear!!!</i> She was to distracted from her small victory that she bumped into Amanda.<br>\r\n          <i>Oh no!!!</i> she thought to herself. \"Hey Stacy, are you feeling alright? I mean first the cat and now you were in the bathroom for almost an hour!!\" Almost an hour? To Stacy, it felt like a few minutes, but when Stacy looked at the clock, true to Amanda's word, it actually was almost an hour! Stacy thought of each moment spent in the bathroom and finally she noticed the little gurgle noise her stomach gave. Amanda smiled as Stacy blushed, too shy to say anything about it. \"So, are you're hungry?\" She asked rhetorically, and left to make something in the kitchen. Stacy turned on the t.v. and watched a little. <i>Yeah... Maybe that's what I need... I mean I haven't in like hours, maybe that will help my mind...</i> She thought nervously, and when a few minutes passed, Amanda was finished and called her into the kitchen. <i>That was fast...</i> What did Amanda make?</span></div></div>",

As Stacy was about to run to the first thing to explore, a thought came to mind... <i>Hey, maybe you could do all of your exploring quicker if you use your arms for running too!</i> At first, Stacy knew that running on all fours was stupid and that humans didn't naturally walk or run that way, forgetting she had done it while eating. Then her mind began to think more about it... It was logical. The more the merrier, and the faster she could be, so she decided to give it a try. Amanda smiled as she notice the plop Stacy made and started running faster on all fours. Stacy's dog tongue hung to the side and she ran everywhere. As Stacy became preoccupied with finding out the many smells, she was too distracted to notice how she was smaller than before and how floppy her ears felt. Her senses became stronger and the new smells that became visible to her nose now made her more distracted. Smelling was all she felt like doing now.

She fell to her side and whimpered as her paws were forming. Stacy closed her eyes tightly so she never noticed. Her tail had just finished it's growth and it went between her legs. Her fingers shrank to stubs and her nails turned black as they started to change form themselves. In a matter of seconds, her paws were finished with their transformation. Stacy opened her eyes, relieved that the pain from all four of her paws had subsided.She stood up and instantly felt like something was different. She noticed that her vision was a little altered and that she couldn't see some colors as she normally could. She started to whimper and that's when she found out that she was not herself. Her head looked at her body, and she notice that not only did she have the body structure of a dog, but her tail and paws were there! These were not human anatomies, and yet she had them! She whimpered more as she looked at her now shrinking breasts! She stared in horror as they retreated to nipples. You could imagine how much worse she was feeling when she saw more nipples forming in two rows down her stomach. As if it couldn't get any worse, a terrible pain shot at her face. A big whine came out as her nose was as mush as a tree inches away from her face. Her nose started turning black and it's texture changed slightly rough and became wet. Stacy lowered her head as her whole body had finished it's structural transformation... What happens next?</span></div></div>",

She looked all over her body, but thought that she didn't really change much. She had a sound mind, but would this, too, deteriorate away? Stacy tried to keep the positives when Amanda called her. \"Stacy! Come here girl!\" Stacy's human mind soon dropped as her canine instincts were front in center. Her tongue lolled on the side as she raced over to her 'master's' side, and wagged her tail with each step. Stacy, then, regained her reasoning\u2026 <i>Oh no! Would this get worse? Could I possibly forget who I am by the time this is over? I don't want to be a dog forever!</i> The beagle who was once Stacy whined and whimpered, feeling her tail droop. \"What's the matter baby?\" <i>She's being affectionate to me? But\u2026 Why?</i> She thought to herself and then another thought entered her mind. <i>Well, duh! Of course she's affectionate to you! You are her dog! Her pet, and she will take care of you because she is your master!</i> Stacy knew that this voice would probably come back from time to time, and that if she listened to it too much, she could possibly loose her humanity, so she tried to ignore it for the time being\u2026<br>\r\nAmanda then looked at Stacy, looking like she was internally arguing with herself and chuckled. \"It's useless Stacy, don't fight the urges! Once this month is over, you'll be back to normal! Well\u2026 Maybe not fully normal. Hahaha\" She laughed as she thought to herself. She did this to all of the children that she babysat who were bratty, just like Stacy. Of course, depending on the child's personality, she changed them from the many breeds that dogs could be. \"Don't worry Stacy\u2026 If this doesn't help you, I'll keep you myself!\" She said, trying to get Stacy's attention. Stacy became more worried, but suddenly put her fear and human thinking behind her as Amanda came with a collar.</span></div></div>",

Even though Stacy was obviously going to become and live like a dog for a while, it will be over after a week! The thought of her being a dog temporarily made her a little happier. Her feelings of happiness started to increase the more she thought about them, and her tail started wagging. Stacy stood up and looked at Amanda. A thought came to mind... <i>This is master. Do not upset master or else she could hurt you.</i> More thoughts flowed in her mind and soon she felt a prickly feeling on her skin. She looked at her body pretty closely, and saw hair, fur actually, grow all over her body. It wasn't too painful, but the sensation made her instinctively raise her leg. The leg followed through and soon enough, she was scratching her body just like a normal dog would. As the fur was growing Stacy noticed that her beautiful dirty blonde hair was changing to what her vision precepted as grayish yellow. A whimper burst through as she tried to scream. Amanda finally came over as the final changes occurred, knowing that Stacy was too preoccupied with all the changes. In her hand, Amanda held firmly onto a pink collar with the name tag labeled Stacy. The whimpering and crying Stacy settled down instantly for a while as she felt giant hands pick her up. Stacy looked at the one who had held her, and saw Amanda, but instead of growling, Stacy started panting happily and wagged her tail. In the back of Stacy's mind, she was screaming. \"C'mon body work!!! That is the one who did this to you!!\" The problem, though, was that wasn't the only voice in her mind, and the other voice was more powerful.<i>Master!!! I love you so much!! </i> It seemed like the other voice was motivating Stacy to do things that her human part would never dream of. Amanda smiled and even giggled as Stacy suddenly began licking her cheek. \"I love you too Stacey!! You're gonna be a good girl for me right?\" Stacy's human voice shouted \"NOOOOO!!!! I will never ever treat you with respect!\" But of course, it was overpowered with <i>Yes!!!! Yes Master!!! I love to obey you!!</i></span></div></div>",

Sneezing, Jessica felt like soot had fell onto her, but as she looked around there was nothing. \"What's the matter Jessica?\" She looked around again, but then dismissed it, feeling a little silly. \"Um nothing I guess... Well, I'll go get my stuff and then I'll leave. Bye puppy! You're so cute!\" She smiled as she rubbed her belly and then stood up to go upstairs. When she came back she turned to say goodbye to the cute beagle and then Amanda. \"I don't know why Stacy thinks this could be the worse time of her life... You seem like a cool babysitter! Even if she is a little old for one...\" Jessica turned to leave, when Amanda felt a little happy. <i>I wish I was babysitting her, she seems better behaved than this one...</i> She looked down to see that Stacy was about to make a dash and picked her up before she could escape. \"Naughty dog! You need to stay with me or you'll be lost\" Amanda looked back to see Jessica, and then...</span></div></div>",

It's not like becoming something different like a new species isn't possible...\" She said, a little down. \"What if I told you that is is and I have already made it possible for you?\" Jessica scoffed a little. \"I might have told you something personal, but that doesn't give you the right to joke at me like this...\" She felt a tear form in an eye and was about to leave when Amanda stopped her. \"I'm telling you the truth! Come back inside and I'll tell you!\" Jessica sighed and then slowly, but surely followed her back inside. Amanda closed the door and set Stacy down. \"Look, I can make anyone become a dog if I want to, I swear! Look, to prove that I'm not lying, this beagle is actually your friend Stacy!\" Jessica looked down as Stacy was chasing her tail then tripped as she succeeded. Jessica laughed a little, but was unimpressed. \"Yeah right... That's your dog that just happens to be named Stacy!\" Amanda whispers something, trying to speed up a change and soon, Jessica felt her tongue changing! \"Well then, I guess your tongue is just a coincidence?\" Jessica gasped and ran straight to the bathroom. She looked at her tongue in the mirror and noticed that not only did her tongue seem flatter with each second, but her tongue was also elongating to a dog's length. This proved it! She was actually becoming a dog!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Jessica react?</span></div></div>",

As Stacy bent over to pick up her blouse  she noticed her skirt was caught on something.  She turned around to her mirror to see what it was.  Stacy nearly fainted as a two inch hairless tail was above her smooth ass cheeks.  It was about the size of a large thumb.  It reminded her of those stubs that dogs have when their tails are removed at birth.  She tried to yank it off,but it hurt.  Breathless from the shock Stacy noticed her face in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears were longer and pointy.  They seemed like the ears of a collie.  Stacy saw that her nose was black and damp.  Her teeth were sharp and canine along with her tongue,which she had trouble keeping in her mouth because of it's length. Stacy closely examined the rest of her body and found that was the extent of her changes.</span></div></div>",

I'm not eating my meatloaf out of a bowl on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda laughed to herself.  She had opened a can of dog food and put it in the bowl, but the spell effecting Stacy must be making her think the dog food is meat loaf.  Amanda decided to keep track of how Stacy's mind interpreted the reality around her to use as a measure of how much her mind was accepting the coming changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't want that 'meatloaf' I guess I'll throw it out\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy noticed Amanda put heavy emphasis on the word meatloaf, but didn't have time to worry about that.  Her stomach was positively growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't do that.  Can I just have a plate and silverware please?\" she asked, surprisingly meekly for the stuck up girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Stacy, I don't have time for games.  I assume you don't want to go hungry.  Just eat your dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stared at the bowl of meatloaf.  If she wasn't overwhelmed with hunger, she might have noticed how cloudy her mind felt.  That cloudiness made it hard to pay attention to Amanda, until she heard her say 'Just eat your dinner.'  The command seemed to cut through the fog in Stacy's mind.  When Amanda gave her a command, Stacy's brain immediately interpreted that idea as if it had been her own.  She was very hungry, after all.  I should just eat my dinner, she thought.  As soon as Stacy thought this, her stomach growled again, echoing its support.  She was so focused on her hunger and the food, Stacy didn't even notice herself get down on her hands and knees.  The next thing she knew, she was sticking her face into the bowl and taking a big bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was amazing!  Stacy couldn't remember meatloaf ever tasting this good!  Although it was a stronger, muskier flavor than she remembered, that seemed to be just what she wanted.  She also noticed it was moister than meatloaf usually was, but that didn't stop her from taking bite after bite, until finally, it was all gone.  She was so focused on the flavor and sating her hunger, she didn't even notice that as she ate more, she got more excited, and ended up smearing some of the food on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess you didn't need a plate after all\" Amanda said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard Amanda's voice, Stacy's mind lost a little bit of the fog.  And with the fog gone, she realized she had just eaten an entire meatloaf out of a bowl on the ground like an animal.  She was deeply embarrassed by her actions, and even worse, that she had done so in front of her babysitter!  She blushed a deep red and looked at Amanda.</span></div></div>",

I don't know what came over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda chuckled.  \"Oh, I don't think it's the meatloaf they'll have questions about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked confusedly at Amanda.  What did she mean by that?  Then she looked back at the bowl.  There was a smear or two of food left.  Wait a minute, meatloaf didn't smear did it?  And she still couldn't get over how strong it tasted.  That musky, meaty taste still felt strong in Stacy's mouth.  As she considered this, her gaze moved up from the bowl on the floor to the counter next to Amanda.  Stacy's blood ran cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way....  I didn't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy could only stare in shock.  Sitting on the counter next to Amanda was a can opener and an open, and empty, can of dog food!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so Stacy.  You just scarfed down a whole can of Purina's finest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. no!  You are just playing a trick on me!  You just dumped that can out before I came in here, I'd know if I ate dog food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smirked.  \"Oh really?  Here, have a whiff of this and tell me that isn't what you just ate so happily.\"  Amanda grabbed the empty can and held it in front of Stacy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy tentatively took a sniff.  As soon as she did, there was no doubt.  That scent smelled exactly like the taste coating her tongue right this very second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gross!\" Stacy yelled.  She blushed a deep red.  She really had done it!  She had eaten dog food!  What was wrong with her.  Her shame was too much, she had to get away.  Stacy turned from Amanda and ran to her bathroom.  Inside, she slammed the door and went straight to her sink.  Her mouth tasted like dog food!  She had to take care of that NOW!  She popped the lid off her mouthwash and took a long swig.  After rinsing it around her mouth, she spit it out, then repeated the process twice more.  The mint aftertaste was finally strong enough that it overpowered anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy started to cry.  She was so embarrassed.  How could she have eaten dog food?  And what was worse, why was there a voice in the back of her mind saying how good it tasted?!  What if her family or friends had seen her?  She'd never live down her freak status!  And that no good Amanda had made her do it.  She was going to show her.  She stopped crying as she became more angry at Amanda.  It was time to take her down.  She wiped her tears away and checked herself in the mirror.  She blushed a deep crimson again as she noticed a bit of smeared dog food on her face.  She quickly grabbed a washcloth and cleaned the offending evidence off her face.  That woman was going to pay for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy opened the bathroom door and stomped back into the kitchen.  Amanda was still standing by the counter, looking like the cat who ate the canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you did, but you're going to pay for that.  I'm calling my parents right now!\" Stacy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda muttered something under her breath she couldn't hear.  Stacy suddenly felt confused, as though she had just woken from a dream.  All her anger drained out of her.  She could barely remember how she got into the kitchen, much less what she was doing there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there something you needed?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy tried to think.  Was there something on he mind?</span></div></div>",

As she thought, Amanda noticed Stacy was unconsciously fidgeting and bending her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.... I don't remember,\" Stacy admitted.  She didn't realize it, but at this point she was practically hopping from foot to foot.  To any parent, Stacy was unmistakably doing the \"pee-pee dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like someone needs to use the toilet if I'm not mistaken\" Amanda said with a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was about to retort when her body's signals finally got through the haze and she realized Amanda was right.  She had to pee bad!  She turned around and quickly walked back to the bathroom.  Once inside, she shut the door, but as soon as the door latched, she felt her mind cloud up again.  It was like thinking through a thick soup.  Why had she come in here?  After a second, she felt her body's need, and remembered she had to pee.  But her mind was so thick, it was hard for her to put together her need to go with what to do next.  She looked at the toilet.  Was that what she needed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Stacy had been using a toilet for years, her mind was having trouble processing what it was there for.  She opened the lid and looked down.  She was almost mesmerized by the water in the bowl.  That water looked so clear and refreshing.  Yes, she thought, water is refreshing.  I must be thirsty.  She went to the sink and filled a glass with water from the tap, then drank the whole thing.  As she put the glass down, she felt the pressure in her bladder grow.  That's right, she thought, I have to pee.  Again, her mind was barely responding.  She walked back to the toilet.  I have to pee, she thought.  What was the next step?  She looked at the toilet.  As soon as she saw the water in the bowl, all she could think about was how refreshing it looked.  That's right, she thought, water is very refreshing.  Again, she left the toilet and filled up another glass, drinking the entire thing.  This time it only took a second for her bladder to tell her she was running out of time.  But for the life of her, she couldn't think of what to do.  Suddenly there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright in there?\" Amanda asked.  \"Do you need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Stacy respond?</span></div></div>",

She needed to go to the bathroom, so why should she leave?  But before she could ask, Amanda walked off.  Stacy had no choice but to follow her.  She walked out to the living room, to where Amanda was standing by the sliding door to the fenced in back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what seems to be the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda...\" Stacy whined \"I need to go to the bathroom!\"  Stacy was dancing back and forth, doing the pee pee dance again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!  Every time I try I get... confused... or something...  Please, I really have to go, help me!\" Stacy was very ashamed to ask for help in something so routine, but she knew something was wrong.  She'd worry about what after she got this taken care of.  Amanda just shook her head and opened the sliding door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're just going to waste my time with practical jokes, I'm going out back.\"  Amanda walked outside.  Stacy hopped out after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeease!  It's not a joke.  Something's really wrong, but I don't know how to go to the bathroom!  I need help.\" Stacy whined.  She couldn't hold it much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda folded her arms across her chest, taking a serious tone.  \"Fine, but to prove you're not pulling my leg, you'll have to do something for me.  Take off your pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Stacy asked.  She couldn't be serious?  Although her thoughts were foggy, Amanda's command echoed in her mind like it was her own thought.  However, that thought was so alien, that it didn't make sense to Stacy, so she managed to brush it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious.  I need you to prove to me you aren't faking.  If you do it, I'll know you're serious.  Take off your pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time Stacy heard the command, she felt it even strong inside her brain.  I should take off my pants, she thought.  I need to prove I'm not faking to Amanda.  Although she didn't like the idea, it seemed logical to her.  She quickly undid the buttons and slipped out of her jeans.  Amanda held out her hand, and Stacy handed them over.  She put her hands down to cover up her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Panties too.  Take them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was intensely embarrassed.  Now Amanda wanted her to take off her panties too?  But then Stacy's mind caught the command, and suddenly Stacy thought she needed to take off her panties.  She quickly pulled her white cotton panties down to her ankles, then stepped one foot, then the other, out of them.  She picked them up and handed them to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Amanda received the panties, she pushed Stacy to the ground.  As Stacy got up, Amanda ran back inside and closed the door, locking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I need to pee!  What are you doing?!\" Stacy said, trying not to be too loud to get any neighbor's attention.  Right now she was thanking her parents for building the 8 foot privacy wall around their back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm helping you.  There's plenty of trees out there, just go by one and then you can come back in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Stacy do?</span></div></div>",

She had no choice.  She quickly walked over to a tree as far away from the house as possible.  Blushing deeply, she crept around the back of the tree, away from the door.  She might not have much privacy, but it was the least she could do to be mostly out of view of Amanda.  There she squatted down.  The act of squatting was enough to break her hold on her bladder, and she immediately began peeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy had never felt more embarrassed in her entire life.  She thought eating dog food had been her worst moment, but this was worse.  Here she was, an eighteen year old girl, and she was peeing on a tree in her yard.  She was a cheerleader, for pete's sake!  She was supposed to be the top of the social strata, desired by everyone.  But if anyone had seen her now, all they would see is a blushing girl with just a shirt on peeing in the back yard.  She tried to fight back the tears, but it was too traumatic, and she started crying.  She also realized just how much she had to go when she kept peeing.  It took her only about forty five seconds total, but it seemed like hours.  She felt as though the whole world could see her shame.  Finally, she was finished.  But now she realized she had no toilet paper.  She took two steps forward and squatted all the way down, patting her crotch dry on the grass.  Then she stood up.  She stopped crying.  She wouldn't give Amanda the satisfaction.  She walked back to the screen door, naked from the waste down.  So much for her dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood just inside the glass with a warm smile on her face.  Stacy was learning to hate it when that woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now, that wasn't so bad.  I bet you feel better now don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy just glared evil daggers at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to let me back in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, as soon as you do one more thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  Let me in now!\" Stacy practically yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's no way to treat the one on this side of the door\" Amanda said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  What more do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you in if you bark like a dog for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  Are you crazy!?  No way I'm doing that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then you can stay out there.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy tried pulling on the door, but it was no good, it was locked tight.  Amanda walked over and pulled up a chair and sat by the door.  Stacy refused to give in, but Amanda obviously wasn't budging either.  She got out a book and started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let me in!\" Stacy whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what you have to do\" was all Amanda would say, then she proceeded to ignore Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy fumed and huffed.  She wouldn't break!  She walked over and sat down in the grass.  She was bored and embarrassed, but she wasn't going to bark!  After about fifteen minutes, Stacy heard a familiar sound of a car driving up the driveway next door.  Oh no!  The neighbors were home.  Although there was the privacy fence, it was just wooden fence posts.  There were small spaces between each post, so if you got right next to the fence, you could see through.  There wasn't any reason for the neighbors to do so, but Stacy was so embarrassed she was worried they would anyway.  She got up and ran do the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!  Please!\" she pleaded.  Amanda just looked at her over her book, but made no move to unlock the door.  Stacy was crestfallen.  Again, she had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof woof\" she said quietly.  So quiet it was barely more than a stage whisper.  She darted her eyes to the side, hoping the neighbors hadn't opened their car yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof woof.\" Stacy said, this time at a normal volume.  Her fear increased as she heard the car doors open and close.  Her neighbors were out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't hear you...\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOF WOOF!\" Stacy yelled.  Her face went beet red.  Amanda reached up and unlocked the door, and Stacy flung herself through it the second it opened.  She slammed the door just as the neighbors came to peek through the fence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know the Reynolds had a dog, did you sweetie?\" Bob Moore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't either.  How nice for them\" replied Nadine Moore.  The two shook their heads and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You're finished you horrible woman!  Grrrrrrrrrr!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was so mad, she could barely speak.  She didn't notice that her tirade had devolved into an animal-like growl.  Amanda was a little worried, after all, Stacy looked like she was about to explode, but she couldn't help but laugh as the teenager gave into her animal instincts.  She just had to get one last barb in at Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're not all bark and no bite?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRRRRRRRRR!\" Stacy growled as she rushed at Amanda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was so angry she didn't even know what she was going to do, her instincts just told her to attack.  She wasn't thinking at all.  Amanda saw the girl coming and waved a hand and said a word in a language Stacy didn't recognize.  Stacy was only about a step away from Amanda, but suddenly she froze in mid-stride.  The cloudiness in her mind from earlier came back with a vengeance.  She stood before Amanda, trying to will her mind into gear.  What had she been doing?  She was sure there was something she was about to do or say.  But for some reason, Stacy could not for the life of her think of what it was.  Every time she tried, it was like her mind stopped working, and the harder she tried, the more her mind felt lost and stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, what was I saying?\" Stacy asked, trying to cover her inability to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were just about to thank me for helping you with your bathroom issue.\" Amanda replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that right?  Stacy tried to remember, but it's like her brain was responding to different signals.  She remembered having to pee, but now she felt better, so she must have gone.  Why did she have a problem?  What was it?  Stacy's brain would only give her fragments of what had happened.  She remembered having to pee, but leaving the bathroom.  Oh god!  Then she remembered she had peed on a tree outside!  And she had barked at the door to get back in!  What was wrong with her?!  Stacy's foggy brain did not remember Amanda tricking her out there, or forcing her to do any of that, all she could remember was actually doing it, and the missing details were filled in with the assumption that she had done that on her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, errr, thanks...\" Stacy said, quickly ending the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so embarrassed that Amanda had seen her pee outside, she just wanted to get away.  She turned and walked toward the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting something?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stopped.  What was she forgetting?  She couldn't think of anything.  She turned and looked at Amanda, and her eyes widened in shock!  Amanda was holding her jeans and panties!  Stacy looked down at her waist.  She was naked from the waist down!  And worst of all, she had been so distracted, she didn't even notice!  Her most private area was exposed for all to see!  Now that she was aware, she couldn't help but feel a cool breeze blowing across her lower regions.  Stacy bowed her head in shame and walked back to Amanda.  She couldn't look her in the eyes as she took her pants back.  She turned to run to her room, but heard Amanda speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, put your panties and pants on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Stacy's mind was cloudy.  Had Amanda said something?  All Stacy wanted to do was run to her room, but now she thought 'I should put my pants back on.'  She slowly stepped into her panties and pulled them up, then stepped into her jeans.  Why hadn't she run to her bedroom to do that?  For some reason, her brain had told her it was more important to put them on then to run away, even though that was her strongest desire at the moment.  Now that she was done, she was ready to go hide in her room the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy is about to rush off, but Amanda has another idea.  Who wins?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Watch tv with me\" Amanda said to Stacy before she could leave the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stopped walking with a glazed look on her face.  Suddenly her thoughts of hiding in shame in her room were pushed to the back of her mind.  Instead she felt the desire to watch tv with her babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that sounds like fun\" said Stacy, turning and heading for the living room.  Amanda led the way and took a seat on the couch.  Before Stacy could sit down next to her, Amanda said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy immediately felt an intense desire to sit down.  Even though she was right in front of the couch, instead of sitting on it, she lowered herself to the carpet and sat indian style.  After a second, Stacy realized she was sitting on the carpet instead of the couch.  She looked up at Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come sit next to you?\" she asked.  Stacy felt a little funny asking for something she would normally just do, but for some reason she felt she needed Amanda's permission.  Amanda stretched her feet out and took up the whole couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I need to stretch out.  You're good where you are.  You don't need to be up on the furniture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy considered this.  She did feel fine where she was.  Sure, there was only one person on the couch, and there were plenty of open chairs, but Stacy didn't need to be up on the furniture.  This seat was fine.  She settled with her back to the couch where Amanda was sitting and looked at the tv.  Amanda turned on the tv, and eventually they settled in to watching a movie.  After a while, Stacy started fidgeting.  Her head was itching, but no matter what she did, it wouldn't stop.  Amanda noticed, and kept quiet for a while, but finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Stacy?  You seem like something's bothering you?\" Amanda asked.  Had Stacy looked behind, she would have seen a gleam in Amanda's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  My head keeps itching, but I can't get it to stop.  It's really distracting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to try?  Maybe I can help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was a bit embarrassed to have Amanda touching her head, but the itching was so annoying that she reluctantly agreed.  Amanda reached out and began scratching Stacy's head like she would a pet.  As soon as Stacy felt Amanda's fingers going to work, the itching stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, that's much better\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled and nodded.  However, she didn't stop scratching Stacy's head.  Stacy was a little uncomfortable with this, but only for a few seconds.  Then Amanda's scratching started to feel like one of the best sensations Stacy had ever felt.  She knew it was weird for her babysitter to be scratching her head like this, but it felt so good that Stacy couldn't bring herself to tell Amanda to stop.  This kept up the whole rest of the movie.  Stacy could barely pay attention, she was lost in the good feelings she was experiencing.  She was so lost, Stacy was unaware that she had opened her mouth and barely stuck her tongue out, and was quietly panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the movie, Amanda stopped.  Stacy woke up from her blissful fog, realizing she had missed most of the movie.  She was about to ask Amanda what they should watch next, since it was only nine o'clock, but Amanda spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you need to go to bed. It's your bedtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy involuntarily yawned.  She suddenly felt very tired.  She looked at the clock and saw it was already 9:00.  Wow, it's already my bedtime, she thought.  I better get to bed.  She stood up, yawning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Amanda, I'm going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Stacy\" Amanda said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy walked upstairs to her room, changed into her pajamas, and crawled into bed.  That night, she had the strangest dream.  In her dream, she was somehow watching herself like she was in a movie.  But the Stacy in her dream was acting funny.  It was like she thought she was a dog.  Stacy watched as dream-Stacy went to cheerleading practice and started sniffing all the other girls' butts.  On the way home, she chased a squirrel into a tree.  When she got home, the first thing she did was drink out of a toilet.  As the dream ended, Stacy dreamed that dream-Stacy turned and looked at her, as though she could see her, and started barking at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy awoke in a sweat.  She couldn't remember what she had been dreaming, but for some reason she heard dog barking ringing in her ears.  That only brought up the painfully embarrassing memory of how she herself had barked at the door yesterday.  Stacy pushed that from her mind.  Today was a new day, whatever strangeness happened yesterday was done.  She got out of bed and headed for the shower.</span></div></div>",

She put on her underwear and then her cheerleading uniform, then tied her shoulder length blonde hair back in a ponytail, grabbed her backpack, and walked downstairs.  Amanda was in the kitchen when she got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Stacy.  All ready for school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about, I'm just going to grab some juice and a pop tart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Have fun at school, but your mom said you're supposed to come home right after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, I have cheer practice today.  I'll be home after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded and handed Stacy a travel mug of orange juice.  Stacy rolled her eyes behind Amanda's back.  Just because she had a babysitter didn't mean she had to be treated like a baby.  She grabbed her pop tart and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was going normal for Stacy.  She saw her friends, caught a few boys checking her out in her cheerleading outfit, everything was good.  Then fourth period happened.  About half way through, Stacy felt the need to go to the bathroom.  She asked for the hall pass and walked to the girl's bathroom.  Once inside, it was like her brain had been replaced with cotton candy.  Every thought took a monumental effort.  She walked to the toilet, but like the other day, as soon as she looked at it, all she could think of was how thirsty she was.  She went to the sink and filled her hands with water, drinking a few handfuls that way.  Even though her thinking was muddled, she knew she didn't have much time in here before she got in trouble.  And she knew she had to pee.  But when she thought about peeing, all she could think about was peeing on a tree in her yard yesterday.  If she tried to think about peeing in a toilet, her mind just spaced out and she completely lost her train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy realized she didn't have time to fight her wonky brain.  She had to pee, and she had to do it fast.  She peeked her head outside the bathroom.  Good, she thought, the halls are empty.  She quickly walked down to the end of the hall.  To her left, there was a door to the dumpsters out back behind the school.  It was supposed to be locked, but she knew the janitors left it open so kids could sneak out and smoke.  Stacy shook her head sadly.  I'll bet they never thought of kids sneaking out for the reason I am, she thought to herself.  She opened the door, hoping against hope no one was out there smoking now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas anyone out there?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stacy breathed a huge sigh of relief.  She was the only out there.  She couldn't even imagine what would have happened if there had been a smoker or anyone else out there to see her.  Even though she was relieved, as her mind processed what she intended to do, she became incredibly embarrassed.  But Stacy could think of no other way.  She had to relieve herself now, and for some reason, whenever she tried to use a bathroom, she just got stupid.  In the back of her mind, a nagging voice was starting to say 'Maybe that's because bathrooms aren't for you,' but it was very quiet for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a deep red, Stacy crept from the door to the grass behind the farthest dumpster.  She took one more look around to make sure she was alone.  Once she was convinced, she reached under her cheerleading skirt and pulled her panties off.  Then she held her legs apart and squatted over the grass and let her muscles go.  Almost immediately, she began peeing.  Stacy was battling conflicting feelings.  She felt deeply ashamed that here she was, peeing in the grass behind the school, but at the same time, she couldn't deny the relief she felt at taking care of her business.  She had never noticed feeling relief at peeing before, it had just been something she did.  But now it actually felt good to pee.  After she was done, she quickly waddled away from where she had been.  Again, she hadn't thought to bring toilet paper, so she squatted in some dry grass and padded herself off, then put her underwear back on.  As she was standing up, she couldn't help but look at what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the grass next to the dumpster was a decent sized yellow puddle.  Some of it had already been soaked into the ground, but she had peed enough that there was no chance all of that would happen for a while.  Although she was embarrassed by what she had done, there was a small part of her that felt differently.  Her gaze lingered a second longer.  Was that pride she felt?  Ugh, what do I have to be proud of?  I just peed in the grass like an animal.  Yeah, the small part of her brain thought, but boy oh boy did I mark that territory.  Anybody who goes out there to smoke will know that Stacy has been here!  A small trace of a grin formed on Stacy's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.  What was wrong with her.  This was nothing to be proud of.  She quickly walked back to the door and crept inside.  No one was around.  It looks like Stacy was in the clear.  She returned to class and handed back the hall pass.  The teacher eyed her questioningly, although probably only because she had taken a bit long.  Stacy just blushed and went back to her seat.  If only the teacher knew the half of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of school went fine.  Stacy studiously did not think about her bathroom adventure.  After school, she got with her friends and went to cheer practice.  There was a rough moment early on.  Stacy and the other girls started stretching.  Stacy looked at her friend Nikki, who was bending over to stretch.  Her mind flashed back to her dream.  Her mind showed her a glimpse of her walking over and sticking her face into Nikki's exposed butt and taking a big sniff.  Stacy practically gagged.  She shook her head to get rid of the thought.  Nikki looked over at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there Stacy?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... uhhhh... fine... everything's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki mouthed 'whatever' and went back to stretching.  Stacy made sure not to look at any one in particular and just focus on her stretching.  The rest of practice went by without any issues.  The girls practiced a lot of new routines, and worked up quite a sweat.  When they were done, everyone noticed there was a slightly different odor in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I shouldn't have to remind you, you need to wash your uniforms after every practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy rolled her eyes.  Of course, everyone knew that.  She grabbed her bag, said goodbye to Nikki, and got in her car.  When she got back, she opened the front door and went inside.  She saw Amanda sitting on the couch as she went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Stacy.  You're just in time.  Dinner's in 15 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm just going to take a quick show and I'll be down\" Stacy said.  She headed upstairs for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled to herself.  It wasn't too noticeable yet, unless you were paying attention.  But if you were, you might have wondered why the sweaty teenage girl who just walked by had the unmistakable odor of dog wafting off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacy stepped into her show, she noticed something was different.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stacy climbed in the shower and turned on a nice hot spray.  She was worn out from cheerleading, and the warm water felt great.  After standing under the water relaxing for a few minutes, she reached for her shampoo.  Normally she didn't even look at it, but for some reason the bottle felt weird.  She opened her eyes and noticed it was a different bottle than she usually had.  Instead of the green herbal essences bottle, she had some strange purple bottle.  And whenever she tried to read the label, her mind fogged up and she got distracted.  God, what was wrong with her these days?  Stacy just shrugged and poured a liberal dollop of the shampoo into her hands, then proceeded to lather down her hair.  Had Stacy actually read the bottle, she might not have been so quick to touch it to her hair.  The purple bottle had a bone shaped lid, and said 'Pet Head 2-in-1 Dog Shampoo and Conditioner.'  Her body wash had also been replaced with a bargain pet soap, but this also escaped Stacy's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy did notice her shampoo smelled different, but with her cloudy mind she just figured she had bought a new bottle and not noticed it was different.  After rinsing her hair, she proceeded to wash herself with the pet soap, again noticing a different smell, but being unable to do anything more than notice it.  She took an extra minute or two to relax in the water, then rinsed off, turned off the water, and dried off.  She dressed in a normal pair of panties and a bra, then put on a pink tshirt, a pair of jeans, and headed downstairs for dinner.  Stacy didn't notice, but the dog shampoo had left her hair a little frizzier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy walked into the kitchen to see Amanda pouring a glass of water from the fridge.  On the table was a plate of spaghetti and salad.  Stacy walked toward the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh, that's my dinner\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's mine?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda pointed to the floor.  To Stacy's dismay, on the floor was the same bowl with her name on it.  And the bowl was once again filled with wet dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... not again...\" Stacy muttered.  She could feel her mind clouding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what Stacy.  I'll let you pick what you want to eat tonight.  Eat whichever seems the best to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda watched Stacy thoughtfully.  She wondered how this would turn out.  She could see the teen was confused, but also trying to work something out in her head.  Stacy, meanwhile, felt conflicted.  For some reason, she could tell this decision was very important.  She really wanted to eat the spaghetti and salad.  But every time she looked at it, it just did not look appealing.  She reluctantly looked over at the dog food.  For some reason, it looked good.  And the smell!  The smell was heavenly.  Stacy was so lost in her senses, she didn't realize that she was staring at the dog food intently with her mouth hanging open.  She even started to drool!  Stacy turned back to the spaghetti and tried to force herself to sit down in front of it, but her body wouldn't listen.  Instead she felt her stomach growl.  Without conscious effort, Stacy's needs took over, and she found herself kneeling down in front of the dog food.  Her mind tried to rally one last time, pointing out that she wasn't a dog and shouldn't be eating what dogs eat, but her stomach rebelled with another hunger pang.  She heard a quiet splattering of liquid on the floor, and to her amazement realized she had been drooling so much it was running down her chin and onto the floor.  Her shock at that realization lowered her mental defenses, and her body took over, plunging her mouth into the waiting bowl of dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled and sat down at the table.  She enjoyed her dinner while watching Stacy go to town on her bowl of dog food.  She was pleased to see how far Stacy's animal instincts were progressing.  She chuckled as she saw just how messy Stacy was eating, this time the teen got even more of the food on her face and chin, and it mixed in with her own drool.  To further confuse Stacy's mind, Amanda held a conversation with her, asking her how her day went, things like that.  Stacy responded like she would to any dinner chit-chat, the difference being that in between talking she was taking large face-first bites of dog food.  Stacy's cloudy mind knew she should be embarrassed of eating dog food like this, but she also felt like it was normal to talk and eat, so she did.  Once finished, Stacy wanted to run away in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, clean up the dishes.\" Amanda commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her desire to go away, Stacy found herself complying.  She took Amanda's plates and her bowl to the sink and washed them.  All the while she was doing this, her face was smeared with dog food.  It was on her chin, her cheeks, her lips, even the tip of her nose.  A bit of her blonde hair had fallen in the way while she was eating, so there was even a bit of food stuck in her hair.  After cleaning, she went to the bathroom to wash away her shame, but she didn't notice Amanda follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked at herself in the mirror despondently.  Her face was a mess.  She wanted to wash it off and drink about five bottle of mouthwash to get the taste of dog food out of her mouth.  But before she could do so, Amanda popped her head in and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, come downstairs, it's tv time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy immediately felt the overpowering desire to go downstairs and watch tv.  She turned and left the bathroom, face and hair still messy with dog food.  Again, Amanda made Stacy sit on the floor in front of her, and she began scratching her head again.  Stacy zoned out again, panting at the pleasant feelings.  Although they were slightly less pleasant this time with the pungent taste of dog food festering in her mouth.  After an hour, she felt a rumbling in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhhhh...\" Stacy moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong girl?\" asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we can take a pee break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have to <i>go</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.  Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood up and held out her hand.  Stacy felt compelled to take it.  She stood up and reached for Amanda with her right hand.  Amanda led Stacy through the living room toward the sliding glass door to the back yard.  Stacy realized where they were heading and wanted to run away, but her brain refused to listen.  Instead, it forced her to follow where Amanda was taking her.  Amanda walked over and opened the door.  It was dark out, so it was unlikely there would be any neighbors outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pants.  Hand them over.  Underwear too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy bowed her head to avoid meeting Amanda's eyes as she reluctantly stripped her pants and panties and handed them to her babysitter.  She knew this was bizarre and wrong for a teenage girl to be giving her pants to her adult babysitter, but she couldn't stop herself.  Amanda pointed out to the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go out there and do your business.  Bark when you're ready to be let back in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy dejectedly went outside.  She knew what was coming, and although it was awful, she had begun to realize that whatever was going on, she couldn't fight it.  Stacy walked out behind a tree (not the same one as before, she wasn't ready for that yet) and squatted down.  This time it didn't just come, she had to actually work her muscles, but finally she managed to poop on the grass.  She realized she also needed to pee, so she went ahead and did that.  After she was done, she cursed herself for not thinking of toilet paper.  She patter herself off, but knew she wasn't clean.  At this point, as much as she didn't want to admit it, Stacy was beginning to associate doing her business with being outside.  When she thought of peeing, she thought of the sights and smells of grass and the outdoors, not the image of toilets or bathrooms.  She didn't realize it, but her mind was already losing her memories of sitting on a toilet.  Squatting was what her mind remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy walked back to the door, but was worried when Amanda wasn't there.  Maybe she was just waiting for her final humiliation.  Stacy knew being quiet wouldn't do her any good, so why bother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof woof!\" Stacy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Amanda walked back into the living room and opened the door.  She had a roll of toilet paper in her hand.  She took a step outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand still and bend over\" she told Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy did as Amanda said.  Then she endured a new humiliation as Amanda wiped her bottom clean with toilet paper, which she then put in a trash bag.  Stacy was still bent over as Amanda walked over to the tree and used some paper to pick up Stacy's mess and put it in the bag, then tie it off and put it in the garbage.  Finally Amanda walked back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come in now girl\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Stacy walked in the door, the phone rang.  She looked at it and saw it was her friend Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nikki, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy started talking to her friend.  When Stacy talked on the phone, she liked to walk around at the same time.  So naturally, Stacy started pacing throughout the house while talking to Nikki.  Amanda laughed to herself.  What Stacy had failed to notice was that she hadn't put her pants back on.  Her brain was losing the ability to focus on human things, just as Amanda has hoped.  Meanwhile, Stacy chatted with her friend, completely oblivious to the fact she was naked from the waist down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour on the phone, Stacy and Nikki finished talking.  She was just starting to realize something was odd when Amanda walked into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bedtime girl\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked at the clock.  That's weird, she thought.  For some reason, the numbers were all blurry.  She figured the clock was broken.  In reality, it was working fine, displaying 9:10 for everyone to read.  It was Stacy who was the problem, she didn't know it but she was beginning to lose her ability to read.  Even though Stacy would never go to bed at 9 on a Friday night, she found herself agreeing with Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy walked into her bathroom and was distraught with her reflection in the mirror.  Her face was smeared with dog food, some was even caught in her hair.  And worst of all, she finally realized she wasn't wearing any pants!  She tried to become angry about it, but her mind was fuzzy.  It was so fuzzy that when Amanda came in with a wet washcloth, Stacy just let her wipe her face for her without any resistance.  Amanda handed Stacy her pj's and left the bathroom.  Stacy changed, grateful to be fully clothed again.  But to her dismay her pj's seemed itchier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put that from her mind when she realized how thirsty she was.  Gosh, all that talking had left her parched.  She thought about how great some nice cold water would feel.  Her mind was so fuzzy that while she was thinking how good water sounded, she didn't even notice her body moving on its own.  Her body walked over and knelt down in front of the toilet.  Stacy came to in time to experience herself diving headfirst into the toilet bowl.  She was confused, but her thirst took over, and Stacy began drinking.  It was difficult, but with a little experimentation Stacy found herself able to take on water pretty well.  Once she had drank her fill, she stood up and gasped.  What had she done!  She just drank from the toilet!  Gross!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy buried her face in her towel.  Her face had gotten soaked from trying to drink out of the toilet, and she wanted to wipe away any evidence of that shameful deed.  But for some reason, even though she knew it was wrong, she found it hard to concentrate on what she had just done.  Her mind was so cloudy that thinking was just too much effort for the poor girl.  After drying off, she decided to brush her teeth and get to bed to end the humiliation of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Stacy looked around, she couldn't find her toothbrush or toothpaste.  Had Amanda taken it?  She walked down to the kitchen, where Amanda was putting something in a cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, did you do something to my toothbrush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.  You must have lost it.  You're always losing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\" Stacy asked confused.  She didn't think she lost a lot of things, but it was so hard to remember.  Maybe Amanda was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  Here, this is better for your teeth.  Eat this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda handed Stacy a cookie.  It was brown and bone shaped.  Stacy couldn't tell, but printed on it was the world 'Milkbone.'  Stacy knew eating cookies wasn't a great substitute for brushing her teeth, but she felt compelled to do what Amanda said.  So she popped it in her mouth and chewed it up.  It tasted strange, but not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, off to bed with you.  You're so tired you can barely make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy yawned.  She was exhausted.  She walked up to her bedroom and just fell onto her bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Stacy awoke early on.  Usually on the weekends, Stacy would sleep often till almost noon, but for some reason she felt wide awake by 7.  A good night's sleep had done wonders for her mood.  She pulled back the covers and sat up in bed.  She felt like today she could get her life back on track.  Stacy reached down and scratched her legs.  Her pj's consisted of a sleeveless top and shorts, but for some reason her legs itched as though they were covered in scratchy fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fingers reached her legs, she gasped.  Her legs felt different.  She was afraid to look, but couldn't help herself.  She glanced down and was horrified to see her legs were covered in a coating of light blonde hair!  It looked as though Stacy hadn't shaved her legs in six months!  How could this have happened?  The hair seemed to be covering her whole legs, both upper and lower.  She had never had this much hair on her upper legs in her life.  But that wasn't the only thing she noticed.  Her toenails had grown and become much more sharp over the night.  Her fingernails as well.  They almost resembled claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy started freaking out, but she also felt the familiar cloudiness coming over her mind.  She struggled to get out of bed and get to the bathroom to shave and cut her nails.  But as she opened her bedroom door, Amanda was standing outside smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Stacy!\" she said cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... morning.... need to go to the bathroom... \" Stacy mumbled, trying to get by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to pee?  The lets go outside girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took Stacy by the hand and led her downstairs.  Inside, Stacy tried to resist, but she couldn't.  Amanda led her downstairs and out to the yard, then pointed to a tree and told her to go pee.  Stacy walked over to the tree, pulled her shorts and panties off, and squatted down and relieved herself.  At this point, Stacy didn't even feel the situation was all that strange.  She had to pee, there was an open tree over there, why not take care of herself?  Once she was done, she walked back to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to take a shower\" Stacy said.  She started to walk to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for that Stacy.  It's time for your exercise.\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stopped and thought.  Exercise?  What exercise?  She often went for a jog on weekdays, but Stacy wasn't a huge exercise girl.  But now she felt like maybe she should be.  Stacy looked at Amanda and realized she had been holding some clothes, which she handed to Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, put these on.  Then go to the living room and start exercising.  I want you to do 100 pushups, 100 situps, and jog in place for 30 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy nodded and took the clothes.  They were a pair of running pants and a sports bra.  Stacy had already taken off her shorts, so she pulled off her top and put on the sports bra, then put her panties back on, followed by the running pants.  Although she still really wanted to shave, she was at least happy to have something covering her legs.  Had Amanda not even noticed her hair?  Why hadn't she said anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts were on her mind as she began her instructed routine.  Stacy mainly just jogged and did whatever exercises they did at cheerleading, so doing pushups and situps on her own was not normal.  As she did, she found this was quite a workout.  She started working up quite a sweat as she did what Amanda told her.  By the time she had finished the pushups and situps, she was breathing very heavy and covered in a sheen of sweat.  While doing her jogging, she didn't realize, but she was panting the entire time with her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, she was exhausted.  She was covered in sweat, her hair sticky with it.  To her great shame, she stank something awful.  And not just the normal smell of a sweaty person.  No, she definitely stank like a dog would.  She couldn't understand why, but anytime she tried to think on it, her mind just fogged over.  She was pulled by her thoughts by the sound of the can opener.  She walked over to the kitchen in time to see Amanda empty a can of dog food into a bowl.  Stacy's stomach growled as soon as she saw it.  Amanda placed the bowl on the floor and Stacy dove in, scarfing down the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing up, Stacy realized just how awful she must look.  She was still sweaty and stank of dog, and she was sure her face was smeared with food.  The taste of it was all over her mouth.  Amanda wiped her face off with a washcloth, then, before Stacy could go upstairs to shower, told her it was time they go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would Amanda take Stacy?</span></div></div>",

Her plan was going right on schedule. \"Uh, your welcome Amanda, you would have done the same...\" While Stacy's happiness was growing inside, her concussion emotion was growing as well. \"So do you wanna watch some more television with me, or do you wanna go to bed? It is getting very late.\" As Stacy thought about it, some of the old feelings and thoughts from an hour or so ago were coming back... She was still a mess and she needed to cleanse he mouth! <i>The incident!!</i> \"Ugh, sorry, but I really need to clean myself up..\" \"Well ok then, but I will come to check on you later, so if you need anything, just Yip!\" Stacy was up the stairs and replied with, \"Alrig-\" Even though she was still heading upstairs to take a shower, she still couldn't understand why Amanda just said Yip instead of yell... Soon after another awkward shower time, Stacy thought that she didn't need a towel and shook herself dry.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing in her shower, Stacy noticed the hair around her groin was much thicker than usual, almost like fur, and it was a golden hue. \"Do I need to start shav... Wha?!\" At the same time, as she ran her hand down to examine the fur, her hand hit a bump. Feeling around, she found five more bumps like this one, and they felt like... \"Nipples?!\" Stacy stumbled from the shock, bumping her rear, and something else, into the shower wall. Stacy looked back and saw a three foot long dog tail covered in the same golden fur as her groin. Seeing the tail seemed to break whatever power that happened to be blocking Stacy's memory and altering her mind, because a very human sense of panic and rage filled Stacy as the gaps where her mind went foggy were filled back in and she was allowed to think on them with her full human cognitive functions. \"I wanted so bad to attack Amanda after... she tricked me into peeing outside!! Then my mind went blank!! Now that I think of it...\" She thought about how she got thirsty looking at the toilet, wanted to pee on trees, and how she mistook dog food for meatloaf. She thought back on the first things Amanda said, including the weird words she didn't quite get before. Amongst those words Stacy heard her name uttered. That was when she put two and two together. \"Man I love my ability to recall things!! The bitch cast a spell on me!!\" Stacy stood defiantly in the shower, tail wagging away. \"Okay, definitely different.\" She utters about her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she realized just when she grew the tail. She had felt a mild discomfort on the base of her spine during practice, but whenever she thought on it, her brain went on auto-pilot like it did with the toilet. Then, during the last routine they practice they did, she did a split, and during it a quiet split only she heard came from under her uniform's skirt, followed by a relief in the spinal pain. She apparently never noticed it before because she was so tired after practice she just wore her uniform home, and the skirt cleverly hid it from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stepped out of the shower, thinking of the words Amanda said. Quietly, she recited them back to herself, certain to not utter her name, just in case saying it with her name could make this worse. \"Morofs Nart ______, Morphos al Canis Familiaris.\" She scratched her head, then said, \"The first part sounds like 'transform' backwards, then the name of the target, followed by a word that sounds like 'morph,' then 'canis familiaris,' which I think means dog. See, Mr. Harmon, I wasn't ALWAYS asleep in biology class...\" Stacy felt a need to pee, and that's when she decided to enact a scheme for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to pee!!\" Amanda hears the now common cries, and Amanda nabs a collar and leash, ready to further her scheme. \"Maybe I can get her to go on a walk...\" She walks upstairs to see Stacy, on the toilet, taking a whizz like a person. \"Wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amanda could continue, Stacy shouted out with gusto, \"<b>MOROFS NART AMANDA SADLER, MORPHOS AL CANIS FAMILIARIS!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda says, \"...\"</span></div></div>",

Seeing my tail helped too.\" Stacy declared. \"Now, enough delays. Out with the spell and my cure before you can only bark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda, dreading the idea of being bested by this girl and having such a simple plan backfire, told her a spell. \"Magus Suspendum _______. Put your name there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy said, \"Alright, Magus Suspendum Stacy Jensen.\" A gold glow surrounds her, and strangely she feels no different. \"Alright, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sweated for a moment, but once she saw her hands were now useless paws, doggy ears &amp; tail all her own wagging behind her, fur covering her paws, forearms, lower legs, &amp; shoulders, and the extra nipples of her chest had swollen up to C-cups like her human breasts, she said, \"Magus Suspendum Amanda Sadler!!\" She pants a moment as the same glow overtakes her. She then says nervously, \"I don't know the counter-spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy screams, \"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda tries to calm her down, saying, \"Don't worry, though. That spell we just used suspends in progress any spells cast on you for two days. That should be enough time for me to contact someone to get a counter-spell, or info on how to make one. Until then, we're stuck in these part dog forms... Of course, you somehow bested the dog instincts I tried to implant in you, but I'm gonna succumb to them over the next 48 hours, and I have to be able to focus in order to work...\" Suddenly, a fullness comes over Amanda's bladder. \"Man, I gotta pee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy got up and wiped, flushing the toilet. However, Amanda stood there, staring at Stacy, whining. Stacy thinks, \"Oh great, now she's like I was this time yesterday. The toilet's right there, but she can't figure out what it's for... Man we could be in trouble if she's like this the whole 48 hours that spell bought us...\" She saw the leash and collar Amanda had brought up to use on Stacy, and Stacy then thought, \"...although, if I am to be boned, I may try to enjoy it...\" Stacy deliberates as to what she should do...</span></div></div>",

No, Stacy thought frantically, her nose itself was turning black! Cracks and jolts rocked her face as her mouth pushed outward into a dog\u2019s muzzle, quickly becoming covered in soft golden fur. Her teeth sharpened, into fangs, as her tongue lengthened further and further out with her muzzle. The human hair she had began to fall out, falling gradually to the floor, to be replaced by the same fur that was invading the rest of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Stacy tried to speak, only to realize her vocal chords were changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ngghhh, Grrrrfff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy moved a hand -a paw - up? They weren\u2019t hands, Stacy thought desperately. Not anymore. Her hands, paws, had changed, her fingers shortened and her thumbs now a long way up her wrist, with short black claws protruding out. Leathery pads had developed on her palms. My-help me! She tried to call out, but could only make a high-pitched whine. Stacy slashed her right paw down her shirt, ripping the buttons apart, tearing the garment off her body. She was horrified to find thick golden fur covering almost all of her chest and back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressure built up at the base of her spine, an uncomfortable pulling sensation. No, not that, she thought urgently, not a tail! She fell to the floor, crawling hysterically out of her jeans as the pressure of her changing hips and legs became too much to bear, using her newly formed forepaws to drag herself along. She watched, panting, as her new tail grew at an astonishing rate, snaking out until it lay on her backside. God, she could feel the thing sitting there. Embarrassment flushed her mind as the fur grew across her hips.  Bone cracked across her legs as they became thinner, differently jointed, suited to the rest of her body. Her feet cricked and Stacy was pushed up on to her toes, on to all fours like the animal she knew she was becoming. Leathery pads invaded the bottom of her altering feet, while fur grew on the few patches of skin that still remained bare. Stacy tried to stand, strained to get up, but clumsily fell back on to her four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plethora of new smells started to invade her canine nose. The sounds outside became crisper, clearer, the birds around her parent\u2019s home now seeming much closer than they ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the changes stopped. Stacy looked over her golden-furred body, at her tail, her four paws, at her black nose, which was always in her vision. A golden retriever. That was what she was. Not human anymore, not physically at least.</span></div></div>",

She bet if her parents trusted her then she would have been allowed to walk around without a collar and lead. Okay maybe still a collar as she now foound it hard to picture herself without one.

Stacy didn't notice the change, as she was too busy enjoying the sensation of Amanda scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Stacy\", said Amanda, handing Stacy the phone. \"I know I'm not your first choice of company. Why don't call a couple of your friends over - tell them to come by after supper, in about an hour or so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, thanks, Amanda\", said Stacy, thinking that maybe Amanda wasn't such a bad sort after all.  She called her two friends, Jessica and Ana, and asked them to come by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica's going to come by in about an hour\", she said. \"But Ana won't be able to get here for two hours. Is that OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, that will be perfect\", said Amanda. \"And now, let's think about getting you your supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda went out to the kitchen. Stacy shook her head. She'd been enjoying having Amanda scratch her. Idly, she strolled over to the mirror that hung in the hall, and then gasped as she saw her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ears!\" she shrieked. \"Wuh's happened to my ears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that dear?\" said Amanda. \"I couldn't quite make it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muh earthe!\" Said Stacy. She was finding it hard to speak. To her horror, her tongue began to loll out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muh tung!\" she said. \"Wuh's happnin tuh muh tung?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, dear\" said Amanda. \"Come and get your dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy found herself compelled to walk out to the kitchen. She saw Amanda setting a bowl of what looked like dog food on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh's dat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dinner, dear. Eat up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yoo crathy? Um naw eatin dat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, dear. Doesn't it smell good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Stacy's horror, it did smell good! Helplessly, she fell to her hands and knees in front of the dish.  With all her strength, she willed herself not to eat the food, but her treacherous tongue began shoveling the stuff into her mouth. It tasted so good! As she ate, she felt her mouth move forward, as though eager to get closer to the food. She quickly devoured it all, licking the bowl clean.  She put a hand to her face and yelped as she realized that she now had a dog's muzzle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to speak, but no matter how she tried, only canine sounds emerged. Amanda called her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, Stacy.\"  Stacy found her legs carrying her over to where the older woman stood. Why was she obeying her so helplessly? Why wouldn't her body do what she wanted it to do? She looked at Amanda inquiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear\", Amanda said. \"I'm afraid it is me doing this to you.  I don't supose it's much comfort to you, but I'm not doing it to you for fun, or even because I want to. Now take off your clothes. There's no point it them getting them ruined while you change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy felt her arms move as if of their own accord, removing her clothing. Soon she stood naked before the other woman. Stacy noticed that things seemed to look - different somehow.  She went and looked in the mirror - her head had completely changed into that of a German Shepherd! She barked fearfully at that image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, girl!\" said Amanda. \"Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Stacy found herself obeying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit, girl! I don't want you falling and hurting yourself when your legs change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy sat on her haunches like a dog. She felt a weird pushing at the base of her spine. She looked back - she'd grown a tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a magnficent tail!\" said Amanda.  \"Oh, Stacy, what a beautiful dog you're going to be!\" Stacy's tail wagged, as though of its own volition.  Her legs began to feel funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roll over on your side, dear, it will be more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy did as she was told and watched in shock as her feet shrank into paws, and her legs and pelvis began to re-orient themselves into canine contours. When this was complete, fur grew, covering her body from the waist down.  She sat up again. Now, only her arms, hands and upper torso remained human. Part of her mind reflected on how bizarre she must look.  The change began to move up her body. Her breasts vanished, replaced by canine nipples. Her arms became forelegs, and finally her hands re-shaped themselves into paws. Amanda looked at Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was right\" she said, snapping collar attached to a leash around Stacy's neck. \"You've become a beautiful dog. Come on, girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda led Stacy out into the back yard, where stood three doghouses that Stacy had never seen before. Amanda detached the leash from Stacy's collar and attached a chain that was fastened to the doghouse in its place.  She filled a water bowl from the garden hose and set it before the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be good, Stacy\", said Amanda. \"I have to go get ready for your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Amanda went back into the house. Stacy fought furiously. Her friends! Was Amanda going to do this to her friends, too? Why else were there three doghouses?  She had to do something! Stacy strained and strained, but the chain was too strong for her to break. She tried to dislodge the collar with her forepaws, but it wouldn't budge. She could at least make noise!  She began to bark fiercely. However, Amanda stuck her head out the back door and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, girl! Be quiet and stay quiet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's mouth snapped shut with a click. She found she could whine and growl softly, but despite her best efforts, she could do no more.  Dejectedly, she slunk into the doghouse and lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, Amanda rinsed the dish Stacy had eaten from and checked to see that she had all of her powders and formulae in order.  It paid to be prepared, after all.  A short while later, Amanda heard the doorbell ring. She answered the door, and saw that it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is at the door?  Is it...</span></div></div>",

Outside was a tall girl about Amanda's age, with frizzy brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\", she said. \"I'm Jessica Alvarez, Amanda's friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do come in, dear\", said Amanda. \" I'm Amanda, Stacy told me you were coming.  As Jessica hung up her coat, Amanda sprinkled a fine powder over her head.  Jessica didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat, Jessica. Stacy stepped out for a moment, but I'm sure she'll be back soon. Can I get you anything?  Are you thirsty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had been fine, but the word \"thirsty\" seemed to echo in her head.  Suddenly, she was parched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please, I'd like a glass of water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda went into the kitchen and came back with a glass of something that looked and tasted like water, but wasn't.  Jessica accepted it with thanks, and drank it down greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that really hit the spot. Thanks again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quite welcome, dear. Why don't you turn on the television while we're waiting for Stacy?  The remote's right over by you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Jessica. She reached for the remote, but found that she couldn't make her fingers work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Jessica?\" asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", said the girl. \"It's like there's something wrong with my fingers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gasped as her fingers became shorter and stubbier, her nails darkened and curved into claws, and pads began to form on her palms. Fur began to grow on what were now her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God, what's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's interesting\", said Amanda, \"how the change happens differently each time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Each time'?\" said Jessica. \"You've seen this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes\", said Amanda. \"Just a short while ago when I changed Stacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"You changed Stacy'?\" said Jessica, so astonished that she didn't notice the change spreading up her arms.  \"You're doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear\", came the reply.  \"If it's any consolation, it's not my choice, and it's nothing personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Nothing personal'?\" screamed Jessica. Her arms had now completely changed into a dog's forelimbs.  \"You're crazy! I'm getting out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she ran over to the door. However, she quickly found that her paws were useless to open the securely-locked door. She turned to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me me out of here, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Amanda. \" Now stop that noise and come over here, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Jessica found her legs carrying her back over to where Amanda now stood. Amanda spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold still while I undress you.\" Jessica found herself incapable of moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Undress' me? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easier to observe the change that way\", said Amanda, as she quickly but gently removed Jessica's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica began to cry as a coat of brown fur began to grow on her torso, even as it re-shaped itself into that of a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just bad luck on your part, dear. I used my powers to find a suitable initial candidate, then I used them again to influence her parents to hire me, then I influenced her to summon girls that would be suitable. Not really her fault, or her parents'. They weren't exactly free agents in all of this. Really, I'm not even 'free'. Blame the Fates, if you like. In the end, those three make us all dance for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda led Jessica over to the full-length mirror hanging in the hall. Jessica moaned as she saw her nose darken and then lengthen, moving outward from her face. Her lower jaw followed suit, her teeth sharpened, and her tongue thinned out and lengthened. Soon she had a perfectly-formed canine muzzle. She felt a tingling at the base of her spine, and soon a tail thrust itself out of her hindquarters. Next, she found herself rising up onto the balls of her feet as her toes began re-shaping themselves into paws.  Amanda steadied her as her legs began to  re-form into those of a dog, lowering the girl gently to the ground once her limps had assumed a completely quadrupedal configuration.  The change was now complete, except for her ears.  Amanda was nonplussed. The sight of an otherwise fine-looking German Shepherd with human ears was bizarre, even to her! However, the ears soon changed, and the transformation was complete. Amanda slipped a leash onto the girl, and led her towards the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the back yard, Stacy's mind was awash in fear and confusion.  Was she going to be stuck like this forever? What was Amanda doing to her friends?  It didn't help that her new canine senses were overwhelming her with a brace of new sensations. The new smells alone were making her crazy! Worse still, there was a part of her that was becoming more and more comfortable as a dog! What if she lost her human intelligence?  What if she forgot she'd ever been human?  She perked up as she saw the back door open. Her tail began wagging at the sight of Amanda. Stacy was horrified! She was reacting like a dog at the sight of its owner!  She whined unhappily as she saw that Amanda was leading another German Shepherd like herself. She caught the new dog's scent, and to her horror, she realized that the new dog was Jessica, transformed just as she was! Amanda led Jessica over and chained her up to the doghouse next to Jessica's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you girls be good and be quiet. I have to go get ready to meet our final guest.  Don't worry, it'll be time for the final step soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Amanda went back into the house. Stacy wondered frantically what she had meant by the \"final step\".  She looked over at Jessica and whined as apologetically as she could. How she wished they could speak together - maybe even plan.  Jessica looked at her, her tail wagging feebly.  Stacy placed one of her forepaws over one of Stacy's. She was pleased to she that her friend didn't pull away. She hoped that meant that Jessica didn't blame her for the fix they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the house, Amanda prepared to receive her next guest.  She hoped that this unpleasant business would soon be over.  She prayed to the Fates that everything would go smoothly, and hoped that they were listening for once.  Shortly, the doorbell rang. Forcing a smile onto her face, Amanda answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is at the door? Is it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is she here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ana, I'm Amanda, I'm staying with Stacy while her parents are away.  Do come in, Stacy and Jessica stepped out for a moment, but they'll be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna came in, and again, as she hung up her coat, Amanda sprinkled some fine powder over her head. After seeing Ana seated on the couch, Amanda spoke to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you anything, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please, a Diet Coke, if you have any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda put some ice cubes in a glass, and, after putting in some more of the powder, filled it with soda and brought it over to Ana.  Handing the glass to the girl she sat down on a chair opposite her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me, Ana, have you known Stacy and Jessica long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna sipped the soda thoughtfully. \"I've known them since my family moved to this town in fifth grade. They've known each other since kindergarten. How about you? Where are you fro if you don't mind my asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've lived alot of places. A long, long time ago, I lived in Greece, but I haven't been back there in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever think about going back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes\", aaid Amanda, smiling sadly. \"Maybe I will, someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna began looking down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Ana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well - Do you mind if I take my boots off? They feel kind of - loose- somehow. Kind of funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, dear. Make yourself comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort. Ana removed her hiking boots. She gasped. Through her woolen socks, she could see that her feet were oddly distended. Removing her socks, she saw that her toes had changed shape, and her toenails had darkened and become rounder and sharper. The contours of her feet were changing. It was as though they were becoming like the paws of a dog!  Even as she watched, brown fur began to grow on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same thing that's already happened to your two friends\" said Amanda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What are you talking about? Are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda couldn't help but be impressed. Ana was shocked and frightened, as anyone would be, but she wasn't panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is my doing, Ana.  I'm turning you into a dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sighed. \"Because my husband ordered it. I'm sure it's no consolation, but I'm not doing this by choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Because your husband ordered it'? What kind of reason is that?  Make it stop! Change it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even I cannot stop it now, Ana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna stood up angrily, and then nearly fell over.  Standing upright was suddenly very difficult. Amanda held out a hand to steady her. Ana shook off the proferred and managed to find her balance. She turned away and began a slow, careful walk towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting out of here! I'll find a way to stop this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved towards the door at a painfully slow rate. It didn't help that her legs were slowly but steadily changing the whole time. After she had taken a few steps, Amanda spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, Ana. Stay!\" To her horror, Ana found herself unable to move. \"Now, come!\"  Ana found herself beginning to turn back towards Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" With everyounce of her will, she fought the urge to obey.  After a minute, Ana began to turn towards the door again. Now, it was Amanda's turn to be astonished! However, during this battle of wills, Ana's legs had become completely canine.  She nearly fell over when a tail thrust itself out of her hindquarters, dislodging her jeans. With a growl, she stepped out  of her pants, and somehow contrived not to fall over. After a few more laborious steps, then change reached her pelvis, and she fell over onto her hands as her rear assumed a quadrupedal configuration. Ana cried out in pain.  Amanda spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ana, sit, NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Ana's legs plopped her down into a sitting position. she couldn't control them at all! With a renewed effort, she began pulling herself towards the door with her arms. She could feel the change beginning to move up her torso.  She knew she very little time left. Amanda watched in shock as Ana reached the door at last. She had to move fast, the change was almost up to her shoulders! As Ana reached for the doorknob, Amanda spoke again, putting more power into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ana, STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna growled again - she was so close, but her arm wouldn't move! Making one last effort, she managed to make her hand move. Even as she fumbled at the knob, the change moved up her arm. The knob was just beginning to turn, when her hands began to change into paws, and she lost her grip. Ana hissed in frustration.  What spirit, Amanda thought. She'll have to be the center. She spoke aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over, Ana. Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly her head still human, Ana found her canine limbs obediently carrying her over to her new mistress. Even as her head began to change, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you\", she said. Amanda watched as Ana's ears became pointed and a canine muzzle pushed forward from her face.  She sighed as she removed the rest of Ana's clothes and leashed the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ana, that was done a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the backyard, Stacy had lost her internal battle against the canine part of her.  She still had her human intelligence, but her human memories - though intact - were like something that had belonged to someone else, in a different life. Her horror at what had happened to her, her fear at what would happen to her friends, all had subsided. Jessica was not so far along, but she too was fighting less and less against what she had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dogs perked up as they heard the back door opening. They saw Amanda coming out, leading another dog. If there was any resistance at all left in Stacy, it finally died beneath the overwhelming joy she felt at the sight of her mistress.  Jessica seemed to pick up some of her friend's excitement.  She scented the new dog - it was Ana! Amanda brought Ana over to the third doghouse and chained her up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls be quiet and be good. I have some final preparations to make, and then I'll be back for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back into the house.  Ana tested the chain and snarled as she realized it wouldn't break. she looked at her two friends. she sensed that their spirits were just about broken. She herself could feel her canine nature growing in strength. Using every ounce of mental energy she could muster, she focused on remaining human inside. After some time, Amanda came back out of the house. Ana knew that it was now or never. If she didn't  escape now, she'd become a good little dog just as the other two now seemed to be. Methodically, Amanda unchained first Stacy and then Jessica, putitng leashes on them both. When she unchained Ana, Ana jumped at her, causing her to drop the leashes, and then ran for it.  To her disappointment, Stacy and Jessica stood happily by while Amanda picked up their leashes. Ana reached the back gate, and began fumbling at the latch with her forepaws. Amanda spoke, with a voice unlike any Ana had ever heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANA, HEEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of Amanda's voice caused Ana to freeze.  Even with all of her will focused on one intent, she could not move. Amanda spoke again, and this time her voice echoed inside Ana's head in a way that would brook no disobedience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna turned slowly, and started in shock as she looked at Amanda. Amanda had changed in an indefinable way.  It was the same woman, wearing the same clothes, but she now looked somehow ageless - simultaneously scarcely older than Ana herself, and yet somehow impossibly ancient. This was not a normal human being. Whatever she was, she could not be disobeyed. Ana trotted over to where Amanda stood, and meekly let her leash her up again. Amanda spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you may have guessed\", she said gently, \"My name isn't Amanda, and I'm not just another babysitter. My real name is Persephone. Are you familiar with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna nodded. Though she was of Japanese descent, she had read up on Greek mythology for school.  Persephone, she knew, was the daughter of Ceres. In the old stories, she had been kidnapped by Hades and forced to become his wife. Before the events of this night, it would have been hard to believe that the gods of myth were real. Now, all things considered, it was not so difficult.  Amanda - no, Persephone  - spoke again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we old gods still exist, though few still believe in us. We still walk the Earth from time-to-time, though not so openly as we did in times past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was speaking, Persephone led the three back into the house. Ana couldn't help but notice that the house looked subtly different. Persephone seemed to read her mind - maybe she actually did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear, well-spotted.  The house <i>does</i> look different.  Because I must take you three away from here, never to return, I have removed all traces of your existences, both from all the places that you, Jessica and Stacy have lived, and from the minds of those that have known you.  This is what this house would look like if Stacy had never been born.  However, for your mothers' sakes, and for the sake of my own mother, who knows only too well what it was like to have her daughter taken away, I have made special 'arrangements'. Fortunately, your mothers are all still young enough and healthy enough. So, I've had a word with Hera and with Aphrodite. Eros will visit your parents wherever they are tonight.  Your mothers will find your fathers particularly 'attentive', and your fathers will find your mothers particularly 'receptive'.  And in nine months' time, they will have new daughters to replace the ones they will never know that they lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone stopped, and for a moment, Ana thought that the goddess was about to cry.  Then she shook her head, and led the three over to the cellar door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone opened the cellar door, and to Ana's surprise, instead of the wooden steps she had seen on previous visits, there were stone steps, wider than should have been possible. Ana looked around as Persephone led them down the steps, They led down to a vast open plain under an overcast sky. Ana could see a river in the distance.  When they reached the bottom, Ana looked around and saw that the steps had disappeared, and the plain now extended indefinitely behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone removed the leashes from the girls' collars and arranged th egirls before her, with Ana in the middle and Stacy to her left and Jessica to her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the middle head that controls the body\", she said, \" and you, Ana, being the most spirited, should be the one in control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna puzzled over her words and began to suspect what Persephone meant.  The tiny part of her that still was human wanted to shrink back, but she knew there was no hope of defiance now. Persephone looked into the distance, almost dreamily, then spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so quiet here, now. We see few new souls here, and there's not much for the guardian of the gates of Hades to do. In short, Cerberus is bored. And my husband loves Cerberus, as much as any mortal loves his or her dog, and decreed that something must be done to liven up the creature's life. In other words, a mate must be found for the hound of Hades. This, however, was problematical. Cerberus is unique, as far as we know, and so a mate must needs be <i>created</i> for him. We first sought to work with mortal dogs, but a magical being must have intelligence and imagination, and dogs, though not without these qualities, did not posses them in sufficient quantities.  Our 'raw materials' needed to be human, for only humans possessed the required ability to think and imagine.  Specifically, they had to be human females: young, intelligent, healthy, and virginal. We consulted the oracles, and they directed us to Stacy. Why? I doubt even Zeus himself could say. However, once we found Stacy, we influenced her parents to go on vacation and to have the idea of hiring a babysitter - me, in other words. From there, it was easy enough to subconsciously influence Stacy to summon two of her friends who were suitable, and the rest, as they say, is history. Anyway, enough exposition. The time has come. I warn you, this won't hurt, but it will probably feel extremely peculiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Persephone began to chant in a language that had been ancient in Homer's day. A wind whipped up, and the studs on the dogs' collars began to glow. Ana closed her eyes and began to feel an intense tingling all over her body. She felt energy flowing through her body like water through a firehose, and had the sensation that her two friends were somehow being pushed into the sides of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light fade and the winds died down, there was now only one dog standing on the plain before Hades' queen. It stil looked vaguely like a German Shepherd, albeit a three-headed German Shepherd the size of a grizzly bear. Persephone set a shallow golden bowl before each of the dog's heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry this had to be done to you, my dears. It's small consolation, perhaps, but know that you wil live forever now, and with any luck be the mother of a new race of creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone filled the three bowls with Lethe water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget now, my dears, the lives that once you led. Remember only that you go now with your mistress to meet your intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature's three heads obediently lapped up the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have a name. I know - a combinination of your old names!  From now on, your name is 'Anastassica'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastassica looked on affectionately as her mistress gathered up the three bowls, then followed at her heels as she walked the distance to the shores of the River Styx. Charon greeted Persephone:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, Mistress. I see that your mission was successful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, Charon. I hope that my husband will be pleased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastassica ignored the rest of their conversation as she clambered onto Charon's ferry.  As he began to guide them across the river, she stood forward and sniffed at the air. Her tail began to wag as she caught the scent of her prospective mate. she could hardly wait to meet him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was defiant, but at that moment, her arms began to shrink, growing shorter and shorter, and sprouting white fur..  Her hands shrank,too, her fingers becoming stubby and her nails turning into claws.  She flailed her new forelimbs in frustration, but she couldn't even reach her pocket to pull out her cellphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smirked and walked over to Stacy's side. Deftly avoiding Stacy's batting paws, she reached in and pulled Stacy's phone out of her pocket and slipped it into her own. Then she walked back over to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy growled, and then said, \"I can still knock the landline off the hook. I can still get through to someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, dear\", said Amanda. \"But maybe not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Stacy's nose changed, becoming a black dog's nose in the middle of her otherwise still-human face. With it came a dog's heightened olfactory sense, and Stacy suddenly smelled something <i>Really. Really. Super. Delicious</i>.  Amanda had laid out a bowl of dog food and a bowl of water on the kitchen floor.  Stacy's mouth watered, and her tongue, growing thinner and longer, came lolling  out of her mouth.She took several involuntary steps towards the kitchen before stopping herself with an effort of will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", she said. \"I am <b>naw</b> a thog and I will naw <b>'e</b> a thog! I don' care ith you <b>ah</b> a wish!\"  As if to contradict her, she felt a thrusting at the base of her spine as a curvy basset hound tail grew from what had been her tailbone.  As i sensing this, Amanda came over again and pulled Stacy's tail out of her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I know, Stacy\" said Amanda,. \"Now go and eat your dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked again at the dog food.

As if of their own volition, her legs carried her into the kitchen, She got down on her knees and buried her face in the food bowl. As she ate, the shape of her head began to change. He jaws projected outward into a canine muzzle, and her hair was replaced by brown and white fur. When she finished eating, she lapped up some water as well.When she was done, her head changed completely into that of a basset hound. Stacy had difficulty standing up - her forelegs couldn't support the weight of her still human body. Somehow she managed it, and walked over to look at herself in the mirror, howling in dismay when she saw her transformed head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she looked at her reflection, her legs began to change, becoming  shorter, and assuming a canine configuration. Amanda rushed over to help lower her carefully to the floor - her now short legs couldn't hold up her still-human torso.  Stacy's shoes and socks had come off, and Amanda easily removed Stacy's jeans and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy squirmed helplessly on the floor for a few minutes, but then her torso began to dwindle, sprouting fur and assuming new proportions. Soon enough, Stacy's transformation was complete!  She tried to speak to Amanda, but found that she could only produce canine sounds.  Amanda seemed to divine her intentions, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to speak, Stacy, I can hear your thoughts, just think when you want to communicate with me. Now, let me explain a few things.  I've left you your human mind and personality.  When we're alone you can do what you like as long as you don't make trouble for me. When w'ere outside, or if anyone else is around,the spell will compel you to behave like a normal dog. Understand this: If you do make trouble for me, I may just decide to suppress your human side entirely, and leave you a dog in mind as well as body for the rest of the week. As it is, you may find your 'canine nature' raising its head occasionally. If you were left like this for much more than a month, you'd  start to lose your human nature gradually and end up totally a dog. But you should be fine for a week.Oh, and one other thing - I've transformed you into a dog that's been spayed, so you needn't worry about any unwelcome male attention.  Not to worry, when I turn you back, you'll be 'intact' again. So, any questions or comments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy thought for a moment. She  was scared, and she didn't at all like the idea of spending the week as a dog, but she wasn't going to grovel to Amanda, or beg anything from her.  One thought was occurring to her, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Actually</i>, she thought at Amanda, <i>I have to...um...\"go\".</i></span></div></div>",

Come.\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was about to protest, but then thought long about the position she was in. A witch had just turned her into a dog. And she just said she could make her a dog in mind as well. Did she really want to risk that? Stacy was a rebel to the core, but even she knew that she couldn't mess with an actual witch. Maybe if she played along for a bit, Amanda might give her some actual privileges? Stacy plotted out her plan to play the slow game, to win Amanda over and then eventually use it to get her human dignity back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's thoughts were interrupted by Amanda suddenly shouting \"Wait! I almost forgot! Stacy, sit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA startled Stacy stopped and sat on the ground. She looked up at Amanda towering over her. Amanda held a blue dog collar in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want to go outside without your collar on. What would happen if you got out and got lost?\" Amanda said as she bent down and attached the collar to Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took everything in Stacy's power to not lash out at this. But she still didn't want to get into any more trouble than she was already in. Stacy looked across the room, and saw her reflection in the window. She was Basset Hound through and through, and the with the collar and tags attached to her, no one would think anything different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Stacy. Let's go outside.\" Amanda said, as she opened the back door. Stacy shuffled out on her tiny legs, the tags on her collar jingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was blown away from how much bigger the backyard seemed. It was because she was smaller, yes, but also because so many sounds and smells she had no clue existed all came crashing into her brain. Instinctively, she put her nose to the ground and started to sniff around. She did have a very powerful nose now, and she might as well put it to good use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Stacy remembered why she was out here. She looked back to Amanda, who was watching and smiling. Stacy bucked up, found a nice spot, squatted down, and did what she needed to do.</span></div></div>",

Standing next to the bed was a woman who looked no older than Stacy, or than Amanda did, herself, now that her spell had had time to take effect.  Outwardly, she looked like an 18 year-old blonde girl in a tee shirt and jeans. Amanda knew that this was an illusion. In truth, this was Irene, an elder witch, and one who had taught Amanda everything she knew about magic.  Amanda moved to get up out of the bed, but Irene waved her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother Irene\", she said, respectfully, \"What can I do for you?\"  Irene wasn't her mother, of course, but so a witch was expected to address her mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda\", said Irene. \"I need a big favor from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything\", said Amanda. A witch dared not refuse her mentor.  \"How may I serve you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid the Lady Antonia discovered who it was that snooped through her private collection of grimoires and maybe 'borrowed' one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, crap\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, indeed\", said Irene. \"Anyway, I have to go on an extended tour of the Outer Realms until such time as she calms down a bit, and I need you to mind something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene produced an ancient-looking book from out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mother\", said Amanda,\"You brought the grimoire <i>here?</i> But she'll trace it wherever it goes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\", said Irene. \"I know a disguise spell that even she can't penetrate.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene twisted the grimoire in her hand, and it re-shaped itself so that it looked like a girl's diary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\", said Amanda. \"But even though Antonia doesn't know me, if she follows your trail and finds a witch here, she'll be suspicious. She'll never believe that I don't know anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll believe it if you actually <b>don't</b> know anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene gestured, and Amanda felt all of her magic drain out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There\", said Irene. \"Now you're the mortal 18 year-old that you appear to be.  In a moment, you'll fall asleep. While you sleep, your memories will alter, as will the memories of Stacy's family and friends, and all appropriate records. Stacy Porter will just have to remain Lori Nguyen's dog for a while. You will be Amanda Porter, well-behaved daughter of George and Mary Porter, who felt perfectly safe leaving you at home alone, as well as Lori Nguyen's best friend since childhood Even if Antonia finds this place, she won't find a trace of magic in you or the diary.  I'll be back to restore you as soon as the heat is off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But  - but -\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, Amanda. sleep\", said Irene. Amanda found herself helpless to do anything for sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke an hour later, she was ravenously hungry. After having a nice sandwich, she got out her schoolbooks. she had school tomorrow, she'd better get her homework done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

Channeling her energy, she zipped through time and space, following Irene's magical trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the trail took her to a quiet suburban town in quiet America. Antonia sighed. How much the world had changed in her 100s of years. After that moment of brief reflection, she once again channeled her magical energies, searching for her desired grimoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally she found it! The trail Irene left lead to a red brick house near the end of the street. Upon arrival of the house, Antonia became very confused.

Something was suspicious here. But Antonia shrugged it off. Whatever Irene's plan was, it was about to fail. All she had to do was get Amanda out of the way and grab her book, and then she could be off to find and punish that wicked Irene.</span></div></div>",

You want the ball?\" Amanda said, as she held the ball in the air over Stacy's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's tail was now wagging at 100 miles her hour, and her tongue was panting at a great pace. All of her concerns disappeared for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Throw the ball! Throw the ball!</i> Stacy thought, and barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go fetch!\" Amanda said, as she threw the ball. Stacy ran as fast as her four legs could take her, and chased the ball before it fell under the couch. She picked it up with her mouth and ran back to Amanda, dropping it as her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl!\" Amanda said.</span></div></div>",

When they were sitting comfortably. she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you both are now aware, there are such things as witches.  Amanda and I are both witches, as was the woman you saw at Stacy's house, who was dressed as a policewoman.  I say 'dressed as' because, I can assure you, she was not an actual cop.  The world you both live in is called the 'Earth Realm'. At any given point in time, there are some witches resident in the Earth Realm. This is not publicly known, since by ancient witch law, it is forbidden for any witch to make the real existence of magic generally known here.  A witch can do magic there, but she has to cover her tracks, and make sure that no one witnesses her making magic, or at least that any witnesses are unable to tell anyone about  the existence of magic. This is one of the strictest witch laws, and even the lowest, most immoral witch would hesitate to break it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\", asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Essentially because it's forbidden by the gods. What their reasoning is, they only know.  I've never met a god, and I'm not particularly eager to meet one. Even the benevolent attention of the gods can result in some permanent alterations in one's lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene paused and took a sip of water form a cup that she had made appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, there are plenty of Other Realms - other dimensions,I suppose you'd call them - and in most of them, witches can live and practice openly. Frankly, the Earth Realm is a good place to hang out if you're a lazy witch -\" Here she glared at Amanda, \" -who wants an easy life where she can live comfortably and not have many other witches around to compete with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked as though she was going to say something, and then thought better of it. Irene continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for me, well, I'll be honest. I'm something of a low-level grifter/thief.  My only real talent is a gift for getting around security systems, magical and mundane. I really shouldn't be talking about lazy witches, I've never really lived up to my potential, either. Anyway, I lived a quiet life, making a reasonable dishonest living, never really hurting anyone, never really doing anyone much good, either. Eventually, I took on Amanda as my apprentice We pull the odd scam together, and then do stuff on our own, never anything big enough to draw the attention of the Council of Elders.  They're the closest thing we witches have to a 'government'.  Basically, they're a bunch of powerful witches who enforce witch law and keep the rest of us in line. At any rate, I was having a little rest between jobs when I was suddenly summoned by one of Athena's Owls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look off shock passed across Amanda's face. Irene continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Owls are agents of the Council -  sort of a witch's version of the FBI and the CIA all rolled up into one. I went when I was called, but I was panicking, desperately reviewing my recent activities to see what I might have done that had attracted their attention. the agent that summoned me quickly assuaged my fear.  They weren't after me for anything I had done.  Instead, they wanted my help with something that they preferred not to have one off their agents involved with. An Aleph-level grimoire had one missing, and they suspected a rather influential witch of having stolen it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Antonia!\", said Amanda. \"So that's why you broke into her estate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Irene.  \"An Aleph-level  grimoire is something only an advanced level witch could even use. However, in the a hands of a qualified witch, it's the magical equivalent of a hydrogen bomb, only one that could be used repeatedly. Used in conjunction with the right kind of magical targeting system, it could be used  to launch a first strike against - well, who knows? - the Council itself seems like an obvious target.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what would she want with something like that?\". said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\", said Irene. \"Wipe out the Council and set herself up as empress or something, maybe. Anyway, the grimoire was taken from a secure location, and the owls were morally certain that Antonia took it, but they had no hard evidence, and it would have been politically 'difficult' to move against a witch as influential as she is without hard proof.  So, they brought me in. I could go in and try and find evidence against Antonia, and if she caught me, there was nothing that connected me to the Owls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that be hard on you if she caught you?\", asked Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Irene, \"But they had me, carrot and stick. The carrot was that if I cooperated, I'd get all sorts of valuable goodies, and immunity against all of my previous misdeeds. The stick was that I refused to go, I'd be prosecuted for said misdeeds, and have the book thrown at me. So, things being what they were, I took the job.  I got into Antonia's place alright - for such a bigshot, the security was abysmal - and I hit the jackpot, I found the grimoire! She really must've thought that no one would dare intrude on her, or maybe she thought  that if she built up her security too much, people would think she was up to something, I dunno. anyway, I started to hightail it out of there with her right on my heels.  She was insane with anger, she zapped two of her own servants trying to get at me!  I managed to get away with her hot on my heels. I bounced from Realm to Realm, and managed to shake her momentarily. She must have suspected who I was working for, because I could see that she had people guarding the approaches to the Owl's HQ. So, I hid the grimoire carefully, and then went looking for Amanda.  I found her at your house, Stacy, and set up a little trap for Antonia. I knew I couldn't overpower her, but I was able to slow her down long enough that I could hide us here.  I brought Amanda along because I knew Antonia would soon find out that she was my apprentice, and would do the gods know what to her to use her against me. I brought you two along because I didn't want to leave you to her tender mercies. She'd almost never believe that you weren't in on it with me, and even if she didn't, she might have zapped you out of pure meanness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we, exactly, Mother Irene?\", asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Hidden Realm that I stumbled across ages ago, and set up as a sort of ultimate hide-away if  I ever needed one.  The gods the,selves couldn't find this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Hidden Realm\", explained Amanda to Stacy and Lori, \"Is what  you might call a 'pocket universe'. It's almost impossible to find your way into unless you know exactly where it is, and I'm sure Mother Irene has added some special security upgrades of her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing at Stacy's house, anyway, Amanda?\" asked Irene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, I was babysitting Stacy.  The real story is that a few years ago, I helped her father out with some gambling debts. In return, well...Stacy, there's a certain unique magical energy released when a girl 'gives it up' for the first time. This energy is even more intense when it's released under a full moon, and the next full moon is Saturday..  The babysitting gig was a cover for me to arrange to be present to collect that energy when you  'made your debut'.  Around about Friday, I would have retrieved you from Lori's, returned you to normal and made a big show of remorse for what I'd done to you. By way of making it up to you, I'd have encouraged you to invite your favorite boy over, and  arranged to nudge him in your direction if need be.  I would have seemingly made myself scarce, but really I'd have been there invisibly.  A little aphrodisiac spell and you and loverboy would have been going at it.  A win/win situation - you would've gotten your rocks off, and I'd have collected the magical energy, for which there is a big market in some Realms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you'd have just asked me, we might've worked something out\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew\", said Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to rely on your cooperation\" said Amanda, \"and If i'd just flat-out coerced you to do it with some guy, that could've damaged the magic.  There had to be at least <i>some</i> willingness on your part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all very interesting\", said Irene, \"but getting back to the present situation, we need to think about what we're going to do.  we could probably stay safely in this Hidden realm for the rest of our lives, but I assumed none of us wants to do that.  On the other hand, if we leave here, there's a fairly high chance that Antonia will be ready to jump on us the minute we show our faces. I, however, have a plan. Will you hear me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others assented, and Irene began to describe her plan.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We're nice and safe in here, but outside this Hidden Realm, Antonia will be monitoring every possible Realm that she can. We'd have to get out of here, get to the grimoire and get it to the Owls before she incinerates us. Two weak witches and two mundanes, we don't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this 'we' stuff?\", asked Stacy. \"We didn't steal the grimoire from her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry you got sucked into this mess\", said Irene. \"But, like it or not, you are. Antonia will fry you both, just to be on the safe side, which is what she'll do to us all if she catches us. However, what if, instead of two weak witches, and two mundanes, she had to deal with four strong witches?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where will these four strong witches come from?\", asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two of them will be the two of us\", said Irene. Turning to Stacy and Lori, she  said. The way you become stronger as a witch is the same way you become stronger as anything else - you study and practice, and the fact is, Amanda and I, we've both coasted. The only area where I could be said to excel is at sneaking into and out of places. If you and I really applied ourselves, we could both become a lot stronger. In video game terms, I'm at about Level 40, and Amanda's at about level 20. Good enough for the low-level stuff we've done all our lives, not not enough to take on someone like Amanda, who's gotta be closer to level 80.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but where are the other two witches?\", asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sitting right there\", said Irene, pointing at Stacy and Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\", asked Amanda, Stacy and Lori. together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW?\", asked Amanda by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain to Stacy and Lori how someone becomes a witch\", said Irene.  \"You see, witches are 'made', not 'born'.   When a witch finds a mundane woman that she considers suitable, she can take her on a an apprentice witch.  What that means is that the witch plants a seed of her own magic in the apprentice. As it grows, the mentor teaches the apprentice about the ways of magic. While she's still in the apprentice stage, the mentor can remove the apprentice's magic as she wishes. The apprentice is bound to honor and obey her mentor,. However, once the apprentice has reached a certain level, she can seal her magic to herself,  Once, she's done that, no one can take her magic away from her, not even her mentor. Of course, a stronger witch can suppress or contain her magic, but no one can take it away from her. At that point, she's considered to have served her apprenticeship. She no longer owes her mentor total obedience, although she does owe her lifelong respect, and any lawful assistance her mentor requires, if she can provide it.  You will have noticed that Amanda calls me 'mother Irene'. that's part of the respect that she owes me as her mentor .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene turned and looked at Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you my have figured out, Amanda hasn't completed her apprenticeship yet, although she really ought to have done so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this got to do with us?\", asked Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's the thing\", said Irene. \"A witch can only have one apprentice at a time. Otherwise, I could apprentice one of you, and Amanda could apprentice the other. But, we haven't got that option. So, what I propose we bend the rules a little. It's not usually done, but there's no actual rule against an apprentice taking an apprentice of her own. I suggest that Amanda apprentice one of you, and her apprentice will apprentice the other one. In reality, I'll be overseeing all of your training, as well as developing my own skills as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute\", said Stacy. \"Does that mean that if I became Amanda's apprentice, I'd have to call her 'Mother Amanda'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Irene. \"Even after you complete your apprenticeship. It' one of the stricter rules of witch law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel any better, Stacy\", said Amanda. \"I really wasn't wild about having to call her 'Mother Irene' at first. I got used to it, eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides\", said Lori, \"If we do it that way, I'd have to call you 'Mother Stacy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long would this take?\", asked Stacy.  \"If we're in here training, who knows what Antonia will be getting up to out in the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mentions what our parents will think happened to us\", added Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the unusual thing about this particular Hidden Realm\", said Irene. \"Time flows differently here.  We could spend a thousand years in here, and only a second would pass out in the Earth Realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\", said Amanda. \"I've never heard of anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither have I\", said Irene. \"This place could be unique for all I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, a thousand years?\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it shouldn't come to that\", said Irene. \"But even if it did, it wouldn't matter. If you become a witch, you''l find that your relationship to time changes a bit.  You don't have to age unless you want to, and we can live indefinitely, assuming we survive Antonia.  I was born in what you would call New Testament times,  and I've  known one witch who claimed to have been old when Atlantis sank. We can be killed, but we don't die of old age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene looked at them all, and said, \"I won't force it on any of you, not even you, Amanda, but what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How do we do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief ritual in which Stacy swore to serve and obey Amanda faithfully as her apprentice, and Amanda swore to guide and teach Stacy truly as her mentor. Irene served as a witness. Then Irene pointed them towards a bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the bedroom, Amanda muttered a brief spell, and Stacy found herself dressed in a comfortable, well-fitted nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get into the bed, and make yourself comfortable\", said Amanda. \"This is the easy part for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy complied, and when she was comfortable, Amanda closed her eyes placed a hand on Stacy's forehead.  Stacy felt a warm, pleasant energy flowing into her.. It was like soaking in a warm bath after a long day. Her eyes snapped shut, and she was soon fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda came out of the bedroom, and said, \"It's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll sleep for a day\", said Irene to Lori, while the magical energy permeates her, body and soul.  Then she'll need a week of very basic training until she can apprentice you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene spent the next day showing Lori everything that was in the cabin and the neighboring vicinity. Amanda stayed near Stacy, and when she sensed that Stacy was about to wake up, she re-entered the bedroom. when Stacy opened her eyes, she looked up at Amanda, and said, \"Good morning , Mother Amanda, how do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With breakfast\", Amanda replied. The two left the room and joined the others at the breakfast table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say\", said Stacy to Irene. \"If Amanda is 'Mother Amanda' to me, how should I address you, 'Grandmother Irene'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\", said Irene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", said Lori, \"Stacy will be 'Mother Stacy' to me, and Amanda will be 'Grandmother Amanda\". Will you be 'Great-Grandmother Irene'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Irene, \"Any witch in your 'mentor-chain' above your mentor's mentor will still just be 'Grandmother Whoever'. I mean, my mentor Claudia, and her mentor Anatu are still alive. If you ever meet her, you'd theoretically have to call her 'Great-Great-Great-Grandmother Anatu', and that would be too much of a mouthful. An older witch who is not in your 'mentor-chain' would be addressed as 'Lady Whoever', and a younger witch or one of your same age can be called by their first name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any male witches?\", asked  Stacy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are male magic users\", said Irene, \"but they have a different craft and disciplines than we do. We don't intermix with them much. Don't worry, there's plenty of mundane males out there, and they tend to be a lot safer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next week, Amanda gave Stacy her basic training, with occasional input from Irene.  Lori was left  mainly at loose ends for that week, which she spent exploring the area around the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her time came. Lori swore to serve and obey Stacy faithfully as her apprentice, and Stacy swore to guide and teach Lori truly as her mentor. Amanda served as a witness.   Stacy put Lori to bed, and planted a see do magic in her.  Lori feel asleep, and when she awoke, Stacy was smiling down at her.  \"Good morning, Mother Stacy!\", Lori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a  day to rest, and then their training began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When it was all over, Stacy was never quite sure how long they did spend training. Irene had been right about one thing \u2013 a magical being\u2019s relationship to time was different from that of a mundane.   They all worked hard, but no one worked harder than Irene.  Every day, she spent time on her own growth, then spent time training with Amanda, then offered occasional supervision while Amanda trained Stacy,  and offered pretty much constant supervision as Stacy \u201ctrained\u201d Lori. (Mostly it was Irene that trained Lori, while at the same time teaching Stacy how to be a teacher.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy found herself becoming competitive with Lori as they each did their best to develop their magical powers and knowledge of witch law, lore and history. At the same time, Amanda was motivated to develop as well \u2013 she didn\u2019t want Stacy (her apprentice) completing her apprenticeship before she herself completed hers!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Amanda completed her apprenticeship first. They took the day off, and watched the brief ceremony in which Amanda sealed her magic to herself, and Irene declared to all and sundry that Amanda had completed her apprenticeship, and was a full and free mistress of witchcraft.  They had a big party for her, and then when back to training the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy completed her own apprenticeship some time later, and Lori completed hers a mere week later. Stacy felt a pride like she\u2019d never felt before. She\u2019d never really worked at anything so hard before, and she felt a real sense of achievement. Witchcraft interested her more than anything she\u2019d ever studied before, and the sense of having become something much more than she\u2019d bene before was very fulfilling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them seemed to have individual strengths. Irene had always been good at stealth and evading security systems, and Amanda had a gift for transformations.  Stacy seemed to have a gift for healing potions and powders, and Lori had a real skill at magical combat.  Once their individual skills were developed, they began working on teamwork, as well. In time, they became a well-polished magical fighting unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy, Lori, Irene and Amanda had gotten to know one another quite well during the training.  It was just the four of them in Irene\u2019s Hidden Realm, after all, and they spent a great deal of time together.  Additionally, some aspects of their magical training were quite intimate. Not physically intimate, but psychically intimate. Some of the things they had to learn to do involved touching one another\u2019s minds, and in time they had no secrets from one another. The training changed all four of them, in ways that were permanent. In a way, they were closer than sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one evening, Irene called them all together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, I think we\u2019ve reached the limit of what we can become training with each other here. I\u2019m very proud of all of you. Heck, I\u2019m even proud of myself. We\u2019ve all advanced so much and become very powerful witches.   Tomorrow, we go to face our final test. We have to deal with Antonia. So, get plenty of sleep tonight, because tomorrow we fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning after breakfast, they all gathered together outside the cabin. Remember, no time will have passed in the Earth Realm, so I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll have a big surprise to hand Antonia. However, stay alert, and make sure that we don\u2019t get caught by any surprises. Everyone ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded, and Irene spoke the spell which returned them all to the Earth Realms. Stacy looked around, and saw\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Stacy jumped onto a kitchen chair she was suppriesed at Amanda's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Stacy. I guess you are a little suprised that you are a kitten. I told you I am not used to babysiting little girls so I had no choise but to turn you into a cat. I know you will grow to love being my new pet. Don't worry your parents don't even remember having a daughter. Until I get bord with you your now my cat.\" Amanda said with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then dug into one of the bags she had arrived with and pulled out a cat's colar that read Stacy. Amanda had been planing this all along. Stacy then started to panic. She then noticed that the front door was open.

Suddenly, a black furred tail, resembling a cat's tail, slithered out the hole, reaching the ground and kept growing a little more. She then directed Stacy's eyes with her fingers to her head as she saw the years drain away, and now she looked the same age as Stacy, maybe even a year younger than her. \"I hate this part...\" she grumbles as her belly tones out, waist contracts, and her breasts gain a cup size, straining her shirt. Finally, her ears seem to vanish, only to re-surface out her hair, looking like black fuzzy cat ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I'm a nekomimi, a catgirl, as is your mom, and our race originates from a distant world, which means you're a catgirl too.\" Stacy was still in shock. She reached out and grabbed Amanda's swishing tail. She cooed a bit, acting like her actions felt good to her. \"G... Go ahead and rub it...\" She seemed to be in bliss. However, Stacy does something else, biting it. Amanda yelps like the dickens, jerking her tail back, screaming, \"Why'd you do that!!\" She was nursing the wound, finding light trickles of blood coming from the puncture marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're for real...\" Stacy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, pick a better way to test my validity!! Our tails are really sensitive, as you'll soon learn!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!! You asked me why I babysit cats...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'm going to turn into a catgirl?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet... See, over the next few days, you'll actually turn into a full-fledged cat, and then after a couple of months as a cat, you'll slowly become a catgirl, and while as a cat, there's a risk you may go feral until you begin to change into a catgirl, so I have to be ready to look after a regular old cat if that happens, but just as likely, you could keep your higher functions in your cat form. It's all random...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm going to turn into a cat!!\" Stacy screams!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I did it 70 Neko years ago, and your mom did it when she turned eighteen 48 Neko years ago!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how long have you been alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"285 Earth years this November. Equivalently to humans. Your mom is 199 Earth years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, 'kay...?!\" Stacy screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we nekomimi age like humans until we turn into cats, then our aging drastically slows down. We can live to be to around 500 Earth years old, and until we reach about 420, we don't really show away signs of aging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure I'm not adopted?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.

In the corner was what looked like an unconscious catgirl maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all of this?!\" Stacy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you'll be spending you next month!!\" Suddenly a dart hits her neck, draining a pink goo into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Month!!\" Stacy screams, feleling a light burn from the injection site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!!\" Amanda states. \"Your mom hired me to watch you for a month so she can not only do her business presentation, but get a needed vacation without you bugging her... her words, not mine, and since I specialize in cats, I decided I'd just made you a cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad?\" blasted Stacy, thinking this woman was loony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Over the next few days you'll slowly become a wittle kitty, with fuzzy fur and a cute tail, and the dose I gave you will wear off about the day after your mom gets back, which will allow your mom time to enjoy you as a kitty before you change back, and you should almost fully change back by a week after your mom gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knows... Wait, almost fully?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for some reason, I can't seem to get the formula to get rid of the tail during reversion, but your mom said that'd be fine.

Stacy watched as the formula drained into Amanda's bloodstream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you just stab yourself?!\" Stacy finally yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda motioned to everything she had installed. \"I'm sure you noticed that these things are automatic. The water bowls are connected to the main waterline so that they automatically fill up when they're emptied, the food bowls have enough food in them to feed two cats for well over a month, and the litter-boxes will replace the litter daily. I do this all the time at home and I'd rather join you in the fun than just sit here and watch you everyday. The only real difference is that at home I usually only do this a week at a time with a quicker acting formula to change in hours instead of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not just do this at your own home and leave me be?\" Stacy was starting to get really irritated by Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I said, my cat died. I was starting to get lonely when turning into a cat without my friend around, so I started looking for someone to have a little fun with. Your mom visits me from time to time and mentioned that you would be a good candidate. I liked the idea so she had me spend some time with you. Now I'll finally have a playmate again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy sighed, seeing there was no way out of this now. \"Alright, what's the first change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... The first change should be a tail and the ears. That should happen about half an hour of taking the formula,\" she glanced at a cat-themed wall clock, \"which should be right about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked at the clock to see that it had, indeed, been thirty minutes since she came downstairs. She heard a rip and spun her head around to see a long, slender orange tail stretching out behind her and moving back and forth. She felt her ears moving slightly and reached up to feel them moving up to the top of her head, each one becoming covered in fur and forming a point. She looked over to a mirror that was hanging on the wall and saw two orange cat ears sitting on top of her head. She looked over to Amanda to see a pair of white ears already situated at the top of her head with a matching tail twitching behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was speechless. All she could do was just stand there in shock at what just happened. She was brought back to her senses when she heard her stomach growling. \"So what are we going to eat if you spent all this time setting this up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat food, of course! It's my favorite brand, Meow Mix! Don't worry. The second change is appetite and it happens pretty much right after the first one. The rest usually take place while you're asleep.\" Amanda walked over to one of the food bowls, got down on all fours, and started eating. \"Come on over and try some. I'm sure you'll find it delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy found herself moving towards the food almost without noticing. Soon, she was standing right in front of the bowl. She crouched down and picked up one piece, hesitantly putting it in her mouth. After just one taste, her hunger overcame her and she started scarfing down as much as she could. She wanted to stop, but it was so good and she was so hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had finished their meal, they got ready to go to sleep. That is, until Amanda got up and went into the kitchen for a moment. She returned with a couple of child gates and placed them in front of the stairs and in the kitchen doorway. \"Don't want your cat's curiosity getting the best of you. Might wanna take off your clothes too. The extreme physical changes start tonight. Don't want your clothes getting ruined.\" So they stripped down and Amanda curled up on the rug like a cat while Stacy layed down on the couch.</span></div></div>",

It was a rustle and a soft 'mew'. There were no cats in the neighbourhood, so she thought she must've imagined it. \"Oh, because I was talking to Amanda about cats,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small wind came up, The clouds changed shape. She kept gazing at the sky - and, much to her astonishment, the clouds re-arranged themselves till they looked like a cat in repose. Again, she thought she heard a soft 'mew'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was nervous. She turned to go indoors, to find Amanda standing at the door, holding a tray with two plates on it.

As Stacy ate the meal, she discovered that she was getting more and more confused by her surroundings. The tree leaves looked like cats to her, and the wind sounded like constant mewing. She saw cats every time she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Stacy didn't realize it, her thoughts towards cats were beginning to change. While she had always been more of a dog person, now the thought of a dog made her feel almost... afraid. Whenever she heard a bark from the neighbour's yard, she wanted to turn and run inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd other things about her personality and habits were changing as well. Using cutlery felt wrong to her, and sitting walking on two legs made her uncomfortable.

She was sipping from a glass filled with a brown liquid. On the coffee table in front of her, was a two-liter plastic bottle labeled \"MOXIE\".  She'd heard of it - one of her classmates was originally from and swore by the stuff, but Stacy had thought it was nasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Amanda\", she said, \"I'm sorry about being so snotty before, I didn't mean to be so rude to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite alright, Stacy\", said Amanda. \"There's no need for us to be enemies, and I won't 'cramp your style' any more than you have to. If you want to call some of your friends over, I won't object.  Just no boys, please. I know you're a big girl, but even 'big girls' make mistakes. Believe me, that's the voice of experience speaking.  Anyway, if you'll excuse me,  I should go get dinner ready. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she turned off the TV, and walked out into the kitchen.  Stacy watched her go, and then looked down at the bottle on the table. she suddenly felt an overwhelming urge  to take a swig from it.  She'd always hated the stuff, but now there was nothing she wanted more than to have a mouthful of the stuff.  Checking to make sure that Amanda wasn't in sight, she picked the bottle up and took a swig of it, then hastily put the bottle down. Ugh! It was as nasty as she remembered it being.  Why had she wanted it so badly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the phone and called three of her friends, inviting them over.  Then she headed back up to her room.  In the kitchen, Amanda smiled. She knew full well that Stacy had taken a drink of her soda.  She'd have been disappointed if she hadn't, since she had placed a spell on the bottle. so that anyone who saw it would feel compelled to drink from it. Stacy, of course, had not noticed that she'd never actually seen Amanda drink from the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The apology was a nice try, Stacy</i>, thought Amanda, <i>but you're not getting off so easily.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacy went up the stairs to her room, her fee began to feel really uncomfortable and sore, to the  point where she could barely walk.  When she got to her room and pulled off her shoes. she noticed that her feet under her socks looked oddly distorted.  When she pulled off her socks, she gasped in shock - her feet looked like, like, hands. sort of. but hands with wrinkly brownish skin, and think brown hair on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's happening to me?  They almost look like a chimp's feet!</i>  She remembered what Amanda had said. Could she have had something to do with this?  What had she done to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, the doorbell rang.

Scattered here and there on plinths were granite statues of various kinds of people, most of whom looked distressed. Amanda realized that she was standing on a plinth herself, but before she could move, her feet turned to stone.  The petrification spread up her body, and within seconds, Amanda was a granite stature, there to serve as an eternal warning to anyone who would dare to cross Clotilde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotilde collected Amanda's things, and then left. She ignored the enchanted bottle of soda - it had no effect on her.  Up in her room, Stacy was unaware of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even now, her friends were approaching her house.  It was a peculiar coincidence that Stacy's three friends were all also named \"Stacy\" and had family names that started with \"M\", just as she did. They had become friends as much because they always ended up next to each other in school.  In addition to herself, Stacy Madison, there were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Stacy Matsui: small, but tough, the undisputed \"boss\" of the group<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Stacy McDonough: a fiery, argumentative redhead, and something of a wisecracker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Stacy Makarov:  a stereotypical tall, blonde, Slavic beauty, quiet, but quite strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause they all had the same first name and last initial, they tended to call each other by their last names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them pulled up in front of the Madison house in Matsui's car.  They piled out and walked up to the front door, which was open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that all about?\", asked McDonough. \"You think something's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah\", said Matsui, \"Madison probably left it open again. Think how many times we've had to listen to her mother yell at her about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsui opened the door, and went into the house. The first thing she noticed was the bottle of soda on the coffee table. Before she knew what was happening, she'd raced over, and taken a swig from the bottle. McDonough pulled the bottle from her hands and  took a drink herself, followed by Makarov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that was strange\", said Matsui. \"I literally could not stop myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said McDonough. \"That stuff was nasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where Madison is\", said Matsui. \"Hey, Madison, are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, is that you?\", came Stacy Madison's voice from upstairs. \"Come up to my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends went up to Madison's room.  Madison was lying on her bed, covered by a sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Amanda didn't do anything to you?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Amanda?\", asked Matsui.\"There's on one downstairs. What's wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is happening to me, and I think she did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison pulled the sheet up and exposed her legs and feet, which were fully transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three gasped in shock.  Matsui recovered first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you?\", she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison told them the story of her encounter with Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what, you think she's a witch and put a chimp curse on you?\", asked McDonough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what else could it be?\", asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", said McDonough. \"Maybe she drugged you with chimp DNA, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DNA doesn't work that way, McDonough\", said Matsui.  \"Madison, could she have drugged you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if there was something in the soda I stole\", said Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\", said Matsui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there was a bottle of Moxie she left out. I had this overwhelming urge to take a drink from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But WE all drank from that!\", said Matsui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY FEET!\", screamed  Makarov.  She was wearing open-toed sandals, and the other three could see that she now had chimp feet, as well.  Matsui and McDonough suddenly realized that their own feet felt cramped in their shoes. They pulled off their footwear, and saw that their feet had changed, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,  God, it's happening to us, too!\", said McDonough, \"What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up a minute\", said Matsui, \"I've got to - got to...arrrr!\"  She began tearing off her clothes. As if a switch had been flipped, McDonough and Makarov did likewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsui pulled her cellphone out off her jeans pocket, then threw it away in frustration when she realized that she no longer knew how to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", she said. \"We're going to search this house, find this Amanda, and somehow make her undo this. Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three members of her troop followed her obediently. Stacy Madison now was walking on all fours. already her hands were beginning to change, and dark hair was growing on her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome didn't find Amanda, as she was now where they would never find here.

She began to peel and eat one, making contented grunts as she ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsui looked at her, half in alarm that she was exhibiting such chimp-like behavior, and half in annoyance that she wasn't sharing. She grabbed the remaining bananas, took one for herself and distributed the others to McDonough and Makarov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends ate contentedly, until Matsui shook her head and said, \"Geez, we gotta do something fast.\" Madison's whole torso had changed, and the other three's torsos were starting to transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Amanda's out in the back yard\", said McDonough. \"We haven't checked there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\", said Matsui. \"Let's go look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't go outside naked\", said Makarov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think we've got worse things to worry about?\", said Matsui. \"Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome went to the back door and looked outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see her\", said Makarov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on\", said Matsui. \"Let's look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved into the yard and looked around, but found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison\", asked Matsui, \"Do you have any idea where Amanda might have gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - ah - ah - I dooo...\", said Madison, a distressed look crossing her face. \"Hoooo!  Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo-hoo HOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged apologetically, pointed at her throat, and shook her head. She was finding it harder and harder to think, the rennants of her humanity were fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsui sighed, and patted Madison's shoulder amiably.  At that moment, a neighbor's dog barked, startling them. Instinctively,  the Stacys ran and climbed into the branches of an oak tree at the back of the yard. When they had caught their breath, they turned and looked at Stacy Madison, whose head had begun to change. Her hair darkened, her forehead sloped back, and her jaw jutted outward. Within a few minutes, there was no sign that she'd ever been human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you guys\", said Matsui. \"Madison's gone full chimp. I'm srry, but I don't see any way out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's gonna happen to us?\", asked Makarov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we're lucky, someone will spot us and call Animal Control, and they'll trank us and take us in.  They'll go nuts trying to figure out where we came from, and then eventually they'll ship us off to some  zoo or wildlife preserve, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, cheer up, Mak\", said McDonough. \"Maybe there'll be some nice boy chimps there! We'll finally see some action!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But our families won't know what happened to us\", said Makarov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a point\", said Matsui. \"They'll find our clothes in Madison's room, but no sign of us. It'll be a real little puzzle. They'll never guess what really happened to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends remained in the tree as their transformations completed.  Soon, they had no memory of their previous lives, or that they had ever been anything other than chimps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there was another visitor to the Madison house.

She also knew that Stacy's parents were away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Looks like Stacy left the front open again</i>, she thought. <i>I'd best have a word with her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe parked her patrol car in front of the Madison house, and walked up and looked in the door.

Looking through, she found ID's for the four Stacys. So, where were they?  Mary sat down on Stacy's bed to think. Presumably they weren't running around naked.  Maybe they were out back sunbathing?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, my feet are killing me!</i>, she thought. <i>Well, no one's around, so...</i>  Mary pulled off her shoes and socks and then gasped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the Hell is happening to my feet?  Was it that soda? Was there something in it? I'd better call this in.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary swiftly realized that she no longer remember <i>how</i> to call anything in! She was distracted by a sudden urge to strip herself naked.  <i>What's gotten into me? I've got to figure this out! I've never believed in magic, but what else could this be? Nana used to say she believed in it, used to tell me all those stories about voodoo and stuff growing up in Lousiana. I always figured she was messing with me, but maybe she wasn't. I better keep looking around</i> She stood up, and found it awkward walking on her new feet. As she tried to walk, the urge to strip grew stronger and stronger, until she finally gave in. <i>God, I'm going to hear about this from the Chief! Say, maybe this is what happened to the four Stacys! That would explain the clothes on the floor.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary searched the house and found nothing. By the time she was done, her legs had transformed completely. She decided to look outside. She loped out into the yard.  The four Stacys were still in the oak tree. They noticed a strange female coming out of the house and hooted threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary noticed them and said, \"Stacy, is that you?\"  The Stacys no longer understood human language, and so chattered threateningly.  Mary felt exposed on the ground, and clambered up a maple tree on the other side of the yard. She fought down the urge to chatter back at them. She sat in the tree, trying to think about what to do, but as her transformation continued, soon all she was thinking about was what to do about the four unfriendly female chimps in the tree across the yard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, another visitor came to the Madison house.

Her nosiness got the better of her, and she parked her car a respectful distance behind Mary's cruiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'ll just take a quick peek in</i>, she thought. <i>If anyone spots me, I'll just say that I'm a friend of the family.</i>  This was basically true - she and Stacy's mother had gone to high school together and still chatted when they saw each other.  Agnes looked into the house and saw the bottle of soda. As the others had before her, she was compelled to go in and take a sip of it.  Hearing a noise form the back yard, she was spooked and ran out of the house, and back to her car. It was only when she was in her car that she realized that she'd taken the soda with her.  Well, she wasn't going back in, so she slipped it in with her groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got home, her feet were killing her, and she was feeling an irrational urge to strip herself naked.

He was tall with brown hair, and looked to be about 27 years old, although he was a good deal older than that. He was dressed like a British nobleman from the 1830's, except for a large, blue backpack that he was wearing.  His name was Burgess,and he was a sorcerer who had come to Earth in order to find a birthday present for his sister, Gwenhwyfar.  The sudden burst of magical activity had drawn him to Stacy Madison's hometown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, Burgess quickly cast a spell that would deter anyone else from entering the room. He quickly assessed the situation. Someone had cast a spell to transform some mundanes into chimpanzees. What was the name of that one witch who liked turning her victims into chimps? Mandy? Amanda? Miranda? Something like that, anyhow.  Why she was transforming all these people, he had no idea. She didn't seem to be around here, anywhere.  Well, after all, it was none of his business. He had to find a present for Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen liked to collect dolls, or - to be precise - mundanes who had been transformed into dolls. Transformed humans were favored children's toys in the magical realms. Some people said that at age two hundred, Gwen was too old to still be collecting dolls, but Burgess was in no position to criticize. He had a collection of soldiers form various worlds and places, himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to him that a policewoman doll would be a good present for Gwen. He cast a spell, and Alicia found herself being forced to stand rigidly at attention. Burgess cast another spell, and her body began to transform, shrinking and hardening, turning into a hard substance like plastic.  She could not move or speak or even breathe, It was just as well that she didn't need to breathe, anymore. The shrinking stopped when she was six inches tall. Burgess picked up the newly-made policewoman action figure up and spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid, dear, my sister always takes excellent care of her collection. She never gives away her toys or sells them. In fact, she even has it written in her will that when she dies, her dolls are to be set free and sent to a nice place to live.  So, don't worry, you'll be stuck like this for eight, nine hundred years, tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia wanted to scream in anger and fear, but found that she no longer could. Burgess materialized a brightly-wrapped gift bx around her and stuck her in his backpack. It occurred to him that he hadn't added any new soldiers to <i>his</i> collection in quite a while.   He had seen in Alicia's mind that she had a sister in the US Army.  He decided to collect Staff Sergeant Bridget Wu next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the now fully-transformed chimps around him.

Whoever she was, someone would probably come looking for her eventually, and a little time as a chimp might teach her to be a little more careful.   The spell he had cast would compel the chimps to remain on the baseball field until the mundane authorities could come and do whatever they liked with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an afterthought, he cast a spell erasing any photos or video footage that might exist of the transformations.  Technically, people on backward worlds like this weren't supposed to know that magic existed. The rule wasn't always enforced perfectly, but ask for hassle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurgess teleported himself to the Army base where Bridget Wu was serving. He turned her into a doll and took her for his collection. Then he returned to his home in the magical realms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the town he had left behind was in an uproar.  The apparent disappearance of so many people ( including several police officers) and the appearance of so many chimps caused a sensation like nothing else in the town's history.  Naturally, the family, friends and colleagues of the missing people were distraught, and the intense search that ensued soon went from statewide to nationwide to worldwide, but no trace of the missing people was found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe near-simultaneous appearance of thirty-two chimps whose provenance could not be determined only added to the strangeness of the situation.  Government experts took the chimps into custody, and conspiracy theories abounded.  Some people even guessed something very close to the truth - some people even said they had seen some of the missing people turning into chimps - but few people took <i>them</i> seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGovernment scientists examined the chimps thoroughly. They were normal, healthy chimps. They weren't carrying any unusual diseases, nor did they have anything implanted in them.  Several of the females were found to be newly pregnant, but given the promiscuous nature of chimps, this wasn't considered to be especially strange.  The main odd thing about them was that no one could work out where they came from. No zoo or wildlife park was missing any chimps, and there were no traces of any chimp-smuggling rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had gotten all the information they could from examining the chimps, arrangements were made to find homes for them at appropriate facilities around the country. Of course, the investigation as to where they had come from continued, as did the search for the missing people and the investigation into what link there might be between the missing people and the chimps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe better part of three months passed. When Gwendolyn Blackthorn (Wendy White's real name) failed to report in, her sponsors sent a representative to look for her.  After some searching, the representative in question, Helga Brightstar, found Wendy at a wildlife sanctuary in Florida. Helga teleported Wendy back to a hotel room that she had reserved, and then transformed her back to her human form.  She looked like her old self, only the curve of her nearly three-months baby bump indicating what she had been through. Helga magicked up a maternity dress for her, gave her a glass of water, and then said, \"Alright, Gwendolyn Blackthorn, what happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy told her what she knew.

They sent an agent out to talk to Gwen Blackthorn (a.k.a. Wendy White).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Helga had debriefed her, Gwen had returned home to decide what to do next.  She hadn't intended to have a child just yet, but she had decided to keep her baby.  Her mother was always after her to produce a grandchild, now she would get her wish.  There was no such thing as \"half-breeds\" among the magical folk. The magical inheritance was passed down through the mother.  The child of a magical father and a mundane mother would be a mundane, and the child of a mundane father and a magical mother would be magical as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no stigma because her child's father was a mundane (Gwen didn't even know who the father <b>was</b>!). Gwen's own father had been a mundane man that her mother had used as a sex toy and later discarded.  The only people who worried about things like that were the magical nobility, but none of them would be likely to marry the child of a low-born sorceress like her anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent who visited Gwen was a youngish woman  - only about 250 years old, not much older than Gwen herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mother Blackthorn\", she said. \"I'm Sister Helena Darkblood, I just had a few questions about what happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>Mother</b> Blackthorn\"?</i>, thought Gwen. <i>Goddess, that makes me feel four hundred years old.

She had placed a spell on a bottle of some mundane beverage, compelling anyone who saw it to drink from it, after which they would be turned into a chimpanzee, while at the same time being compelled to strip themselves naked.  Amanda was known as a low-level troublemaker who specialized in transforming people into chimpanzees. What she had done was not technically illegal. The law was that unclaimed mundanes like the people of Earth were considered to be a common natural resources. Mages were allowed to use them in reasonable amounts, as long as they did not disrupt the mundanes' society.  However, something unexpected had happened to  Amanda....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)Her Grace, Clotilde Scyscream, Countess of Mergerestrith, found Amanda at Stacy Madison's home and abducted her.  Doubtless Amanda was now one of the countless marble statues that decorated Clotilde's estate, the fate of just about everyone who crossed Clotilde.. Helena frowned at this. Technically, if Clotilde had a grievance against Amanda (which Helena was quite prepared to believe), she should have summoned one of Helena's colleagues and had Amanda hauled before a judge, rather than simply taken the law into her own hands. In theory, even a noble like Clotilde wasn't above the law. In practice, of course, Influential types like her could get away with things that commoners could not.  Well, it wasn't Helena's decision about what to do about that, if anything. She'd merely present the fact to her superiors, and let them decide. At any rate, Clotilde had then left, without taking any interest in what Amanda had been doing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)Several additional mundanes had come across the enchanted beverage and been transformed by it, as had Gwendolyn Blackthorn, a young sorceress visiting Earth to study the native culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)Lord Burgess Stormdancer, Baron of Greymatter, had been visiting, apparently looking for some mundanes to acquire for his own purposes. At any rate, he had visited Stacy's home town - probably drawn there by the magical activity - and transformed one of the locals into a doll and then giftwrapped her. He had then caused the transformed people to gather at one location, presumably so they would be easier for the locals to deal with them.  <i>Nice of him</i>, she thought, <i>It would have been even nicer if he'd let us know what had happened there.</i> At any rate, he had then gone to a nearby military installation and collected another mundane, before returning home. Well, nothing he had done was wrong, <i>per se</i>. He'd only taken two mundanes, and had done it without leaving any evidence of what had happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena reported back to her superiors, who decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She cast a spell to make people see her as Wendy's \"Aunt Mary\", come to collect \"Wendy's\" things.  Gwen entered the house, gathering a few of her \"mundane\" possessions.to keep as souvenirs. She had a backpack that was bigger on the inside just a Burgess had.  She then gathered the magical items that we hidden around the house where no mortal would find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she'd lived on Earth as Wendy, she'd made several mundane friends, five of whom she decided to keep a s souvenirs as well.  Given what had happened recently, she had to be discreet about it. She didn't want Helena or one of her colleagues coming after <i>her</i>.   Gwen planted a thought in their minds to go on a camping trip in the mountains together, at a certain spot Gwen had found., So, it was the a week later, they were all gathered in the woods together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Margaret Heller, a friendly woman in her late 30's, she had been Wendy's boss in the office Wendy had worked in as a cover for her studies.. With her, was her adolescent daughter, Cindy, slim and coltish, she was no longer really a girl, but but not yet quite a woman.  Cindy dreamed of a being a ballerina,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Georgia McDonald, a co-worker of Wendy's. She was all woman, but the phrase \"tall, dark and handsome\" still suited her well, and she looked good in a tuxedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Miki Nogura, a short, cute, intelligent <i>meganekko</i>. She was an English lit student who was working her way through college as a waitress in Wendy's favorite diner. The two had become friends over discussions of literature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Anne Horvath, another colleague of Wendy's, a cheerful wisecracker.  She had brought her eight year-old twins, David and Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Anong Chailangka, a woman of Thai descent who worked at the local library. Quiet most of the time, once she got started on a favorite subject, she would talk your ear off. She had been Wendy's best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen teleported to their campsite, and showed herself to them as Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy!\", said Margaret. \"B-but...you disappeared! Where have you been? Were the others with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen gestured, and the mundanes immediately went into trances, standing stock-still at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd decided to use the five adults as servants, so she dressed them to suit their new roles:  Margaret would be her chief maid and housekeeper, Georgia would be her butler, Miki would be her cook,  Anne would be her nanny, and Anong would be her body-servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were properly outfitted  (Georgia looked so dashing as a butler!), Gwen transformed them into automata - sort of robots powered by magic rather than science.  While they looked, sounded and felt human,  they were as durable as if they were made of diamond. They could last indefinitely, would never age, and would never require rest or food.  She programmed them with all the information they would need for their duties, and to be happy and fulfilled in their new roles.  (She wasn't one of those \"mundane rights\" nuts who thought that mundanes should have the same rights as mages, but she didn't believe in being cruel to them, either. If you were going to enslave a mundane, you should at least alter their minds so they liked it.)   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd never had servants before, but with a kid on the way they would come in handy. At her command, they marched over and stored themselves in her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked at the three children, and thought about what to do with them. She looked at Cindy. The girl was achingly beautiful, as girls often were at that age.  Well, Gwen would make sure that she never aged out if it.  She dressed Cindy in a pink ballet outfit, and then turned her into an automaton. Now she would be young and beautiful forever.  Gwen shrank Cindy down to five inches tall. and materialized a base under her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dance\", said Gwen. Music played and Cindy pirouetted and twirled gracefully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\", said Gwen. The music stopped and Cindy froze in place.  Gwen had programmed Cindy so that when she danced, she was filled with joy at the thought of dancing for her mistress.  When she was at rest, she was filled the knowledge that she was loved and admired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen decided she would be keeping Cindy for herself, so she would give David and Donna to her daughter-to-be. (She had use dher magic to determine her child's sex.)  She turned David and Donna into automata, making David into a teddy bear, and Donna into a doll. She stored them in her bag, and then called down an avalanche, covering over their campsite and sweeping their camper into a nearby river. She made it look as much as possible like an accident. She cast a spell over the area so that any investigators who came would never question that it was an accident. Then she went home to begin constructing a nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so...</span></div></div>",

A few months later, she gave birth to a healthy daughter, that she named Ariel. Young Ariel had black hair, and features that favored her father (who, as it happened, was the college trackman Andy Borelli, although she would never knew him). Her transformed friends and their children remained in the Blackthorn family for thousands of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda remained a statue in Clotilde's garden for  the rest of Clotilde's life, which was another five hundred  thirty-seven years. When Clotilde passed away, her heirs sold off the statues in her garden.  Amanda was sold to a collector named Perceval Rabbitstorm, who was unaware of her origins. She remained in Perceval's collections for another two hundred nine years, when he gave Amanda to his young niece, Charlotte.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte, practicing her transformation spells, changed Amanda from a statue into a sword, and gave her to her brother, Tycho, who was a would-be warrior.  Tycho wielded Amanda in battle for a hundred years before, tiring of bloodshed, he retired to a farm and transformed Amanda into a plowshare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda did yeoman service as a plowshare for three hundred years before being sold off along with a lot of other used farm equipment.  She was purchased by a wannabe antiques dealer who intended to clean the equipment up for re-sale, but who got lazy and never got around to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, Amanda was purchased as-is by Jehanne Blackthorn, Ariel's daughter, who was unaware of Amanda's connection to her grandmother's life.  Jehanne, like Charlotte, used Amanda to practice her transformations. She changed Amanda into a trumpet, which she gave to her nephew, Humphrey, a budding musician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumphrey became a legendary trumpeter, and played Amanda before cheering crowds all over the magical realms, for nine hundred years.  When Humphrey passed away, Amanda was buried with him, as no one else was deemed worthy to play the master's trumpet.  There Amanda lies to this day, hoping that maybe someday a grave-robber and/or archaeologist will come along and she might yet be returned to her true form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wu sisters remained in the collections of Burgess and his sister for the rest of their lives. When their owners passed away, they were returned to human form and sent to live out their human lives in a special colony for former toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the humans who had been transformed into chimps, they lived out happy chimp lives in the various zoos and wildlife refuges where they had been sent. The females all gave birth to several offspring and, after the collapse of human civilization on Earth, became the ancestors of several chimp populations that prospered in various regions of North America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Even as she watched, the empty bottle became full again, at which point she compulsively took a swig from it, and soon found herself changing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the stationhouse, an ancient-looking car pulled up. The driver was Elmer Pardiggle, a lanky, dark-haired eighteen year-old senior at the local high school.  Elmer was a genius. This was not merely his own opinion, all of his teachers felt the  same way. He was good in all subjects, but he had a particular gift for machinery. He could take apart and rebuild just about any machine he'd ever seen.  Despite his genius, Elmer was the despair of his teachers, as, in addition to being a genius, he was also lazy and a bit antisocial. He got some of the highest grades in his class even though he made only a half-hearted effort in school. Time and again, various teachers had admonished him that if only he put in a real effort, he could easily be class valedictorian and on top of the Honor Society. As if he wanted something like that! To impress the sort of idiots that lived in this town meant nothing to him. Instead, Elmer put his energies into various pranks, large and small. He prided himself on the fact that he'd never gotten caught.  He was working on a really big one at the moment. His \"magnum opus\", as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, he let his passenger out of the car.  Said passenger, hight Tommy Jellyby, was a short, squat fellow who was a classmate of Elmer's, the only classmate whose friendship Elmer made any effort to cultivate.  Tommy was a bland fellow, and dumber than all but the dumbest rocks, and easily manipulated.  This made him very useful to someone like Elmer, and Elmer used him a lot.  However, Elmer knew that even a moron like Tommy might eventually notice if their friendship was a one-way street, so from time to time, Elmer magnanimously did small favors for him. Today, he was performing one such favor.  Tommy wanted to go to the police station to report that his bicycle had been stolen, and Elmer had agreed to drive him there. Elmer saw no reason to go into the station himself, and was planning to go over to the Food-E-Mart to get himself some snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just meet me over there when you're done.\", he'd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Elmer had pulled away, Tommy had gone to enter the police station. T his surprise, when he opened the station door, several chimps came loping out. He looked around inside tentatively, and saw several more chimps, and what looked like people who were half-chimp! Unfortunately, he also caught sight of the bottle,  and immediately ran over and took a swig from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Elmer had completed his purchases and was sitting in his car, contemplating the mental and moral shortcomings of everyone that wasn't him, a common pastime of his. He looked up and saw Tommy coming towards his car, a look of great distress on his homely face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the Hell is that on his feet?</i>, thought Elmer as Tommy approached the open driver's side window of Elmer's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Tommy?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA torrent of words came pouring out of Tommy's mouth, as he told Elmer what had happened. \"And see, it's happening to me, too!\" He lifted up his left foot for Elmer to inspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElmer looked over the proffered appendage, and thought quickly. He instantly believed Tommy's story. Tommy was too stupid to lie, and anyway, even as Elmer was watching, black hair was beginning to sprout on Tommy's lower legs. On top of that, he'd already heard reports on the radio about people spotting chimps around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen\", he said, \"We need to get you to a hospital, but we need whatever's in that bottle so they can figure out what it is. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Tommy. But if I bring it out here and you see it, it might affect you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right\", said Elmer. He upended the plastic bag his snacks had come in. \"Put it in this, and when you come out, I'll pop the trunk, and you can put it in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Tommy, and loped off back to the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy returned ten minutes later, now stark naked, and with his legs completely transformed. Elmer popped the trunk. Tommy put the bag in the trunk, then slammed it shut. As Tommy got into the passenger seat, Elmer asked him, \"Tommy, why are you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't help it\", said Tommy. \"Just had to. The others in the station were like that, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElmer drove in the general direction of the hospital as the change spread up Tommy's torso.  Fortunately, Tommy wasn't bright enough to notice that Elmer was taking a circuitously route. Finally, when they were at a stop sign, Tommy leaped out the car's open window, loped towards the nearest tree, then swiftly climbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just as I'd hoped</i>, thought Elmer. <i>Now no one knows I have this. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home, he looked around to make sure no one was watching. None of his family should be home at this hour. He got out and looked at the trunk of his car.  He'd thought it over while he was driving. Whatever this was, it had to be magic. He didn't like the idea of magic, but he felt he had to accept a thing that was true even if he didn't like it, and there was no scientific explanation that fit the facts. So, how did this magic work?  Tommy had said that he'd felt compelled to drink from the bottle that minute that he'd seen it. Was sight the key? When Tommy'd carried the bag back to Elmer's car, several people had passed him without trying to grab the bag away from him. So, maybe you had to see whatever it was to be compelled to drink it. It was a risk, but  for the sake of the prank he was contemplating, it was a chance he had to take.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He went into his house, and fortunately, no one was home.  He went to his room and shoved the bag into the back of his closet under a carefully-arranged pile of detritus.  All the drive home, he was thinking about how he could use the bottle of magical whatever-it-was in a prank he'd been planning for quite some time. The problem was the fact the whoever saw the fluid was compelled to drink it.  So, if he used it in a prank, he wouldn't be able to watch it without being turned into a chimp himself, which he didn't want to do, even for an epic prank. Perhaps there was a range limitation? But how to test it? He thought about it a while, until an idea struck him. then, he went out and bought a small card table, some cardboard,  some tape and some red Solo cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning he got up before dawn and drove out to Outskirts Road. He parked his car out of sight, then quickly set up the card table, and taped a bit of cardboard to it.  Then he set a cup on it, and stepped  back and walked around the table. From one side, he couldn't see the cup, but from the other side, the cup was plainly visible.  Elmer returned to the blind side, and set the bag on the table. He closed his eyes, took the bottle out of the bag and, without opening his eyes, filled the cup, stopping when the weight of the cup told him it was full.  He put the bottle back in  the bag, and backed slowly away from the table, not opening his eyes until he was well back.  He then hid himself behind a tree where he could see the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElmer was relying on humans being creatures of habit.  While he didn't socialize with his classmates, he did sometimes listen to their gossip. thus, he had learned that two of his classmates, Susan Roper and Miriam Harper, jogged together along Outskirts Road at dawn every day.  He just hoped no one else would come along and spoil the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Elmer was in luck. Just as the sun was coming up, he saw Susan and  Miriam jogging up the road towards him, with Miriam's little dog in tow.  When they were about a hundred feet way, he saw Miriam gesture towards the table. so, they'd seen it. They jogged on as normal until they were about thirty feet away. At that point, the two began running as fast as they could, making a beeline for the table, so that the poor little dog could barely keep up with them. Susan got to the cup first, and took a big swig from it. Miriam caught up with her and wrenched the cup away, draining it completely, and then tossed it on the ground, where her dog began lapping at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElmer watched as the two girls stood around, talking concernedly to each other, obviously trying to work out what the point of it all was.  After a few minutes of this, Susan winced and removed her running shoes and athletic socks. Even in his hiding place, Elmer could hear her horrified scream, a scream soon echoed by Miriam. He watched as the two girls gave into the compulsion to strip their clothes off.  Elmer watched as they transformed, eventually taking to the trees, the little dog  - who seemed to be completely unaffected - ran after them barking.  Elmer emerged from his hiding place and gathered up the table,and carried it back to his car, throwing it and the bag with the bottle in it into his trunk.  Fortunately, no one else had come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, the compulsion takes effect when you're about thirty feet away</i>, he thought. <i>So I should be able to watch so long as I don't get too close. That means I can proceed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prank Elmer had in mind was one that he had been building towards for his entire high school career. Unlike most of his classmates, who either mocked or ignored him, Elmer had gone out of his way to befriend the school janitor, Mr. Peterson. Peterson had taken a bit of a shine to Elmer, and had shown him parts of the school that he could never have seen otherwise. By his sophomore year, Elmer knew how to get into any part of the school, and precisely how the alarm systems worked  He also had enough dirt on Peterson that he could blackmail the older man into ignoring any \"extracurricular activities\" that Elmer committed.  By his junior year, Elmer had his own set of keys to the school. By his senior year, he had conceived of his final, ultimate prank.  He had rigged the sprinkler system in the school's auditorium to spray a concoction of his own devising. nothing really toxic, but a noxious fluid that would act like itching powder on any skin it touched. He'd attached a reservoir to the sprinkler system, with a special valve that he controlled. That way, if the system went off before he was ready, it would merely spray water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one other thing that concerned him.  Would the contents of the bottle be enough to spray the whole auditorium?  Would the fluid work if it was diluted?  He went out and bought a bottle of water and an eye-dropper.  He got out the magic bottle, and with his eyes closed,  took a drop from the magic bottle and put it into the water bottle, then shook it up thoroughly.  All while working blind, he put the magic bottle and the eye-dropper away, and the water bottle into another bag.  The next day, he drove to the park, where many people liked to jog.  Waiting until no one was looking, and without looking himself, he set the bottle down where it would be seen and then turned around and didn't look back until he was thirty feet away.  He turned around just in time to see a young woman drinking from the bottle until her young male companion snatched it away from her and finished the bottle off.   Elmer watched as the two transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good</i>, he thought, <i>it works if it's diluted.  It really will work.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elmer knew that the next assembly was scheduled for the next Monday morning. Despite everything that had gone on in town, he knew that Principal Donner would stick to his schedule no matter what. Over the next few days, there was quite a stir in the town, resulting from the simultaneous disappearance of several dozen people (including a large percentage of the police force) and appearance of a similar number of chimps.  The mayor called in help from the state police and had as many of the chimps as possible humanely captured, while a special facility was kept to hold them while it was determined what to do about the situation.  Many members of the public came to conclusions very close to what had actually happened, but the official story was that the government was still looking into the situation. A few days went by without anymore disappearances.  That Saturday, Elmer snuck into the high school, leaving his car parked out of sight. He brought the bag with the bottle in it to the place where he had hidden the reservoir  that he had attached to the sprinkler system. It was hard to get at, but it was someplace that even Peterson never went, especially since Peterson wasn't all that dedicated to begin with.  He opened up the reservoir, closed his eyes, and began emptying the bottle into it. When the bottle was empty, he would open a valve that would let water into the reservoir . Very quickly, the weight of the bottle told him that it was empty, but, to his surprise, it suddenly felt heavy again, like it had re-filled itself.   It took all of his self-control not to open his eyes and look.  He let the bottle empty and re-fill until he was reasonably certain that the reservoir was just about full.  He waited until the bottle was empty, and quickly re-sealed it.  He did his best to make sure that everything was in place without opening his eyes, and then backed out of the crawlspace where the reservoir. Everything was set.  Elmer went home, and hid the bottle in his closet as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Monday morning, the announcement came to go to the auditorium for the assembly.   Elmer ducked into the boy's room, and waited until it was likely that everyone had gathered for the meeting.  He snuck out into the hall  and making sure that he wasn't seen and went and carefully went to the hall just outside the auditorium, and peeked in through the door's window, doing his best not to be seen.  He was reasonably certain that he was at a safe distance. Well, he wasn't going to back out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed the switch on his remote, and the sprinklers opened up, raining down brown fluid on the students and faculty below. Just about everyone ingested some of the fluid that fell on them. The few that didn't  found themselves to either lick it up off the floor or the bodies of the people around them.  Elmer watched gleefully as Principal Donner called for order after the downpour ended. This didn't last long as the assembled throng began to notice that something was wrong with their feet.  Elmer took a more than clinical interest when Mary-Sue Wanamaker, the busty blonde head of the cheerleading squad, gave into the urge to strip that seemed to inevitably accompany the transformation.  Elmer paid for his distraction when he felt a strong hand clamp down on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Mr. Pardiggle, what have you done now?\", said a menacing female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElmer whirled to see Cecily Hardacre, the hulking math teacher popularly known as \"the Amazon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", he said. \"Why are you out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now\", said Ms. Hardacre. \"Don't tel me a bright boy like you never noticed that one faculty member always stays out of assemblies just in case someone decided to get up to some mischief? Now, what have you - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by Sheila McNeill, a mousy bookworm, came racing out of the auditorium., She was stark naked and a chimp from the waist down. She was also dripping wet, covered with the brown fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, no, no, no, NO..</i>, thought Elmer, as he and Cecily were compelled to grab Sheila's arms and lick the fluid off of her chest.  Shrieking, Sheila broke free and ran off, the first of many to flee the auditorium. Elmer took his opportunity to flee the scene  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, you don't\", said Cecily, in hot pursuit. Elmer reached an empty classroom, where he gave in to the urge to get naked.  Cecily followed him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Pardiggle\", she said, even as she began removing her own clothing. \"I want answers, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", shrugged Elmer. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they transformed, Elmer told Cecily everything he had done. By the time, he had finished, the transformations had reached their throats.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the hoo-hoo-hoo whole story\", said Elmer.  \"Not that you can do..hoo-hoo-hoo!\" Elmer could no longer speak, and was finding it hard to think.  As their transformations completed, Elmer looked at the attractive female across from him, no longer remembering that she had been a math teacher, or even what a math teacher was.  Cecily looked back. Elmer approached her, and found her receptive. soon they were interacting in a way that neither of them would have imagined even a few minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, someone else would find the bottle</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The events at the high school caused a whole new uproar, especially after the first response teams that arrived on the scene soon vanished amid confused reports of more chimps appearing. Eventually, it occurred to someone to send in a specially-equipped robot, whose camera showed an empty auditorium with pools of an odd, brown fluid here and there on the floor.  The robot took a sample of the fluid. However, this led to the member of the analysis team who recovered the sample drinking it, and being transformed.  This in turn led to the first confirmation that the chimps were transformed humans. A tight lid was kept on this information, and the effort which was launched to recover all of the chimps still at large was publicly categorized as a humanitarian effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second, more careful recovery effort was made, and the carefully analyzed sample revealed itself to simply be a common enough carbonated beverage. The baffled authorities conferred, and three things resulted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)The high school auditiorium was thoroughly cleaned by robots, and then dismantled, its components interred in a concrete vault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)The rest of the building was searched, resulting in the discovery of Elmer's apparatus. However, since Elmer had been careful not to leave fingerprints or other incriminating evidence, and Peterson the janitor was among the transformed, nothing further was discovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)Emergency Federal funds were provided for the hasty construction of a chimp sanctuary. The town and the surrounding area had been scoured, and as far as could possibly be determined, no chimp had escaped capture.  While the sanctuary was under construction, the chimps were cared for as well as possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main problem, of course, was one of public relations. Many people had arrived at the conclusion that the chimps were the missing people, and were demanding custody of their transformed family members.  The government stonewalled this, and reassured everyone that the chimps would be taken care of and that the government would not rest in its efforts to retrieve their missing loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Elmer's thirteen year-old sister Emma was about to make a surprising discovery.  After the initial shock of her brother's disappearance, Emma, now in eighth grade,  had found that she wasn't all that broken up over it.  She and Elmer hadn't really gotten along all that well, and she found his absence somewhat less than heartrending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne afternoon, about two weeks after that events at the high school, Emma was at her home with her three closest friends, Diana Hayes, Ruth Jackson, and Fatima Al-Qadry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping me with this stuff, you guys\", she said. Her mother had requested that Emma go through and sort out her brother's things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't you mom afraid that we might find something 'personal' in here?\", asked. (By \"personal\", it was understood by them all that she meant \"pervy\".) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she never thought of it\", replied Emma. \"Frankly, I'm not sure that Elmer had a 'personal' life, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sorting through Elmer's desk and dresser and finding nothing of interest, Emma next decided to tackle his closet. After some more of the same, her hand felt a bottle buried under a pile of books. Could her brother have hidden booze in here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma pulled out the bottle, and just had time to read the word \"MOXIE\" on the label when she found herself opening it and taking a swig. Before she could say anything, Diana snatched the bottle away from her, and then Ruth and Fatima did likewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck, you guys?\", said Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, E\", said Diana. \"I literally couldn't stop myself.\"  Ruth and Fatima murmured in agreement. She set the bottle aside and resumed work, but soon noticed that her feet felt...odd. Somehow, she had a horrible suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her back on the others, Emma pulled off her shoes and socks. Her blood ran cold as she saw her transformed feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, you three\", she said. \"Take off your shoes and socks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken by surprise, her friends obeyed, and then squealed in greater surprise when they saw their transformed feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God!\", said Ruth. \"It's true! The chimps are people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bottle!\", said Diana. \"Does that mean your brother was behind what happened at the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd bet my life on it\", said Emma. \"This smells just like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\", asked Fatima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn into chimps, I guess\", replied Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth had taken out her cellphone, but was looking at it in dismay. \"I - I don't remember how to use this!\", she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But - but what are we going to do?\", repeated Fatima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wasn't the genius Elmer had been, but she was a quick thinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what we're gonna do\" said Emma, a determined gleam in her eye. We're going next door to visit Veronica. If we're going down, she's going down with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica Wilton was Emma's next door neighbor, and her arch-enemy since kindergarten. Emma despised Veronica, and Veronica despised her right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you three\", said Emma, as she stood up and left the room. The other three followed obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the kitchen, they saw Emma's college age older sister, Elaine, and her three friends, Nan, Jan and Fran,  all studying (i.e., \"gossiping\").  Elaine looked up and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you four losers going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma glared. She had been prepared to spare her sister, but what the heck, might as well give Mom and Dad a clean slate.  She held out the bottle and smirked as Elaine and her friends all drank from it, and then grabbed it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" demanded Elaine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out soon enough!\", shrieked Emma, who ran out the back door, followed by her three friends, and, in a minute, Elaine and her three friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma found herself fighting an urge to strip naked, which urge Diana and Ruth were already giving in to. Only super-shy Fatima was still resisting.  Emma looked towards Veronica's yard - JACKPOT! Veronica was sitting outside with her three airhead buddies, Tiffany, Britney and Amethyst. Emma held the bottle over the fence, and said, Ohhh, Ver-RON-ic-aaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica looked up, angrily. Before she could speak, she and her three friends were racing towards the fence that separated their yards. Veronica snatched the bottle from Emma's and drank from it, followed by her three companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's the heck is going on?\", she asked, before suddenly noticing Diana and Ruth, whose legs were now completely transformed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma explained the situation to them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're full off crap!\", said Veronica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check your feet\", smiled Emma, beginning to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica pulled of her shoes and socks, and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You miserable...\", she glared at Emma with a mixture of venomous hatred and grudging admiration. Then, as if coming to a decision, she grabbed the bottle from the bewildered Amethyst, and went to the back door of her own home, and yelled inside:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, EVERYONE! YOU GOTTA COME OUT HERE AND SEE THIS! IT'S AMAZING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, her 16 year-old sister, Virginia, her 19 year-old brother, Victor and their eight year-old sister, Vanessa came trooping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all the noise about, brat?\", said Victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica held the bottle up to her siblings, and laughed as they drank from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm the family 'disappointment', am I?\", said Veronica. \"Let's see how disappointed Mom and Dad are now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, she's even more messed up than I thought</i>, thought Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine collared her sister.  \"You little jerk\", she said. \"I can see wanting to get at that little twerp Veronica, but why'd you do this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to let you off\", replied  Emma. \"But then you made the 'losers\" crack. You have no idea how mad that kind of stuff makes me. I'd say maybe you'll know better next time, but I don't think there will be a next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bickering continued for a time until they were all transformed, and then several of the older female chimps began competing for Victor's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, someone else found the bottle. It was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their colleagues sent for a robot, which collected the bottle and stored it out of sight.  The two transformees were collected and the bottle was taken to a lab where it carefully tested. Not carefully enough, as the initial research team were soon transformed as well.  Subsequent, more careful research with volunteers who were warned what might happen to them gave some interesting results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn agent who had lost the use of her legs in an accident was exposed to the bottle in the hopes that they could see what the effects were on someone who could not approach the bottle unaided. To her astonishment, she found the use of her legs restored as she was compelled to use them to walk to where the bottle was, drinking from it before anyone could stop her.  A second experiment with another paraplegic agent yielded similar results. More investigation taught the researchers  a lot about how the fluid affected people, but nothing about how it worked. Ultimately, the researchers had to accept that they could come up with no better answer than \"magic\". In the end, it was decided to lock the bottle away in a  secure vault in a secret installation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe better part of three months went by, and Wendy's report in was overdue. After a week with no word from her, another witch, Prudence Grey, was sent to investigate.  She fought the chimp who had been Wendy and temporarily restored her human intellect and power of speech. Wendy explained what had happened.  Prudence thanked her and apologized that she couldn't help her further right now.  Even as Wendy shrugged in understanding, her intellect reverted to that of a chimp.  Prudence easily found the bottle that Wendy had mentioned - mundane security was nothing to her - and took it away, replacing it with a bottle of regular soda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrudence took the bottle and reported to her superiors.  It was quickly determined to be the work of Amanda Darkwind, who was known to be the prisoner of Lady Clotilde Overstar, part of the witch nobility. Prudence was sent to seek permission from Coltilde to question Amanda. Prudence wasn't too happy about this. In theory, the nobility were subject to the same laws as the commonality. In practice, the nobility could get away pretty much whatever they wanted. If Prudence angered Clotilde, she could end up joining Amanda as a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrudence followed all the protocol in requesting an audience with Clotilde, and received an affirmative reply two weeks later. When she arrived at Clotilde's estate, a six tall penguin who had once been a young male witch who had irritated Clotilde showed her in to see Clotilde, where she obsequiously requested permission to question Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One wonders why anyone would wish to speak to her, if it's permitted to ask\", which Prudence realized was her way of saying, \"Tell me why you want to talk to her and I'll decide if I'll humor you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to question regarding one of her manifold sins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One could believe her capable of any infamy, what is she supposed to have done?\", asked Clotilde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has disrupted a protected mundane world, in a way not seen since the time of Priscilla the Cruel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" said Clotilde.  \"Then you must speak to her. Follow me.\"  Clotilde led Prudence into her garden of statuary.When the reached Amanda, Clotilde gestured, and Amanda's humanity was restored from the waist up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda avoided Clotilde's gaze, but cast a quick glance of recognition at Prudence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will answer Goodwitch Grey's questions, truthfully and completely\", said Clotilde, in the tone of voice in which one might address a dog which had soiled the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda quickly told Prudence what had happened, possessing enough self-preservation to omit the fact that if Clotilde hadn't abducted her the situation would not have gotten so far out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\", said Prudence. \"And what type of spell did you use?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A temporary transformative\", replied Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\", said Prudence. A temporary transformative was used by witches who intended to return their subjects to their original forms fairly quickly. They were easily undone, and would wear off by themselves after a few months.  Permanent transformative spells were only used when the witch intended that their subject should remain in their new forms forever. Even the withc who had cast the spell would have a hard time undoing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", said Prudence. \"When do you expect the spell will wear off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has it been?\", asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About three months\", said Prudence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then if nothing is done, the spell will wear off in another five months\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\", said Prudence. She turned to Clotilde. \"Thank you for your indulgence, my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotilde acknowledged Prudence's reply, and assuming that she was done questioning Amanda, idly cast a spell turning the errant witch's upper body back to marble, this time using what Prudence recognized as a full-strength permanent spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bye-bye, Amanda</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrudence took her leave of Clotilde and reported back to her superiors. As she had feared, her report merely fueled their debate. Matters were finally brought to a head five months later, when the transformees began returning to human form. As it happened, there was good news and bad news for those who were newly returned to humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was that those who had been paraplegics or had suffered from other disabilities remained free from these disabilities even when they resumed their human forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bad news was that the women and girls of childbearing age - between about thirteen and forty years old - were about eight months pregnant. Only the very oldest and very youngest were not.  While they all retained at least some memories of their time as chimps, the fact the chinps were rather promiscuous meant that none of them could be certain who the fathers of their unborn children were. This threatened to become a huge legal tangle, untitl the government reached a decision. There would be a huge financial settlement for everyone affected, paid by Uncle Sam. In return, the affected people would be legally bound to buy into the government's cover story, that they had been kidnapped and experimented on by techno-terrorists, and there would be a moratorium on paternity suits. In effect, what happened in \"chimpdom\" would stay in \"chimpdom\".  Seeing this, Prudence's superiors sent her to Earth, where she cast a spell, reinforcing the mundanes' agreement. In time, their memories of the events would fade a bit, but would never vanish entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little over a month later, the pregnant women and girls began giving birth. Some kept their babies, others gave them up for adoption. A few romances blossomed, sometimes in the unlikeliest places.  Cecily Hardacre's daughter was unmistakably the child of Elmer Pardiggle. To the surprise (and perhaps, horror) of the community, the two were married several months later, and would eventually have several more children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the underage mothers gave up their babies for adoption, but Emma Pardiggle insisted on keeping her daughter,  who was unmistakably the daughter of Veronica Wilton's older brother, Victor. Emma wanted Veronica to see her raising her niece, which somehow seemed like a great revenge to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the town returned to something like normal, although visitors sometimes found themselves surprised when the local got angry when someone the phrase \"monkeying around\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy White returned to the witch world, and gave birth to her daughter, there.  She never bothered finding out who the child's father was, and never returned to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amanda grins, she can tell the spell is working. \"Oh, there it is, Stacy, can you hand that book to me?\" Amanda asks, pointing to a shelf on the wall.

It didn't hurt at all, but it was definitely not normal. <i>Some sort of reaction to that food, maybe?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished her search, and went back down the ladder.

It took a minute for Stacy to realize what she meant, but she soon figured it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Janet's incisors were sticking out from under her upper lip, perpendicular to her other teeth.  Anna's ears were twice their normal size, and flaps of skin appeared to be extending from them. Belinda heel were oddly swollen, forcing her up on to her toes, which appeared to be receding into her feet.  Additionally, the skin of her feet appeared to turning wrinkly.

Stacy - who liked boys just fine, thank you - still found the girl alluring. <i>If anyone could ever make me switch teams, it would be her</i>, she thought. Anna, Astrid and Belinda seemed to be similarly affected. Janet - who did <b>not</b> like boys - looked like she'd been hit by a baseball bat. She moaned softly, and - was she? Yes, she was actually drooling just a tiny bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If we get out of this. we really need to find her a girl friend</i>, thought Stacy. <i>I wonder if there are lesbian elephants?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had many names\", said Amanda. \"But my first name was 'Ahn-Zuu'.   It meant 'Little Rabbit' in a language that was forgotten a thousand years before the Sphinx was built. Yes, I am older than the current civilization.  I am what you would call a 'sorceress'. A long time ago, I entered the service of a powerful being who has also had many names. You know her as 'Mother Nature'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother Nature is real?\", said Belinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Ahn-Zuu, \"And she's not to happy with the human race these days.  So many of her animals are going extinct, and humans are the cause. So, she's using humans to solve the problems humans to rescue the animals that humans are destroying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?' asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhn-Zuu waved her arm, as if pointing at the landscape around them.  \"This place is a sort of 'cosmic nature preserve'  in what you would call 'another dimension', a place specifically designed to be a paradise for elephants, and a few other animals, as well.  Here, you, and others like you, will create a population of elephants, safe from predators and hunters. You'll retain your human intelligence and personalities, but will be otherwise compelled to live as normal elephants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why <b>us</b>?\", asked Anna. \"I get it that humans have been bad, but we haven't extincted any animals personally. Why are <b>we</b> being punished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misunderstand\", said Ahn-Zuu. \"Being turned into elephants isn't a punishment, it's a privilege.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>privilege</i>?\", said Belinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes\", said Ahn-Zuu. \"You don't want to <i>know</i> what she does to to poachers and polluters. I wish <b>I </b> didn't.\" She shook her head, as if to clear away a bad memory.  \"If you knew what 's going to be happening on Earth over the next century, you might just be very happy to live here as elephants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why <i>us</i> particularly?\", asked Belinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No special reason. You're all basically decent girls. I saw Stacy heading in a bad direction, I decided to save her from that.  You were just easy to gather, being her closest friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks <i>so</i> much for inviting me over, Stacy\", said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame her\", said Ahn-Zuu. \"I would've gotten you some other way if she hadn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'A bad direction'?\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you would've been dead by thirty\", said Ahn-Zuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it <b>have</b> to be <b>us</b>?\", said Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, couldn't it be someone else?\", said Astrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Anna. \"Listen, get us out of this, we'll do whatever it takes to stop people hunting elephants, I swear we will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, girls, but that was decided above my pay grade, as you would say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about our families?\", asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm afraid that for them, you'll just have disappeared one day. I'm afraid that Mother Nature isn't always gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, what does she do for endangered predators?\", asked Belinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Provides them a place like this, with plenty of prey animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that hard on the prey animals?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's natural for predators to hunt prey.

But I should warn you, I myself couldn't get in and out of here without her permission. Anyway, I've got to go now. You've got mating season coming up in a month, so I've got to recruit for boys to turn into suitable mates for you. Hmm. It's about feeding time for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured, and another table laden with greens appeared in front of them,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye\", she said, and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Mating season'?\", said Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead by thirty'?\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist the food, the girls fell on it, and devoured it until it was all gone.When they were done, Stacy's trunk reached halfway down her chest, Janet's tusks were much longer, and Anna's ears were now completely elephantine, as were Belinda's legs.  The skin on Astrid's butt was gray and wrinkly, and the change was beginning spread down her legs.

Sure, I've done some dumb stuff - that party was the least of it, only what my parents found out about. But every girl  wants to have a little fun when she's my age. I would've straightened out eventually.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was so caught up in her reverie that she did not notice at first when two of her teeth jutted forward, becoming tusks. They only caught her attention when she reached up to scratch her face and her hand bumped against one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and walked on. <i>I guess it doesn't matter now, if I'm going to have to live out my life as an elephant.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached a river, where she stopped and thought about whether or not to try crossing it.  Idly, she used her trunk to pull a leafy branch off of a  tree and began devouring it.  It was only after she'd eaten it that she realized what she'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her reflection in the river. Her lower lip was now gray and wrinkly, and jutted out like an elephant's. Her teeth were broad and flat. Her ears were starting to change, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy realized that she felt hot, so she leaned down and instinctively sucked some river water into her trunk and sprayed it over her back.  She was still hungry, so she munch on some more tree branches. While she did so, her ears changed, and then her entire head became that of an elephant, albeit a very small one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should I cross the river? I better not. It might be deeper than it looks, and there's no one around to save me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs turned back, she found that her head was so heavy that she could only stand upright for a brief period. She found it easier to walk on all fours -  her arms seemed to have gotten longer.  As she walked, her hands swelled up until her fingers disappeared except for the nails.  By the time she got back to the barn, her arms had become an elephant's forelegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked in the barn and saw Astrid. Her legs had changed, and the change was spreading up her lower torso - she now had a huge, flabby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, is that you?\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy found that...</span></div></div>",

She hadn't known much about elephant anatomy, but had half expected to have a row of teats, but it seemed that elephants only had two breasts, in roughly the same places on their bodies as human women did. Janet and Anna were similarly changed.  As for Belinda and Astrid, only their arms, hands, necks and heads remained human.

I've even brought a sample of the sort of cage I like to keep them in.  Take a look\", said Amanda, pointing behind Stacy. Stacy turned and then jumped back, startled. Behind her was a large metal bird cage, nearly five feet high.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did that come from?  That wasn't here a minute ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, dear. I just brought it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked at Amanda sharply, suspecting that the older woman was mocking her, then turned her attention to the cage. Stacy bent over in front of the cage and pulled the door open.   As she looked at the cage, it seemed to start getting bigger and bigger. Her clothing began to feel looser and looser - when her pants suddenly fell down she realized that the cage wasn't getting bigger, <i>she</i> was getting <i>smaller</i>! The shrinking stopped when she was one foot high. She tried holding her shirt to cover herself, but it was now difficult to keep a grip on it. Even as she started to speak, she felt a powerful wind lifting her up, and blowing her into the cage!  When the wind died away, she found herself stark naked, and precariously balanced on the perch in the cage. She turned just in time to see the cage door slam shut and lock itself behind her. She gasped as her feet began to change into those of a bird, steadying her balance as they curled around the perch. Grey feathers began to spread over her body as the change moved up her legs. Her arms re-shaped themselves into wings, and then the change completed itself as her face pushed forward into a beak.  She was now a fine specimen of an African Grey parrot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God\", she said, \"what's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should think that was obvious, Stacy\", said Amanda. \"I've turned you into a parrot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? <i>You</i> did this? How? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'How' was by magic. 'Why' is that you're easier to handle this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Magic'? What are you, some kind of a witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But witches aren't real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're in a position to argue that point, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stopped to think about this for awhile, then she spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you can't leave me like this! Please, I'll behave, I'll be as good as gold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Stacy, but from what your parents have told me, your word hasn't always been good in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but when my parents hear you turned me into a parrot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, you parents already know. They hired me to do just this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was stunned by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll miss me at school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school's been told that your parents changed their plans at the last minute and took you with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I told my friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If any of your friends come by, I'll deal with them. If they get too nosy, maybe you'll have company in that cage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen carefully, Stacy, this is important.  If you behave yourself, I'll leave the TV on for you, on whatever channel you like. If you don't behave - well then, you can amuse yourself reading the newspaper at the bottom of your cage.  Now, from time to time, I'll have to open the cage to change your food and water and so on. <i>If you leave that cage before I change you back, the change becomes <b>permanent</b>. Even I wouldn't be able to change you back then.</i> So - no funny business.  Just try to make the best of things, and the week will go by smoothly. Consider it a learning experience. Anyway, look on the bright side, I could have changed you into a bird that couldn't speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy thought about this for awhile, then spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're such a powerful witch, why are you working as a babysitter? Surely you don't need the money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not being paid in money.  Frankly, you'll sleep better at night <i>not knowing </i>what your parents <i>are</i> paying me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda picked up Stacy's clothes from the floor, folded them, and held them under one arm. With her free hand, she picked up the remote..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you like to watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy sulkily watched her favorite shows that night, resisting Amanda's attempts at conversation. She fell asleep early, but woke in darkness to the sound of Amanda's voice from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Oh, it's you. What? No, I can't.  I <i>can't</i>, I'm doing a job.  No, I mean it.  What? <i>He</i> asked for <i>me</i> personally? I suppose I'll have to, then. I don't like it, though, it's really skirting close to breaking a contract. I will <i>not </i>be staying long. Alright, goodbye, I'll see you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda came into the living room and faced Stacy's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, something's come up, and I have go out for awhile. I should be back in a few hours. You should be fine. Just you remember, though - if anyone comes around, you stay good and quiet if you ever want to be human again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she replenished Stacy's food and water, and left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda watched TV for awhile, then fluttered around the cage for awhile. Maybe it was of the spell, but she had figured out flight fairly quickly. She really didn't like being caged, and TV got boring eventually. She thought of the hamster she'd had as a little girl. She wondered what its life had been like. Well, she'd never keep an animal in a cage again, that was for sure. When nightfall came with no sign of Amanda, Stacy began to wonder where she was.  When morning came with still no sign of Amanda, Stacy began to be really worried. She'd eaten all of the food she'd been left, and she was starting to get <i>really</i> hungry. What was worse was that Amanda had left the bag of Parrot Chow out on the kitchen counter right where Stacy could see it. She'd never imagined that the day would ever come when bird food would seem so appetizing to her, but that day was here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe capper came when the local morning news broadcast reported that the badly-burned body of a middle-aged woman had been found in the park several miles from Stacy's home. The woman had been carrying no ID. The police's only clue was a ring the woman had been wearing which jad been engraved with the letter \"A\" in Gothic script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thrill of fear ran through Stacy.  Was the dead woman Amanda? That would explain why she hadn't come back. If it <i>was</i> Amanda,  what was going to happen to <i>her</i>? She was out of food and her water was running low. Her parents weren't due back for several days yet.  If Amanda never came back, Stacy would starve to death in the cage. Should she try to break out of the cage?  She remembered what Amanda had said about the change being permanent if she left the cage without permission. Was that a bluff to get her to behave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy decided she had two options:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, she could stay in the cage and hope that someone would come by and feed her.  Either Amanda would turn out to be delayed and not dead, or she could wait for someone to come to the house and try her best to get their attention and get them to feed her. If Amanda never came back, then her parents could just find another witch to change her back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she could try to break out and get some food and water, and maybe even try to get help somehow. The business about the change being permanent could well have been a lie, and anyway, life as a parrot beat death in a cage!  At least parrots lived a long time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy thought it over awhile, and  then decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Something like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.birdscomfort.com/macaw_parrot_cage.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.birdscomfort.com/macaw_parrot...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After thinking about it a little longer, Stacy decided to break out of the cage.  She was getting hungrier and hungrier, and there was still no sign of Amanda coming back or of anyone coming by the house.  She would just have to take the chance that Amanda was bluffing about the spell being permanent. Stacy flew over to the cage door, clinging to the cage with one foot, and examining the lock with the other.  Stacy realized that she was in luck - Amanda had left in a hurry, and hadn't locked the cage door properly.  Even so, it took her nearly half an hour to get the cage door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had done so, she paused. This was the moment of truth.  If Amanda <b>had</b> been telling the truth, then if Stacy left the cage now, she would be stuck as a parrot forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've come this far\", she thought. \"I may as well go all the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she flew out of the cage, Stacy felt a tingling sensation all over her body. Was it the spell becoming permanent? Or was it maybe an \"alarm\" of sorts, to let Amanda know that she had left the cage. Well, it was too late to worry about it now. She flow over to where Amanda had left the bag of Parrot Chow and managed to get it open. Stacy helped herself to a mouthful - she'd never imagined that bird feed could taste so good. Then she flew over to the sink and managed to turn on the faucet to get some cold water flowing so she could have a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sated, she decided to fly around the house.  She flew around all of the rooms she could get into - if a room's door was closed, she couldn't open it.  Everything seemed in order in all of the rooms she <b>could</b> get into.  Finally, she went to her own room. The clothes she had been wearing when Amanda changed her were carefuuly folded  and were lying on the bed.  It made her sad to think that she might never wear clothes again. She noticed that her bedroom window was open.  That was good - she could get out of the house if she had to. She was sure that she could tear through the screen with her beak, if she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy flew back into the living room and perched on the back of the couch, facing the TV. Enough time had passed that the noon news was about to come on. Stacy watched as the newscaster reported that police were no closer to establishing the identity of the burned woman. She thought about what to do next. It occurred to her that she ought to be able to use the phone to call someone. She flew over to the phone and managed to knock the handset loose from its base.  She would be able to dial  by peckign the appropriate buttons with her beak. But who should she call?  The police?  What could she tell them?  \"Help, a witch has turned me into a parrot\"? No, they'd just think she was a kid pranking them. She'd have to claim that there was a medical emergency or something, and then try to explain it to them when they came.  But would they believe her even then, or would they just think that she was someone's well-trained pet? And if they did believe her, what could they do for her? She might end up in a lab somewhere, or worse, a zoo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to her that it would be lunchtime at school right now. She could call one of her friends without worrying about getting them in trouble with a teacher.  Who to call? It had to be someone smart and open-minded, and who wouldn't be easily freaked out.  Stacy thought about all of her friends and decided to call Maria Yoshino. She wasn't Stacy's best friend, but they were still good buddies, and Maria was very smart and flexible. If any one of her friends could help her figure out what to do, it would be Maria. Stacy flew to her room and got her address book out of her jacket pocket. She memorized Maria's number and flew back to the phone. With a little difficulty, she dialed Maria's cell phone. Maria answered on the second ring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Maria, it's Stacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy? I thought you went away with your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, are you OK? You sound a little funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm not myself today.  Listen, Maria, could I ask you a huge favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you come by my house after school?  I've got kind of an unusual situation going on here, and I need some help figuring out what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd really rather not say until you get here. It'll be kind of obvious why then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I guess I can do that. I should be able to get there by around 4:00.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, M, I really appreciate it. Oh, and do me a favor - when you get here, don't come to the front door,. come around to my bedroom window, instead. The reason why will be obvious for that, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy swore that she could <b>hear</b> Maria's eyebrows raise at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Stace, I'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and one last thing, Maria. Please, please, PLEASE, don't tell ANYONE that you talked to me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,  Mystery Girl, but this better be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it will, be, it will be. Thanks again, M!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Stace, I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy hung up the phone and managed to work it back on to its base.  She passed the next few hours wathcing TV. At 3:45, she flew into her bedroom and perched on the windowsill. Maria appeared right outside the window at 4:00. She was an attractive girl of Japanese ancestry. She wore rimless glasses and was dressed plainly but presentably. Maria looked up and saw Stacy. She gave the parrot a penetrating stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, little bird. Is Stacy in there somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy decided to go with the direct approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Maria. <b>I'm</b> Stacy. The 'little bird' is me. A witch turned me into a parro.t\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Stacy's surprise, Maria seemed to take this in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b>thought</b> it was you\", said Maria. \"I think I'd better come in there, don''t you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd appreciate that\", said Stacy.  \"I think if you push it, you should be able to open the screen enough to squeeze in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necessary\", said Maria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Stacy's astonishment, Maria began to blur and then dissipate into a nearly invisible white mist, which flowed through the window screen and into Stacy's bedroom and re-shpaed itself into another African Grey parrot, perched on the windowsill next to Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Stace\", the parrot said, \"<b>I'm</b> a witch, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get away from this window\", said Maria, \"We don't want anyone seeing us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two flew down to the living room and perched on the couch. Maria used the remote to turn off the TV.  Stacy looked at ther friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're a witch! You! Miss 'Scientific Skeptic!' You always say that magic is nonsense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of what gets called 'magic' is nonsense. Any witch worth her salt is fairly skeptical of most so-called 'supernatural' stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there alot of you witches around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that many <b>real </b>witches. Now tell me what happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy told Maria the whole story, answering every question her friend had as best she could. As she wrapped up, she asked Maria the question that was uppermost in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it true what Amanda said?  Am I stuck as a parrot permanently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, spells like that <b>do</b> exist, though it would be beyond my current power level.  It's an awfully extreme spell to use for a simple babysitting job, though. I'm going to scan you, but I'll have to resume my normal form to do it. Don't worry, the scan won't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria flew off of the couch, then misted out and re-formed as her usual self. She began to mutter in a language that was already ancient in the time of Yamato Takeru, and her eyes began to glow green.  Suddenly, twin beams of verdant light shot forth from her eyes, transfixing Stacy. There was no pain, but Stacy couldn't move. Abruptly, the light stopped.  Maria's expression was unreadable as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Stacy, Amanda was telling the truth. You will be a parrot for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God\", said Stacy. \"What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave her friend a moment to compose herself, then spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me call my mother. She knows alot of things that I don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took out her cellphone and spoke again in the ancient language she had used before.  After a brief conversation, she hung up and turned back to Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom wants to have a look at you, do you mind coming over to our house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Does she think there's any hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what she wants to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria went around the house, checking to see that everything was in order. She checked the rooms that Stacy hadn't been able to get into previously, but didn't find anything unusual. Amanda hadn't left anything in the house except the birdcage and the Parrot Chow. Maria stuck this last into her backpack, then transformed herself into a robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to cast an illusion spell to make you look like a robin, too.  People will be less likely to notice us that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this was done, the pair flew up to Stacy's room, where Maria \"misted\" them through the window screen. When they re-formed outside, she caused the window to shut and lock. The two then flew to Maria's house, stopping from time to time to perch on rooftops or tree branches. Stacy found the experience of flying around outside to be overwhelming. There were so many new sensations, and even her familiar neighborhood looked different when seen from above.  Eventually, they came to Maria's  house and flew in through the kitchen window, which Maria's mother had left open. Once they were inside, Maria resumed her human form and dispersed the illusion around Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy alit on the kitchen table and looked at Maria's mother. Anna Yoshino was a striking woman, apparently in early middle age. There was no doubt that she was Maria's mother.  After introducing herself, she scanned Stacy as Maria had. When she spoke to Stacy, her expression was as unreadable as Maria's had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, I'm afraid that Maria was correct. The spell that was used on you is permanent, and I don't know of any way to break it. I flatter myself that that's saying alot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Amanda that powerful?\" asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Amanda,\" said Anna, \"but I <b>have</b> heard of her, and she is said to be quite powerful.  However, with spells like this, sheer raw power isn't everything. Some things have to be finessed. Enough raw power to break a spell like this would also be enough power to incinerate you, which would be contrary to our purposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm definitely stuck as a parrot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so. About the only good thing about this is that you're now immune to any further transformations. No one will ever be able to transform you into anything else. I'm sure that isn't much consolation right now, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Anna, \"frankly, I'm quite concerned about this whole situation.  We need to find out what happened to Amanda, and why your parents hired her to babysit you. It's bizarre - it's like hiring a brain surgeon to deal with a paper cut, or hiring Picasso to whitewash your fence. It's overkill. There's more going on here, and I want to know what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing I want to find out is whether the woman in the morgue is Amanda or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get to the morgue and see the body they have there. Maria or I would be able to tell if she was a witch or not. Stacy, I'm afraid  you'll have to go along, so that if she <b>is</b> a witch, we can test whether she was the one who put the spell on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will we do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll wait until tonight - the fewer the number of people around, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy spent the next few hours talking to Maria and Anna, going over everything she remembered about what Amanda had said to her. Later, she dozed for awhile. At midnight, Anna woke Stacy and Maria, and took them out to her car. She drove them to the morgue where the police were keeping the body.  Parking nearby, she rendered the three of them invisible to everyone except themselves. Quietly they entered the building and went to the room where the body was. There was only one attendant present. Anna wordlessly placed him in a trance. Maria and Stacy looked away as Anna uncovered the body. She placed one hand on the body and one hand on Stacy and scanned the body. Then she re-covered it and released the attendant. Silently they returned to the car, where Anna made them all visible again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Mom?\" asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's wait until we get back to the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to the Yoshinos' home, Anna and Maria sat down on two easy chairs in the living room. Anna motioned Stacy to perch on the chair behind Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed, and said, \"I scanned thoroughly, and I'm quite sure of the results.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The room was quiet for a moment, before Stacy finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, she's dead. What could kill a witch like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even a high-ranking witch isn't indestructible. In fact, most of the things that would kill a mundane would kill one of us if we were careless or taken by surprise. I once knew a powerful witch that was killed by a cross-town bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will you do? Are there 'witch police' that you report this sort of thing to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are..'authorities'.. that one can contact if absolutely necessary, but it's generally not in anyone's interest to invoke <i>them</i> lightly. Ordinarily, since I am neither friend nor family to Amanda, I would keep my nose out of this business.  However, I want to find out whether what happened to Amanda has anything to do with you. I prefer to be forewarned if who or whatever did for Amanda is going to come after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thrill of fear went through Stacy - she hadn't thought of anything like that! Stacy hung her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much for everything you've done for me, Mrs. Yoshino. I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, you're a friend of my daughter's and you came to her for help.  As far as I'm concerned, that puts you under her - and therefore <i>my</i> - protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy thanked the older woman again. She knew on some level that she was going to owe a huge debt to the Yoshinos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mom\", said Maria, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find out what happened to Amanda. The first thing we need to do is go back to Amanda's house, it will be easier to follow her 'trail' from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio drove back over to Stacy's house.  Anna magicked the front door open and they went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell me, Stacy,\" she said, \"where did you see Amanda last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy perched on top of the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  I'm going to try and call up the images of what happened here a few days ago, and see if we can pick up Amanda's trail that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see into the past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To an extent. Hush now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna began to mutter a spell, making passes with her arms at the same time. Stacy's vision blurred for a moment, then cleared again. She was watching herself two days ago! The prespective shifted from to the guest room where Amanda was staying. She watched as Amanda answered her cellphone. It was the same conversation, only now they could hear both sides of it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hello, Amanda.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Listen, you've to meet me at the Blue Coyotl right away! Something really big is brewing!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What? No, I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You have to, this is <b>big</b> - and potentially <b>very</b> profitable.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I can't, I'm doing a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A job? you aren't serious!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No, I mean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You <b>have </b>to! We need someone good and Alberich asked for you <b>personally</b>!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? He asked for <b>me</b> personally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yup.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I suppose I'll have to, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wonderful!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it, though, it's really skirting close to breaking a contract. I will not be staying long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fine, fine. Come right now, and we'll have you back there in two, three hours tops. Your client won't even miss you \"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, goodbye, I'll see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Great! Thanks, Amanda, you won''t regret it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy watched as Amanda came out and told her she was leaving, and gave her the warning about leaving the cage. The scene faded and Anna began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was interesting.\"  She began muttering a new incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy whispered to Maria, \"What do you make of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks as though some firend of hers called her away to work another job.  It's very bad form to leave one job to go do another. Witches take contracts very seriously - more seriously even than mundanes do. Really, you're not supposed to break a contract for anything short of death. Sometimes even death - even <i>your own </i>death isn't considered a valid excuse. An ethical witch just wouldn't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, dear\", interjected Anna. \" But I am increasingly convinced that Amanda was <i>not</i> an ethical witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the Blue Coyotl?\" asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a popular meeting place for a certain type of witch.  Something like what a dive bar would be for mundanes, but if anything, even sleazier than most dives. The fact that Amanda knew the place and would readily go meet someone there says alot about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing! I neve rknew there was anything in our town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can access it <i>from </i>our town, but it's not actually <i>in</i> our town, strictly speaking. Hush now, I'm going to try and follow  Amanda's \"trail\" to see what she did when she left here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy watched as she saw a projection of Amanda leaving her house and transforming herself into a parrot, flying towards the park where her body was eventually found. When she got there, she landed next to a tree, resuming human form. She knocked on the tree, and it opened up like a door. Inside was something like a tavern out of a ren-fest, only empty and dark. It had the look of a room that had been evacuated in a hurry. Amanda stepeed inside and the portal closed behind her. She looked around, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne? Are you here? Why is this place empty? Where in Hell are you?\"  Amanda whirled as a voice came form behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the circle reserved for traitors, no doubt, where you shall shortly join her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speaker was a tall, beautiful woman with long blonde hair and icy blue eyes. She wore shimmering blue robes embroidered with intricate designs. Stacy had always liked boys (for all that her boy-chasing days were almost certainly over), but she could well imagine falling in love with this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vieno!\" shouted Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you remember the name of she whom you robbed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It wasn't me! It was Arachne's idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar! Arachne would not have had the nerve or the wit to concoct such a scheme! But fear not! She has paid for her part in your robbery. She lived just long enough to sell your location to me before I paid her in the same kind of 'gold' I am about to pay you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVieno raised her hands and they began to glow with a pulsing golden light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" cried, Amanda, sobbing. \"Please! Have mercy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER!\" Stacy, Maria and  Anna looked away as twin bolts of golden fire shot from Vieno's hands, enveloping Amanda. Fortunately for their sanity,Amanda's screams did not last long. A portal opened below her remains, dropping them down into the park. Vieno turned and seemed to be looking right at the three watchers. Vieno spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for you, who watch from the future...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was horrified: \"She can <u><i><b>SEE</b></i></u> us, she can <u><i><b>SEE</b></i></u> us, she can <u><i><b>SEE</b></i></u>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Vieno. \"I can see you, little bird. But fear not, for I have no quarrel with you, who have also suffered from Amanda's venality. Alas, even I cannot undo what she has done to you. But be of stout heart. If you can keep your nerve, there may yet be happiness in your future. You have my blesssing, child. For now, farewell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the projection vanished, and the three once again saw Stacy's living room around them. They sat very still, for even Anna was shaken. After a minute, Anna went to the refrigerator and took one of Stacy's dad's beers out, opened it up, and took a long gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Anna, \"I've seen all sorts of things in my life, but that takes the cake.  To think that a witch lived who was stupid enough to rob Vieno!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was she, Mom?\" asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vieno! One of the Ancient Elders! One of the thirteen most powerful witches alive!  Merciful Mother, what was Amanda thinking?  Robbing Vieno is a bit like robbing an irritable H-Bomb! And you, Stacy! She gave <i>you</i> her <i>blessing</i>! Really, you ought to go out and play the lottery tonight or something! Talk about a favorable omen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anna downed the rest of her beer, Stacy spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna set down her beer bottle and looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next thing I want to do is have a serious talk with your parents. When did you say they were coming back from Paris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunday evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well then, ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's getting quite late, let's get home and get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they drove back to the Yoshino home. Maria set up a sleeping area for Stacy in her room. They both fell asleep very quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Maria went off to school, promising to see Stacy later.  After she had gone, Anna sat down at the kitchen table, sipping a cup of coffee.  Stacy spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, what do you think Amanda meant when she said I'd sleep better not knowing <b>how</b> my parents paid her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you can imagine, a powerful witch doesn't really have to worry much about money as such. It's easy enough to magick up all the cash you need if you're so minded.   However, there <b>are</b> things which cannot be purchased with money or treasure or what have you.  For example, certain types of spells require certain types of...energies...which can only be obtained through, shall we say, <i>manipulation</i> of the human life force. It's possible that your parents gave her 'access' to their bodies and/or souls in return for looking after you for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy felt ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God!  You don't mean they did <i><b>that</b></i> with Amanda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not <i><b>that</b></i> exactly, but I'm afraid it would have been something at least that 'intimate'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would they do something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Stacy, what has your relationship been like with your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've always been OK.  I mean they're, well... parents... you know? They have been kind of uptight ever since they went away the last time, and I threw that party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Uptight'...hmmm...\" said Anna.  \"Setting aside the busienss with the party, would you say they'vegotten alot stricer even before that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little, I suppose. They really haven't liked me being around boys at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, why did they go to Paris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted to get away for awhile, they said\", replied Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it wasn't a business trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, I'm afraid we're going to have to discuss something a little personal, here.  When I scanned you before, I could tell that you are still a virgin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's <i><b>that</b></i> got to do with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, there's <b>alot</b> of potential magickal energy of a unique type tied up in a girl's virginity.  Properly released, it can be used to achieve powerful effects that are very difficult to create any other way. That's why you hear so much about 'virgin sacrifices'. It's also why it's vitally important that a girl be very careful as to when and how and to whom she 'gives it up'.  Not for prudish or Puritan reasons, but because it can be devastating if that energy is misused. Also, once the deed is done, that energy is gone forever. Tell me, Stacy, was there never a boy that tempted you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there <i>was</i> a guy that I came close to doing it with. He was at the party that night - it might have even happened then and there, but my parents came home unexpectedly, and somehow it was never the same with him again after that. Say, do you think that that's what this is alll about? My parents wanted to make sure this energy didn't get used up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. We'll know more when we talk to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Stacy spent the next few days with the Yoshinos.  She had a pretty good time, considering the circumstances.  When Sunday afternoon came along, the three of them went over to Stacy's house.They checked the house out, but everything seemed fine there. Anna magicked the bird cage away and then spoke to Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it best if we try to catch your parents by surprise. If they come home and find us here like this, they'll know something's wrong right away and be on their guard. So, we're going to disguise ourselves.  Stacy, I'm going to render you invisible to everyone but the three of us.  Maria, I want you to take on Stacy's human form, and I will take on Amanda's form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Anna muttered and gestured. Her body blurred and re-formed as the exact duplicate of Amanda.  Stacy winced a little when she saw Maria take her old form, the one she would never to wear again.  She felt a slight tingling  as Annna made her invisible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed the time amiably, waiting. Stacy's parents had expected to be home between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. Maria checked on-line and verified that their flight had arrived on schedule.  However, 6:00 anmd then 7:00 and then 8:00 came and went with no sign of them. When 9:00 came with no result, Anna frowned and said, \"Hmm, I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish...</span></div></div>",

There were no obvious spells or enchantments on them, but there was something definitely \"off\" about them, though she couldn't say exactly what. Still, she could think of no reason not to let them in, so she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, George, Vera\", she said. \"How was your trip?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry we're late\", said George. \"Traffic was a little heavier than we'd expected.\" He and Vera were both carrying two heavy bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, help your parents with their luggage\", said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", siad Maria (as Stacy), but her father waved her away.  Insread, her parents simply let the bags drop onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna scanned them again. She had feared some trap, but she could detect none. It was a calculated risk, but she decided to make her move. She cast a spell entrancing Stacy's parents, commanding them to go sit on the couch. She dropped her disguise and rendered Stacy visible. She nodded to Maria, wog also dropped her disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to them?\" asked Stacy, flying around her parents' heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just put them into a trance. They'll have to answer any questions truthfully and completely now.\"  she turned to George and Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, Vera, why did you hire Amanda to babysit Stacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge replied: \"We needed to make sure that she remained a virgin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was that so important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera spoke: \"She was promised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Promised'?\" said Anna. \"Promised to who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who Dwells Outside\", said George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gasped. \"You promised your <b>daughter</b> to <b>that</b>! Why? In the name of She-Who-Invites, <i>why?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we were young\", said Vera. \"We both worked at an accounting firm. We met at a company function, and began dating. We discovered that we each had an interest in black magic and embezzlement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge took up the story.  \" We came up with a scheme to rob the company blind and to use magic to cover our tracks. We stole the money but our magic failed.  One of our colleagues figured out where we were doing. She was gathering evidence against us to take to our boss. We found out that she knew. We were desperate. We managed to get her alone and drug her.  We took her to our home, and then tried to decide what to do.with her. Even if we killed her and got away with it, it would only be a matter of time before we were caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera continued. \"We searched all of the magickal books we had. I found the name of Who Dwells Outside in an old book. It gave its true name, T -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Don't</b> say it!\" interjected Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera resumed her narrative.  \"We performed the ritual of summoning, slitting her throat as an offering to Who Dwells Outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <b>killed </b>her?\" said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was us or her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy reeled inside. Her parents were crooks and killers! Being turned into a parrot was less of a shock than this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is what they're saying real?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't lie right now\", said Anna. \"So it must be true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who or what is 'Who Dwells Outside'?\" asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ancient, powerful creature that originates outside of our reality. It delights in causing  pain and chaos. Anyone who deals with it ends up regretting it. The worst part is, your parents killed that poor woman just to summon him. They needn't have bothered - just speaking his name summons him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they <i>promised</i> me to him? What does that even <i>mean</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at Stacy sadly. \"Remember what we were saying earlier about a girl's viginity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. my <b>God</b>! But <i>why</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge began to speak again. \"Who Dwelled Outside helped us.  Covered up our tracks at the company. Cleaned up the woman's body. Helped set us up in a new life on the other side of the country.  Even taught us a little real magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in return for this?\" asked Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were to turn over our daughter, pure and intact, when he demanded her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera added, \"At the time I didn;t even know that I was pregnant, let alone that it would be a girl. But Who Dwells Outside knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy, squawked at her parents \"And you were to turn me over for that? This can't be real! God, I feel like I don't even know you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn tried her best to comfort Stacy. Inwardly,she wondered whether the girl's parents were sociopaths. It was a wonder that Stacy had turned out as well as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what sdo we do now, Mom?\" asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get out of here and get home before Who Dwells Outside arrives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice spoke from behind them. \"A bit late for that, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, Maria and Stacy spun around. A well-dressed but somewhat dumpy-looking middle-aged man stood in the doorway. Completely ordinary-looking, apart from his glowing red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am T'aksa'ntek - Who Dwells Outside\", the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <b>him</b>?\" said Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled. \"Perhaps you were expecting something a little more like Cthulhu, or something similarly Lovecraftian?  I can do that, but I don't usually. Dear old Howard, he remains the only mortal ever to creep me out. As improbable as it may seem, I sometimes think that he must have gone somewhere even<b> I've </b>never been. Anyway. To business. I've come to collect my fee. I see that she's a bird now. That halfwit Amanda! Really, I warned those two that she was dangerous, but they wouldn't listen! But, that's as may be. Surrender the girl to me, and I'll leave you in peace. You can do what you like with her parents. A witch of your caliber ought to be able to use them for ingredients in something or other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl\", said Anna, \"is under my protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who will protect you, my dear? Or your daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, he shot a beam of red light straight at Anna. She erected a shield. It held, but she began to sweat almost instantly.  Maria moved to bolster her mother, but Anna shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria! Take Stacy and get out of here! You know where to go! I can hold him long a little while, but not long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Who Dwells Outside snarled and redoubled his efforts. Anna  gaped, but her shield held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria spoke.. \"Mom, I - !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded, and turned herself into a bird.  She flew towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy hesitated.  \"But we can't just abandon your mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't help her!

She suspected that Maria might be pulling her along in a sort of magical slipstream. Soon enough they arrived at the Yoshino home. Maria resumed human form and let them in the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your house a safe place to be?\" asked Stacy. \"Won't he be able to follow us here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Mom's been living in this house for a hundred and fifty years. In that time, she's put alot of time and effort into its defenses. Even Who Dwells Outside would think twice before trying to force its way in here. It might get in eventually, but it would use up enough energy doing so that even <b>I</b> would have a good chance of beating him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This house is a hundred fifty years old? It doesn't look much more than forty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother's good at illusions.  Now, come on, we've got to get down to the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked through the living room, the TV popped on. Who Dwells Outside appeared on the screen.  It was still in the living room of Stacy's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Maria\", said T'aksa'ntek. \"I see you've run to ground. Smart move.  It would certainly take more time and effort than I want to spend to come in there after you. However, I do believe I have a way to lure you here. Come here, slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master\", said Anna from \"off-camera\". She walked to T'aksa'ntek's side.  Maria gasped. Her mother was hideously changed.  Her legs were now capriform, her ears were pointed, and curling horns jutted from her forehead. The skin on her uncovered torso was dark red. The total effect was to make her look like the pop culture image of a she-devil.  She draped her arms seductively around T'aksa'ntek's neck and smiled lasciviously. Only her eyes told a different story - Maria saw outrage and pain in her eyes.  Maria shook with anger and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a very formidable witch, your mother\", said Who Dwells Outside, \"you should be proud.  I was able to batter down her defenses and take control of her body, but as you can see, even now, her mind defies me.  I expect it's going to take about another hour to break through her final defenses. Then she will be mine completely.  I'll eat her soul and fill her body up with my will, making her my creature forever. So, you've got about that much time to surrender Stacy to me. I wouldn't take that long if I were you.This sort of thing can be pretty unpredictable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen went blank.  Stacy saw the anguish in Maria's eyes. She knew what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria\", she said, \"I'm so sorry for dragging you and your mother into this.  Look, I haven't got much of a life left - I'm stuck as a parrot, and my parents are deranged jerks. Let me just turn myself over to Who Dwells Outside and get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\", said Maria angrily, with tears in her eyes. \"It's not happening. My mother would disown me if I let it have you just to save her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going down into the basement.\" Maria led Stacy down into the basement. It looked like a normal basement, filled with the detritus of a normal American life. In the back, there was an ornate door built into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my mother's 'inner sanctum'. I've never actually been in here.  This is where she keeps private things, things she wouldn't share with anyone, not even me. She also keeps dangerous things in here. - powerful magickal objects. I am hopeful that there's something in here that we can use. You heard Mom say that I would know where to go. Well, this is where she meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria opened the door. The room looked like something out of an old Japanese inn.  Various objects rested on shelves lining the walls. Stacy perched on Maria's shoulder as Maria looked at the various items.  She fluttered into the air when Maria suddenly gasped and bent over to look at something on a bottom shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something that we could use that could give us a very good chance to defeat Who Dwells Outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's use it, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just one small problem,\" said Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There would also be a very good chance that it could destroy us both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria held out her hand in front of her so that Stacy could light on it, and the two could speak face-to-face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", said Maria, \"you game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked at her, and said:</span></div></div>",

I never knew that my mother had anything like this. I've only seen it in the <i>Encyclopedia Magica</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It enables the wielder to use an opponent's energy against them.  The only problem is that when it's used, there's kind of a backwash against the wielder. The more of your opponent's power you try to use against them, the more is directed back against you.  Against an enemy like Who Dwells Outside, the backwash would almost certainly be enough to destroy me. An experienced witch like my mother would be able to re-route enough of the backwash energy that she could survive. I'm not really powerful enough. In a best case scenario, I might be able to do what you might call a \"<i>kamikaze</i>\" attack on Who Dwells Outside, but even then I wouldn't be guaranteed of beating it. I might be able to weaken it enough that my mother could break free and finish it off. There is a way you could help me with it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy becoming my <i>fa'iit't'aarah</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no good English translation.  The closest I could give you is something like 'animal-partner'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, like a familiar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of\", said Maria. \"However it happened, you're a magickal animal, now.  That means you now contain a fair amount of potential magickal energy. Add to that the fact that Vieno gave you her blessing. From a witch like her. that's more that just well-wishing.  For awhile at least, the laws of probability will have shifted significantly in your favor. Put all that together, and it means that if you were my <i>fa'iit't'aarah</i>, I'd be able to tap enough additional magickal energy that I'd stand a much better chance of beating Who Dwells Outside with incinerating myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's do it!\" said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, there's more I have to tell you first. This bond, it would be permanent, breakable only by the death of one or the other of us. Our life forces would be linked. If I die, you will die, too.  If you die, I may survive, but from what I've been told, it's an extremely traumatic event for the witch it happens to. Also, the bond is very intimate, very deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound like a marriage!\" said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like a marriage, but in some ways we'd be even closer than spouses would. In point of fact, if we do this, it'll most likely mean I'll never end up marrying. Most witches that take on a <i>fa'iit't'aarah</i> never do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd give that up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To save my mother? Definitely. Anyway, there's no rule that says I couldn't take on consort or two over the years\" said Maria, smirking. \"For that matter, we could find you a nice boy parrot, if you felt that need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy would've blushed if she still could.  Maria continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ordinarily, we'd spend about a year being tested for compatibility before the bond, but we haven't got time for that. One final thing - this would be a partnership, but it's not an equal partnership. <b> I</b> would be the senior partner. You would essentially be agreeing to enter my service. Now I assure you that I wouldn't treat you like a slave, but it's up to you to decide how much faith you have in me.\" Maria smiled.  \"I can promise you an exciting life, and it might last thousands of years if it outlasts the next hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do if I say no?\" asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled amiably. \"Then I will go and fight Who Dwells Outside as best I can, win if possible, and 'die gloriously for Clan Yoshino' if I must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I do this, we can beat Who Dwells Outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be honest - our chances will increase a great deal, but even then I can't guarantee success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy thought hard.  This would be the biggest decision she'd ever made. It could also be the last decision she'd ever make, depending on how things went. She thought over her options, and looked Maria in the eyes for a minute. then she said:</span></div></div>",

I just have to be completely uncovered for the bonding. 'Nothing hidden', as the old books say. I should warn you - the experience will be pretty intense. a witch and her partner usually spend about a week recovering after the bonding. We'll have to do it in minutes. Ordinarily, there'd be a huge ritual with the highest ranking witch available officiating and every witch I've ever known who could make it in attendance, but that's all window dressing. In the end, it comes down to you and it it comes down to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Maria outlined the ritual for Stacy. Then she stood up straight and looked as dignified as a naked girl with a parrot standing on her right hand could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, daughter of Vera, do you - freely and of your own will - agree to enter into my service as my <i>fa'iit't'aarah</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, daughter of Anna, I do so agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, so be it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria put her left hand on Stacy's head and spoke an incantation. For Stacy, it was as intense as Maria had said it would be. It was like a lightning bolt went through her. Suddenly, she was in Maria's mind, and Maria was in hers. She <i>knew</i> Maria like she'd never known anyone, and Maria <i>knew</i> her likewise. Knowing Maria as she now did, she felt with all her heart that she'd made the right choice. Maria staggered and then sat straight down on the floor.  Stacy fluttered to the floor next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Maria began to dress herself. Then she put the ring on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Stacy, are you ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, 'Mistress'\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled sadly. She knew that Stacy was joking, but she also knew that in a real way, she <i>was</i> her friend's mistress now.   Before today, she hadn't even begun to think about whether she wanted to take on a <i>fa'iit't'aarah</i> or not. Now she had taken on an awesome, life-long responsbility after only a few minutes' consideration. Even to save her mother's life, it was a staggering thing to do. She set the reverie aside. Time was burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Stacy left Anna's 'inner sanctum'. Maria carefully locked the door.  The two left the Yoshino home and flew over to Stacy's house.

The house shook as their duel began in earnest. Waves of energy streamed around them both.  Stacy felt power flowing from her to Maria. Each penetrated the other's shield. Maria's clothes caught fire and Stacy singed her feathers trying to beat the flames out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let it go!\" said Maria. \"Keep your distance, I need you intact!\"  Maria struck back, causing T'aksa'ntek to grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, my dear\", it said. \"No one's made me work this hard in centuries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, it seemed to Stacy that the fight was even, or perhaps even beginning to slide in Who Dwells Outside's favor. But then, Maria seemed to rally, and the tide began to turn. Suddenly, Stacy heard the voice of Who Dwells Outside in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stacy, I'm shielding these thoughts from Maria, this is between the two of us. I want to ask you, has it occurred to you that Maria has done the same thing to you that<b> I </b>intended to do?  She used you to make herself stronger, to gain an advantage. Worse, she's enslaved you for life! I only intended to use you once, to take something that you just would have given to some boy eventually anyway! I wouldn't have needed you afterwards. Just a simple one-time thing - it could even have been pleasant! But even at worst, it would have been over quickly. But, you can still be free!   I don't need<b> your </b>soul, especially. Deny your energy to Maria now, and when I've won, I'll transfer your soul into Maria's body, and her soul into yours. Once that's done, I'll re-shape Maria's body into a copy of your old one.

She let her power flow freely to Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnraged, Who Dwells Outside made one last push.  Maria was wreathed in flame. Her clothes and hair burned off, but still she didn't falter. Her shield held and she returned the assault, pushing her opponent back. Who Dwells Outside began to cringe and beg for mercy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I can do things for you! I can make you even more powerful! I can make you the strongest witch this world has ever seen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria coldly replied, \"No\", and made one final effort. Screaming, Who Dwells Outside vanished in a puff of fire.  Maria sank to her knees, smoke rising from her body. Stacy alit on the floor beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you kill it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Maria. \"A thing like it can't be killed. But I have banished it from our world forever. It can never return here. That's as complete a victory as we could possibly have over a being like that. She looked down at Stacy. \"I could never have done it without you, Stacy.  Thank you so much. I know what it must have cost you to turn down what he offered you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew. And it knew that I knew, but it wanted you to think I didn't. I let you think that I didn't know, because I wanted the decision to be yours. You had to choose loyalty to me freely, and you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shrank herself to Stacy's size and hugged her friend.  A voice came from across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, daughter of Anna, your humble mother begs your assistance in freeing herself from this wall, where you, in your righteous anger, have seen fit to imprison her.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked at her mother. With the disappearance of Who Dwells Outside, her mother had resumed her normal form, but was still stuck to the wall.  Since her mother was addressing her in the formal mode reserved for momentous occasions, Maria responded in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, daughter of Noriko, your loving daughter is at your service, and apologizes for daring to lay hands upon your august person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she freed her mother, and the two women embraced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so proud of you, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love you, too, dear, always and forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stepped back and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Mom, you're all naked. Let me whip up something for you to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gestured, and Anna was clothed in a tee-shirt, blue jeans and sneakers, her hair done up in a pony tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smirked and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty bare yourself, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured, and Maria was clad in a woman's business suit, her hair done in a severe-looking bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at her daughter's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you used the Ring of Oolt-thoor. I wondered what you would choose from what I had in my 'sanctum'.  I might have known that you'd choose the most powerful item in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria blushed, and made to offer the ring to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mom, it seemd like my best choice at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna forestalled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it. You've earned it. It belongs to the stronger witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The stronger witch'? Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you.  You used an item of power to defeat and banish an elder being. You can't do that and remain unchanged. To use a video game  analogy, in terms of raw magickal power, you've moved about ten levels ahead of me. I still have an advantage in knowledge and skill, but it will be my great pleasure to help you surpass me there as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked over at where Stacy was, perched on end table. Maria looked also, then stepped back and re-entered the formal mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honored mother, I beg leave to report that during the recent emergency, I took the step of taking on Stacy, daughter of Vera, as my <i>fa'iit't'aarah</i>. I beg your forgiveness for taking such a momentous step without first consulting you, but the circumstances at the time seemed to call for precipitous action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at her disapprovingly, but Stacy saw a twinkle in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter, given the nature of the situation, and your relative youth and inexperience, I am prepared to overlook your misdeeds just this once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not contain her laughter long, and soon she and Maria were again hugging one another. Anna turned to Stacy, and held out her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, will you please come over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy flew over and alit on Anna's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, I want to thank you for standing by and helping my daughter in what can only have been an extremely trying and traumatic situation. You've joined our family in a most unusual and unexpected way, but I welcome you, and hope that you will come to think of me as of a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am\". said Stacy, touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna turned to George and Vera, who were still motionless on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as for them: I'm not the law, but I'm not of a mind to leave them unpunished. As for their crime of selling you to Who Dwells Outside, one could say they've already paid for it, having lost both their daughter and whatever reward Who Dwells Outside was going to give them. However, there is the crime of murder, for which they have not been punished.  Stacy, I have an idea of how best to punish them.

Stacy couldn't help noticing that, even allowing for the teenager's clothes that Maria had dressed her in, Anna looked hardly any older than Maria.  Anna smiled when Stacy told her this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my normal appearance\", she said. \"You see, we witches age differently than mundanes do.  Well, we age 'normally' until we're about eighteen to twenty. Then we begin to age very slowly - it varies from witch to witch.  It should hit Maria soon. Get used to how she looks now, she probably won't look much different for a century or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that cause problems with people wondering why you never age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Typically when I go out in public, I disguise myself to look more like whatever age I'm claiming at a given point in time. Eventually, when enough time passes, I just use my magic to establish a new identity for myself, and alter memories and records accordingly.  I'm five hundred years old and I've llived in this town for the last hundred and fifty or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hundred forty-three, Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna drove them to a nearby forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like a nice place\", she said. They walked from the car into the woods. It was dark, but Anna cast a spell that enabled them to see clearly. They found a clearing in the forest, and stopped.  Anna had George and Vera stand a good distance apart from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, son of Howard, and Vera, daughter of Eleanor, hear now your sentence, for the crime of murder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you going to do?\"  asked George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not\", said Anna, \"I am no executioner.  Your sentence is to be life imprisonment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" said Anna, casting a spell.  Stacy watched as her parents' clothing disappeared. For a moment, nothing else seemed to happen, but then Stacy noticed that their feet had turned a brownish-gray. Vera shrieked as she felt her  toes and heels extending into roots. Bark appeared on their feet as they began to merge together. The change spread up their thighs as their legs began to merge together to form trunks. As the change moved up their torsos, their arms extended out as if of their own accord, transforming into branches. Leaves grew from what had been their fingers. Finally their heads, too, changed - they had become two smallish oak trees. Ana and Maria worked together to cast a second spell afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna spoke to Stacy:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is their punishment. they are transformed - as permanently as you were. They will live out long lives - and oak trees live a very long time - as part of this forest.  Here, they will be useful to the world around them, which is more than they would have been rotting in a cell somewhere. Maria and I have cast the storngest protective spell we can. They will be safe from fire, disease, insects, even human meddling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they still - human - inside, I mean?\" asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Anna, \"they still have their human 'minds'. They are aware of who they were, and of what they have become. They can even 'talk' to one another, psychically.  Listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy could now hear her parents' voices. they were lamenting their fate, and berating one another for bringing them to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could even speak to them, if you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe someday\", said Stacy, \"but not now, pelase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" Anna gestured, and the voices faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove back to Stacy's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen to ypur home with your family gone?\" asked Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno\", said Stacy. \"As far as I know, I was my parents' sole heir. They weren't much for extended family. I think I have some second cousins on my mother's side, but I've never met them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna thought about it for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go through the house, and see whether there's anything you want to keep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, there wasn't much, mostly a few keepsakes  and heirlooms. A few other things, Maria and Anna kept for their own uses, with Stacy's gladly-given permission. Anna and Maria magically transported the items back to their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for one last big spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna led Maria in an incantation. Her home vanished, and the lots of the neighbors on either side extended to divide what had been her parents' land right down the middle. It was as though the house had never stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't this increase the nieghbors' property taxes, enlarging their lots like that?\" asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I included an element in the spell to adjust their assessments\", said Anna. She addressed Stacy.  In addition to making it as though the house never existed, we've removed all memory and record of you and your parents, except for what we know, of course.  I know it's hard to think that you're forgotten, but it's better than having people going around looking for you. Whoo, I am beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three drove back to the Yoshino home. That night, Stacy slept in Maria's room again, but the next day, Anna magickally added a room onto the back of the house, and furnished it with the things Stacy had taken from her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all rested for a week, but on the morning of the eighth day, Anna smiled amiably at the pair of them after breakfast, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Mighty Sorceress, it's time to step up your training so that you can learn to properly use those vast new powers of yours. Wipe that smirk off your beak, Parrot Girl, you're included in this, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Stacy looked at one another in resignation.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time sped by. Before Stacy knew it, a hundred years had gone by, until now it was 2114. Her life as a human was a long-distant memory. She and Maria had spent twenty years training with Anna, before the latter had declared that there was nothing more that she could teach her daughter. After that, Vieno had consented to take Maria on as an apprentice, which lasted another twenty years.   Initially, this had seemed like an impossibly long time to train. but as Maria said, when one may reasonably anticipate liivng for millennia, twenty years was hardly long at all. Eventually, Vieno, too, professed herself satisfied that Maria had learned what she could teach her. Maria and Stacy had then spent another ten years traveling the world, meeting other witches and other magickal being, leanring what they could from them, before returning home to set up a household of their own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, Maria had, as she had predicted, remained single, although she had from time to time, had \"liaisons\" with various mundane men and male witches (\"Never call them 'warlocks'\", Maria had said.).   Witches tended not to marry much, anyway, Maria had explained. Their long lifespans, made \"happily ever after\" somewhat more problematical than it was for mundanes, who at most only had to put up with one another for a century if they lived that long.  There were a few witch couples that had been \"together\" for centuries, but they were a rarity. If a child resulted from a witch \"liaison\", then custody of said child was something that was typically worked out by the parents, with input from their families, if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWitches were strictly forbidden to marry mundanes - this grew out of the rule that the very existence of witches was to be kept secret from mundanes except under special circumstances.  Had Amanda lives much longer, she would almost certainly have found herself in trouble for her dealings with Stacy's parents.  Stacy was still a little vague on how this rule was enforced, but she knew it was. It occasionally led to some sad situations, but the rule was generally pretty well followed.  As long as he or she didn't break this rule, a witch could have a long-time association with a mundane if they were careful, but this practice was discouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a child resulted from a witch/mundane relationship, its fate would depend on its mother.  The child of a witch father and a mundane mother was wholly a mundane and would always be in the mother's care. If the mother died in childbirth, the child would be given into the custody of its nearest mundane relatives. If none such were available, they were placed with appropriate mundane authorities. It was forbidden for the witch father to take custody of the child. This seemed harsh to Stacy, but the law was generally obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, if the mother was a witch, and the father was a mundane, the child would be wholly a witch. (There was no such thing as a witch/mundane \"hybrid\".)  The mother would have custody of the child as a matter of course. Maria had never heard of a witch dying in childbirth, but she assumed that if such a thing happened,  that the child would be placed with an appropriate witch. In this case, the mother was expected to end the liaison and to never inform the father of the child's existence, as it was felt impossible to conceal the child's magickal nature from a parent.  This meant that alot of witch mothers were effectively single mothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrequently, a female witch who wanted a child (and for whom there was no willing male witch available) would carefully vet prospective male mundanes, selecting one possessing desired appropriate characteristics to father her child. (Non-magickal characteristics were passed along largely according to mundane laws of genetics.)   Maria had been the result of such a choice by Anna. Witches were fertile for a long time, and often spread their families over centuries. Stacy had been surprised to learn that Maria had three older sisters and an older brother:  Sazae (born in 1573), Takashi (born in 1662), Emiko (born in 1808), and  Joanna (born in 1915). She also now had a kid sister, Elizabeth, born in 2034, some twenty years after Stacy's transformation.  The older siblings didn't come around much. By 2114, Stacy had only met Sazae, Joanna and, of course, Elizabeth. Maria herself had met all of her sisters but had never met Takashi. It wasn't that the other siblings were estranged, simply that for witches, absences of decades or even centuries were not uncommon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Some</b> witches carefully planned who would father their children, and when. Maria, on the other hand, had a careless moment with a handsome young fellow during a visit to Hokkaido in early 2098, which resulted in the Christmas Eve birth of her daughter Jennifer.  Despite her lack of preparation, her pregnancy had gone well, with a great deal of help from Stacy, Anna and Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen years later, in 2108, Anna had another daughter, Charlotte, providing Jennifer with an aunt that was younger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Stacy, she had set aside romance, emotional or physical, from her life.  She certainly had no interest in mundane parrots, and she had never encountered a magickal one. She devoted herself to helping Maria and her new \"niece\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, when Jennifer was sixteen, and Charlotte was six, all of Anna's daughters gathered at her house.  Sazae, Emiko, Joanna, Maria, Elizabeth and Charlotte were all there. Only Takashi was absent - he was said to be off in some other realm or other. Because of the nature of witchly aging, Anna and her daughters all looked as though they were within a few years of age of one another.  Jennifer also was present, playing with Charlotte while her grandmother and her other aunts caught up with one another's doings.  Emiko was fascinated to meet Stacy. Of all of Anna's daughters, only Maria had seen fit to take on a <i>fa'iit't'aarah</i>.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pleasant lunch, Anna called over Jennifer and Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, I have to ask you a favor - as you know, the reason we're all gathered here today is because we have to go to the Grand Convocation, and you two are both too young to go. Don't feel bad, it's just going to be a few hours of witches b.s.-ing one another about what great spells they've invented.  You'll both be more than old enough by the time they have the next one, and then you'll find out for yourselves. Anyway, Jennifer, would you mind babysitting your Aunt Charlotte for the afternoon? We should be back by nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Grandma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, Charlotte, will you behave for Jennifer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Jennifer, you know where everything is here, and if there's an emergency, just contact me using that magic cellphone your mother gave you.  Feel free to hang out here, or to go to the Park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Anna and the others took their leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled. All her life she'd heard the story of what had happened to Stacy, and now <b>she</b> was the \"mystical babysitter\".  She turned to her little aunt, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Auntie, do you want to hang out here, or do you want to go to the Park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte smiled at her niece, and said:</span></div></div>",

Stacy couldn't even say a word because she was embarrased and she had blushed also. Amanda turns to Stacy and says. \"Aww, did the baby wet herself. I guess we can't leave you in a dirty diaper, can we?\"<br>\r\nAmanda picks up Stacy and says \"Let me go! This is not funny!\" Amanda ignores her complaining and takes her to the nursery, where she changes her in clean diapers, and put Stacy in the crib, along with the baby toys. Amanda leaves the room and says \"You stay here and play with your toys while I make you something to get.\" Stacy replies and says \"Change me back to normal!\" As Amanda leaves she shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she leaves, Stacy notices that Amanda has left her wand on the table in the room. Before she tries to go get it, the baby toys starts to hypnotize her. She shakes her head and forgets about it. But the toys are very hard to resist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

The wand lay on a table across from her crib, but, how to get to it?  Stacy rolled over awkwardly in her thick diaper, in order to try to get on her knees and then to her feet.  Unfortunately, her motor-skills seemed to have regressed as well, leaving her arms and legs flailing around adorably while she rolls over into the stuffed teddy bear.  Sensing she won\u2019t be able to get any traction that way, Stacy then tries to roll the opposite way, but instead only manages to get an arm and leg entangled in her fuzzy blanket.  She\u2019s getting frustrated and flustered at all her struggling for nothing, and makes little grabbing gestures at the white bars of her crib-prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBaGaBaBa!  Gabagabagaba!  Bwhaaa!  Waa!\u201d, baby Stacy cries out in the empty nursery.  Now she has lost her ability to speak, though her mind remains that of her 16-year-old cheerleader self!  Stacy pleads for Amanda to change her back, but it comes out nonsense baby gabba-goo babble, which utterly horrifies Stacy.  She knows deep down that she might be able to save herself if she can just get to the wand across the room, but getting there before her ward returns seems all but impossible.  Instead, Stacy manages to grasp her pink rubber rattle, and shakes it around triumphantly, as she slowly gives-in to the beguilingly cozy comforts of her teddy bear, blanket, and crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still cooing to herself in the crib minutes later, Stacy realizes that she is thirsty now, and maybe a little gassy or worse, like a poop might be due soon.  Mortified at this new humiliation, Stacy again tries to right herself in her crib, just as Amanda returns carrying a bib and a baby bottle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a good girl!  There\u2019s my Stacy-baby!\u201d coos Amanda to Stacy as she picks her up under her arms and blows kisses and raspberries into her navel, which tickles Stacy like crazy, causing her to spazz-out, wiggling around adorably and laughing like a happy little baby for Amanda.  Then, Amanda playfully tosses Stacy up in the air and catches her, Scaring the bejesus out of her.  She does it again, higher this time, and when poor Stacy lands in her arms this time, it relieves her gas bubble, but also causes her to just slightly poop her diaper.  It\u2019s so thickly padded, it\u2019s totally unnoticeable, but she knows, and can feel the slick spot between her diaper and bottom.  Her secret is so mortifying, Stacy\u2019s baby cheeks turn bright pink.  She is being carried out of the Nursery now, and nestled right next to Amanda\u2019s ample breasts, Stacy forgets instantly about the wand left back in the nursery and again remembers she is thirsty, and begins bawling and pawing at Amanda\u2019s blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amanda smiles down at her and asks, \u201cOh, is Stacy a hungry baby now?  Yes you are!  Yes you are!  See, this weekend babysit won\u2019t be so bad!  You\u2019ll stay out of trouble.  No parties.  No drinking.  And your Auntie Amanda is here the whole time to make sure baby girl gets fed and changed and washed and pampered and loved and hugged like a pretty baby should!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amanda profers a pink baby bottle, but Stacy is still trying to reach out at her tits, to show her that she would rather get her milk from the source.  Amanda laughs at her charge asking Stacy, \u201cWhat if your friends on the cheer team could see you this weekend?  Ha Ha!  Look at you!  So you want some of your babysitter\u2019s milk do you?  Is that right?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She waggled her finger at Stacy. \"No screaming in this house.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, a strange sensation came over Stacy, and she felt a warm liquid pour into her diaper. She had lost control of her bladder! Stacy began to scream again, but she didn't stop wetting herself. She whimpered as her diaper grew so full that it began to hang off her butt. Amanda smiled cruelly and plopped her down on the floor. Stacy moaned in disgust as she squished around in the urine. She sighed as the flow of pee stopped, only to find that it began to build up, and now it hurt because she had to go so bad. Amanda changed her diaper into a much poofier one, and as soon as it was on, Stacy began to wet herself again. Stacy cried and cried and cried, this was so humiliating! \"Stop it!\" she yelled, and this time it sounded like \"stom hit!\" Amanda grinned and snapped her fingers, and Stacy stopped peeing.<br>\r\n\"Alright, Stacy, I'll stop.\" She snapped her fingers again, and Stacy's stomach began to contract. Now she was... Um, you know... Pooping. A lot. Stacy screamed as the warm mush filled the diaper and Amanda said, \"Alright, you big baby... I'll relent a bit.\" Stacy sighed, but she didn't stop pooping, it simply came out much slower. Amanda snapped her fingers and instantly, an identical, but clean, diaper appeared on Stacy. \"Now, honey, it's time for...\"</span></div></div>",

Stacy began to cry and scream and wail, hoping for Amanda to stop and cover her ears and she might be able to escape. However, Amanda finished buckling the straps and leaned close to Stacy. \"Stop yelling,\" she said, \"or you'll regret it.\" Stacy refused. \"Alright then, but you asked for it,\" said Amanda. She smiled cruelly and snapped her fingers. Stacy found that her mouth was closed, and she was unable to open it. Then she felt her stomach knot up, and she felt like she might throw up at any moment. Amanda laughed and said, \"Your mouth can't open, so the puke will stay inside for you to taste. However, there is one way to lessen your punishment... You can either endure the terrible taste in your mouth, with your cheeks so full that they sag and hurt, or you can swallow it, and the amount you swallow will triple and go into some <i>extra special</i> training pants I have for you.

How's your babysitter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine\", said Amanda, still using Stacy's voice, \"She's actually cooler than I thought she would be. She said she didn't care what I did as long as I didn't do anything that got back to my parents. anyway, why don't you come over and hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Miranda. \"Can I bring Abby, too? I was thinking of calling her, anyway.\"  Abigail Nomura was a mutual friend of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Amanda.\"The more the merrier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda and Abigail arrived at Stacy's house about half an hour later. Miranda rang the doorbell, when they received no answer after a few minutes, Miranda tried the doorknob. It was open, so they wen t in. They looked around, but saw no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy? You here?\", said Miranda. \"You left the door unlocked again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys!\", came Stacy's voice from upstairs. \"Come on up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door behind them,  Randi and Abby went upstairs. When they reached the top of the stairs, Amanda, who was hiding out of sight, smiled as she watched them. Her eyes glowed bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi's legs seemed to go out from under her. \"What the heck?\",  she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby looked at her friend in surprise.\"Randi, are you alrah- Ah gah? wah gah bah bha bah?\"   she put her hand to he throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi looked up at her friend. \"What did you say?\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah gah gah-gah wahhhh!\", wailed Abby. try as she might, she could no longer make her mouth form words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi tried to get to her feet, but found that she could no longer stand upright. Abby continued babbling incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abby, help me up, would you?\", said Randi.  Abby tried to help her friend, but found that she could no longer control her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Interesting how the spell affects them both differently</i>, thought Amanda, still watching from out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Randi said,\"Hey, Stacy, give us a hand would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no response came, Randi began to be worried. <i>What's going on here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccepting the inevitable, she crawled along on all fours in the direction of Stacy's room. Abby followed her, still babbling non-stop. As they moved down the hall, their clothing disappeared, replaced by diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell?\", said Randi. Now she was really scared. Whatever was going on here wasn't natural.  \"Stacy? Stacy? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah bah gah!\", added Abby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved down the hall, Randi noticed that everything seemed to be getting bigger around her and Abby. she looked at Abby, and gaped.  Abby was not only getting smaller, she was getting younger. She looked about eleven years old!  Randi looked at her own body. she was getting younger, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi was distracted by Abby falling down onto all fours. Randi tried to console her friend as she began to cry. they continued to grow younger, until they were both infants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Amanda came down the hall, and picked up Abby in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who are you? where are you going with her?\", demanded Randi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda cooed at Abby until she stopped crying, and then put he into a crib which had materialized next to Stacy's.  Then she went back int the hall and picked up Randi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the babysitter\", said Amanda, finally answering Randi's question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Babysitter'?\", said Randi. \"What kind of baby sah -? Sah! Sah ah gah!\"  As Abby had before her, Randi found herself unable to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda set her down in a crib next to Stacy's and Abby's.

Ah gah bah?\" She grasped at her throat.  \"Wah bah gahhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda watched with amusement as Dolores dropped to her hands and knees.  Her distress as her clothing was replaced by a diaper and she de--aged to infancy was funny to Amanda.  Amanda picked up to the now-infant Dolores, and thought to herself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Little did she know that when she was delivering that package, she was delivering herself, as well.  Hmm, I'd better get rid of that delivery truck.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother spell, and the delivery truck drove itself away. It would park itself several miles away.

She conjured up a double-sized baby carriage, and began pushing it down the street. As she was walking along, she saw two twelve year-old girls walking towards her, one redhead and one blonde. These were Bridget O'Halloran and Louise Jensen, two friends walking home  from dance practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's eyes glowed red, and the two girls stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\", Bridget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDah bah ah!\", replied Louise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the baby carriage, they fell into  it. At first they looked grossly out-sized for it, but they quickly shrank as they de-aged.  Soon they were both infants. Amanda began pushing the baby carriage and began walking back to Stacy's house. An older woman who was passing by looked into the carriage, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What lovely babies? Are they yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no\", said Amanda. \"I'm just watching them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the house, Amanda put Bridget and Louise into cribs next to Dolores, Stacy, Miranda and Abigail.  She sent them to sleep, and then went downstairs to watch TV for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, she went back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Their memories should be gone by now.</i>, she thought, <i>I'd best go deliver the goods now. I wonder if the people here will ever figure out what happened to these girls? Probably they'll never guess.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke a spell, and she, the six babies, and the cribs disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and her cargo reappeared in a small hut that looked like something out of a \"Lord of the Rings\" knock-off. A small, rat-faced man greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amanda, you got the goods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Vlad, I sure do. Six baby girls, all untraceable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, let me check 'em out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVlad looked at the girls closely, and made a few mystical passes over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\", he said. \"You've delivered the goods, for sure. Here's your payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a quart-sized bottle of a pink liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Amanda, her eyes widening, \"I'll never call you a cheapskate, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always deliver the goods, Amanda, so I like to keep you sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", said Amanda. \"Keep me in mind if you ever need anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\", said Vlad, \"Bye now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda vanished. Vlad chuckled. He <b>had</b> paid her more than they'd agreed, but it still wasn't as much as he'd make for these babies.  There were plenty of people in his world who wanted to adopt babies, who, for one reason or another, couldn't adopt legally.  For them, a black market dealer in untraceable babies from other dimensions was a source of last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty-One Years Later:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drifted off to sleep on the evening of her twenty-first birthday, Mariella Driftwood (<i>n\u00e9e</i> Amberstar) happily patted her six months pregnant belly, and thought about where her life had taken her.   Her parents,  Arnulf and Pierella Amberstar were bakers to the court of  the Duke of Highwater, and she had grown up surrounded by the smell of fresh baked good. Bakers would never be nobility, but court-endorsed bakers were the most comfortable of the artisanal classes, and Mariella had grown up lacking for nothing.  She had married at sixteen, as most girls did, and her husband, Randolph Amberstar, was the son of the court-endorsed stonemason. He was a good match class-wise, and she liked him, as well.   The baby she was expecting would be her third - she had a four year-old daughter, and a two year-old son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she was adopted, her parents had told her when they she was old enough to know.  She had been found after the Great Flood of '49, and, by all accounts, her entire native village had been wiped out.  She would never know who her biological parents were, but she didn't care, Arnulf and Pierella were all the parents she would ever need, and were good grandparents to her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Mariella had a bizarre dream, a dream of herself as a young girl named \"Stacy\", living in a strange world where everything was different in a place called \"America\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, when she woke up, she remembered the dream vividly.  It seemed so real. But it couldn't be, could it?  She thought about what her parents had told her about her origins.  She'd heard the stories about black market babies being kidnapped from other worlds.  Could she have been one of those? If she was, did it matter?  Of course, it might have just been a strange dream. Should she talk to her mother about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mariella wasn't able to go see her mother right away. She was busy for several days. During her days, she took care of her children, and worked on the accounting side of her husband's family's masonry business.   Each night, though, she dreamt of life as \"Stacy\", each night's dream more vivid and detailed. She didn't tell Randolph about it, and he didn't seem to pick up on it. If he did think she was out of sorts, he put it down to her pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a day off came, and Mariella took her daughter Jehanna and her son, Xandro to see her parents.  Grandpa Arnulf took the children to \"help\" him bake up some pastries, while Mariella sat down to have a chat with her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I ask you something personal?\", asked Mariella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, dear\", replied Pierella. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there anything...odd..about my adoption?\", asked Mariella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you ask?\", said Pierella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella told her mother about her dreams.  Pierella looked away from her, as if thinking of escape, and then sighed, as if she'd made a painful decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariella, I'm really not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Not sure'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain\", said her mother.   You know that  when I was a little girl, I got the Garthik Plague.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella nodded. Garthik Plague was a virulent disease, that tended to be fatal to people that were old or sick. People it didn't kill, it frequently left sterile. There'd been a big outbreak of it back in '32, when her mother was young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I married your father, it soon became obvious that your father and I couldn't have children. That wasn't odd, there were a lot of us like that. The problem was, when we tried to adopt, we found that there was a huge, lengthy waiting list. It would be literally years before we could get a baby.  Then there came the Great Flood of '49, and suddenly there were a number of orphaned infants available to adopt. While we were sad about the people who'd been killed, but we couldn't help being happy about the fact that there was a baby available that we wouldn't have to wait years for. Now, years later, we heard rumors that some of the babies that became available at that time might have been smuggled black market babies, and not genuine orphans of the Flood. I guess when there's a major disaster like that, it makes things easier for them to 'process' babies that don't have proper papers, so they'll often try to take advantage of those situations.  We didn't believe it - we didn't <i>want</i> to believe it. so we just didn't think about it.  But, these dreams of yours. maybe that means it was true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella sat, stunned and speechless.  Finally, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...that's..I mean...it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPierella took her daughter's hand. \"Please understand, when we adopted you, we had no idea about any of this. It was only later that we had any idea about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Momma\", said Mariella, embracing Pierella, \"I don't blame <b>you</b>. I just would like to know who this 'Stacy was. I don't want to go back to her life, or anything like that. My life here is better than her life was, and I would never want to leave Randolph and the kids behind.  But I would like to know how it all happened. Also, 'Stacy' had a mother and father, I can't help thinking how they must have felt when their daughter disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPierella nodded sympathetically.  \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

I'll contact her, and let you know when we can go see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, thanks, Mother\", said Mariella. \"Can we keep this between ourselves, if possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\", said Pierella. \"I won't even tell your father unless and until we need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella visited with her parents as though nothing had been said.

Mariella arranged to have Randolph's mother babysit her kids, and went to her mother's home.  There, she found her mother sitting with an older woman that she recognized as Gloriana, the Duke's personal sorceress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them sat over tea and cakes, chatting about local gossip, until finally Gloriana brought up the reason they were all there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Mariella, Pierella's told me about your dreams lately, and the concerns you have about them. Now, let me say this up front, just to put your mind at ease: I've taken a discreet look into this situation in an official capacity, and I've made an official determination that your parents acted in good faith in adopting you.  So, don't worry about this coming back to haunt them..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, thank you\", said Mariella, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That said\", continued Gloriana, \"I'd like to touch your mind, so I can get a direct look at these dreams you've been having. Don't worry, it'll be gentle, and I promise it won't have any effect on the baby you're carrying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then\", said Mariella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I stay\", asked Pierella, \"or do you need me to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can stay\", said  Gloriana. \"In fact, I prefer to have a family member present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need me to do?\", asked Mariella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sit back and get comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella sat back in her chair. Gloriana moved onto the chair next to her, and reached out and touched Mariella's forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariella found her dreams of her life as Stacy replaying in her mind, only now she had Gloriana watching them with her. When the dreams had all played out, Gloriana sat back, looking thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find anything useful?\", asked Pierella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed\", said Gloriana. \"You were indeed kidnapped from another world, as were five others. and this Amanda, she is known to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be possible to find the others?\", asked Mariella.  \"Maybe even contact my birth parents - and the others' families - so they know what happened to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your second question: Probably not. It seems like there's no native magic in your birth world, and usually, it's forbidden to let people in worlds like that know that magic is real.  I'll check with the Magisterium to see what the ruling is, but I wouldn't hold out much hope for that.  Also, you might want to think about the effect it might have on those people. they've had twenty-one years to deal with your disappearances. It might be upsetting to them to have those old wounds re-opened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloriana sat back, and then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for finding the others, it might be possible. If you're getting your memories back, the others might be, too.  Of course, it's possibly they might not all have been sent to this world.  If would be good if we could talk to Amanda, she might be able to tell us a lot. that might not be so easy, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\", asked Mariella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloriana said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Amanda's made an eerie red glow, the world around Stacey gave out a mesmeric effect on her. She felt her clothes sinking to the ground. At first, she thought she was being sucked into a black hole, but then she saw what looks like Amanda was growing. There was only one explanation for all this. She was being turned into a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the sudden, the sight of Amanda and background faded. Memories of her past started flashing before her eyes, but they seemed to go backwards rapidly, fading. Stacey started to get really scared. Not only was she losing her teenage dignity, but also any memory of it. By the time her 7th grade memories faded away, her chest has flattened back into that of a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Amanda! Please! I'll eat the baby food! I'll never betray you or my parents again. just please don't take my life away!\" she begged. All she could hear was the rushing of her visions of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a memory from 4th grade zoomed in. \"Stacey!\" Stacey thought she was hearing voices until she heard the voice again. \"Stacey!\" it was her mother. She seemed tall to her with her 4th grade body. \"I can't believe you lied to us! I wish you were a baby again so I can raise you right!\" The memory then faded and the images went back to their normal speed. She couldn't believe it. She has lied to her mother and father before. In fact, she did it very often. Maybe it was the punishment from Amanda, but Stacey felt a tear leak through eye. She has lied to her parents to the point where they can't trust her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories started to become more obscured as her mind got weaker and so did her legs. She fell over backward. She expected to feel the floor, but she felt a soft fabric instead. It didn't take sight to know it was her over-sized clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There that was better, wasn't it?\" Stacey heard another voice. She thought it was her mom, but it was Amanda. The images faded back into the background which lost most of it's ominous effect. It was now a lot bigger and so was Amanda. Amanda pointed her index finger upward when the tip began to glow a light green. Stacey felt something constrict her. It was her panties. It shrunk until it fitted around her waist. The fabric thickened until it has become a diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda lost her demonic features and gave a short smile before she picked her up. She reminded her of something when she said, \"Time for your snack.\"</span></div></div>",

To make matters worse for her, she began shrinking. All of her clothes began slipping off...all except her panties, which were thickening into a very bulky diaper. It also became evident that she was regressing as well, as she could see her memories fly by much like Stacy did.<br>\r\nSpeaking of, while Amanda was having <i>her</i> issues, Stacy was screaming her head off. Why? Well, imagine having memories somehow being retrieved and being brought back into your brain <i>all at once.</i> Obviously your brain couldn't possibly handle it. Which is why Stacy eventually passed out.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nEventually Stacy awoke and the first thing she did was vomit. Luckily, a bucket was right next to her. Once her vision was focused, she saw a girl in a black robe. \"Oh, thank goodness you're alive!\" Stacy didn't know who this girl was until she remembered what happened earlier. \"Amanda?\" \"Yes. Turns out my wand overheated and everything back-fired.\" Stacy couldn't believe it. The mean old witch that made her evening a living hell was now nothing more than an adorable 13 year old girl. Stacy also finally realized that she was back to her normal age...sort of. She was about 16 now and still wearing a diaper, one that was used quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Amanda said speaking up, \"I'd like to apologize for what I did earlier.\" \"I'm sorry, what?\" Stacy furiously stood up, although balancing was difficult due to the fact her brain was still recovering a bit. It was then that Stacy could see that Amanda was pretty small, around 2'10\" - 3'1\". \"You turned me into a baby, tried to force me to eat baby food, and you want forgiveness?\" Amanda actually looked scared. \"Stacy, please, calm down! I know what I did was horrible and I actually had worse planned for you. I deserve any punishment you have for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Stacy's shock, Amanda handed the wand to her. She took the wand and began to think of what she should do.<br>\r\nCould it be a trap? No, Amanda would've changed herself back. Not to mention she actually does look sorry.<br>\r\nHowever, Stacy really wants to get back at Amanda.</span></div></div>",

When she opened one of her eyes, however, she saw that the only magic Stacy did was to change her own diaper...and slightly thicker. \"I don't understand--\" Amanda began, only to be stopped by Stacy putting a finger to her lips. \"Revenge doesn't solve anything. I forgive you, Amanda, but I certainly don't trust you.\" The small 13 year-old couldn't help but hug Stacy and say \"Thank you!\" several times as she cried a bit into the former victim's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Stacy used the wand to clean up any messes made as Amanda silently watched. After cleaning the kitchen, Stacy couldn't help but ask \"So, what's with the robe?\" Amanda blushed at the question. \"I don't have anything else that fits me,\" opening up her robe and revealing her petite breasts and a diaper almost ready to burst, \"Besides the diaper, anyway.\" Stacy was a bit horrified by the state of the girl's diaper. \"Good lord, Amanda, why didn't you tell me you needed a change?!\" \"I-I was too nervous...\" It was at this point that Stacy could see how different her former baby-sitter was now. Instead of a rotten, old witch, she was an adorable, timid teenager. Stacy sighed. \"Well, let's get you changed.\" She led Amanda to the living room and instructed her to lay down as Stacy made baby powder, wipes, and a thick, small diaper appear. In seconds, Amanda was in a fresh, new diaper. \"Better?\" Stacy asked. Amanda smiled and said \"Better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Amanda's breasts made Stacy wonder something. When Amanda left the room, she pulled out the wand and focused slightly, causing its tip to glow. Suddenly, Stacy's shirt started feeling tight. She looked down and saw that her breasts were growing. She let this go on until all the buttons on her shirt popped off, revealing her new bosoms covered by the unfortunate bra that has to hold them. Next, Stacy focused on her butt with the wand and watched as it slowly started growing as well, her diaper stretching to fit. It grew until it was big enough to give Stacy a perfect hourglass figure. It wasn't long after that Amanda walked in, holding a tray with two glasses of soda and a plate of cookies. \"Hey, made us some cookies--\" she stopped as she saw Stacy's huge new curves and fainted, Stacy using the wand to stop the tray from falling and move it to the table. She looked at the wand, then at the mirror and said \"I'm going to have so much fun.\"</span></div></div>",

She had to keep her situation under <i>her</i> control, not Amanda's. She continued to moan and groan, just as Amanda was about to rifle through the green bag. At last, the babysitter seemed to take notice of her baby, and dropped what she was doing. Stacy saw her raise that magic finger in the air, and Amanda let out a perturbed sigh. Yes, yes! It was all going according to plan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this will have to do...!\", Amanda sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy opened her mouth to moan again, but suddenly found it filled.

Her black flowing hair had become even longer, and Stacy could have easily mistaken her for a fellow classmate. Amanda, after turning to Stacy, then looked back in the hall mirror, admiring herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I haven't looked like this for ten years! Hee-hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer coquettish laugh almost scared Stacy. But how was this an answer to <i>her</i> problems?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's how its going to work now. This is our story. I'm going to mesmerize your dear head of attendance, Mr... Dackle, if I remember? into letting you off for the week. I've got my ways. In the meantime, you're coming with me to catch up on your schooling. As a baby! I'm sure they'd understand the desperate plea of a poor teenage mother, who can't leave her growing baby all alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter wrung through the house with a metallic tone. Ironically, it sent most of the house haywire! The TV flickered on, and a rerun of \"The Wizard of Oz\" was playing. How delightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, my favorite! Come on, little Stacy, let's watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just so happened that Stacy abhorred The Wizard of Oz, and that was her first crime in two respects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. It happened that Amanda caught Stacy from running from the movie, and immediately sent her to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. It was the first lie and deceit Stacy had played against her parents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun rose, it was just in time. Stacy awoke not in her bed, in her house, but in school grounds. She took last night for disbelief, until she realized she wasn't the one walking. Strapped to Amanda's back was Stacy, and they were parading to Stacy's first class, which, magically, Amanda seemed to have! I guess the body of the 18-year old was good for more than one thing!</span></div></div>",

It was lucky as well she'd been this close to the ground. Weaving and dodging her way through the crowd, Stacy noticed quite a few familiar faces, all of them staring at her little baby body. If only they knew, she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at last, as she thought she'd gotten far enough away, she realized she was now useless without Amanda to change her back, if she did. She wanted to cry, and in doing so, she attracted attention. Particularly of a certain Trenton Maxwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrenton was Stacy's ex-boyfriend. He'd been the best one of them, and it really hurt when they broke up. And it was all her fault. Thanks to her cronic lying, she'd broken the trust, and heart, of poor Trenton. Now, they could barely look at each other without disgust. And yet, he still picked up little Stacy, and stared into her eyes. They still bore that kind, special glint of a relationship long past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt, of course, didn't take Trenton long to figure out the baby's owner. Amanda had practically left a huge ruckus once she figured out Stacy was gone. Trenton held Stacy close, and Amanda noticed the two. She walked over kindly, trying to maintain the charm and appeal of her young body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\", Amanda stated in true young charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrenton looked towards Amanda in an awed manner. An awed manner which struck Stacy, his ex who'd broken up with <i>him</i>, nasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, um, here's your baby, safe and sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's not my baby, she's just a friend's... I'm not like that... yet. I'm Amanda, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Trenton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook her hand as he passed off Stacy, but it didn't feel like a handshake should... There was a certain degree of lust in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda walked off with Stacy, scolding her, a sudden decision by Trenton shocked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe babysitter turned, pleased in a sickening way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if it's not too much trouble, would you...?\"</span></div></div>",

She looked down and saw the diaper white and puffy between her legs. \u201cOH MY GOD that was real I thought I was dreaming\u201d she said. Looking up a little she saw she was wearing a cute purple Dora the explorer shirt. She got up and started to walk to her closet to find something else to wear. As she got to the closet and opened the doors she looked at a closet for a little 5-6 year old girl\u2019s closet. It had puffy little princess dresses, more formal dresses and little girl tee shirts all looked to be about her sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was looking she heard her door knob turn and looked at the door as it opened. There in the door way stood Amanda. She walked up to Stacy with a big grin on her face. Stacy blurted out\u201d what did you do with all my clothes and why am I still in this diaper?\u201d gesturing to the diaper but knowing not to touch it. Amanda told her\u201d well my dear those are your new clothes tell I decide you are a big girl, oh and I completed your other request while I was at it.\u201d Stacy looked confused for a second and thought about it, she could not come up with a request she asked for. She skeptically looked at Amanda and asked \u201cwhat other request?\u201d Amanda replyed in a tone like it was common knowledge \u201c why you started to cry out for mommy and because she was gone I changed it so everyone but us will think that I am your mommy that way when you call out to mommy you will be in everybody else\u2019s eyes be referring to me. And so it looked more real so it comes as no surprise later for you everyone will treat you like the little girl you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumb founded by this Stacy stared in awe stricken terror at Amanda. \u201cy-you didn\u2019t, y-you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d was all Stacy could say. \u201cThat was nothing, if you be a good girl that is all that will happen to you but if you act up and be a bad little girl then I will start taking away more of your grown up abilities and making this room more suiting for you.\u201d Amanda said with a smile on her face and pep in her step she left Stacy in the room to return to other things.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stacy flinched, but accepted the comfort. Amanda shifted Stacy so that her head was resting comfortably on her shoulder. She rubbed her back, humming lullabies.

She got up to put the teenage baby in her playpen, but stopped. Stacy began to cry. Amanda was concerned. \"What's wrong now?\" she asked. \"No be alone.\" Stacy cried out, burying her face in Amanda's shoulder. Amanda sighed, and went up to Stacy's nursery.

Are you ready for lunch?\" I asked. Stacy nodded, and I picked her up. I sat her on my lap on my couch, and I began to feed her. A few hours later, I looked at the clock, and saw that it was 7. I fed Stacy dinner, and sat her on my lap. I cradled the sleepy girl, and talked to her softly. She yawned, and I knew it was time to put her down for the night. I carried her to her nursery, and changed her. I put her in a pink butterfly onesie, and put a matching pacifier in her mouth. I kissed her forehead, and put her in her crib. I walked downstairs, and sat down to watch a movie. I heard Stacy start crying, but she then stopped. I ran to her nursery, and opened the door. I saw...</span></div></div>",

I began rocking her, humming. She yawned behind her paci, and snuggled into my chest. I smiled. As I went to put Stacy in her crib, she began whimpering. I continued to comfort the baby. I figured the best time to put her down for night night was when she was in a deep sleep. I sat in the rocking chair, and hummed, gently rocking.

Stacy smiled a little smile and Amanda picked her up. She carried the baby to the changing table and lay her down. Amanda snapped, and Stacy giggled up at her. Amanda took off Stacy's onesie, followed by her diaper. She smiled with satisfaction, seeing a small drop of red. The punishment had been set. \"Now you have to deal with menstruation. The only difference is that yours will be longer than a week.\" Amanda said. She wiped off Stacy, put a new diaper on her, and changed her into a red onesie. \"And now, since you're dressed in red, the blood can't be seen.\" Amanda said, with just an undertone of evil. She picked up Stacy and lay her down on the floor. Amanda started tickling Stacy's foot, causing her to giggle. \"Drip, drip, drip. That's how it goes. Over and over until you're red.\" Amanda said. She tickled Stacy's stomach, using a spell along with it to speed up the flow of blood. She picked up Stacy, putting a hand under the front of her diaper. She gave it a little pinch, and when she looked back at her fingers, she could see some blood. \"Perfect.\" Amanda said, laying the baby in the crib, on a waterproof fitted sheet adjusted to the mattress. Amanda gave a final, gentle squeeze to Stacy's midsection, causing her to giggle more. But also bringing on more blood.<br>\r\nThe next few hours were quite peaceful for Amanda. Stacy had slept since noon, and it was nearing six. Amanda went upstairs to get Stacy before dinner. Stacy smiled at Amanda as she picked her up. \"Hello, my little bleeder.\" Amanda cooed. She looked at the sheet and could see a patch of blood shaped similarly to the bottom half of Stacy's torso. She lay the baby on the changing table and removed her onesie. Stacy's diaper was all around red, being covered in blood. Amanda laughed quietly, and took off the diaper. Stacy's bum, legs and part of her belly was covered in dry blood. Amanda took Stacy into the small adjoining bathroom, put Stacy in the tub and washed her. She dabbed her off with a towel and took her back to the nursery for a diaper and onesie change. Amanda tickled Stacy some more and carried her downstairs to feed her.<br>\r\nOn the second day, Stacy had become miserable. She was experiencing cramps, and of course bleeding. \"Aw.\" Amanda said when she picked Stacy up from her crib that morning. \"Looks like my little bleeder pooped too.\" Amanda tickled Stacy through the changing, bringing an onslaught of giggles, pee and some more blood. She threw the diaper away and changed Stacy into a new diaper, pulling some rubber pants over it. She put Stacy in a red dress and carried her downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or else mommy will give baby a longer punishment.\" Amanda said. She picked Stacy up, holding her under her waist. \"Now listen, mommy doesn't like to hurt you. But mommy will do that, if baby is a bad girl.\" Amanda said. She lay Stacy back down, making faces at her. Stacy giggled, and Amanda picked up her feet again. \"Good girl. Now hold still so mommy can change you.\" Amanda said. She wiped Stacy, re diapered her and dressed her back in a red onesie. \"Now, if you're good today, mommy will stop your punishment. So be a good girl.\" Amanda said. Stacy's head stayed still, but her eyes said that she agreed. \"Good baby. Come on, we have to run out to the store.\" Amanda said.<br>\r\nStacy started crying. Amanda picked her up, shushing her, shooting her a warning look. Stacy stopped, and Amanda put her back in her carseat. \"Good.\" she said.<br>\r\nLater that evening, Amanda ran a bath. \"Ok, if you keep still in the tub with mommy, I'll stop the punishment.\" she said. Stacy sucked her thumb, looking up at Amanda. Amanda picked up Stacy and stepped into the bath. She held Stacy's hands in hers, and sat the baby down below her waist. \"Yes, good girl.\" Amanda said, washing Stacy. She rinsed her and set her in the baby tub, and cleaned herself. \"You are a good girl, Stacy.\" Amanda said. She put a towel around them, and went to dress Stacy in her pajamas for bed. Amanda snapped, and the punishment ended. \"You deserved this. Good baby.\" Amanda cooed.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't risk Stacy growing up and remembering what Amanda really was. So, with a snap of her fingers, Amanda had regressed Stacy back to just a few weeks old. \"Now you're going to remain this age for quite some time. I will erase your memory, if I ever decide to progress your age.\" Amanda said. She cleaned up the young baby as she wriggled about. \"Now, now. Mommy's almost done.\" Amanda said. She took some diaper rash cream on her finger and rubbed it over Stacy's diaper area. \"Good, good little one.\" Amanda said, bringing the clean diaper onto Stacy. Amanda picked up Stacy, setting her in the basinet, and went to wash her hands. She came back, looking fifteen years younger. \"I've made myself twenty six.\" Amanda said. \"I must say, I think I look gorgeous.\" She picked up Stacy and went downstairs to feed her. \"You can't eat solids anymore, so would you like formula or breastmilk?\" Amanda asked. Stacy whined, shifting herself towards Amanda's breast. \"Ok, breastmilk it is.\" Amanda said. She opened her shirt and bra, and fed Stacy until she was full. Amanda burped her and put her shirt back to the way it was. \"Was that yummy? I bet you're happy.\" Amanda cooed. \"What should we do today?\"</span></div></div>",

She was just a helpless infant now. She couldn't think like she used to! \"Now I can have some fun with the little baby.\" Amanda said, picking up Stacy. She walked into the kitchen and found some laxatives. She crushed one up, and mixed it in with a bottle of formula.<br>\r\nStacy lay in her crib, wanting to sleep. But her little baby mind wouldn't let her, for some reason. A strange feeling started in her gut. She started to pee, and proceeded to poop. Worse though, because she nearly had diarrhea. If she had her ability to think, she would curse her so bad. But she was reduced to a fully helpless infant. So Stacy lay there and started to wriggle around, finding comfort impossible. She began to cry, and Amanda strutted into the room. She looked into Stacy's crib and saw the poor baby, squirming around in her dirty diaper. \"I think somebody needs a change.\" Amanda said. She watched Stacy for a while longer, stuck in her rather unfortunate situation. \"I should probably change your diaper now. I would rather you have to wait, because I like to watch you suffer. But if I left you like this for too much longer, you'd start to stink up the whole house.\" Amanda taunted. She picked up Stacy and carried her over to the changing table. Stacy cried, kicking her legs when she could. Amanda changed her, and put her back in her crib to sleep. Stacy fell asleep and Amanda left, taking the baby monitor with her.</span></div></div>",

I am sorry about earlier!\" \"Fine....\" she says, \"..but only because you said please and apologized.

If you wet or mess yourself, including bedwetting you will wear diapers the rest of the time. By rest of the time. I mean the rest of the time I am babysitting you.\" She then pulls out a diaper and wipes. Regaining control of yourself, you attempt to crawl away. She just sighs and pulls your pants off as you keep trying to escape. Expertly she removes your wet panties while you are still moving. You try stand up, but your legs won't allow it for unknown reasons. She quickly overpowers you with one hand holding yours together and tapes your hands up against a wall with you laying on the floor. \"Please don't diaper me!\" you beg Amanda. \"Please don't. I didn't mean to have an accident!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy just sighs and tells you to stop because she doesn't want to do a bunch of laundry full of wet clothing. You desperately struggle to free your hands and keep kicking your legs. Suddenly, though you seem to magically lose all control of your legs. You try to scream but your mouth won't open either. Amanda wipes you off with baby wipes and then slides a disposable diaper underneath your butt. She powders you up and puts a little baby oil. The tapes are then connected to the diaper. Looking down it looks childish. It obviously isn't a baby brand, since it is so big, yet it has cartoon characters. Amanda gets out the tape again and heavily tapes the diaper going around at least 4 times. \"There you won't be taking that off. If you need the bathroom now just use your diaper. \"Now remember no backtalking or breaking the other rules.\" She untapes your hands and walks away leaving you stunned.</span></div></div>",

But you won't be able to go until you put on a diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand Diaper  Rule 4: If you don't know how to change yourself you must ask me but I will decide when to change you if that is the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Understand?\" Amanda said, her tone leaving no room to argue.</span></div></div>",

When that finished Julia grabbed out a fresh new baby diaper and some powder. Expertly she quickly powdered the teen and finished taping up the diaper. Julia looked down at Stacy who was looking at the ceiling. She still could not believe she had just changed her teenage friend's diaper! Not only was it a diaper but an actual baby diaper that fit her! Julia looked over Stacy some more and couldn't help but think her friend looked cute.

He had a gun and was about to shoot Stacy when Amanda turned him also into a mere infant. She snapped again and he was now in a full diaper. It took a minute before he started crying and squirming. Amanda put Stacy back in her bouncer and picked up her new baby. She changed his diaper, all the while patronizing him about how bad it smelled. Amanda put her new son in a playpen and picked up his jacket. She found his wallet and took out his driver's license. \"Henry.\" she said. Amanda's new son looked over at her. \"Henry, you be a good boy for mommy, or your punishment will be a big, poopy diaper. Ok?\" Amanda said. Henry tried to nod, but couldn't. \"Let's make you a bit younger.\" Amanda said. She snapped and Henry was now just three months old. She snapped again and his brown hair was all gone.

Now, he was just a tiny, bald baby. \"Stacy bear, I'm going to have to make you younger too.\" Amanda said. She snapped and Stacy was now three months old as well. Amanda put her babies in the playpen and watched as they fell asleep. \"Oh, my sweet little babies.\" Amanda said. She kissed their foreheads and went to the kitchen to make a phone call.<br>\r\nWhen the babies woke up, they were crying. Amanda picked them both up and took them to the nursery. She put Henry and Stacy on the changing tables and started on Stacy. After changing her dirty diaper and dressing her, Amanda put Stacy in her crib. Amanda went over to the second changing table, where Henry was. She stood him up and turned him around. He had pooped through his onesie. There was poop on the front of his onesie too. Amanda took off his onesie, threw it in the hamper and looked at Henry. His legs were almost covered in poop, the front of his diaper and the top of his diaper. \"Henry, how in the world did you do this?\" Amanda asked, opening her son's diaper. She picked him up and put him in the bathtub. Holding Henry up, Amanda turned the faucet on lightly. Water came out and Amanda stood Henry. She held his torso, from the bottom of his nipples all the way to the top of his legs, under the faucet. The green poo started washing off of him. Amanda turned Henry over so his bum was under the faucet. She washed Henry's back and bum and turned off the water. Amanda picked up Henry, holding him at arms length, back to the nursery. She threw out his diaper, laid a towel on top of his changing table and took a new diaper out. She dabbed Henry off with a washcloth, until he was dry, and took out a wipe. Amanda lifted Henry's backside gently by his ankles and wiped hid crotch, front to back. After cleaning him,Amanda put some baby powder on him and taped his diaper on. Amanda put a clean onesie on Henry and picked him up. She went over to Stacy and picked her up too. \"Babies, daddy's coming home tonight.\" Amanda said.</span></div></div>",

She was so entranced by the pretty light that her butt landing heavily on the hard floor took her completely by surprise. Stunned for a few seconds, her rapidly reddening screwed-up face let out a wail of pain as a dark patch began to make itself apparent on her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Amanda, stifling fits of laughter, was preparing Stacy's new necessary peripherals: a pack of magically-enlarged diapers and similarly-enlarged baby toys spilled forth from her own magically-enhanced bag. She was deliberately taking her time, having decided that a few minutes in the urine-soaked clothing was exactly what Stacy deserved for her attitude. She was picturing the delicious scene of the \"responsible\" young woman explaining why her favourite, moderately expensive, trousers were thus soaked to her parents, making a mental note to leave the offending items where her parents would notice them the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy had by now settled to silence, having crammed as much of her left hand into her mouth as she could, the occasional sniffle still escaping from the red-faced young woman. Her eyes and ears were drawn to the rattling of a plastic ring of keys, dangled tantalisingly over her face by an unrecognisable big person. Successfully grabbing the keys with her right hand, she shook her upper body violently in a zealous effort to replicate the rattle, before curiously substituting her drool-covered fingers with the ring. Her eager tongue enjoyed the smooth and unfamiliar texture of the plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention duly drawn, Amanda had little trouble removing Stacy's shoes, jeans, and underwear, cleaning the appropriate areas properly, and placing a diaper over her exposed nether regions. After contemplating for a moment, she magicked away her bra from underneath her shirt as well. The cool breeze of the air conditioning caressing her now-bare legs caused Stacy to giggle around the keys, enthusiastically waving her feet in the air and barely avoiding clonking the retreating Amanda on the head with her heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a safe distance away from the infantile 18-year-old, Amanda considered her options...</span></div></div>",

This is just something that happens to all babies.\" she responds gently. You begin to whimper and kick. Amanda just simply grabs your legs, and removes your diaper. She changes you, and dresses you in a light yellow onesie. The material is very soft, kind of like the material of your sweatshirt. \"There, now isn't that better?\" Amanda comes, taking you back over to your crib. She lays you down. You look at Jessica, who gives you a look like 'At least you didn't mess or piss yourself when you were a teenager'. You give her a look that reads 'Well, I'm sorry I was embarrassed'. \"Nighty night, Jessie.

You'll get fat, gassy, nauseous and cranky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month in with twins, yes.

Her belly and breasts seemed to be getting <b>bigger</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's happening to me? Am I having an allergic reaction to something? My belly's so big, I look like I'm six months pregnant!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down in a chair, which creaked under her weight.  At that moment, Jenna Wolfman walked by. Jenna was the head of the school's cheerleading squad, and was dating Steve \"Steak\" Porterhouse, the QB of the school's football team.  Stacy had no special beef with her, but she found her to be a bit of a busybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow', Stacy\", said Jenna, \"You look beat! Can I get you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks, Jenna\", said Stacy. \"I could use a beer to steady my nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna tsk'ed at her.  \"Now, Stacy, you know better than that. No alcohol for you mommies-to-be! I'll get you a lemonade.\" Jenna flounced off before Stacy could answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?', said Stacy aloud.  \"Was she trying to be funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she wasn't\", said a voice from behind her.  Stacy whirled around in the chair. Jessica was standing right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Jess, you startled me!\", said Stacy.  \"You gotta me, something's wrong with me! I'm all bloated up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Jenna returned with a bottled lemonade.  \"Here you go, Stace\", she said, not seeming to notice Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy thanked her and watched as Jenna flounced off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jess, she completely blew you off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just didn't see me\", said Jessica. \"Anyway, you're not bloated, you're six months pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Pregnant?' Jess, what the heck are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me explain\", said Jessica. \"Look at me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked at the other girl.  To her shock, the other girl's blurred and changed, becoming completely different. yet somehow familiar. She - she looked like an eighteen year-old version of..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on, here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple. I'm a sorceress Your parents hired me to look after you while they were away, and asked me to teach you some responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sorceress? Are you out of your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still doubt me? Watch me. Ah, the perfect subjects!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda gestured down the hall at little Jill McNab, who was 4' 8\", and Hilda Swenson, captain of the girl's basketball team, who was 6'6\". the two friend were chatting amiably. Amanda gestured, and before Stacy's astonished eyes, Jill began to grow and Hilda began to shrink, until they were both the same height, around 5'7\"\".  The two kept talking, apparently oblivious to the  change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God\", said Stacy. \"How did they not notice what just happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic\", said Amanda.  \"As far as they - and everyone but you and I - are concerned, they're the same height they've always been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all sank in to Stacy's mind.  \"But - it's ridiculous! Why would my parents hire a sorceress to teach me responsibility? Why would a sorceress take a job like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they didn't know I was a sorceress\", said Amanda. \"I told them I was a youth counselor. And I took the job because I was bored. the problem with immortality is filling your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're teaching me responsibility by making me pregnant? I'm pretty sure that's not what my parents would have wanted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they wouldn't, but I believe in giving extra value. And what's a bigger responsibility than raising a child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, a joke's a joke\", said Stacy., \"But you can't <b>do</b> this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can and I have\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <b>un</b>do it! Please!\", said Stacy, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\", said Amanda. \"Not going to happen. Anyway, it won't be so bad. I looked over your friends, and it seems to me that a lot of them could use a lesson in responsibility, too, so I made several of them pregnant, too. This party is now a combined baby shower for you all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Several'?\", said Stacy. \"How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven! Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll show you.  Upsy-daisy\", said Amanda, helping to lift Stacy out of the chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how is it my clothes still fit?\". asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I altered them to be maternity clothes.  All part of the service\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda led Stacy to a sitting room where Stacy saw seven of her friends - Mallory Hayes, Gwen Yamaguchi, Vickie Borelli, Wanda Jones, Debbie Martineau, Iris Wang and Ana Castro -  all sitting and chatting, and all just as obviously pregnant as Stacy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God\" said Stacy. \"Wait, who are the fathers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that party you threw that got your parents so mad? You and the Mommy Squad here got drunk and slept with those college boys that Jimmy Andrews 'invited' along.  None of you even know the names of the fathers. Not to worry, all of your babies will be born happy and healthy, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, none of that ever happened! At least, I know that I never slept with anyone that night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no?\" said Amanda. \"Think back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy thought back to that night, but found her memories strangely foggy. Instead, she remembered waking up hung over the next morning, and her horrified realization about a month later that she was pregnant, her parents' less-than-thrilled reaction, her stubborn insistence that she would keep her baby, and the minor uproar when it became general knowledge that eight girls had gotten pregnant that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that never happened!\" she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has, now\", said Amanda.  \"I can re-write history on a small scale like that. Also, I gave all eight of you an overwhelming compulsion to keep and raise your babies yourselves.   You'll all give birth about two weeks after high school graduation. You'll learn about responsibility together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you're a fine one to teach anyone about responsibility, Amanda!\"  Amanda and Stacy both whirled as a voice came from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl stood behind them, who somehow looked to Stacy as though she were eighteen and eight hundred at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mariam!\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her?\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could call her my boss\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\", said Mariam, \"and as your boss, I'm wondering why you're here interfering with mortals instead of carrying out your responsibility to guard the Gate of Elthaar! Did you know that a Meta-Kobold escaped on your watch? I know it, because I just spent five hours tracking and capturing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..um--uh..\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it\", said Mariam, \"while I work out your punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,  ma'am\", said  Stacy, \"but can you undo what Amanda did to me and my friends.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", replied Mariam, \"there are both practical and ethical issues with undoing a pregnancy spell, so I'm afraid you'll all just have to lump it. Anyway, Amanda was right about one thing. You and your friends do need lessons about responsibility, even if <i>she</i> had no business trying to teach you about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariam turned to Amanda.  \"I've decided on your punishment. First, I'm stripping you of your powers...\" Mariam raised her hand and...something... flowed out of Amanda into her.  \"Second, I'm turning you into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was like having two dueling sets of memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on\", she said. \"Isn't this 'Livia' going to miss Mariam and come looking for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Goddess\", said Mariam, coming out of her shock. \"I don't know whether I want her to, or not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't she be able to undo all this?\", asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\", said Amanda. \"Might she might just leave us all to stew in our own juices.

The three of them did their best to enjoy the rest of the baby shower.  Mrs. Willis, Jessica's mom, who had been chaperoning the party, drove them home. As they entered the house, Stacy noticed that things looked different. The family portraits showed three daughters, instead of just one.

Stacy's room was largely the same. What had been the guest bedroom and their parents' home office were now Amanda and Mariam's bedrooms.  After changing for bed, the three met in Stacy's room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that's your boss downstairs\", said Stacy to Mariam. \"What's she doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably here to read us the Riot Act\", said Mariam.  \"And then to decide what to do with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Livia came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, ladies\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariam said, \"Livia, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it\", said Livia. \"I already know what happened, and I don't want to hear any excuses.  You two have made a lot of trouble for me. I've spent the last five hours getting chewed out by <b>my</b> boss. It took me a <b>lot </b>of butt-kissing and groveling just to avoid ending up here with you.You're both in deep trouble - you. Amanda, for slacking off on the job, and you, Mariam, for falling for a trick that a first-year magic student would have seen coming.  So, here's what's going to happen to you:  You're staying right where you've put yourselves. You will be left here to  live out a mortal lifespan, at the end of which, you'll will judged on how responsibly you lived as Mortals, and especially on how well you raised your children, and on how well you helped set an example of responsibility for Mariam, here. If you're judged to have behaved well, then your immortality and powers will be restored, after which, you'll be on probation for a century or so. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Mariam, \"Will we have any kind of protection while we're mortals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only until you give birth\", said Livia. \"After that, it will be up to the Fates. You'll be as vulnerable to illness or mishap as any other Mortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked stricken. \"But then, we might not live to even <b>see </b>judgement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\", said Livia. \"that risk is part of your punishment. So, be careful, and pray that the Fates don't hate you.  Oh, and don't bother trying contact any of your pals to try and get you out of this, I've already sent out a general warning: I'll be keeping a close eye on you two - as if I didn't have enough to do - and anyone who tries to help you two will end up wishing that they had not. Anyway, I'll be staying here until your parents come back, so we'll have plenty of time to talk.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask a question?\" said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\", said Livia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do immortal sorceresses have 'jobs' and 'bosses', anyway?  Can't you just magic up whatever you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Short answer, no\" said Livia. \"There are some things we need that we can't just 'magic up'.  The long answer involves things Mortals aren't allowed to know - and are better off not knowing, really. Anyway, it's a school day tomorrow, so you three had better get to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy, Amanda and Mariam went to school the next morning. They found themselves mostly socializing with the other seven girls of the \"Mommy Squad\". To her dismay, Stacy found that even in the Twenty-First Century,  there were still plenty of people - and not just other kids - who derided them as \"careless sluts\", and worse. Still, in some ways, it wasn't as bad as Jenna's solicitous condescension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Stacy said to Amanda: \"You made all those girls pregnant, why couldn't you have done her? It might have taken her down a peg or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Jenna?\", asked Livia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy explained about their \"friend\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah\", said Livia. He eyes lost their focus, and for a moment, she almost seemed to be in a trance.  Then she shook her head. \"I've just  taken a look at her. You'll be amused to know that she <b>is</b> pregnant, one day. She and her boyfriend - 'Steak\", you call him - had a little 'afterparty' once the baby shower was done, and his 'sheath' failed catastrophically. She doesn't know herself yet, so don't spoil the surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir parents came home at the end of the week, and Livia took her leave of them. \"Remember\", she whispered to Amanda and Mariam, \"I'll be watching you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the triplets continued their new life. After about a month, they noticed Jenna's increasing agitation. It was only when the school year was about to close that Jenna started to 'show'.  By that time, the triplets were so big themselves that they didn't have the energy to enjoy her distress when the news became widely-known.  In fact, Stacy found herself sympathizing a bit with Jenna, much to her surprise.  Shortly after graduation over the course of two weeks, the \"Mommy Squad\" gave birth. Oddly, all of them had daughters - Stacy named hers \"Louise\" after her aunt, Mariam named hers \"Adriana\"\" after her sorcerous mentor and Amanda called hers \"Bridget\", just because she liked the name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Stacy saw baby Louise, she feel in love with her. She couldn't imagine life without her. Was it the spell, or was it just maternal instinct? Who knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months after they gave birth, Mariam huddled with her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, we've got to get out of this house. Mom's constantly on our backs to give up the babies for adoption, so we can go to school, says we can still put this 'mistake' behind us. Well, I don't care if it's the spell or not, I'm <b>not </b>giving up my baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Stacy. \"She seems to have no 'grandma' instinct at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think we should do?\", asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've got some money saved up, we can rent a place and live off that until we can get jobs. We can work different shifts and trade off baby-watching duties, at least until the girls start school. We'll take classes when we can. It'll be hard at first, but we can make it on our own. I actually have a place in mind. It's a little big, but I was thinking we could ask Gwen and Debbie to come in with us on it.\"  Gwen and Debbie were the two members of the \"Mommy Squad\" that they were closest to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we can do it?\", asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to bust our butts\", said Mariam, \"But we'll be on our own, and we'll be learning responsibility, which is what this is all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and Stacy thought about it, and said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were tired all the time, but they were getting by.   One evening, the triplets were at home watching the babies - Gwen and Debbie were both working late shifts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man\", said Stacy, diapering Gwen's daughter, Jennifer. \"I've worked more in the last few months than I have in my entire life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have to stay motivated\", said Mariam. \"It won't be like this forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might end sooner than you think\", said a voice from behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey whirled to see a tall blonde woman and a short, dark-haired woman standing behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karla!

Felicia was basically a good person, but she was easily led.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine\u201d, said Mariam,  \u201cJust get out of here, now, before Livia sees you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you sweat Livia too much\u201d, said Alexandra. \u201cShe \u2013 huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn aquarium and a large birdcage had materialized at one end of the room.  Alexandra\u2019s clothes vanished and she began gasping for breath.  Slits that Stacy recognized as gills appeared on her neck. Instinctively, Alexandra ran and dunked her head into the fish tank. As she began to shrink, her hair disappeared and her skin was replaced by orange scales. Her arms turned into fins and her legs merged to form a tail, completing her transformation into a fair-sized goldfish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia\u2019s clothes vanished next.  As she shrank , she was pulled through the air and through the open door of the birdcage, which slammed shut after her.. Her feet turned into talons, and her arms into wings.  Brightly-colored feathers sprouted all over her body. Finally, her mouth and nose twisted outwards to become a parrot\u2019s beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I tried to stop her\u201d, she wailed. \u201cIt\u2019s not fai \u2013 fai \u2013 fah- faah- Faahhhh \u2013 Felicia wanna cracker!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust great\u201d, said Mariam. \u201cI hope no more of these idiots show up.

Their clothing morphed, becoming Nineteenth Century women's wear, even as their hair twisted into styles of the same period. Anjali's right hand reached out and grabbed Baozhai's left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, Anji, let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women  shrank down  until they were only a few inches tall.

They flattened against the surface of the picture, becoming a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, Livia!\", said Sarah. She and Elizabeth began to shrink, their skin becoming rough brown cloth. As they shrank, their features changed, becoming ursine.

At that point, if they survive, a decision will be taken as to whether to issue further punishment or assign them to some duty or other. The others will be left as they are until the higher-ups decide what to do with them. Assuming of course, that  they aren't destroyed one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that kind of, well...brutal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorceresses are very powerful beings, even low-level, crappy ones like them... and, to be honest, me.  Consequently, the punishments for getting out of line have to be that much stricter.

Without prelude, a woman materialized in front of them. To Stacy's astonishment, Gwen and Debbie seemed not to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, losers\", the new arrival said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What so you want, Giselle?\", said Livia, returning the other's contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\", said Stacy, leaning over to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giselle has Livia's old job.

As the change spread up her legs, they merged, becoming a tree trunk. The change spread up her torso, and her arms were forced outward, becoming branches. Leaves sprouted from her fingertips. She did not speak as the change reached her face, her eyes merely glaring hatred and frustration at Livia.  New branches sprouted from her head as her hair was replaced by more leaves.  Then her body expanded and grew, so that to look at her, no one would have guessed that she'd ever been anything than an oak tree. All this time, Gwen and Debbie had noticed nothing, and didn't question the presence of a new tree in the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should have known better than that\", said Livia, finally.  \"The big bosses <i>really</i> don't approve of gloating.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately this was not the case. Of the magical variety their guests could be broken down into three categories.<br>\r\nFirst were those who thought they knew better. Those who thought that people got caught because they got sloppy or weren't as bright as they were. This was the case with Laura a portly little witch who spent months casing the joint, laying down charms and spells. Even going as far as to etch it into the very brick work. Everyone tried to warn her but it was no use. It wasn't that she was exactly best friends with any of them just that she had something to prove. The girls decided to just let her get on with it. After weeks of careful planning and laying down counter spells and protective charms she strolled into the apartment and told them they were free to leave and return to their old lives. They weren't sure if they didn't go because they didn't believe her or because they were used to it all by now and couldn't picture life without their kids or even each other but they just offered her a drink and a bite to eat.<br>\r\n\"No I've done it, all this will fade soon so you don't exactly have to rush out the door but I've cracked it. I am after all the smartest witch of this or any other generation.\"<br>\r\nThis was when the girls saw that she was wrong. Ever boast and brag out of her mouth caused her head to swell. Literally. And as her head grew ballooning outward her body began to wither. Soon she didn't have the muscle to wave her hands any more but still she didn't notice. Her features began to dwindle as her head continued to grow leaving only black dots for her eyes, nose and mouth that was so inflated it was now little more than a smile plastered on her red face. Her boasts kept coming but were now little more than the whine you get when air escapes from a balloon. A high pitched gasp of air and when she couldn't boast any more her clothes dropped to the ground revealing the string that was dangling from her head. The colour faded from red to yellow and nothing but a balloon and some clothes remained.<br>\r\nThe clothes were divided amongst who they would fit and the balloon was given to Louise.<br>\r\nThe second kind of guest they got were people on a dare. In the same way that college kids dared each other to visit haunted houses and the like they had a fairly constant stream of people who should know better, sometimes hanging around outside, sometimes knocking on the door and sometimes breaking in to grab a prize to show they had done it. This was how Gwen ended up with a full body mirror in her room, as far as anyone else could tell, or how they woke up one morning to find they had seven babies now instead of six.<br>\r\nThen there was the last group. They were the smallest and less frequent than the others. There was talk of what they wanted. They didn't rush in and try to get out as soon as possible, they clearly didn't have a plan but just sauntered in and let the curse envelope them. There was Meric who broke in and hid in their wardrobe for three hours while they were out. When they found him he smiled, shouted I'm here to break you out of here and then grabbed onto a hanger before his body faded into a pink nightie. Worse was Karen who came in and stood in the bathroom for two days offering brush peoples hair with her fingers and getting annoyed that the curse wouldn't take hold until someone pointed out to her that it was only to stop people rescuing them. When she unconvincingly shouted that she was here to rescue them she smiled as her body started to twist and morph. Her last words were a shout of anger \"I wanted to be a hairbrush!\" before they got a new toilet brush next to the loo.<br>\r\nThere were others. Like Debbies boyfriend who promised to take her away from all this, meaning work and house sharing but fell victim to the curse anyway. Still the girls found a use for the dress dummy he became all the same though Debbie was glum for weeks afterwards and wasn't sure why.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't have to worry about repo men after all when if they tried to force their way in and take something would end up just joining the household. Also the way reality warped around them left a gap in who should be coming to repossess their stuff. That added with the stories that were starting to spread by people half remembering what had happened when they had driven people there meant that companies started to give them a wide birth. Even stuff that didn't have anything to do with them ended up with people changing. A car had been parked outside their house right in front of a fire hydrant. A local beat cop by the name of Joey had figured it was theirs and went to either get them to move it or get a ticket. He left in a pink dinosaur dress skipping home to what had once been his wife but was now his single Mummy hoping to get home in time before dinner so she didn't get in trouble.<br>\r\nThe girls couldn't do magic directly but they still remembered bits and pieces and could work around it to limited effect. Tarot readings and the like were still easy enough to do plus while they couldn't do major magic themselves they knew what was needed to perform it. Thus they soon had their own small store selling the appropriate crystals and herbs for use. However their side business was where they made their real money. Didn't like your age or gender or even species and you could step through into the backroom and it was all taken care of. It didn't even have to yours. People would come to see them about abusive partners that they couldn't go to the police about and left with oil paintings, dolls and brand new pets. Even some of the higher ups stopped by for supplies every now and again though they claimed they were just there to keep and eye on them. It might have been hard for a small niche business like this to get under way and stay afloat but the curse helped there too. This was the case for Mike, a down on his luck guy on the short road to prison who decided to bust in one night and grab whatever looked like it was worth the most to flog on later. When the store opened tomorrow they found they had a cute Japanese maid who lived to serve.<br>\r\nThe local mob who came round to offer them protection for the right price left to sell their girl scout cookies along the street before taking their money back to pay for their scout hut before heading home with the satisfaction of job well done and no memory of who they had been. <br>\r\nWith all hands on deck the women were fine for money and their kids grew up happy not wanting for too much and always with a meal in their bellies and a smile on their lips.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One afternoon, the six housemates were sitting in the backyard with their babies Stacy with her daughter, Louise,  Gwen with her daughter, Jennifer, Debbie with her daughter, Roseanne, Amanda with her daughter, Bridget, Mariam with her daughter, Adriana, and Livia with her twin daughters, Portia and Cornelia (Cornelia was a \"visitor\" who had been punished by being reverted to infancy and \"assigned\" to Livia, since Livia was the senior (ex-)sorceress in the house).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy  pulled Livia to one side.. \"Livia, can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Livia. She turned to the others.  \"Guys, would you watch our girls for us?  Stacy and I are going to wash Sheila.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheila\" was the housemates' used '05 Ford Freestar minivan, which had originally been a sorceress who violated the \"No Visitors\" on an evening when they'd been bemoaning their lack of reliable transportation.  Gwen and Debbie thought it was cute that they'd named their vehicle, little knowing that they hadn't given her the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about Debbie's boyfriend, why was he transformed? I mean, Debbie and Gwen and I, we're not under judgement, are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked. I was curious about that, myself, so I contacted  Delilah - she's the sorceress who has my old job, now. As the senior 'inmate' here, I'm allowed to contact her.  Anyway, it turns out that Debbie's 'boyfriend' was a sorcerer, who was playing a long game. He set up a Mortal life for himself and suppressed his magical powers, all in hopes of beating the prohibition against 'visitors'. Or course, he got caught. Remember, you can't tell Debbie any of this. Of course, the spell would keep her from believing you, but why risk it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy nodded in acknowledgement, and Livia continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, don't worry.  You, Gwen, Debbie and the other girls that Amanda cast her pregnancy spell on can do what you like and go where you like. It's just me, Mariam and Amanda that have to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would happen if you feel in love with a Mortal? Is that against Witch Law, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not <i>strictly</i> forbidden\", said Livia. \"But we'd have to give up all hope of getting our immortality back if we did, and between us, a guy would have pretty damn amazing for me to give <i>that </i>up. Oh, one other thing - you're a special case in one way.  Your parents hired Amanda to teach you responsibility.  and that Powers That Are have decided that that constitutes a valid contract, even though your parents didn't know who or what they were hiring, so Amanda is bound by that.  Mariam and I am, too, because as her bosses, we should have stopped her from doing dumb stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\", asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that we three have to spend our Mortal lifetimes setting you the best example of Responsibility that we can, which means that wherever you go, we have to go, too. So, one, that means that you're kind of stuck with us, and, two, if you take it into your head to take off for Central Africa or Mongolia or Decatur, Illinois, we have to go, too.  We can point it out if we think it's a bad idea, but if you decide to go, we can't stop you. Anyway, as a personal favor to us, please think about that before you decide to move.  We won't have to be under the same roof, always, but we'll always be nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, on an unrelated note, are your daughters, you know, part Sorceress, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Livia. \"They were born to us when we were Mortals, so they're Mortals, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, even if you get your immortality back, you'll have to leave them someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, same as every parent. At least, we'll still be able to watch over them, and occasionally even help them in small ways - the Big Bosses aren't heartless, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLivia sighed, sadly, and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a different note, we should be getting fewer 'visitors' from her on.  A directive came down from Circe Herself, the next visitor here will have something 'epic' done to them. I don't even like to think about what that would mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Circe'?\", said Stacy.  \"<i>The</i>Circe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only.  The most powerful Sorceress there is.  Above Her, you get into the Celestials, and I'll very, very happy if I live out my life without ever meeting one of Them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven years went by, and sure enough, there were no more visitors.  Stacy was now 25, and Amanda, Mariam and Livia looked 25 as well.  Gwen and Debbie had moved out, having taken jobs in another state. There had been a tearful parting, but it did mean more room in the house, and it was easier with no one in the house who didn't know about sorcery and witches.  Amanda had become a beautician, and a surprisingly good one.  Stacy  was now a nutritionist, Mariam a stockbroker and Livia an assistant office manager on the fast track to promotion.  Louise, Bridget, Adriana, Portia and Cornelia were seven years old, and in elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir landlady passed away and the four housemates found to their astonishment that the old lady had left the house jointly to Stacy, Amanda, Mariam and Livia. Stacy was on better terms with her parents, and the other three had become like additional daughters to them, as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome had been through some hard times. but now things were going nice and smoothly for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was one of the rare mornings when the four had a day off while the girls were at school.They were in the back yard, enjoying a coffee and talking about all the chores they ought to do but probably wouldn't.  A rush of wind, and three women appeared in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLivia and Mariam both knew them from the old days, Amanda only knew <i>of</i> them.  They were a notorious trio called \"The Three V's\". Vatsana, the leader, was tall and East Asian-looking.  Vatsana totally dominated the other two - Viktoria, a short blonde, and Vibha, a medium-sized woman who looked Indian.  Livia knew that if Vatsana had said \"Today, we are jumping off a cliff\", then Viktoria and Vibha would have jumped without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\", said Livia. \"Are you three nuts? You <b>know</b> what Circe will do to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh\", said Vatsana. \"She's off at some Celestial Conference or other.. We'll be long gone before <b>she</b> gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, will you now?\", came a voice that came from behind them. They whirled to see who it was. To Stacy's surprise, she seemed to recognize her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, it's that chick that used to be on</i> Doctor Who! <i>She was the girl who lied all the time, and then her boyfriend was killed off. What was the actress' name - Jenna Something?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled at her, handed her a large wad of money and said, \"Hi, Stacy, I'm Circe, pleased to meet you.  To answer your unspoken question, this isn't my real face. Believe it or not, I do my best to keep up with Mortal popular culture. I saw this face on TV, and decided to try it as a \"look\". It's not as though she and I are going to turn up at a party wearing the same body, after all. Look, some things are going to happen that you're better off not seeing.  Go have yourself a spa day and get Sheila washed and detailed, and spend any change on whatever you like. Don't worry, we'll be done here before the girls get home from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy saw ice <i>and</i> fire in Circe's eyes, and made herself scarce.  She got the rest of the story form Livia, later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCirce had turned on the three malefactors, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you, and warned you, and WARNED YOU! But obviously, it wasn't enough.  Well, you three are going to spend the rest of time as a living example of what happens to people who push me too far!  Listen up!  What happens to you three here is <i>forever</i> - there will be no parole, no reprieve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Three V's stood stock-still, as though frozen in place. Circe turned to Amanda, Mariam and Livia, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, ladies, your neighbors won't see anything, I'm casting a camouflage spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the three visitors, and gestured.  Their clothing vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, ladies\", she said, \"Have any of you ever seen a film called <i>The Human Centipede</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, crrr-app!\", said Amanda, who had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVatsana changed first. Her limbs vanished, and her body became round and serpentine. Her hair disappeared and her skin was replaced by golden scales. Her mouth and nose became elongated like an anteater's  and twin horns grew from her head. she hovered in the air, her long, thin tongue hissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria changed next. Her skin, too, became golden and scaly. Her breasts vanished as her torso became larger and reptilian. Her limbs took on a quadrupedal alignment, and her hand and feet grew enormous talons. Enormous wings sprouted form her back. Now, only her head remained human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Vibha changed. Her limbs vanished, and her skin was replaced with golden scales.  She became a human head with a long reptilian tail that had four spikes growing out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria moaned in anticipatory horror as Vatsana floated over to her, but her moans were soon muffled as Vatsana's bottom fitted itself snugly over Viktoria's head.  At the same time, Vibha's head implanted itself in Vatsana's backside. The joins vanished and the three were now one creature, one that was about the size of a grizzly bear, and looked like a cross between an anteater, a dragon and a stegosaurus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ex-sorceresses recognized the creature as a filth-eater, a type of vermin that fed on dragon droppings and the occasional dragon louse (for extra protein). It was known that Circe bred and trained dragons as a hobby (It was also said that some of the dragons were transformed former lovers of Circe's who had talked too much.)  Circe opened a portal to her private estate, and the newly-made filth-eater flew through and began eagerly consuming dragon guano.  Circe closed the portal and addressed Amanda, Mariam and Livia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All three of them will retain their own minds and personalities, but Vatsana will have control of the body.  Viktoria and Vibha followed her thoughtlessly, now they will follow her helplessly, with no control over what they do.  Viktoria and Vibha will not be able to see, of course, but they will be able to converse telepathically with each other and with Vatsana, although I'm sure how much fun those conversations will be.  In ten thousand years, I'll check up on them. If they seem sufficiently repentant, I'll wipe their memories and merge their minds, so that they'll be a single, contented filth-eater. If they're still recalcitrant, then they can go on being miserable forever.  Anyway, I gotta go. <i>Ciao</i>, ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Livia had told her the story later, Stacy ahd asked: \"So, there's really no hope for them to ever be returned to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. 'Circe' may rhyme with 'mercy' in your language, but that's the only similarity between them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, they tried to put on a good face for the sake of the children, but none of them ate that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We even would be allowed the occasional 'dalliance', as long as we handled it responsibly.  Until Phil came along, we've all avoided it, because we all know how easy it is to be 'irresponsible' once your hormones and emotions start overruling your brain. It doesn't hurt  that even nowadays, a lot of guys don't want to take up with a woman who already has a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would be the line that she must have crossed for this to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once she fell in love with him  - truly in love - then she would be considered to have 'given herself to a Mortal'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was considered to have accepted a sentence of 'Death by Mortality' - the same sentence all Mortals are under, really - and her memories of her life as a Sorceress were taken away. She now only remembers a life with you and Mariam as her sisters, and me as her friend. Our 'cover story' is now real, as far as she's concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do 'The Powers' do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a person isn't expected to keep secrets from their lover, so they take away the secrets, so there's no temptation.  Anyway, a relationship between a Mortal and an Immortal is considered 'uneven'.  This levels the playing field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One advantage for her\", added Mariam, \"Is that she'll no longer be under judgement, so she won't have that worry anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the other hand\", said Livia, \"The decision is irrevocable. Goddess forbid, but if Phil gets hit by a bus tomorrow, there's no taking it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them were surprised when, a few weeks later, Amanda came to them and said, \"Guys, I think Philip is gonna propose to me Saturday night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How do you know?\", said Mariam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he was asking me a few weeks ago about how did people know what size rings they took, and he made a real awkward segue into what size ring <b>I</b> took, and what kind of rings I like, and so on, I thought it was pretty obvious what he was up to.  Anyway, he invited me over for dinner Saturday night, said he had 'something special' he wanted to talk to me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", said Stacy, \"What are you going to tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thought about it along, long time, and if he does ask, I'm going to say 'yes'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariam and Livia looked stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...um...wow\", said Mariam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you sure? I mean, Phil's a great guy, I like him a lot, but do you really wanna give up immort- uh, I mean, your <i>freedom</i> -  for <i>any</i> man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\", said Amanda, \"For a chance of a life with him? Yes, a double yes! I love him, and Bridget loves him!  I want more babies! I want <i>his</i> babies! Bridget wants to be a big sister, and I <i>want</i> her to be a big sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But think of what you're giving up!\", said Livia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I giving up?\", said Amanda. \"I feel more alive now  than I ever have in my life! But don't you see? Because are lives are so short, we have to get the most out of them!  Love is worth the risk of losing everything!  I'd rather have a short time with him than to live forever without him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLivia turned away, tears in her eyes. \"But...but...I...I\"ll miss you when you're gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda hugged Livia from behind, laughing and crying at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think that the Great and Terrible Livia would ever say something like that to the likes of <b>me</b>! Oh, Livia, I love you, too! And maybe you don't understand this right now, but that love is all the sweeter to me because I know that we won't always be together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do whatever your heart tells you!\", said Livia, sobbing, and then she astonished them all by kissing Amanda on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday night came and Amanda got ready to leave on her date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be good for your Aunties\", she said to Bridget. Livia, Mariam and Stacy wished her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening came and went with no further sign of Amanda. The next morning at breakfast, Bridget said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't Mommy come home last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...welll...\"said Stacy, \"Probably it got late, and she didn't want  to drive home while she was sleepy, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\", said Bridget. \"So you don't think that she and Phil were getting a head start on getting me a little brother or sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd finished coughing, Stacy said, \"Let's not repeat that one for Mommy, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda came home just before lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Stacy. \"It went well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was everything I'd hoped for!

One night she met with Livia and Mariam to discuss the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know\", said Stacy, \"Bill and I both like this area a lot, so there's no danger of us moving, and forcing you two to move as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear\", said Livia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this place used to be so crowded\", said Mariam. \"It'll seem almost empty with just the two of us, and Adriana, Portia and Cornelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Livia. \"And in a few years, the girls will go out on their own, and it will just be the two of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe people will think we're an old couple\", said Mariam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think some of the neighbors think that already\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\", said Mariam.  \"We were a couple - sort of -once - a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, don't tell her about that!\", said Livia, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do tell\", said Stacy. \"I didn't think you two swung that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't exactly like that\", said Mariam. \"Although it is true, that when you're Immortal, you end up trying all sorts of things, eventually. No, we were just kids in magic school, experimenting, the way Mortal college kids do.  We would each take turns transforming the other one into their 'dream man', and you know, 'experimenting'.  You know, Livia made a surprisingly cute guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made a pretty studly guy, too, you know\", said Livia. \"Certainly, Mother Charlotte seemed to think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, here we go\", said Mariam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was our senior magic instructor\", said Livia, \"and she met Mariam when she was wearing a male form and calling herself 'Mario'.  Charlotte got the hots for 'Mario', and it was all Mariam could do to get away from her before Charlotte had her way with 'Mario'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Goddess\", said Mariam. \"Charlotte was all hands! Still, at least I didn't spend five years as a squirrel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", said Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never forget anything, do you?\", said Livia. \"What happened was, me and this guy, Julius, were horsing around trying to zap each other with transformation spells, and we somehow managed to hit each other with simultaneous spells and turned each other into squirrels!  We only knew spoken spells in those days, and as squirrels, we couldn't speak, so we couldn't turn each other back! Mother Miranda, our teacher, was  furious. She locked us in squirrel form and turned us loose in the Forest of J'Raan, which had a large squirrel population. By the time she came back for us five years later, we'd both done our part to make the squirrel population there even larger. This was centuries ago, so by now, most of the squirrels in the Forest are likely descended from Julius and me. I'm still under a curse that if I ever use a squirrel transformation spell on myself or anyone else, I'll be turned into a squirrel permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, those were the days\", Mariam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too funny\", said Stacy. \"Say, I wanted to ask you. You know how  as long as you're under punishment, you two have to be somewhere near me, even if not necessarily in the same house? That  doesn't mean that you two have to go on my honeymoon, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, an allowance is made for privacy\", said Livia. \"So we won't have to tag along and cramp your style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Stacy and Bill were married,and she and Louise want to live in a new home with him, although of course there were frequent visits with Aunties Livia, Mariam and Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stacy and Amanda still visited Mariam and Livia often, Stacy now had a second daughter, whom she'd named Sharlene.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla the Dog, Emiko the Cat and Alexandra the Goldfish had lived out normal animal lifespans and had returned to their normal forms to face judgement. Livia had later heard that they'd been given their immortality back and sentenced to a thousand years of community service.   Felicia the Parrot was still living with Mariam and Livia - parrots lived a long time.  Giselle the Oak Tree was still growing in the back yard  - she might be there for centuries, Danitra had cast a protection spell, so that whoever lived in that house would not cut her down prematurely.   The various bits of furniture and toys that were really transformed sorcerers and sorceresses were mostly in storage in the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about what life would be like now for Livia and Mariam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The girls will be leaving to go to college, soon, and then it will be just the two of them rattling around that big old house. Maybe they could move someplace smaller?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the Fates intervened. Mariam had a new co-workers in the brokerage where she worked, George Martinez. The two became fast friends, but because it wasn't a typical \"romance\" -  no hearts and flowers stuff, just two people enjoying getting to know one another - Mariam didn't even notice how much George was beginning to mean to her.  Livia had noticed, of course, but she was torn over what to do about it.  As with Amanda, she was appalled at the thought of her friend giving up immortality for what could only be a short-term relationship - fifty or sixty years, at most. On the other hand, it <i>was</i> true that Amanda seemed very happy with Phil, and it would be selfish for her to try to make Mariam do what she thought she should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had finally happened one afternoon, when  Mariam and Livia were home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Liv\", Mariam said, \"I never meant for this to happen, I never thought it <i>could</i> happen, but I was having lunch with George today, and we suddenly realized how much he meant to me, and I kissed him, and he kissed me back, and I knew it was all over. I could feel my memories beginning to fade. I fought it as long as I could, I wanted to talk you as the woman I was one last time, before I...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLivia could almost <b>see</b> it as the change happened. She surprised Mariam with a bearhug, so her friend couldn't see the tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Mariam\", she said. \"Please be happy for as long as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Livia talked to Stacy about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so <i>alone</i>, Stace.  They've both come to mean so much to me! I mean, they're both still there, but I'm the only one who still remembers the old days. And, someday, assuming that judgement goes in my favor, I'll have to face Immortality without them.  Goddess, Mortal life is one parting after another! How do you stand it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy consoled her friend as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Some time later, Mariam and George were engaged, and later married.  Livia sold them her share in the house, and moved into a smaller place nearby.  George and Mariam moved in after they married.  A year later, Mariam gave birth to a daughter that they named Petra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three more years passed, Stacy and her pals were now 39, and their eldest daughters were 21.  One afternoon, Livia was sitting in her new home, chatting with Cornelia, who was home visiting from college. Cornelia was telling Livia a carefully-edited version of her life at college, but Livia was aware that while Cornelia had had several \"dalliances\" with both male and female schoolmates, she had avoided any permanent attachments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLivia worried about what would happen to Cornelia. Originally, she had been a sorceress who had violated the \"no visitors\" rule, and had been reverted to infancy with her memories of her previous life wiped. She'd also been changed physically so that she was Portia's identical twin. Annoyed at first  with the burden of an extra, Livia had soon come to care for her as much as she did for Portia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Livia hadn't been sure about was the nature of Cornelia's sentence. Since she no longer remembered her life as a sorceress, she wouldn't know what behavior to avoid.  Danitra had explained it to her, once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She violated a rule after several warnings had been given, so her sentence is extra harsh.  She has to live a responsible life and avoid Mortal romantic entanglements, and if she does that, she'll be given her immortality back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she doesn't know any of that!  You're saying she has to play a game well where she not only doesn't know the rules, she doesn't even know she's playing the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, and you can't tell her.  Basically, what happens to her is up the Fates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLivia had done her best to instill a sense of responsibility in both of her girls, but in Cornelia, especially.  IT was true that Cornelia played around more than Livia - as her mom - might like, but she seemed to be doing so carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reverie was interrupted by a knock at the door. Livia answered it, and was surprised to see that it was Danitra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\", she said. \"Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Aunt Dani\", said Cornelia, who knew Danitra as a friend of her mother's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kiddo\", said Danitra. \"Can I have a word in private with your mom?  Don't go far, 'cause afterwards, I'm going to want to talk with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Cornelia, puzzled. \"I'll be out back when you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cornelia had left the room,  Livia turned to Danitra, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got good news for you, Liv.  There's been a general review of your sentence, and it's being reduced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you mean, 'reduced'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you still have to survive through a normal Mortal lifespan - which for our purposes means survive until you're at least eighty -  and avoid avoid falling in love with a Mortal. Oh, and live a generally responsible life. But you're off the hook as far as keeping Stacy on the straight-and-narrow. She seems to have turned out OK, anyway. So, to sum up:  Just behave yourself and make it to the end, and  you'll get your immortality back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooow\", said Livia. \"And what about Cornelia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be given her memories back. Otherwise, the same rules as you: Live  to eighty, be responsible, no falling in love with a mortal.  At least now, she'll know the rules she's supposed to be playing by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\", said Livia, who went and called Cornelia into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys, what's going on?\", asked Cornelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember\", said Danitra, touching Cornelia's forehead. Cornelia looked stunned, like she'd been lunched in the face. Livia guided her onto the couch, and gasped as Cornelia grabbed her in a fierce embrace, clinging to her frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanh..Hannnnhhh...Haaaaannnnhhhh\", said Cornelia, as memories poured into her mind.  \"Ooooohhh, now I understand so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed her grip on Livia, but did not let go. She closed her eyes, and rested her head on the other woman's shoulder.  Finally, she raised her head and looked at Livia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for everything you've done for me...can..can...can you still be my...my Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiddo, I won't <i>ever</i> stop being your Mom\", said Livia, returning her daughter's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext..</span></div></div>",

She was resident in an assisted living facility, sharing a unit with Cornelia, who was now eighty-two years old.    Both had avoided any romantic entanglements, and believed that they had lived reasonably well-behaved lives.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLivia was the last of the old roommates left. Even her other daughter, Portia, had passed away a few years ago. Still, Grammy Livia and Auntie Cornelia  were frequently visited by Livia's grandchildren, great-grandchildren and even some great-great-grandchildren. When she'd reached eighty, she could have petitioned for an end to her sentence, but she hadn't wanted to leave Cornelia to serve out her sentence alone, so she'd stayed. Even when Cornelia had passed eighty, they had waited a little while.  Finally, they'd agreed to go together when Livia reached a hundred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they'd had breakfast, they sat down together on the couch, and Livia said, \"Now, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanitra materialized in front of them.  \"Any last things you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanitra gestured, and the years fell off of the two old women, leaving them both looking twenty-one again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's good to be young again\", said Cornelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanitra cast a spell, and two dummies resembling Livia and Cornelia appeared on the couch.  They would fool the Mortals, who would believe that the two women had passed away in their sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanitra led them before a tribunal, but it was a formality, and they swiftly had their immortality and magic returned to them.  They went back to their individual homes, but they were so used to living together that they magically merges their two residences.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got new jobs, and from time to time - with permission - they discreetly looked in on their Mortal relations.  Eventually, all of the Sorcerers and Sorceresses who had been transformed served out their sentences and were returned to other duties.  The last one on Earth was Giselle the Oak Tree, who finally returned several hundred years later. Giselle had found her centuries had left her with a serenity like she'd never known, and so, when her immortality was returned to her, she received permission to take up residence in the Forest of Jirraan, transforming herself permanently into an oak tree.   When they had time, Livia and Cornelia would take a picnic lunch, sitting in Giselle's shade, discussing the latest news and gossip where they knew that Giselle could hear, even if she could no longer speak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both agreed that it was the most peaceful place they had ever known.</span></div></div>",

Before long, the smell of pot roast, mashed potatoes, and veggies <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncooking hit your nose. Though usually not a big eater, for some reason you find yourself <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfamished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner is served,\" you hear shortly after, and then head to the table to tuck in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you have polished off what she put on your plate and gotten through seconds, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook up to see her smiling at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you mumble over your last mouthful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just makes me happy to see you enjoy my cooking so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just really great, reminded me of when I went to Grams place this last<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsummer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing...really.

Sure, things might be a little different this week, but she could<br>\r\n<br>\r\nadjust. Such cooking would be great if this is what it would be like until dad and<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmom got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to rouse you from your thoughts, Amanda returned with pastries and some sort of<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndark, fizzing drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smells were like an utterly enchanting aroma, and some part of her kept<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwondering if she ought to be nervous. Yet, this taste extravaganza was just <br>\r\n<br>\r\nso good she had to have more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm not allowed to drink alcohol,\" she told Amanda, with the last shred of<br>\r\n<br>\r\nresistance she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, I would never do that to you. Everything here is perfectly okay for you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crossed her heart and grinned at you, you find any nervousness you might<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhave had has departed as you take one of the pastries and a swig of the juice, and it <br>\r\n<br>\r\nis as if your taste buds light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm glow seems to engulf you, and the next thing you know you find you're open<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsomehow. You feel like you might agree to anything, just to keep enjoying this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nkind of treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to sense this, Amanda comes over and takes you by the hand and looks you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Stacy, we are going to have a wonderful week. But, we are going to need to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmake some adjustments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout really thinking about it, you answer ,\"Sure, I'm okay with that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is just great Stacy. Remember how I told you that I take care of old people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I suppose I could learn in time to care for young people. But as it is, we don't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhave that luxury. So, I need for you to get much older for me. Really, it's for the best<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand just for the week. I'll even give you some say in the process, and of course meals<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlike the one I just cooked all week long. You can either do this gradually or fairly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nquickly. I'll leave that choice up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Pick out an outfit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsuitable for an elderly old lady of between age 80 and 100. Then come on back and we'll continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun,\" replied Stacy, and raced to her room. She soon returned dressed in lavender polyester slacks, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith a long sleeved dark purple top, a silver shawl draped over her shoulders, with black low heels, and pearl <br>\r\n<br>\r\near rings and a double strand pearl necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm dressed, what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, you can't wear your own bra, it won't fit right in a little while,\" Amanda replied, handing her a small bag <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith bras, panties, a girdle or two, and support hose.\"Go and put these on underneath, and then come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, all right...this is becoming kind of a chore--but I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned again, this time complaining that nothing fit quite right, it all seemed a little big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be soon, trust me,\" Amanda said matter-of-factly. \"Now, here are the rules for the week. When you get<br>\r\n<br>\r\nup in the morning, you'll revert to an 18 year old. You will stay that way throughout the day, and you can even go<br>\r\n<br>\r\nto cheer leading practice. Once all your school stuff is done, I suggest you get home quickly. Within a half hour <br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter school and cheer leading gets out, within 10 minutes you'll be an old woman again. If you try to tell anyone <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat is happening, either during or after school, the same fate awaits them. Anyone of your friends who stops by <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfor a visit will be transformed until they leave. Only, they will think and act as if they'd always been that old. On <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe weekend, we can go and do things but only as a couple of old ladies, and if any friends come along they will<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbe old too. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really, seems pretty clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing, you need to choose an age between 80 and 105, or if you don't really care I'll just set things in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmotion and the age will be chosen at random. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Go for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and this box here is for you as well. It has little items you may need when you hit your golden years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh would hurry...up?\"Amanda replied, as she started racing through time. Soon she had passed into her late   <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntwenties, her hair getting longer, her body filling out a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmhmmm, this is one hot bod,\" she murmurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too used to it, it won't last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, she soon found herself clearing her early forties, as fine lines and crow's feet etched her face, as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbags under her eyes and a light droop of the breasts. She looked a bit more matronly now, and her eyes didn't <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfocus as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not seeing all that well, and is it getting hot in here or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are some glasses, and trust me, they will work,\" she remarked, handing her some sequined cat's eye <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsilver glasses on a beaded chain.\"As for the hot flashes, they will pass in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich they did, as Stacy passed 58, soon hitting 59, 60,61,62, and 63, her hair getting more and more gray by <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe moment, and now it only reached the edge of her shoulders. Her clothes did seem to fit better, and she was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nglad she had the girdle and support hose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got a sudden hankerin fer a game a bingo...is that my voice? I sound so...so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old? Well, you aren't a spring chicken anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No guess not. Hey, leasht I qualify fer dem shenior discountsh. Hey wash wiff ma teef?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, put these in,\" she said as she handed the seventy-eight year old some dentures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that's better. An kin ya hep me ta a seat there dearie? The joints are a bit achey, I don't seem ta be able <br>\r\n<br>\r\nta stand real well. The body ain't as spry as it once were ya know girlie. Could use on a them...one a them...ta <br>\r\n<br>\r\nan git round...oh, what ya call it, a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain...no don't spose it's sposed ta rain,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda put a cane in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thankee dearie, that is jes the thing sure nuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the process came to an end, Stacy found herself at age 89, leaning on a cane. Her hair was completely white <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand in a tight pin curl perm, and her skin was a mass of bags, sags, and wrinkles. She shuffled over to the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nkitchen table and sat down opposite Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and one more thing,\" Amanda added. \"If you do try and tell anyone, you'll and they will find that their reality <br>\r\n<br>\r\nalters so that everything is like they have always been the old lady or man they have become. They won't know<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou as the younger you, they'll just think they have always been this older person who knows you in some way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I guess so. So no tellin and everythin is fine, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You learn quickly for someone so old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You betcha there dearie,\" Stacy cackled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. Now, would you like some tea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure would, fer some reason that sounds jes fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's make sure we have you wearing Depends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them big didies?

Something seemed familiar about this lady, yet she couldn't say what. For that matter, her brains weren't working at quite the same pace, and now her vision had gone fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try usin yeer glasses Jess,\" the old lady told her, though she couldn't for the life of her recall wearing any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are resting on your chest, on the cute beaded chain I made ya fer them,\" Stacy replied, as she wandered over to her friend and took the cool metal frames in her fingers <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand gently placed them on her  nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That better Jess, or would ya prefer not ta see what I dun, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wondered how long it would take you to recognize your old, and I do mean OLD, friend,\" Amanda replied with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whas, whas happening to me?\" Jessica wondered perplexed, as her friend took her by the hand and escorted her to the bathroom. Her body felt foreign to her, it didn't seem to function the same. Her fingers looked...like moms? She pondered this as her friend, yet how could that be her friend as Jess was only 18, wasn't she? As her friend lead her into the bathroom, Jessica found herself staring at her middle aged reflection and let loose an audible gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting older?\" she moaned as she passed 55, and considered her salt and pepper hairdo she now wore in a trendy shoulder length cut. Trendy, that is, if you were an average, middle aged woman, not to mention the fine lines, crow's feet, and other signs of advancing age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took ya long nuff ta figger that out Sherlock,\" the old woman...friend...replied with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt which point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, she will be looking for a girl of about 18, won't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call her, and then trust me, everything will work out fine-tell her you are Stacy's aunt and you want her to meet us at the theater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,if you say so,\" Stacy replied, and called her friend following Amanda's advice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jessica felt a bit puzzled after the call. Why would Stacy have her aunt call? What the hell though, a movie was a movie, and if someone else was treating she<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwasn't going to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she proceeded to get ready, thinking about all how she and Stacy had kept in touch since high school. She grabbed a sweater and headed out the door to her car. She <br>\r\n<br>\r\nenjoyed these weekends home from college, and she thought of her senior interviews that were coming up. As she drove down the road, she wondered about the first job out <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof college, and then a little further about her recent marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that this was due to the years drifting by, and her body changed to reflect this as well. As she raced past her twenties and into her thirties, her face looking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n more angular, and even her clothing changing. She now wore red capri pants, with a gold pol shirt with the collar turned up and a large bobble necklace of blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed forty, and thought about her son just starting high school, as fine lines started to appear on her face and a long lock of white gracing the one side of her face. Her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n skin appeared a bit like worn leather, as crow's feet and under eye bags formed as she pulled into the theater parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifty year old got out and wandered over to the theater, where her good friend awaited her. It seemed like years since they had seen each other. Not too long ago they were <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin high school , now they were both in their early fifties and entering menopause. She fanned herself as a hot flash hit, rapped her sweater tighter around her and adjusted the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nelegant cat's eye, tortoise shell, glasses on their beaded chain, and proceeded to hug her good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy old girl, you're a sight for sore eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stared at her not comprehending, and then said,\"Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, we're both a little older, and it's been  a few years, but it is so good to see you again. we have so much catching up to do, and so much to talk about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea...\"she muttered, and then added,\"It is great to see you too, ready for a gal's night out with my cousin Amanda and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way,\" she replied. \"Let's get into that cool air conditioned building, damned hot flashes are hitting again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" both Amanda and Stacy laughed, as the three women headed into the theater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI </span></div></div>",

She placed the sweater over Stacy's shoulders, and they wandered past the hallway mirror and out the door. Even with her vision a bit fuzzy, the 45 year old Stacy could not help but notice that something seemed different about her hair. What was it though? Could it be that white streak in her bangs, or the gray hairs laced throughout? Why did that bother her?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Is something wrong?\" Amanda said smiling.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"No, I...uhh...I guess not...just a few pesky gray hairs...and that touch of white...maybe pick up some hair color while were out.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Sure thing, though you really don't need it.

More gray showed in her hair, and her body looked much more matronly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I feel so warm? I am really felling uncomfortable dear, can we make this quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure ma'am, I'll get us taken care of asap. I imagine though you would like some glasses so you could see better, you did tell me that earlier, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I did...sure, guess I must have,\" she replied, wondering a little but glad for the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later and a few more years, the 57 year old Stacy entered the optical store alongside Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, they exited the store with the 61 year old Stacy now sporting some half bifocals on a beaded chain. Amanda, had secretly managed to come up with many other<br>\r\n<br>\r\npairs of glasses as well. Then they headed to a clothing store and soon left with all sorts of age appropriate outfits to fit the now 64 year old, as well as Stacy sporting a powder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nblue dress, jacket, and white ruffled shirt and pearls. Her hair had become steel gray with touches of its original color. It was quite long, hanging down below her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hair's a bit long and out of style for someone of your age,don't you think?\" Amanda asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...spose so, yeah, guess it might be,\" Stacey replied, still wondering what was happening to her as she passed 69, and allowed herself to be lead into a nearby salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya, this is my client Miss Stacey. She needs the usual, if you get my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kind of busy,\" Tanya responded, before she realized who had spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, as I've stated before, you do and always will have time for me. Otherwise, I will certainly have time for you. Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the tanned young stylist  found swatches of white in her red locks along either side of her face, as well as laugh lines, crow's feet, and her vision blurring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she knew where she had left her glasses  and proceeded to put them on. At which point she was greeted with the vision of a middle aged woman in clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmore appropriate for someone in her mid twenties.She had an outfit in the backroom that would look better she could change into shortly. Her skin had started to look more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n like worn leather, and her voice came out deeper than when she last spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifty year old Tanya looked at Amanda and replied cautiously,\"Yes, of course sweetie pie, I can most certainly find a spot for Miss Stacy, always happy to oblige.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after, the 78 year old left with Amanda, now sporting a short, pin curl perm. They picked up a few more things, and then Amanda lead the 88 year old who leaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\non a stylin, colorful, cane back to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that wasn't so bad, was it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, eh dearie, spose not, no spose not. Now, you did remember to pick up my pills, the Depends, and my denture cleaner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did...remember, I did tell you I take care of grandparents...like yourself, didn't I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dearie, I do recall ya mentioned that,\" she rattled, as they drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, they pulled back up to her home, and Amanda helped the 94 year old out of the car, and lead her slowly toward the house. Stacy shuffled along beside her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbracing the other hand along her mid back. She wondered what had happened, where her family had gone to, where the years had gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda helped her through the door and into her rocking chair, she looked at her quizzically and rasped, \"Where'd it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd what go my dear?\" Amanda asked innocently, as she placed a blanket on her charge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My youth...I know sumpin happened...jus not what...things kinda a blur...did you...make me this...old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did tell you I cared for grandparents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why? And, how'd ya get all a my stuff...I know I didn't see, see ya pay fer it there young un?\" she puzzled aloud, trying to make sense of what had happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
