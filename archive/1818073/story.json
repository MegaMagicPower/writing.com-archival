Her son snuggled into the fat he was resting on, a young Devourer born just barely a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still something she had to do.  Being so young, he wouldn't have the metabolism that turned Devourers into the iconic fat dragons that they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her belly sink lower as she breathed out deeply, letting her offspring roll towards her head.  She opened her mouth as the hatchling squealed in happiness, enjoying this as a game.  He tumbled into her mouth, resting on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick swallow, she swallowed her child into her belly.  Kusien had to remain there for at least a month, so that his metabolism would adjust to a life style of lazing and eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over onto her belly, and pushed herself up, experiencing the familar dificulty that came with such a large gut.  Her back legs were padded with fat, along with some on her front legs.  Her belly barely scrapped across the ground, creating a trail that could barely be seen in the dirt.  She needed to find something for herself and her son to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling to leave her cave due to her belly being caught in the entrance once again.  As she traveled, she found a rather large herd of deer, something that she enjoyed particularly.  She beat her enourmous wings, slowly lifting up off the ground on wings meant to carry much larger.  She hovered above the group, positioning herself so that they would be trapped, but not killed when she dropped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly softened the fall, and the fat pinned the deer underneath.  As she moved away, she took a count of how many she had successfully stunned.  the final count was roughly 15, less than she was used to, but more than enough to get her son used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her head over, and thanks to her long neck, lapped up ten of the deer and swallowed them whole.  She pulled the other five into her mouth and bit down hard, crushing bones and letting blood gush out over her mouth as she chewed up the meat for Kusien.  She swallowed and let the prechewed fall into the same sack that was holding her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien wondered what kind of game his mommy was playing with him.  He ran around the inside of her belly, gently knawing on the walls with his under-developed teeth.  he soon grew bored and curled up to try and go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a sudden surge as his mother slammed into the ground, and wondered what was going on.  The larger fat dragon began to swallow various things, and wondered if he was getting a playmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a batch of shapeless meat fell into the stomach that he was in.  Kusien squealed happily as he dug into the contents of the meal he was given.  As he finshed his meal, he laid on his back and pawed at his spherical belly, packed tight with his meal.  Kusien fell asleep as the cycle repaeted itself constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of one month, Kusien's mother wondered what her son looked like.  She began to retch as she worked on regurgitating her son.  A msmall bulge could be seen on her padded neck, and she felt the hatchling enter her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was softer, and larger to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let him drop onto the ground and got a good look at him.  He was around the size of one of those domesticated wolves that humans kept, and looked very bloated.  His own belly came into full contact with the ground, as that is where most of the fat ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that he would leave, as food to maintain him would not soon be enough for both her and him.  He would have to lear how to hunt, fend for himself and how to find a mate.  She had to get to work now for him to be ready...</span></div></div>",

He could not me heard, nor would he be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved out of his cave and waited for the greater wind dragon to pass by.  Kusien jumped out and landed on the smaller dragon, taking his head in his maw and swallowing.  The smaller dragon growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KUSIEN!!!  AGAIN?!?\" He yelled.  The large Devourer chuckled and swallowed the small noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Kain?\" Kusien said to his belly.  Kusien, now a ten foot tall, standing on his hind legs, and nearly 2.5 ton Devourer dragon, chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you say 'hi' like a normal dragon?  Why is it when ever you greet me, you EAT me?!\" Kain complained.

I told him to follow me this way so he could meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what is this 'Silver-Haired Devourer' like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not FULLY a Devourer.\" A new voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien jumped when he saw the imposing figure.  He was nearl twice as tall as Kusien, and his scales shone brightly, contrasting with the bright blue of Kusien's own scales.  This dragon's scales were like the extremely rare metal, platinum, and were more than likely just as valuable.  He was MASSIVE!  The belly hung out in a way that Kusein had not seen before, and all of his appendages had their own generous deposits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you're Kusien right?\" The dragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...the...the Silver Haired Devourer!?\" Kusien said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess...I prefer to be called Dasuke, after it is my name,\" Dasuke held out a paw as he introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Dasuke?  As in THE Dasuke that defeated the demented Half-God?  The same one, said to be the LAST Halfling in existance!?\" Kusein asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yes?\" Dasuke said sheepishly.  \"It wasn't just me after all, and that was years ago...I don't do much now...\" He nervously rubbed his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Well, what DO you do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mainly eat...the recent years have made my Devourer half much stronger...so much that I...well, look like this.\" Dasuke smiled with slight blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...Though I've never seen someone as big as you...except maybe my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm still relatively small for a Devourer, after all, some can grow up to hundreds of feet tall, and hundreds of tons as well.  I'm only seven tons or so.  So, since I'm here, want to do something with me?  I'll let you decide.\" Dasuke smiled and leaned over to pat Kusien </span></div></div>",

THIS IS YOUR FAULT!\" Kusien yelled as best as he could.  Kain only gave a playful kick inside Kusien's gut as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few short minutes before the larger Devourer stopped, pausing at Kusien's own ponderous belly.  The smaller dragon breathed heavily, hoping that he would start moving the other way and would be released.  A large breath moving past his face suddenly pushed him forward, and Kusien could feel his gut being squished in and pressed out to the sides as he slid forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien tried to move, but found his arms pinned as he moved forward down Dasuke's throat.  He just groaned as he felt the sharp teeth press into his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien noticed he was sliding forward faster, as a slight feeling of panic took over his mind, thinking that this legend was going to just turn into some bubbling dragon fat.  hefelt his head press against a tight bunch of muscle, before being released into a fairly fresh space.  THAT surprised him, before he remembered that Devourers have a specially enlarged storage stomach.  Kusien fell quickly into the spongy sack, groaning and realizing that what he did to Kain had just happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\" Dasuke's voice came from all around him, the walls vibrating with his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien groaned.  \"You could have warned me!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...I tend to be a bit impulsive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien sighed.

I plan on showing you the biggest of the big out of all Devourers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of these festivals. The Devourer Festival is where Devourers who are of age gorged for several days straight. The festival helps Devourers put on a lot of weight. That's where my mother met my father. Unfortunately, my father couldn't move in with my mother since the cave was too small for his girth or that's how my mother states it. Apparently he's been trying to find a bigger place and intends on taking my mother there someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's typical for Devourers. It takes years for a male Devourer to find a good home for his mate. One Devourer couple couldn't live with each other for 30 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien then thought of an idea and involved making Dasuke think that he was extremely hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dasuke do you know how much longer we're going to be? I'm getting hungry.\" Kusien said in order to convince Dasuke to stop for a bite to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The festival is one week away away. I could easily swallow some wild life from an enchanted forest. In fact I think I could use something to eat as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien smiles as his prank is about to play out. Kusien knew that once Devourers started eating they won't stop until they eat more than half their body weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKain then kicks Kusien's belly which prompts the young Devouer to regurgitate his friend. The two dragons observing the helpless wildlife fall into Dasuke's storage stomach. Kusien figured that the rest of the wild life was going to Dasuke's other stomach. As Dasuke ate the walls of his stomach expanded to allow the excess food to be stored. Kusien and Kain took advantage of this opportunity and made a quick meal out of the wild life trying to find a way out of Dasuke's stomach. Kusien then took extra measures by storing some of the wild life in his storage stomach .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning Kusien?\" Kain asked as he noticed Kusien eating his fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see soon enough.\" Kusien whispered as a grin appeared on his muzzle.</span></div></div>",

Over the past few dayspast few days whenever Dasuke would stop for a meal Kusien would insist that he's still hungry even after he had his fill. Dasuke would comply by eating a little bit more than usual. Kusien would then store some of the food in his storage stomach and would trick Dasuke's storage stomach into opening the tract that leads to his other stomach. This would cause the wildlife to run to their inevitable deaths as they became one with Dasuke's girth. All the extra food had caused both Devourers to gain roughly 50 pounds or so. It wasn't until they arrived that Dasuke caught on, but he couldn't help but crack a smile remembering he would do the same thing to his own father when he was Kusien's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here. Get ready to be regurgitated and Kusien, please don't press against the walls of my stomach.

Don't worry I know that you were only trying to make your trip more enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusien sighed out of relief, however he and Cain were soonwisked upwards as Dasuke's storage stomach began to contract and expand in an effort to regurgitate the two. After two minutes  Dasuke spit both dragons of his mouth. Kain had managed to land on Kusien large hide while Kusien himself landed on his stomach. Both dragons were amazed as they saw that they were in some sort of town surrounded by greenery. Both dragons, mostly Devourers, and humans walked about hauling large barrels of food for the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Lush Haven , the world's most magical city and home to the Devourerer Festival.

Everyone else is too busy to have noticed your display of affection.\" Husien said as he cracked a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash of light Dasuke transformed into his human form. Kusien and the other two dragons were shocked. Dasuke went from being larger than Kusien to being much smaller in a blink of an eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start that tour. I was going to do it in my dragon form, but I don't think that will be possible if a certain someone wants to cuddle with me while I give the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat! Why can't you be super cuddly in human form as well!\" Sabrina complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Devourer hybrids with halfling blood or Crimson Mystic blood, human blood, or both have a faster metabolism. It will be a long time before Dasuke starts gaining weight in human form, unless he does nothing but eat.\" Kusien's father teased Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I need to pin him down and force more food down his gullet.\" Sabrina said in a snarky and sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke and the others take a tour of Lush Haven before registering for the Devourer Festival.</span></div></div>",

Help me!\" The girl cried as she tried to hit the thug with her boomerang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girly but you're magical royal friend won't save you. I know what you really are.

The man who caught her eye wore white clothes and was draped in a crimson robe. She had apparently heard of this man. His name was Keith Veranos. He and three others defeated the evil half god Emotion, better known as Shen Marens, who in turn is his brother's exact opposite.

Normally Zania would be angry, but she thought it would be best to out trick the hero and what better way than to transform into her human form. Zania then transformed into her female form, a woman with a fair complexion, red hair, green eyes and a fiery red dress. This caught Keith off guard. Zania used that to her advantage and used a gravity spell to pin the half dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want? You must have a reason for staring at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZania then burst with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the great prankster and hero didn't expect a Crimson Magma such as myself to be the future Queen of Silenia.

It looks like almost all of the legendary heroes are gathered for the ball. I believe the theme is Halfling Awareness.\" Alexander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I came up with the idea. I want to help the Halflings live at peace and by enacting a protection program that warrants imprisonment for killing Halflings who are not guilty of any crime. I also hope to share our family secret to show the difference between Halflings and other shapeshifting dragons. Someday I wish to for our kingdom to have great peace with all of dragon kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a goal milady. Let's finishing watching the duel.

Instead of telling you I'll just show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina transform into her true form, a 19 foot jade Halfling. Dasuke was stunned to see another member of his kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a Halfling!? So that means your brother is also a Halfling!\" Dasuke exclaimed as he was recovering from the shock of seeing another Halfling. \"There's no use in holding back.\" Dasuke said as a grin form on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke then transforms into his dragon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Dasuke takes up half of the arena!\" Zania gasped as she looked at the two dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect. He is part Devourer. I've heard rumors that he spends more time in his dragon form than his human form. He only changes to human form when entering towns and cities. I wouldn't be surprised if he starts gaining weight in human form eventually. Half dragon Devourers and Devourer hybrids that can turn into humans have a higher metabolism than other Devourers and their subspecies. It's usually not until after their teens that they gain weight and the weight gain is faster than other Devourers. It usually takes years before it sttarts affecting their human form.\" Molinda explained as she conjured up a pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Dasuke swallows Regina as she proceeds to shape-shift. He then regurgitates Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck! I'll have to take a bath! I can't believe he swallowed me when I tried to turned into sand! I was going to shape-shift into another form that usually would of beaten something as large as him!\" Regina complained as she threw saliva off her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to help clean you off.\" Alexander said as he used water magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina is then doused with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't let you walk back all wet.

You and Dasuke are becoming quite an item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us? A couple? He's cute, but he only sees me as just a friend. Sure he can be the cuddliest guy around when he's a dragon.\" Sabrina said before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet Keith is cute too.\" Zania replies as she blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fell in love with that psycho. He can barely sit still.\" Sabrina said trying not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we'll be getting a storm soon.\" Molinda said as she looked out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bolt of lighting strikes close to the castle. A man emerges from the lightning. He's a tall muscular man with electric blue hair and yellow eyes. He wields a large hammer and is dressed in armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Stormling? What is he doing here?\" Molinda asked referring to the hybrid standing by the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I the mighty Thor have come to seek an audience with the royal family!\" The man yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZania decides to cast a simple illusion spell on the castle in order to inquire about this Thor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father! Mother! I cast an illusion spell on a man named Thor. He asks to inquire of us but he does not have an invitation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work Zania. If this Thor poses a threat we will escort him out. If he comes with peace then the illusion shall fade.\"The king replied as he transformed into his dragon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZania, her mother, and the Halfling guards transform. Thor then enters the castle under the impression that Sabrina is the princess herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings fair maiden. I am Thor. I am from a far off land full of Halflings and Halfling Hybrids. While traveling I met a guy in a tavern who gave some sort of note. He reeked of blood and judging by his quiet demeanor he was an assassin by trade. I tried inquiring what the note meant but he didn't reply. Instead he just wrote another note. I have heard that your family is good at solving issues of the magical matter so I came here. One question though milady. Why is everything upside down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina gasped. Apparently Kevin had intended the note to be read by Keith, herself or Zania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, the weird substance that comes out of your mouth may be dangerous. Let me zap it before it kills you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was stunned speechless. Zania's illusion worked too well and now Thor wants to administer shock therapy. Zania lifts her illusion spell on Thor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What trick is this? A woman from Islesonia and a Crimson Magma? You must be the real princess. Blondie are you Sabrina Mathis? This note said to find you and the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Ken sent you. These notes are illegible. You storm smudged Ken's writing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm part Storm Dragon, but that's what happens. I believe the princess can use a restoration spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it in the morning. Airia show our guest to his room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Wind Halfing Hybrid peeps her head from around the corner before transforming into human form. She is petrified with fear upon meeting the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hel... Hello sir... Please follow me...\" The nervous Airia said as she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a cutie. The shy act is awfully adorable!\" Thor exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiria hides behind a plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she still shy? I thought she was getting over that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll warm up. She gets frightened of new people and large crowds. Fortunately all the invitees are people she'll know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ought to retire as well. Keith will be coming tomorrow. I sense this whole note restoration may spark a kiss.\" Molinda said in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina puts her hand to her face. <i>Out of all people did she have to fall in love with a psycho?</i></span></div></div>",

A lot of nobles will be in attendance and some commoners will be present as well. This was a great idea. There are very few humans that know our family secret.\" The king said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those few humans also work for us and take a vow of silence not to tell people that we're Crimson Magmas. This also ensures the Halflings we employ royal protection.\" The queen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness, this info about your family being hybrids and hiring my kind to serve you is an honor. I am thankful for the kindness you have shown.\" Dasuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should be thanking you and your comrades. You taking on the supposed title of the Last Halfling has helped many lives. Every Halfling that serves me and those who are in hiding thank you.  With our Halfling Awareness and the need for Halflings to be judged fairly by other Halflings we could use a new sheriff.\" Zania said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suke would make a great sheriff. All he would have to do is eat the criminals whole.\" Keith remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone except Sabrina starts laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have to decline such an offer. As tempting as that may sound it would traumatize people if they saw a Devourer start swallowing suspects, even if they are a half dragon.\" Dasuke replied as he was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dasuke's right. It would be terrible to associate the world's most lovable breed of dragon with devouring people. Though Devourers do such for no ill will it would be against their nature to do so unless their lives were threatened. Also most people believe that rubbing a Devourer's belly brings good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Sabrina. Can't you take a joke. Even Ken finds my jokes enjoyable so much so that he has to prevent himself from laughing too much and that's from a guy who only speaks by writing in his notepad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina glares at Keith. Zania is still laughing from Keith's remarks before she takes a sip of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken talks via notepad to distinguish himself from his murderous brother Shen. Shen would talk up a storm before he goes in for the kill, yet he's also skilled at impersonating his brother. Yet for the safety of mankind and human kind we classify Ken unofficially as a Blood God Dragon alongside his brother.\" Molinda said as she reached for a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet he's the only one not showing up to the ball. His duties and his stench might not bode well for the average man or dragon. Ken only sees us if he needs backup for a job or if something terrible is about to happen.\" Dasuke replied as he started eating his sixth plate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZania and her friends enjoy their time before the ball.</span></div></div>",

The king and queen invited me to negotiate a treaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember now. You're called the Lord of Thunder. The other day you sent a request for opening new trade routes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct milady. Lately my people have been having trouble with a certain witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she the Mad Witch?\" Molinda interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... You're a fortune teller like Belkin. Then you probably know that I'm no mere human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct. You're a third Storm dragon, a third Halfling and a third Crimson Mystic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your powers of perception are remarkable. Pardon me miladies, but I have business to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thor! Wait! Why don't you wait until later. I'm sure that my parents can make the negotiations tomorrow. We have plenty of food and drink. We can even help you take down the Mad Witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will consider your offer. Joining together with other heroes of legend will make an epic quest. Let us resume the celebration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without further ado the ball resumed as planned.

By the end of breakfast a new treaty for trade had been signed. However, the new trade route had been abandoned for years. Rumors say that a lord of fire had been controlling all trade in the area for at least six years. It was decided that Lord Thor of Thunshire would take a decent sized party to excavate the trade route. Naturally Zania volunteered to go along for she never been to Thunshire before. As a result Molinda, Belkin, Airia, Regina, Alexander and Dasuke and his friends agreed to help out. It was three hours later that Zania and her party were ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Mother and Father. I'll see in a few weeks!\" Zania yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Zania and tell us about the human culture of Thunshire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do Father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZania and her party wave goodbye as they walk down the abandoned trade route. Once on the route everything seemed fine until a foul odor loomed in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that smell? It smells like blood or something.\" Belkin said as he covered his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could mean only one of two things. Either this lord of fire hired thugs to kill people who take this road or a certain Angel of Death is nearby. If it is who I think it is then there is good reason why he's here on a road.\" Dasuke said as he transformed into his dragon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this attached to this tree. It looks like a note? Zania pondered as she approached the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZania carefully removes the note from the tree. She then opens the note. She notices that it is written in red.

The prophecy states that the Half-god Emotion will conspire with humanity to merge him with his older twin Duty. By then the Goddess Order will reawaken in the form of a human woman. In four months time Emotion will gather an army of faithful servants. Unfortunately this means that my evil brother plans on reversing the curse that separated us. If we were to be merged into one being again the world will truly plunge into disorder. If that ever happens you must awaken the Goddess Order. I'll do what I can to prevent Shen from fulfilling his plot for revenge. One more thing you should know if you can't tell the differences between me and him. This note that you're reading now is how I'll talk to you. My brother loves to hear himself speak so that should be a dead giveaway between us. If he is posing as me then our dragon forms will be the last indicator. In dragon form I have a black hide and blood red underbelly. Shen has a red hide and a black underbelly. May you fare well on your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen Marens.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! This makes the vision that I had yesterday much clearer. That means what I foresaw is bound to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told that after I met Keith yesterday, Molinda. But who is this woman that's supposed to be the Goddess Order reincarnated? Is it someone we know?\" Zania asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the Goddess is truly among us in our fair country of Silenia I would say that Sabrina may be the Goddess? He did say a human woman after all.\" Thor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that? There's no way that could be possible? It's true that up until after I was born my people would take their children to be blessed by the Goddess shortly after birth. Since then the priests and priestesses have been proclaiming that the Goddess will return soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy Sabrina. That outburst would only make it more likely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zip it Keith! Your just going along with Thor's joke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call a picture of the Goddess's human form a joke. I copied this from a book I was reading in the library. The resemblance is uncanny.\" Keith said as he showed the group the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no doubt that it's close but I can't imagine Sabrina wearing an outfit like that. The battle armor is like that of Valkyries.\" Zania responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sabrina could say something the bushes started rustling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we got some company boys.

Knowing that it was impossible to kill the half-god Dasuke lent Sabrina his sword to trigger Keith's imprisonment tome. After Shen was imprisoned he bid farewell to his comrades briefly. With sword in tow he walked towards the mountains. Yet once in a while he did run into his friends, except Ken who always stuck to the shadows. He enjoyed the casual pace that he started to put on weight in his dragon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he was embarrassed, but when Sabrina started to cuddle up to him he pretty much accepted the weight gain. It was bound to happen sooner or later. Now in his 20s Dasuke was a whooping seven tons, yet he's still somewhat small for a Devourer, but that is due to being both part human and part Halfling. His breed of dragon doesn't develop the Devourer traits until their late teens or early twenties. He won't gain a lot of weight in human form until his mid twenties or early 30s or if he decides to fully adopt the Devourer lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Dasuke had things to do. There has been one thing that always bugged him. Is he truly the last Halfling or are things not what they seem? Considering that Halflings seamlessly blend into human society, there may be more of his kind then what others let on. He's almost certain that some of the king's men are probably Halflings themselves. He's almost certain that Sir Alexander Gemstone was a Halfling himself, for he and his sister called themselves shapeshifters and never would go into battle with their respective weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now Dasuke was walking into town in his human form. Despite preferring his dragon form he didn't want people going out of their way just to rub his stomach and feed him. The last thing he wanted to do was eat the entire town clean. The last time that happened he sold a pelt that he shed. The pelt was more than enough to feed the town for five years, but he felt guilty despite the townspeople saying otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke briefly paused and pulled out a parchment stamped with the royal seal. It was an invitation to a ball on Halfling acceptance. He was invited to speak on behalf of his species. Afterwards he was asked to help the princess's committee revise the jurisdiction by establishing laws for fair treatment for Halflings. This included a jury full of both humans and Halflings. Dasuke sighs before putting the parchment away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Times are starting to change. It would be a relief to meet others who are Halfings or part Halfling. If I could find that out then I won't have to search for answers about my kin.\" Dasuke said to himself as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke looked around to see if there was anyone he knew. He then felt someone place a hand on his shoulder. Dasuke turned around to see Sabrina Mathis standing behind him or so he thought. He then heard the shouting of a maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keith! How dare you create a clone of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke sees Sabrina chasing Keith with an arrow loaded on her bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to lighten up! The clone is only temporary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke then looks back at the Sabrina clone. Her eyes turned pitch black and there were fumes coming off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Better dispose of this clone before she explodes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke quickly transforms and attempts to swallow the exploding clone. Once the clone was in his mouth it exploded, but the explosion wasn't as dangerous as he thought. Instead of damaging his mouth he tasted chocolate for some reason. Dasuke sensually moaned as he swallowed the chocolate remains of the clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the best chocolate I've tasted in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate? Chocolate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sabrina, I made the clone out of chocolate. It was the least dangerous substance I could think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina responds by slapping Keith across the face. Keith stumbled backwards due to Sabrina's impressive strength. Unlike most women, Sabrina had some pretty impressive muscles and a pair of four-pack abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have almost killed Dasuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Sabrina. Keith sure does know how to make some fine chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Suki! It's my mother's secret recipe. Speaking of my mother I believe she's writing a magical cookbook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool. What brings you two here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as you Dasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I just met a gorgeous gal who's totally into me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What girl would court a psychopath like you?\" Sabrina asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A princess who's not human.\" Keith replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the king's daughter? I've heard rumors that the royal families may be of hybrid dragon blood, but nobody has confirmed it and those who work with the royal family took a vow of silence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't believe me. I'm sure the princess will tell you tonight. I have to get ready for the ball. See you lovebirds later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith then disappears in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy really pisses me off. I thought he would of gotten saner by now, but he got worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Sabrina. Keith is just trying to have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina sighs as she leans against Dasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what he is saying is true, than I'm getting as far away as possible. The last thing we need is a nutcase as king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Greetings Mr. Sernos. Would you do me the honor of dueling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke turned around and saw Regina Gemstone standing right behind him. He then reverts to human form, much to Sabrina's chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your challenge Lady Gemstone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well head to the abandoned arena. Your welcome to watch if you like Miss Mathis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. I have to give a certain magician a piece of my mind. See you later Dasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina then blows a kiss at Dasuke before running in the direction of Keith's house. Regina and Dasuke then walk to the abandoned arena.</span></div></div>",

Both were almost evenly matched, but in the end Dasuke transformed and swallowed Regina whole before spitting her back up. He was then invited by Princess Zania to have lunch at the palace. During that time Dasuke enjoyed his lunch and even laughed at one of Keith's jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for the Lunch Princess Zania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem Dasuke. You're free to eat as much as you like. Our head chef that we recently hired used his magic to multiply our food supply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I don't want to be rude and let my appetite loose.\" Dasuke responded as he began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Suke. No one will complain if you bulk up a bit. I've been doing some research lately about Halflings anyway. My newest findings indicate that they can become truly massive. Combine that with some Devourer traits and you get one of the world's strongest dragon hybrids.\" Keith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only causes Dasuke to blush more. Without realizing it Dasuke takes two more plates of food and begins devouring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you enjoy my cooking.\" A deep masculine voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belkin? What are you doing here?\" Molinda asked the large red headed man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started my new job today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So our new chef is the new triple hybrid admirer you were talking about Molinda?\" Zania asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" Molinda replied as she started blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelkin's bright orange eyes gleamed before he spoke. \"The only people who knew were the king and queen and Molinda. If there is anything else I can fetch it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for dessert?\" Dasuke asked after he finished his ninth plate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact there is. I just finished baking two dozen pies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBekin takes out a saucer and pulls out a large knife. He then taps the saucer with the knife. Dasuke and the others witness a pie magically appear on the plate. Then with skilled precision Belkin slices the pie into ten pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" Keith said as Belkin gave him a piece of pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing. I just used my magical knife. I never go anywhere without it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the weapon that you chose. It seems pretty practical.\" Sabrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it is. Most Halflings chose a weapon that suits their personality. I can also use it for combat and fortune telling. I have to return to work. The ball is a few hours away. If you need anything just ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelkin then walks back to the kitchen. Dasuke and his friends finish off the pie they were given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the best Boysenberry pie I've tasted. I have a speech to prepare for. I'll see you at the ball tonight Zania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke then heads off to the royal garden. Little did he know that Sabrina was following him. After walking for thirty minutes Dasuke spots a large clearing within the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be a good spot for a brief nap. After that I'll practice my speech and get ready for the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke transforms into his dragon form and falls asleep while laying on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe. Dasuke looks so peaceful when he's asleep. Might as well take advantage of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina then back-flips onto Dasuke's stomach with great athletic grace. Once on her crush's belly she watches the clouds go by. Dasuke unconsciously rubs the side of his ample form before grinning in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's nice to relax once in a while, especially on a super cuddly dragon. I have a feeling that something epic will happen soon. I just feel like something inside me is ready to come out. It may be my magical abilities growing stronger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina yawns and falls into a brief sleep.</span></div></div>",

Dasuke looked at the statues and deduced that both of the statues were of the Goddess Order. Dasuke was still in his dragon form and just happened to notice a woman wearing a cloak at the fountain that stood in the center of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Dasuke. I've been expecting you.\" The woman said in a voice that strangely sounded a lot like Sabrina's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke walked towards the fountain where the woman was standing. The woman walks towards the center of the fountain and turns around. To Dasuke's surprise the woman was Sabrina or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina? What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughs briefly before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have me mistaken for the body that I have been reincarnated into. I am the Goddess Order. I have come to warn you of Emotion's wicked scheme. A scheme that threatens to tear the world apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you speaking of Shen and what do you mean that you have been reincarnated in Sabrina's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dasuke, I was there when we sealed Shen away, but a witch is currently planning on freeing him. As for the reincarnation, didn't you listen to Sabrina as she told you the legends of the war against the God Chaos?\" Order said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember, but I didn't think it would happen in this generation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite understandable Suke.\" Order replied as began cuddling up to Dasuke's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Order? How should we prepare for this looming threat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out in due time Dasuke. What I can say is that you'll have many allies and grow more powerful. Before we part there's something I need to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrder directs Dasuke's attention to the fountain. Dasuke takes a look into the fountain. The fountain shows Dasuke a reflection of his future. In it he sees himself in both his human form and dragon form. In his human form Dasuke appears to be roughly 1000 lbs. and a foot taller, yet it was obvious that his muscles were massive due to the definition in his arms and legs. In his dragon form Dasuke was probably the largest dragon he had ever seen. By his guess he Probably had to be 20 times his current size or maybe close to 30 times his current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that my future? I know in my dragon form my metabolism is starting to lower, but I wasn't sure about it affecting my human part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the natural order for your type of hybrid Dasuke. You're destined to grow more powerful on your journey and I think Sabrina and I would adore the extra in both of your forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDasuke blushes as the Goddess who is actually Sabrina in human form rubs Dasuke's belly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Long ago in a time long forgotten the Goddess Order helped defeat the wicked God Chaos by granting humans and dragons a solution to their troubles. The gift was a curse known as Gemini, a powerful curse that reduces a deity's powers by dividing them into two distinct personalities and causing hatred towards each other. After human and dragon triumphed over Chaos who were now known as Emotion and Duty, respectively, the Goddess vanished as the remainder of her powers went back to her temple in Islesonian Isles. During the war she had taken too much damage from Chaos's attack and only had enough strength to give the heroes of Silenia the curse. The Goddess faded knowing that Duty should keep his brother in line as they became Angels of Death who guided the departed souls of man and dragon to eternal paradise or damnation depending on whether they were faithful to the Goddess's teaching. For centuries the Goddess's spirit has been slumbering within her temple recovering and awaiting reincarnation. The day came as a couple expecting a child entered the sacred temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was ready to give birth and the husband was stressed. All worshipers of the Goddess wanted her sacred blessing for their children. Many humans and Halflings disguised as humans partook in this tradition on the isles. The Mathis family were a regular human family, but their soon to be little girl was predestined to take the reign as the Goddess reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Selena! The priest is almost done delivering the baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying Harold! She's about to come out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that we're having a daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a feeling I have! Ow! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!\" Selena screamed as the priest delivered Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newborn Sabrina starts crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on having a daughter. Now we must place her on the alter so she may receive the Goddess's blessing.\" The priest said as he took Sabrina to the altar right next to the bed that her mother was laying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O Glorious Goddess Order, I bring to you a baby girl who shall receive your blessing! I ask that you protect her from all evil and let her be a woman who strives for order and balance! I ask you to lend her your gift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the priest said the blessing something unusual and wonderful happened. A light spewed out of the altar and took the form of the dragon. The dragon then took on the form of a woman. The woman touches the babe Sabrina and pours all of her energy into the child. The Goddess and Sabrina became one flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the stars! Our Goddess has returned! What are you going to name this godly child?\" The priest said in an over excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name shall be Sabrina Mathis for she has the beauty of the Goddess.\" Her Mother Selena said as she held the babe in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A remarkable name that suits the newly reborn Goddess. When she is of age she will bloom and blossom like a flower. She will be adventurous and to the point and will never back down. Like the Goddess she will hate being confined and will be a free spirit. When her powers develop she will inherit the Sacred Lightning Bow. In 20 years or so her powers will be awakened, but that will come when the world is on the brink of destruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mathis family was overjoyed at their bundle of joy, however they will not live long enough to tell their daughter of her fate for they would be killed by the demented half God. It would be that day that throws Sabrina into the hands of destiny.</span></div></div>",

On her journeys she occasionally ran into her comrades, except Ken who's whereabouts are unknown. Armed with her bow she was practicing her archery skills. Little did she know that a new journey was about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina had little to no knowledge that she is destined to become the Goddess Order reincarnated into human form or the draconic powers she would achieve upon the Goddess's awakening. All in all she only knew how much she'll make after she sells the two rabbit pelts she has. As she drew back her bow she focused on the target. Her arrow began to emit electricity. Then with a graceful release she fired the arrow at the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow had hit its target. Sabrina grinned as she went to retrieve the arrow. After putting the arrow back into her quiver Sabrina set off for town. However, the rustling of bushes caught her ears. On instinct Sabrina loaded an arrow onto her bow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out! If you think you can ambush me you're surely mistaken!\" Sabrina yelled at whoever was in the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have mercy on me! I came on His Majesty's behalf!\" A woman yelled in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina returns her arrow to her quiver and lowers her bow. The woman in the bush slowly makes her way to Sabrina. The woman had platinum blonde hair and amber eyes. She stood three inches taller than Sabrina, but was slightly less muscular. She wore a light blue maid's outfit that complemented her athletic figure. The maid curtsies before speaking to Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The... The name's A... Airia.

She then curtsies before running off. Sabrina reads the invitation briefly. A grin forms on Sabrina's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like my favorite dragon will be attending tonight's ball. Hopefully he'll ask for my hand in marriage. No, wait. Why should I wait for him to ask me when I can ask him.
