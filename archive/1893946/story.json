It probably rolled under the drivers sit as I tried to catch it with my toes. Could you get it for me?\". You reached out beneath the with your hand, trying to feel the flip flop as Roni and Alex both left the car, grabbed their stuff and started walking towards the beach. \"We'll meet you later\", Roni said as she sent an air kiss up your way, and you smiled. <br>\r\nThen, your hand finally hits the flip flop, as you pull it from under the sit. \"Have you found it yet?\", Shir asks you. \"Not yet..\", you reply, as you bend down and look at it, feeling it with your fingers. You've always had a thing for feet, a fetish - and for some reason, Shir was on the top of your list. You remembered one time when she sat next to you, her feet up on the couch almost touching your hand. You just couldn't resist - and slowly moved your hand towards her wiggling toes, and stroke each one with a swift motion of your index finger. The toes stopped wiggling, and as you looked at Shir's face, you could tell she was a little puzzeled, even though she didn't look your way. A few seconds passed, and you felt as if you've made the biggest mistake of your life.. When the toes started wiggling again!<br>\r\n\"No way..\", you thought, \"Could she possibly invite me to touch her toes again?\". You streched your index finger yet again, and slowly, shaking with fear, started stroking the undersides of her toes. You've stroked the first and second toes, and could actually feel the tiny drops of sweat as your finger swiped them away from the foot's slightly hot flesh. When you reached the third toe, suddenly the toes clunched with great force, traping your finger under them. You immediately looked at Shir's face, scared as hell, to see what her reaction's like - and then you saw it.. Shir was actually smiling. She actually liked the fact that you were touching her smelly foot, and stroking her toes. She squeezed her toes a couple more times, letting all the sweat and dirt from her undersides drip all over your little finger, and at that moment, on that couch - she never looked more sexy and irresistible to you.<br>\r\nSince that event, you've never had the chance to touch Shir's feet again. True - you did gave Roni some relaxing foot massages, and even managed to sneak a sniff of Alex's sandal while visiting her house one time - but nothing compared to that night with Shir's awesome toes. If you could, you would've liked to stick your tounge between her sweaty toes, and lick them forever and ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should bend over and search closely\", you tell her. \"Fine, just find the stupid thing\". You bend over, making it look at if you're looking under the sit - and get the flip flop as close to your face as you can. You look at it cloesly - and can see the dump, black prints made by her toes, and could only imagine how sweaty her toes must have been. You feel the prints with your finger, going through each one as slowly as possible. \"Shir, I've found it\", you say as you've finished. \"Good, can you pass it under the chair?\", she asks. \"Sure\". You look under the chair, flip flop in one hand, and then you see it - Shir's foot, blocking all the light as it reaches down, under the chair, toes first to grab the strings of the flip flop. You stretch your hand forward, trying to feel where her foot it, and then you feel them - her sweaty toes land on your fingers, scrunch a bit and then continue to cover your whole hand. You're in heaven as you adjust the flip flop, so the toes could grab it. It's like a heavenly dance - the toes rub themselves against your hand, up and down, and occasionally split up, allowing the space between two toes to collide with your skin as they run down your finger, trying to reach the divider. You're in heaven as you extend your fingers towards her, in the darkness around you, and just as you're about to take it all in - the toes grab the flip flop, and retreat. You snap back into reality as you watch the foot go back, while Shir says \"thank you baby\", and then proceeds to adjust the flip flop on her foot as she leaves the car to find Roni and Alex.<br>\r\nAs the door behind Shir closes, you feel empty inside. You take your hand out, and put it against your cheek. It's still hot and moist from the encounter. And then you slide it towards your nose and take it all in. It smells like lotion mixed with sweat and a little bit of stench, but it's so good. And you bet the undersides smell even better! If only you could be so small as to go and smell a woman's foot, without her knowing - you wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's time to snap into reality, grab your backpack and go after the girls, you think. Maybe the opportunity to worship someone's foot would come eventually, but it probably won't be today. <br>\r\nOr would it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, you get out of the car and start walking towards the beach - where you see the three girls, who already opened the parasol and set the straw mat on the hot sand. As you near them, Roni starts running your way, smiling - and before you can even figure out what's going on, she jumps on you and curls her legs on your torso as you hold her tight. \"Honey? me, Shir and Alex have to go change into our bathing suits. would you be a dear and keep unpacking our stuff and set the folding chairs we brought?\", she asks you. \"Sure, sweetie, you go on ahead\", you answer, smiling. \"Thanks baby, you're the best\", she replies as she gives you a kiss. Then she runs back to the girls, as Alex hands her her bikini, and they all run to the women's showers to change into something a little more appropriate. <br>\r\nYou watch them go further and further away, as you reach the spot they picked out on the beach. You feel tired from all the driving, and a bit light headed if to say the truth. You take one of the foldable chairs with one hand, and with a swift motion - adjust it and plant it into the hot sand. You take a good look at how inviting it looks to you, and think to yourself: \"What's the harm if I take one minute of resting? the girls probably won't be back for another 5 at best\", you think, \"After that, I'll get right to the other three chairs and start organizing everything else\". So you take off your backpack, take off your flip flops just behind the parasol, far from your position, and fall into the hugging arms of the foldable chair - and it feels amazing. Not before long, your eyes close faster then light, as you take all the sounds, salty air and the hot warmth of the sun in. It feels amazing, as you slowly drift into sleep.. <br>\r\nIt feels so right, and yet, for some reason - so wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in complete panic!, \"Shit! what time is it?!\", you think as you stare at your clock. it's 12:34.. you've only been asleep for 4 minutes, thank good. \"Oh man, my head hurts like hell.. I just have to finish preparing everything and then I'll go back to sleep for an hour or so until it fades away\", you mumble as you rub your eyes, and take a small leap forward to get up. Only.. there's nothing to stop your fall.<br>\r\nYou panic and feel disorianted as you plumet to the great at such a great speed and before you can even understand what's happening around you - you hit the hot sand, face first, and get a fistful up your mouth. You cough like hell, as you try and open your eyes wider.. and then you notice something strange - the sand actually looks and feels like it's made of chunks of grains, rather then individual ones. But you didn't notice that on the way over - so what the hell's going on here?<br>\r\nYou try to find something to hold on to as you try to recover your balance.Then you find something that seems to be strong enough, like some sort of shelf with ridges on it's outside surface to help you hold on. As you finally regain your balance and stand up, you lay against it as you rub your eyes until your vision returns to it's normal state. You open your eyes, and see you're staring directly at the beach. Sure, the grains of sand look wider in size, but it's probably because you didn't pay any attention to it to begin with. \"Probably just lost my balance there, for a minute\", you think, and you turn around to see what's that thing you've been leaning against - and fall back on your butt, short of breath and scared like you've never felt in your life, as you begin to understand what that thing actually is.<br>\r\nA giant blue wall, decorated with pink flowers - well actually, some of them looked a bit more blackish then pink. and as you examine it more closely, you finally see them - right where the wall is being connected to a ceiling by some sort of an arch, stand five black, dump prints, each the size of a car and a half, from the biggest who's the nearest to the sand, 'till the smallest one, who's the furthest away from you. \"It can't be..\", you think to yourself, \"That's Shir's flip flop!\".<br>\r\nAnd indeed, tipped on it's side, laying right next to you. \"I.. shrunk?! but how can this be?!\", you start yelling. You get up and stare at the giant foldable chair infornt of you.. it's tall at least as an office building, and you just can't believe your eyes. \"Why have I shrunk in size?..\", you're thinking, as you start going through all the things that happened during the last few hours. \"Me and Roni got to the car, put the stuff in the trunk, drove to pick up Shir then Alex, drove for 2 hours while everyone else fell asleep, got the the beach, helped shir find her flip flop, got ou..\", you stop. \"I touched and smelled Shir's foot\", you tell yourself, \"Could she have done this to me on purpose? but it doesn't make any sense.. she didn't seem to know..\", but your mind goes blank as you suddenly hear thundering-earthquakes nearing you, and turn around to see what's going on.<br>\r\nThen you see them, giantess size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/513/29860010151167227726170.jpg/\" target=\"_blank\">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/513...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shir leading the way, her toes wiggling hard and strong on each step to get the sand out of them, while crushing the small grains with each step she takes. It is both magnificent and terrifiying. And Roni, your sweetheart, follows in her foot steps as her giant toes plumet into the sand, making sure to smoosh each grain as much as possible.<br>\r\nShir is smiling, and for a minute - it actually seems as if she's looking directly at you!, \"Is she looking at me?! could she know?..\", you ask as you follow her eyes as she nears your position. But then it hits you - she's not looking at you at all, she's looking at the foldable chair. And the reason she's smiling is because she's probably going to take a seat and rest her tired feet up on the sand..<br>\r\n\"ON THE SAND!\", you yell. And then you understand you have to take drastic measures, if you want to avoid being crushed under Shir's massive feet. You take a look around you, and in the blink of an eye, decide to.. </span></div></div>",

Shir and Roni would reach you soon, and unless you take drastic measures here, your life could end before you know it.<br>\r\nYou jump into a batch of sand in front of you, clawing your hands into the grains like a maniac. You have 30 seconds tops, and you have to make sure to get as far away from their feet as possible.<br>\r\nYou dig with all of your strength, reaching as far and low as your tiny hands possibly can. Soon enough your entire body is being able to fit into that little hole you've created. You keep on clawing deeper - not sure where you're going, but as long as you're doing something instead of just doing nothing - it seems logical to you. <br>\r\nSoon you begin to notice the air levels dropping, fewer rays of sunshine reaching into your tiny hideout and the heat from the outside being replaced with a cooler sensation. You know what's at stack here, the idea of shir simply crushing your beneath her foot is too terrifying - so you keep your senses and dig in with your all. This is no time to slow down.<br>\r\nAnd as you keep on doing that, you begin to wonder.. where is Shir? It's been quite a long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have a chance to react, the sight before you takes you by storm. Between hundreds, maybe thousands of grains flying all around you, as you spin out of control, you notice them - 5 gigantic shovel like monsters, each covered with a lovely shade of purple, digging their way into the sand and around you. You try and regain control, but you're just unable to do so because of your tiny size - and that sends tremors down your spine, as you understand just how insignificant you are right now.<br>\r\nIt's a no brainer for you - it's obviously a foot. A gigantic, smelly, five toed foot clawing it's way into your hideout in a matter of less than a second - while you took about 30 of those in order to try and hide yourself from it. The toes clunch with huge force, crushing the grains of sand, and yourself, between them, as they begin to leave the comfort of their new home into the outside world.<br>\r\nAs you feel your whole world turned upside down, the toes that are holding you as their prisoner starts to wiggle in anticipation as the hot air begins to wash over them again. Although it takes some adjustments, your eyes finally open up - and when you look up, you notice the lovely face of ___, staring back at your new home.</span></div></div>",

You go into a panic, struggling against the vice-like grip of her toes; if being stepped on by one of your friends was bad, being stepped on by a complete stranger was even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're helpless, just another grain of sand that stuck to the pale flesh of her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment of peace ends, and with a rush of sun-baked air her foot goes soaring across the beach. You scream, sand blasted as her foot soars high, higher, and higher still, before speeding down towards the ground. You're rocked as she lands heel first, nearly losing your lunch as her toes follow suit, arcing towards the warm surface. They impact, plunging below; you choke back another wail as sand rushes in, burying you and her toes as she presses her foot down. You recall this, the familiar cluntching of toes as they wriggling in the sand, grinding you between towers of skin and boulders of rock and silicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot rises once more, shedding waterfalls of sand as it bursts free from the earth. You find yourself immobilized, caked between a hard layer of sand and the unrelenting skin that curved beneath her fourth toe. Helpless, you screw your eyes shut and wait to die as she begins to step forward yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon couldn't understand people who wore shoes on the beach. The sandy foot experience was basically the whole point of the trip to the ocean! She relished every step, worming her toes in the warm ground, feeling the particles shift and clump and stick at her whim. She liked to think she could sense the Earth's very essence like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked by a group of three young women on her way back to her group; distracted by them she failed to notice Tobi's small form among the sand, though to be fair she likely wouldn't have seen him anyway. He stuck to her skin like one of the thousands of grains of sand, unnoticed as Shannon strolled along the beach. She moved slow, letting the ground press into her as she stepped, unaware of how this tormented the poor man at her feet. Had she known that each step popped Tobi's ears, that each wriggle of her toes scraped away more of Tobi's skin, that every grain of sand that she clutched at threatened to smush Tobi, she likely would have helped him. She didn't, however, so she carried on, step by grueling step, until she reached her spot and flopped back on her beach towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe five yards away were two young girls, half her age: Katrielle and Elizabeth. Kat and Liz were sisters, and Shannon was their babysitter. Their mom was stinking rich, so Shannon was paid quite a fair bit to take them to the beach and keep an eye on them. It wasn't a bad gig, either, since the girls were just the sweetest things, without a mean bone in their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back on the towel, Shannon crossed her feet at her ankles; a shower of sand poured off them onto the fabric, including the poor, abused Tobi. Still unaware of his existance, she closed her eyes. The girls were fine, she had decided, so maybe she could just catch a quick nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, had decided to:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear the thunderess footsteps of Shir as she slowly reaches up to your position. You turn around as quickly as possible and start running through the sand towards the chair, which is only about a few steps away from you - but at your current position, seems like the journey of a lifetime.<br>\r\nYou run hard and fast, as your feet sink into the sand below you. Although you are small, the grains are still small enough to sink under your weight. You start yelling: \"Come on, come on!!!\", as you take one look behind and see the most amazing sight you have ever seen - Shir's massive foot raising from the ground, about to take another step. The grains of sand fall from her flesh as it flexes in the heat of the sun, the giant toes grind against each-other up and down, as if to call: \"Come here, little man - we won't hurt you\", and the sweat that drips from her huge sole glimmers in the light from above. It's a beautiful sight, but as you snap to your senses - you understand that unless you run under that chair, those toes could mean your death - so you turn your head away and dig your feet into the hot sand as you run away as fast as you can.<br>\r\nTen steps later, and you're already exhausted. Your breath is heavy and your sight is blurry - but the foldable chair's shadow already covers you. You are so near, so you crack a smile and contine your steps - one, two, three.. soon enough you will come to a rest. As you reach it, you grab the one of the small metal bers that hold the chair in place, and bend down so you could catch your breath again. It's great - the cool breeze blowing around you, the shadow covering your body and the small grains of sand that are falling on your head. Small.. grains of sand? \"that doesn't make any sense\", you think to yourself as you look up, and cower next to the metal bar in fear - the huge sole of Shir's massive foot is covering your sight. The toes wiggle above your head and before you even have time to do anything - they charge at you, or the metal bar in fact. The big and second toes charge at you, head on - as they collide with your tiny body. You are being mashed into the skin between the two giant toes as they wiggle in excitement. You're completely taken over by fear - as you push the smelly flesh with your hands, as many drops of sweat overflow your mouth. You begin to gag, and just before you think it can't possibly get any worse - it all stops. The two giant toes lay still to the sides of you, and as your senses come back to you - you feel this cool feeling upon your back, as if it's some kind of a cold wall you're being smashed into. It feels nice and relaxing, and as you look behind you to see exactly what it is, your eyes widen - it's the metal bar, as the spot between the two gigantic, smelly, sweaty toes are being pressed into it. And just as it all comes into place, and you begin to understand what Shir is about to do, you hear her voice booming from above, as her eyes focus on that little metal bar: \"Ohhh... it feels soooooo gooooood\".<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the toes start wiggling against that little metal bar. The hot toes try and cool themselves against the cool metal surface and also dry that sweat that's been building up between them - and for you, it's a living hell. The sweat keeps you in place, as the hot flesh moves all around you - forcing your face deep into it, smelling it and feeling it rub against you. You try to wiggle yourself free, but everytime you do - Shir just rubs the skin between her toes harder and harder. She must think you're some kind of dirt and sand grains being stuck together by her sweat - and she's just trying to take you apart. As she does it, you can hear her moaning from up above - this must be heaven for her.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the toes make a dramatic turn. Before you can even respond, your right leg is caught between the metal bar and her second toe, and a second later, the wiggling resumes - and you hear a cracking sound. \"AHHHHHH!!!!!\", you yell in pain as your leg snaps before your eyes, and before you even start crying - the skin mashes itself against you, pushing you hard into the metal bar, as it rubs you up and down. She's applying more force into the rubbing, as it feels good for her - there's no other explanation.<br>\r\nThe flesh is pressed hard into your little face - keeps you from screaming, from crying - and almost entirely of breathing. You can hear grinding all around you as the toes assault the little metal bar, and keep pushing the plump skin with your hands and kicking it with your feet.. well, foot. It's a living hell..<br>\r\nBut the real question is - what happens next?</span></div></div>",
