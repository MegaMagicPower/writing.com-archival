You each received a call from one Mr. Vincent Rush, a man who is famous for doing these reality tv type challanges to give away his vast fortune, but he didn't say what the object of this game was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou each unload from the helicopter, the five of you lining up as Mr. Rush approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Contestants are as follows\" bellows a voice from the beyond<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia Kenoff.

The literal translation of this name is \"Island of the Obese One\" which, my friends, is why you are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cause you to look at your other contestants, who share your look of bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to a good friend of mine, this island now lives up to its name. He has provided many, many items for our little game. They have dispersed on the island. Each of these items will either make you gain or lose weight. That is the object of the game friends. You will be changing your weight regardless of what happens, but the one who at the end of this week who is the lightest of the five of you will win the million dollars. The rest of you will become permanent residents of the island, cursed to fluctuate in weight until the day you die. It was all in the contracts, albiet worded slightly different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think!\" you shout \"this is unfair. We all worked hard to be who we are, and you are going to change our lives forever, just for your entertainment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks slowly over to you smiling. He places a small wrapped candy in your pocket, and laughs. \"Why, yes. Do enjoy that candy whenever you get around to eating it, my dear friend. Anyway, as I was saying. You will all find cabins to sleep in around the island, and there are no creatures on this island who wish to harm you, so from this moment on, it is just you five, and the magical powers of the Island of the Obese. Good Luck, and may the thinnest person win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just great\" you say as you look down at your current body, knowing that it soon would be different, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, just who exactly are you?</span></div></div>",

Every last one of the men gather around the concrete slab that you're on to admire your body, which you now notice is still growing!  The many rolls and lovehandles at your sides have grown past the boundary of the slab, and are now hanging off the sides, slowly creeping towards the cold stone floor.

He didn't question why he hadn't noticed these items earlier, his find too focused on his mental whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, I think....I need to get some sleep.\" Caitlin looked exhausted enough, who knows how long she had been running from that creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sure, get some rest.\" Adam nodded before he intently watched as Caitlin settled herself and quickly feel asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Poor girl, she's so tired and hungry too' the voice purred, 'we don't need to wake her, we can feed her while she's resting, she'll be so happy when she wakes up'. Adam nodded to the voice's statement before quietly getting up and heading towards to supplies. He inventoried 5 water bottles, 10 fruit, and after opening the boxes discovered them to be filled with Hostess snack cakes of various types. He grabbed the water bottles first and headed back over to Caitlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here...\" Adam softly mumbled as he lightly held Caitlin's jaw and slowly poured the liquid down her throat. He didn't want to choke her so he only did small amounts at a time to not upset her rest. Besides, what was the rush? He would make sure she was always have everything she needed. He finished all the bottles which at about 50 pounds each had added an additional 200 pounds to her making her over 400 now. The water had the effect of spreading throughout her body pretty evenly causing everything to sag. He then went back to the supplies and decided on the hostess cakes next, he stacked 3 of the boxes and carried them over to Caitlin's increasing side. He stopped and looked confused at the boxes of food, \"Food....will wake....\" He murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO boy, she WANTS the food, she'll EAT it without waking up, WE just NEED to give it to her, she's SO tired after all' The voice continued stronger and louder then last time, the powder controlling more and more of him. Adam grabbed a twinky, unwrapped it and placed it in Caitlin's that was resting on her stomach, her nose twitched and her arm moved the twinky to her mouth where she sleepily ate it before resting her hand on her stomach again. Adam continued this going through the first box before Caitlin started to stir.</span></div></div>",

The rhythmical rising and falling keeping her calm before her brain finally caught up and she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam appeared at her side, softly patting her massive stomach, \"Hungry.\" his voice said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?!\" Caitlin demanded. \"Does it look like I need anymore food?! I'm a whale!!\" Caitlin now weighed over 500 pounds, she tried to stand up but the added weight on her injured ankle made her shriek before she feel on her ass jiggling the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry.\" Adam stated again before turning and bringing several boxes closer to where she fell. He opened the top box and pulled out a Ho Ho and unwrapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" Caitlin tried to move away, but found that her body would not let her move. \"What did you do to me?\" Caitlin was starting to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry.\" Adam said again, placing the Ho Ho in her hand and stared at her through glassy eyes. Caitlin's body moved grabbing the Ho Ho bringing it to her mouth and to her horror she chewed and swallowed the entire thing. After she finished eating it, Adam turned his attention back to the box and pulled out a Snowball this time and repeated the process, each time saying the same thing over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....\" Caitlin begged after finishing an Apple Fruit Pie, \"Stop this....\" She found it getting harder and harder to speak, despite her weak protests she found herself looking at each piece of food in her line of sight with anticipation. Her idle hand starting grabbing at the food as well so she could get it to her mouth faster and her felt a voice inside her whispering \"More\". The plant has also infected Caitlin but this was for her to want to eat more and more. Her previous shock had kept her from hearing the voice earlier but now that she had rested it had begun. She was well over 800 pounds at this point, immobile unless someone where to help her, and even then not very far. Her face had very well rounded, her cheeks looking like a tennis ball was stuffed in each. Her face was framed by her quadruple chin growing above her ever increasing breasts resting on her massive size stomach laying on the floor. Her shoulders have been swallowed up by fat and her torso and arms where now one continuing mass. Her stomach pushing aside her thick legs, toes curling from the amount of pleasure she was getting. Eventually her arms started getting so fat it was getting difficult to bring them to her face to continue eating. She grunted as she tried to move but found herself to weak to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'SHE so HUNGRY, FEED HER BETTER' The voice, once a soft whisper in Adam's head had completely taken over his mind, it only needed to issue a command and he would obey. The next piece he jammed directly into her mouth while she eagerly gulped and swallowed. This continued for some time until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before you can reach the edge of the path however your vision begins to fade to black and your consciousness starts slipping away. You manage to belt out a feigned cry for help before your legs finally give way causing you to pass out and crash into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs consciousness slowly returns and your senses realign, you wake up to discover yourself on a wooden cart that is being taken down a forested path. Still a massively overweight little girl, but your time unconsciousness has at least allowed you to regain your strength. Before you can do anything else however, a man speaks up from behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, so you've finally woken up.\" He says with a brash, accented voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to turn your head and look around to see him, but still being unaccustomed to your body makes it difficult. You try to adjust yourself but your belly is in the way of the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't strain yourself, now.\" he says. He laughs a little to himself and continues, \"It's my fault. I should've known to bring a bigger cart with me. This one's usually for the younger kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart <i>does</i> seem to be a little small for someone of your size. Giving up on trying to adjust yourself, you remember that you are still in the competition for a million dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you taking me?\" you ask in a somewhat scared tone of voice. \"I-I'm on the island for a competition, and I need help to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking you the village,\" he responds, in a calm and assuring voice. \"They can help you there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to lose this weight....I-I'm not supposed to be this big. I'm not even supposed to be this young! I'm 19 years old and kinda thin and I just picked up the dress-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The elder in the village will help you with your problems.\" He says, interrupting your frantic conversation. You can't actually see his face, but from the tone of his voice you get the impression that despite your appearance, he's aware of your plight. It calms you down a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you come to a clearing in the forest where a few aboriginal looking huts are erected. There you see a host of massively overweight people wearing the same style dress as you are going about themselves. A fire resides in the middle of the village surrounded by elaborate hanging decorations, while off the side many other smaller campfires are erected and people are preparing food. \"This must be where this little girl's dress came from,\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart stops right before the entrance to the village and the man who was pushing you pops into view. In start contrast to the villagers here, he's buff looking and wearing adventurer clothing. A gristled face with facial hair and somewhat young looking...if you were your normal self you'd probably be really attracted to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I'll take you there.\" He says, motioning you to get out. Slowly, you attempt to sit back up but the small size of the cart makes it difficult to wedge your body fat out. \"Ack...\" you spurt out, blushing massively. Noticing your difficultly, the man leans over to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon now, up you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly effortlessly on his part you're sitting back up again. Still wedged against the side of the cart, you pull your belly out and plop it down in front of you. Finally loose, the man takes a hold of your left hand, puts his arm around your back and helps you down onto the ground. It's a little difficult to stand up again, but you manage to stay up this time on your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. Now c'mon, the Elder will want to speak with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing him through the village, everyone else seems unaffected by his presence. Are they used to him being here? And how come he's so different from everyone else? Despite your age and weight, you fit in pretty well here with your matching clothing. You notice a few other children roughly your age and size playing around a small campfire and seem to be enjoying themselves. They take notice of your arrival with the man and wave. \"Oh no, they saw me!!\" you panic, and quickly force your attention back in front of you again. Do they think you're the girl your clothes originally belonged to? No, that can't be it...surely you look far different in appearance from the girl they're thinking of. All these massive people around you are beginning to really frighten your little 7 year old self. You move closer...a lot closer...to the man and try to stay with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you come to a bigger sized hut form the rest, adorned with exquisite symbols on the door. this must be where the Elder lives. The man turns around and kneels down to your level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I need to go inside and talk to the elder first by myself, then you can come in. Will you be alright?\" The prospect of being out here alone does not sit well with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I'm scared....I want to come in with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay darling, I'll be right out again in no time and then you can talk to the elder and get this all sorted out, alright?\" He smiles, evoking somewhat of a fatherly figure which succeeds in calming you enough to nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ata' girl.\" He says, affectionately patting you on your belly causing it to jiggle a little. \"Just wait right here, I'll be right back.\" He gets back up and opens up the curtain to the hut. A massive man, weighing no less than 500lbs by your estimate escorts him inside and the curtains fall back shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone again though, your thoughts start to wander. Is he really being genuine? What if he's just trying to mislead me? What if they confuse me with the little girl these clothes belonged to like those other kids did? What if I'm stuck here forever? Your mind is increasing overwhelmed by negative thoughts. To make matters worse, the smell of all the food being prepared is starting to give you cravings. Placing your hands on your tummy you can feel it churning...so hungry...maybe they'll let you just stay here for a while and eat up some of that delicious smelling food and then let you go. It doesn't seem like a very dangerous place, now that you think about it. You haven't seen any weapons since you got here, maybe they're a peaceful people? You're already dressed and look like them, maybe you just need to sample some of the cuisine and they'll accept you. Or maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the Elder hut is on the edge of the village and you could make a run for it back into the forest if you so desired. Or you can stay here and wait for the man to come back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The smell of the food wafting in the air eventually cleanses your mind of suspicions about these people. \"How bad can it be?\", you think to yourself. \"Nobody with food that smells this good can possibly be bad\". By now though all those arousing aromas are making you incredibly hungry...looking around you spot a what appears to be a bread roll on a bench nearby. Without any regard for who it belongs to you wander over and swipe it off the bench and immediately begin munching down on it, stopping for a moment only to reconcile with how you've never acted so rude about what is surely other people's food ever before...\"But...\" you think to yourself, trying to justify it, \"I've never been this hungry before either!!\" As you're about halfway done though, you hear the man's voice again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! There you are! Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" you shriek, trying to conceal the half-eaten roll behind your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, It's alright.\" He says. \"You probably haven't eaten in a while anyways. Go ahead, nobody will mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously you take it out from behind your back. He smiles again, motioning with his hands that it's alright. Giving into intense hunger you start chowing down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along now,\" he replies. \"It's time to go see the Elder.\" Without stopping your work on the roll, you follow him inside the hut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the hut is partitioned off into a few separate smaller rooms, one of which you are directed into by large man you saw earlier. He wears different clothing from the rest of the people you've seen here so he's obviously somebody of importance. There, the man hands you a white dress not unlike the one the large man you just saw was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to wear this in order to see the Elder,\" he says. \"I'll wait outside so you have some privacy\" and exits the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused at why you'd need to change clothing, you unwrap the dress and examine it. Again, you think to yourself, \"Wow, this dress must be for one big lady!\" before remembering that you're the big lady now, blushing. You slip off your current dress and top and toss it to the side. This is the first chance you've had to really examine your body since you changed, and seeing as you haven't lost your self-consciousness about your image, decide to take advantage of the privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you came to the island you'd hardly ever seen people as big as you are now...much less a little seven year old. Your tummy used to be flat and have just a little bit of fat, but now there's so much it hangs down and you have to pick it up and readjust it when changing your position or changing clothes. Love handles roll off your sides now and even at this age you still feel like your butt is way too big. Your once ample breasts are still there, there much smaller now and oblong in shape. You'd check out your legs but your can't actually see them anymore with your belly in the way. \"At least I fit in at this village,\" you think to yourself, blushing in embarrassment and your massive girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with seeing enough of yourself, you go back to the white dress and try to slip it on. Despite how big you thought it was before it's a really tight fit and you have trouble slipping it over the fat rolls of your body. Eventually though you manage to get to last bit over your belly and squeeze into it. It's practically a skin tight fit and does a particularly good job revealing all the fat rolls and crevices of your body. \"Agh, dammit, it's too small....\" you think to yourself. You look around the room for a few moments trying to see if there's a bigger one but everything in here seems to be the same size. Realizing a futile effort, you sigh and leave with what you've been given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too small! I want a bigger one!\" You pout to the man who's been patiently waiting for your return outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it looks fine on you. Besides, It's a one size dress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? One size only?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It changes it's size depending on the person who wears it to conform to their body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" you say, sighing. \"It shows just how fat I really am. I don't wana be this fat! I'm supposed to be a big girl! A big, slim girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighs, and kneels down to your level again. \"C'mon. You can see the Elder now. She'll help you\". He stands back up and makes his exit through another door, motioning for you to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just you again, and this is your last chance to get outa' here while you still can...</span></div></div>",

Various leafy fauna are situated around the room and the smell of strong incense wafts through the air. There, in the middle of the room, not unlike Jabba the Hutt, lays a truly immense specimen of a woman wearing an elaborate shining robe that more resembles a massive blanket than an article of clothing. Her girth is enormous and she easily dwarfs in size anyone else you've ever seen before. Despite your impressive size, you feel small in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, Richard. So this is Lamita, ehh?\" She bellows out in a large, booming voice. Richard's that guy's name? He never did actually tell you what it was. Wait, Lamita? You've heard that name before somewhere....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is!\" he replies. \"I found her passed out on the side of the path leading to museum. It's a good thing I had a cart with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, ha ha! She's turned out quite nicely! Lamita, did you work yourself too hard? It's a good thing we have Richard and his carts around here. Don't want people actually exercising and losing weight now, eh?! Hahahaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it dawns on you and you remember: The name on the girl's dress was Lamita! They're confusing you with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, but I'm not Lamita!!\" You exclaim. unable to stay silent any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" retorts the Elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...you have it all wrong. My name is Caitlin. I'm 19 years old, I'm not really a little girl. I just found Lamita's dress and it cut me and I became this...this body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh.....\" says the Elder curiously, stroking non-existent facial hair. \"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm only on this island for a contest to win a million dollars. I didn't even want to do it after I got here and that man told me the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" replies the Elder, blunty. She adjusts herself so she can move her head in a little closer. \"Tell me, 'Caitlin'. What was the name written on the dress when you discovered it in the hut back in the mainland?\" What? How did she know all that happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...? How do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the name written on it, 'Caitlin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you say, blushing a little. \"It was Lamita.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite sure of it, you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly notice Richard is standing right beside you holding the dress you took off earlier. You take it from him and examine where you saw the name and age written down, but it's gone. Confused, you try looking around the rest of the skirt but can't find anything written down anywhere. Out of the corner of your eye you can see the Elder's smug grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand...it was written on here! I know it was!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dear I'm afraid nothing was ever [i]really[/i] written on there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the gods, who know your real name, that put it on there for you to discover.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gods...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. Most of the people in this village wore that dress and found their real name on it once upon a time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her and try to say something in response, but are unable to produce a fitting response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gods of this island protect this village and it's inhabitants. They look down on us in our favor and bless us with food and happiness. The bigger we are, the more happy we live our lives, the more content they are with us. Every so often though, they bring us someone new from the rest of the island to join our family and make it even bigger. Gaining weight and becoming a little girl again are not coincidental. You've been chosen my dear Lamita to join us and start a new life, the gods favor you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloored by these revelations,  you again try to produce a fitting response but are at a loss for words.  Eventually you manage to muster out, \"I....I don't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking\", says the Elder. \"And let me just say, you should really choose the stay here! Ha ha! It's a good life. You get to eat all day, you don't have to work, and the gods don't really ask much of you. Yeah, you gotta give up your old life and everyone you used to know is gonna think you're DEAD...and really for all intents and purposes you are...but think about it. You're lucky the gods made you so young. You get a brand new chance at life with the wisdom you already have to live it any way you want. A lot of people would LOVE to have that chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard pokes in and interrupts. \"I should add...\",  he says, clearing his throat. \"You don't have to stay here if you don't want to. The gods will send you back to your home, wherever that may be, should you so desire. You won't actually remember any of this I'm afraid, but you will be back in your old life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lamita...whadda' ya say? A chance for a new life, or back to your dumb old boring one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn deep thought, you think to yourself. A new lease on life...sounds appealing. You've had your fair share of mistake and things you regret. But what about all the people you know? You'll be dead to your family and all your friends, never to see or hear from them again for as long as you still breathe. But, perhaps those people aren't worth caring for. Maybe your don't have your parents anymore? Perhaps you're on bad terms and want nothing to do with them. Take a moment to reflect on your own life situation, dear reader. What choice would you make?</span></div></div>",

It's taken some time to get to this point, but you are certain in your reasoning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Wonderful! Fabulous!!\" cries the Elder.\"Richard! Fetch the cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard wanders off to a side room, presumably to obtain this 'cake'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, you don't have to tell me your reasons why,\" says the Elder. \"Everybody's got a different story. But more importantly, that life is behind you. Today, your new life begins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard reappears holding a plate with a slice of cake on it. It's a pretty standard fare cake with red frosting and sprinkles though it looks absolutely delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...what's the cake for?\" You ask, delighted to see food is involved in this process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you finish the cake, you pact with the gods and this village will be complete.\" says Richard, handing you the plate and a fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on now, eat up.\" encourages the Elder. Excited to get something sugary, you dig in. The cake tastes sweet like nothing you've ever had before. Incredibly moist and rich, you quickly make work of the slice and set the plate down on a nearby table. \"Mmmm....\" you say, enjoying the last piece and you swallow it. Before you can go any further though, you feel a slight tingling on your body, not unlike the way you felt when you first changed. \"Uh oh...?\" you think to yourself. Your body grows a little bit bigger in size this time. You feel your tummy getting a bigger...your clothes are really stretched to their limit now...too much! RIIIIP! The fabric gives way under the size of your expanding girth, revealing an even bigger version of yourself to the elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh,\" you say, blushing beet red. \"I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to rip it!\" You try and cover yourself with the ripped fabric, but the Elder doesn't seem to mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha!! That's just a little bit of divine comedy for you right there, Lamita!! Gain 30 pounds in a jiffy. Hilarious! Every time! Gwa ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\", you say flabbergasted. \"That was supposed to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. The gods love it. Don't worry about bein' naked around here, we're all used to it. You're one of us now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer assurances make you feel a little bit better, tearing the clothing off. You notice now that Richard is suspiciously absent from the room. \"Uhm...where did Richard go?\" You implore the Elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Richard? He's really just the village's spirit guardian. He comes and goes from time to time. Now c'mon, let's get you in some clothing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the coming days you manage to integrate yourself into the community with the other children. Making friends and even going so far as to consider some of the older people your new parents. While initially self-conscious about your weight when you first became your size, the compliments from everyone on how beautiful they think you are quickly changes your perception and you grow to become proud of just how big you've become. The million dollars which initially drew you to the island quickly becomes irrelevant and you soon forget your previous life so completely that you can't even remember what your old name used to be. Over the years you make more friends in the village and become even bigger, but most importantly you live out your days happy and at peace with yourself. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pick up the belt and inspect it.  The leather itself looks like ordinary brown leather and has quite a few notches punched into it.  It looks well worn, with signs of wear and tear occurring from roughly the last third of the belt's holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have been a bit of a fatty.\"  You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a small gold plate that hides the buckle itself from view, kind of like what you see cowboys wear.  The fastening mechanism is just a stud that pops into each hole, and even though on testing it seems pretty sturdy, you still think it can slide loose if you engage in a bit of rough and tumble.  A small tag has <i>\"Warning: may shrink when wet\"</i> printed on it.  All in all, it's a pretty fine belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off you own belt and slip it the new one through the belt loops on your shorts.  You manage to fasten it to the second hole, like you usually do.  It seems a little tight though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a small belt,\" you mumble while gauging how much room is left between your waistband and you.  When you look at the gold plate, you see the number 210 has been engraved on it, the same number as your weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed that earlier.  Must be a sign- this is my lucky number and I intend on keeping it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle to yourself as you undo the belt and set it at the next notch.  A strange sensation passes over you and you see a small light shimmer across the buckle.  The plate now reads 215.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at the belt, you can see your stomach slowly rise up and out to fill the gap.  It's only a small increase, kind of like taking a deep breath in, but when you poke it, you realise that your once rock hard abs are covered with a layer of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck?  This comes off now!\"  You undo the belt again and start to take it off when you accidentally push the stud through a notch two holes further down.  The plate shimmers again and now reads 235.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell no!\"  You cry out in frustration as you see your gut balloon out again.  Your previous size 32\" waist has blown up to a 35.  You prod and poke your new gut and it jiggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck, I've never jiggled before in my whole life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea pops into your head.  Maybe if you can bring it back to the notch it was in before, you'll lose the weight.  You undo the tight belt, careful not to let it hit any other hole.  You suck in your gut as much as you can and begin to pull it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of struggling you manage to hook it back into where you first started.  The plate glows softly and a new number is etched onto it by the light- 210.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah, I knew it would go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour victory is cut short by another tingle that runs through your body.  Instead of shrinking down like you thought you would, you instead feel incredibly bloated.  A faint hissing sound can be heard and your whole torso begins to inflate outward.  It stops fairly quickly, but the damage is noticeable.  Now it looks like a rather fluffy pillow has been shoved down your shirt.  Your underwear feels tighter, and with a few pokes you come to the conclusion that your ass has blown up too.  Feeling around your gut, it appears as if the belt is cinching in your waist, with your belly bulging rather comically above and below the the leather strap.  It really is digging into your bloated form, and it feels like it could pop off any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got get this thing off, or at least under control.  You're tempted to try and unbuckle it yourself, but your balloon belly is obscuring your view.  Is it worth the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that the small tag said something about shrinking when wet.  You know you passed several streams and rivers on the way here, but what if something else goes wrong?  Maybe you should search the tree house for something to help you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You realise that you are pretty thirsty and should probably hydrate yourself while you still have the chance.  Before you open it, you notice something slightly odd.  At the bottom of the can, its says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now with 20% extra to really fill you with get up and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're use to drinks advertising that they've included more volume wise, something in the back of your head starts to nag you.

If your frat brothers could see you now, they'd be laughing their asses off.  Scared of a can?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear something below, and peek out of one of the windows concealed by the tree's branches.  Adam is wandering around below, but it doesn't look like he'll find the ladder.  Just to be sure you pull it up as he approaches.  Taking a closer look at him, it appears as if he's already fallen victim to the one of the island's traps.  He isn't that much bigger, only about 25 pounds of additional gut, but since he started off wearing such a tight shirt, it's noticeable even from this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he's packed some junk into his trunk too.\"  You chuckle to yourself as you see him turn around.  Not that you remember what his butt looked like earlier or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dry scratchy feeling at the back of your throat brings your attention back to the can.  Should you drink it?  After all, if the girls are anything like Adam, you're already in the lead.  Speaking of, maybe you should call out to him and let him be your guinea pig, there are more cans lying around.  But is that really worth the risk of showing him your secret hide away?  Maybe you should try to approach him instead, and keep the treehouse secret?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Opening the pull-tab, you hear it fizz and see blue tinted bubbles foam over the lip and down your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\"  You quickly place your mouth over the opening and suck all the foam into your mouth.  You tip the can can and take a few gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.  Tastes like beer.  Definitely made for college students.\"  You look down at the can and notice that while it tastes like beer, there's a slight hint of something else in the after taste.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething blue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head at the stupid description you just came up with.  Your stomach gurgles and you pat it.  The action forces a deep and loud belch to erupt from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Niiiice!\"  You commend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot a chest over by a standard military cot.  Taking a few more swigs of the drink, you walk over to investigate.  As you bend over to lift up the lid, your stomach grumbles again only this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*phhhhhhhhht*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up again, surprised by your recent bout of gas.  You look at your drink and shake it again, hearing it fizz violently in the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, how carbonated is this stuff?\"  You shrug and quickly finish the can in a few quick chugs.  Another loud and long belch echos around the room.  You look down and notice that you have a severe case of bloating.  Your belly has now rounded out, roughly the same size as the last time you and your buddies went on a beer drinking binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, all that from one can?  It takes about 12 beers for me to blow up this big.\"  You shake your gut, and it gurgles loudly in response.  The pressure inside intensifies and your stomach looks like it inflates some more.  You panic a little before another loud long *buuuuuuuuuuuuuuurp* escapes from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just gas.\"  You tell yourself.  You look at your dome of a belly and jiggle it again.  You can hear something slosh around inside and the pressure builds up again.  After cutting the cheese, you sit down in front of the chest and open it, going through its contents and breaking wind along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you find in the chest are various pieces of clothing.  Ranging in sizes, most are normal, though few would fit you.  One of the things that manages to catch your eye is a mechanic's jump suit- the kind that are blue with snap buttons all down the front.  It looks like it would fit across your broad shoulders, but it looks pretty roomy around the waist.  The strange thing you notice about it is that it has a kind of tie around sash, made out of the same material, around the waist.  There's a small fold that it disappears into at the back.  Thinking that would act like a belt, you pull one end, expecting the other to eventually be dragged through, but you find that it doesn't- the material just keeps on coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird *urp*.\"  The small belch alerts you to the fact that while you're fairly bloated, you're still pretty thirsty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and find another can, and notice that not all of them are the same colour.  Sticking with blue, you pop it open and chug about two thirds of it's contents.  You look down at your gut and see that it's even bigger now- it looks like you managed to swallow a fully inflated basket ball.  You shake it and see it rise a little again, and your gas is back with a vengence.  Putting it off to the carbonation of the drink you return to the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother item you find is an old wrestling uniform.  This one is a little strange as it has a pull tab attached to the seam.  You pull it and you hear a faint hissing sound.  You realise that the uniform is inflating somehow.  It manages to get to  pretty decent size, a few feet across, until it stops.  You press down on it and find that it's pretty firm, and would probably float.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would probably make *uuuurrrrp* for a good life jacket or something.\"  You look around for a valve to release the gas, but can't find any.  Looking at the pull tab, you see something in small print:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fart to release.\"  Figuring that it won't be a problem, you let one off and find that as you do, the suit begins to shrink.  It stops deflating with the end of your fart, so you let another one rip and see that it shrinks with each of your releases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\"  You scrunch you face and push a long fart out, lasting for half a minute.  The suit manages to completely deflate, and you're left a little tired from your efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your second can and crush it.  Throwing it aside, you notice something bright red underneath a few other articles of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Santa Clause outfit?\"  You pull out the iconic red jacket.  You reach down to pick up the pants too quickly and you jostle your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omph.\"  You rub you gut as the pressure increases.  Looking down, you see that your cargo shorts are straining around your bloated waistline.  Maybe you should change into something a bit more roomy until you can fart this out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You turn over and look up.  There, standing over you is Adam.  \"Jeeze, you're huge, what happened?\"  He said trying to hold back a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you grab your gut \"W..Well... I tried this scale, and it turned almost all my muscles into fat... and when I tried to reverse it, it doubled my weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looks like he's thinking \"So they're serious?  This place can make us gain weight?\"  You nod.  Adam looks at you again and helps you up.  \"Then maybe it's best we stick together.  Watch each others backs so we don't end up gigantic, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill worried about your new girth, it seems like a good idea, so you agree.  But what is Adam really thinking?</span></div></div>",

I don't think something that looks like that is safe.  Adam grinned and lifted his shirt a bit, showing his abs.  \"Well, I ate one after we got here, and I'm no different, am I?\"  You're hesitant still.  \"What about getting sick?

You feel so full from one little fruit!  Then, the feeling of fullness turns into a tingle... and it spreads across your whole body.  You groan as you get warmer.

The weight piles on, creeping higher and higher.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lied.  I just wanted to know if this fruit was fattening too.\"  He said poking your gut \"I wonder how big you'll get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waddle back, your thighs expanding, your belly growing heavier, your chest sagging.  Your face has plumped up making you unrecognizeable as the old Ian,  Your underwear shreds and falls away, leaving you naked and obese in front of the young, thin man.  He's grinning as he watches your body get bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so heavy!  It's hard to stay balanced.  You can feel yourself getting out of shape as every individual pound piles on, eventually stopping, leaving you at 530 pounds.  You'll never be able to get back into shape!  You're a huge pig now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam is just staring at you, grinning.  He grabs you by the hand and pulls you along.  You try and fight him, but with your muscles shrunk down and the fat you're hauling, you're too weak to escape his grasp.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting side by side is a row of books, about ten in total, all of them with leather covers.  Not being all that bookish, it doesn't surprise you that all of the titles are unfamiliar.  In fact, a few of them seem purpose-made for the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isla de Obeso Nature Omnibus.\"  You read the title of one aloud.  That could come in handy later on.  You pick it up and flick through the pages, vivid pictures capturing your attention.  You see an entire chapter devoted to berries, some of them looking pretty enticing, but more than half of them leading to some kind of inflation or weight gain.  You see a picture of the tree that's supporting your house, it's called the Boundfat.  Reading on you see that its nuts have a strange property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"When immature, the nuts have a tendency to stimulate and promote the proliferation of fat to a minor degree.  However, once ripe, the active agent in the mature nuts once responsible for weight gain, now promote weight loss through a rather unusual means.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look outside a window and see a branch with what looks like a nut pod.  You walk over and break it off and find that it's easy enough to open.  Inside are three nuts, about the same size as a walnut.  Two of them are a deep brown, but one is lighter like a peanut and smaller than the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll never know without trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to experiment and eat the immature looking one.  Upon swallowing, you feel an odd sensation, particularly around your butt.  You walk over to the scales you saw earlier and jump on.  The display reads 215.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I am a little more pudgy than before.\"  You say as you inspect yourself.  Your six pack has lost a bit of its definition, but not by much, and you barely have any love handles- in fact it just looks like you're wearing shorts that are a little snug around the waist.  Turning around you spy a mirror next to the cot in the room and see that your ass is looking a bit fuller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, onto nut two.\"  You eat one of the deep brown nuts and the same sensation as before runs through you.  You lift your shirt up and see that your six pack has lost all definition now.  Poking it you see that it doesn't feel like fat.  It's more springy to the touch, and almost more firm than fat would be.  You step on the scales again and the display and it now reads 213.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  I put an inch on my waist and I lose 2 pounds?\"  You look across at the mirror and notice that your ass is definitely rounder now.  You pop the second brown nut into your mouth and chew.  After swallowing, and your body tingles like before.  Unlike last time however, you hear a sound like someone rapidly blowing up a balloon and see that your gut is now inflating outward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat looked before like a little belly is now fairly round, you guess about 38 inches, and that's just from your left hip around to your right.  Your ass is huge, each cheek the size of a basket ball.  You peer around your new girth and see that you're back to your original weight of 210.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly walk back around to the book and skim over the page until you find what you're looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The mature nut is capable of such a feat by converting fat into a light weight gas.  At first, this reaction is fairly minimal.  However, further consumption catalyses the reaction in addition to further converting more fat into gas.  Said gas will migrate out of the body in due course as most flatulence would.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it's good to know it isn't permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A word of caution must be advised however.  Excessive consumption of the mature nut can lead to a new reaction, wherein the active agent, upon a lack of fat to convert will begin to act on the gas itself.  This new product is more volumous and has a curious effect on individuals that usually suffer from aggravated flatulence.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're usually proud of the fact that you're quite capable of out belching your fellow frat brothers, you're now beginning to regret it.  The book goes on to say that in usually gassy people, such as yourself, it will stimulate the production of gas in your gut and because of this, it'll take longer to belch and fart your way back down to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like I'm stuck like this for a while.\"  Looks like this wasn't going to be the quick solution you thought it would.  Still, it's pretty useful should anything else on the island try to fatten you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up at the other books, you find that a few more titles grab you attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.  Getting distracted this easily usually means it's time to chow down.  You remember passing some berries on the way here that you saw in the omnibus.  Something about them being \"sweet and light yet filling.\"  They sound like they'd hit the spot.  A loud <b>*braaaaap*</b> from your behind reminds you that in your state, your a bit of an easy target now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there's something lying around the tree house?  Worse comes to worst, there are always more nuts lying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see that the book is set up like one of those 'choose your own adventure' novels, with options at the bottom of each section and directions to other pages.  Never being the type of guy that read these you flip to a random page somewhere in the middle.  You see a picture of yourself, only that it looks like your stomach has swollen to the size of a beach ball.  It looks like you're struggling against some vines or something.  You're grasping onto one with both your hands as it looks like it's forcing its way into your mouth.  Another seems to have manged to worm its way into your pants via your exposed butt crack.  On further inspection you see that the picture of you also has... pitched a rather strong tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>*f-uuuurrrrp*</b></font> is this?\"  You look at text and you spy the word loveweed.  You pick up the Omnibus again and find its entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A curious specimen that derives its name from the behaviour it displays during its reproductive cycle.  The plant lures an animal to its main bed with enticing smells.  Curiously, it chooses to mimic the smell of roasting meat, thereby attracting omniverous and carniverous animals, rather than the typical herbiverous and pollen feeding species one would expect. Once the animal is in close proximity to the main body of the plant, the loveweed releases a pheromone to subdue its target.  Human subjects often report an extreme sense of arousal upon exposure, with some more sensitive to it reporting multiple orgasms during the whole experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell now you know where the love in loveweed comes from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The weed then penetrates the animal through which ever orifices are available, generally preferring the anus and mouth.  After each vine-like appendage meet inside the animal, the plant then pumps a creamy liquid through each of its two vines, the amount of which varies due to the difference in time between each captive.  After the plant has finished, it severs the two appendages involved, which proceed to enter the animal.  These two pieces are not alive in themselves, but merely contract up to meet each other and sit in the liquid it deposited earlier.  The roots quickly dissolve in this medium, and provide nourishment for the various developing seeds found within.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It knocks you <b>*phhhhht*</b> up?\"  You say to yourself as you fart again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The seeds do not germinate in the host however, and eventually work their way through its digestive system.  This provides an excellent mechanism for seed dispersal.  Of particular note is that a plant may impregnate an animal more than once, and that multiple plants may involve themselves with one animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's a ticket onto Jerry Springer if i ever heard one.\"  You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as how the loveweed has a fairly non-descript appearance, it is easily confused with several other plants in its Family.  Classification is further hindered by the fact that loveweed tends to grow in areas that said family members have colonised themselves.  Also, each plant behaves in the same way in attracting and sometimes forcefully capturing an animal, though none use this as a means of germination.  The other related plants include:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirweed: more placid than the loveweed, it waits until an animal stimulates its vines, then proceeds to pump air.  People commonly use the plant as an aid in diving, but quickly find that its continual pumping makes it difficult to stay under water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasweed:  as aggressive as the loveweed, it deposits many small, soft pods in the animal and only stops when it senses that the animal has reached its limit.  As the pods ripen, their liquid begins to bubble and upon bursting, instantly vapourise.  This causes most victims to experience various amounts of bloating and severe gas attacks.  As the pods are at different ages when deposited, the effect tends to continue for quite some time and at sporadic phases.  As the gasweed is capable of depositing hundreds of these pods, victims can become quite inflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaterweed: placid like the airweed, it pumps a water-like substance into the animal.  In the event that another liquid source is nearby, it may transport that via its root system to the captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanillaweed: with a temperament like the waterweed and airweed, it pumps a calorie rich, thick, vanilla-like substance to the victim.  Unlike other weeds, it only enters via the mouth.  The vanilla milk was often used by locals to help the under nourished, as the body is capable of quickly absorbing the nutrients and converting it to fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoamweed: more slender than the otherweeds, this variety does not pump anything into its victims, but rather, severs it appendages once it has invaded or after a given time period once it has been stimulated.  The thin weed then decomposes after while and produces a foam-like substance.  In animals, this foam migrates out of the stomach through to the rest of the body, giving an impression of all over body growth or inflation.  The foam will only decompose into gas with certain agents (see entry Foamweed).  This property, along with the fact that appendages will decompose outside of a host make it an excellent material for padding protection or even floatation devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpongeweed: another weed that does not deposit anything into its victims besides parts of itself.  A thin yet incredibly dense (it cannot be chewed or cut through and once it invades, it will continue to do so until the vine finishes), on its own, spongeweed does nothing.  It is in fact quite beneficial to most healthy animals, quite often fighting off the effects of other toxins and agents.  That it is the most aggressive member of the family may appear odd to some, until it's behaviour with other species is noted.  Spongeweed absorbs any liquids from other weeds (and is capable of recognising liquids passed from waterweed) and quickly swells in size.  The capacity to which it does so has yet to be recorded and some say there is no limit.  It then manufactures a light gas, whose high activity makes it far more volumous than any other gas produced by the island inhabitants.  The buoyancy of this gas even affects the host on land, with   the subject appearing to bounce quite a bit when moving.  This lack of coordination can prove haphazard, as other weeds are sure to be present nearby.  This is particularly troublesome with the gasweed, as spongeweed invades the pods and produces twice as much gas as would normally occur.  The process continues sporadically, although spongeweed's production of the gas tends to relate to how disturbed it is while in the gut.  Victims report an increased sensitisation of skin, a pleasant sensation that results in further agitation and thus inflation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA curious feature of these plants is that none of them seem to be in direct competition with one another, and as with the loveweed, are all more that willing to use the same victim more that once and also after different species.  It has also been noted that some will penetrate at the same time, usually by one of the more aggressive species piggy backing on another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at \"The Adventures of Ian\" you wonder about your future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a choose your own adventure book, so it might not happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking through a few more pages you see yourself in different situations.

You find yourself ducking branches and pushing palm fronds out of th way, when you trip on a root and find yourself tumbling down a hill.  Managing to gain some control, you slide down on your butt and quickly ware a hole into the seat of your shorts.  You stop on a dense patch of tall grass, and flip onto your stomach with a small <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oomph.\"  You can feel that you're not injured or anything, but the draft over your rear end pretty much confirms that you underwear is fairly tattered around that hole in your shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.

Sure enough, it describes your fall and impromptu inflation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear what sounds like a small waterfall, and you wander past a small bush and see that you've arrived and Bubble Falls.  The book has a small description of the area, saying that a variety of weeds grow here, but that airweed is the most common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt goes on to say that the lake fed by the waterfall has airweed growing all along the it's bank and even across it's bed.  You look at the crystal clear lake and see the vines at the bottom, occasionally releasing a small stream of bubbles.  The book goes on to say that this is one of the major sources for airweed and that pieces just <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...break off, float down the stream and grow wherever they land.  That airweed grows in-land is due to both deliberate and unintentional transport by island inhabitants.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the lake and see something shimmer at the bottom.  You check the book and sure enough, it has you stripping down, ready to skinny dip and retrieve a golden bag.  As you take off your clothes, you fart and belch as you bend over and move.  You look down at your bloated form, you can hardly see your feet, and even with a dick as big as yours, it's hidden from sight while flaccid.  You pick up the book again, and read that your recent encounter with airweed has left you too buoyant to reach the bottom of the lake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily (the book's words, not yours) there is a solution.  Growing on a tree by the side of the lake is some waterweed.  As it fills you up with water, most of your gas would be pushed out.  Once pumped, you'd be heavy enough to sink to the bottom, and after grabbing the bag, you could use the airweed on the lake's bed to inflate yourself and float back to the surface.  The only problem is that the tree also has a bit of spongeweed.  As it will take a while before it can absorb anything the waterweed pumps, you should be able to reach the bottom before you inflate.  However, this will leave you even bigger than you are now.  If you're strong enough, you may be able to keep the spongeweed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option is the second type of weed, growing by a bush only a few feet away from the tree.  You can't really see it, but the flowers are white like vanilla.  The fat you gain from it would definitely out-weigh your gas, and you could use the airweed at the bottom to inflate and reach the top again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You feel another shift in your stomach, and hear a loud <b>*glug*</b> sound- like when people empty a water cooler.  You feel weird, and your butt and thighs start to cool down and you realise that water is now being pumped into them as well.  You hear the glugging sound again, and realise that with both ends blocked off, the gas has nowhere to go.  You spit out one vine and push against the tree to try and dislodge the other one from your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pop, you stumble forward, the momentum carrying you to a safe distance from the tree until you fall.  When you land, the water inside of you sloshes around and you feel like you're on a water bed.

You're pretty sure you're heavy enough to sink now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the lake, and just before your head goes under, you take a deep breath.  The lake is fairly deep, and you quickly find the surface of the water getting further and further away.  You manage to bound forward, bouncing like an astronaut on the moon, or a hippo underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Definitely the latter\"</i> you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the bag, you're in desperate need of air.  You jump forward and spread your arms out like you're going to belly flop, and slowly land on the floor.  You grab the bag, but can't see the end of any vines nearby.  Improvising, you bite down on one of the larger vines.  Gas streams out of it at a much quicker rate than anything before- it rushes into you and you can feel yourself inflate immediately.  You begin to rise to the surface as you bloat out in all directions, gas rapidly turning you into a sphere.  Close to the top, the airweed snags and pops out of your mouth, but you've filled up enough that to continue to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit air again and bob along the surface of the lake.  The waterfall gently pushes you to the bank, a blessing as you can't swim in your current state.  On land, you literally drag your butt as you shuffle toward your clothes and the book.  As spherical as you are, you can't reach anything, so you drop the bag next to your shoes.  You're still pretty heavy from the water you drank, so all that effort has left you drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWet and panting heavily, you're stuck for ideas on what to do, when a familiar urge strikes you.  You shuffle a few feet away from your gear, not wanting to accidentally piss on anything.  As you urinate, you find yourself blasting out some huge farts and even a couple of deep belches.  After about 20 minutes of constant peeing and flatulence, you've manged to regain the use of your legs.  In another 10, the golden stream stops and you've managed to de-bloat yourself down to your earlier size, before to entered the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to your gear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Julia is looking a little worse for ware; she was looking fairly large to begin with and that the extra weight has just deposited itself on her ass.  Adam on the other hand looked pretty normal, so the 30 pound belly he's now sporting is a pretty obvious change.  The text continues:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The natives found that after one use, the talisman would no longer work for the user, but instead the victim.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I have to hide this thing.\"  Turning around, you decide that the best place for it is back at the bottom of the lake.  After all, who would know what it is without your book?  You toss it and turn back to your clothes, not noticing that the talisman isn't actually sinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've managed to dry off so you put your underwear and shorts back on.  As you're sitting down, your bloated belly presents too much of an effort to try and button your short's waist, so you move onto your socks.  You put one foot into your shoes and find that you crunch something.  You smack the sides of your sneakers and see that bits of airweed fall onto the grass and in your lap.  Cleaning them out, then brushing yourself off, you see that the weed has gotten everywhere.  You stand up with your shirt bunched in your hand and feel a belch rising.  You let it out as you put your shirt on and you accidentally fling pieces of airweed down your mouth.  You cough a little and spit out as much as you can, but you know you've swallowed a few bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, gro<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>*oss*</b></font>.\"  You belch out.  You button up your shorts with a bit of difficulty.  You see a rather large stream of gas bubbles rise to the surface of the lake, and you feel a little bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sympathy gas.\"  You say out loud, trying to convince yourself nothing is wrong.  You pat your stomach and let out a large fart.  Unlike other times, you don't feel any less bloated.  You look at the book and read about swallowing the airweed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As airweed can survive in a variety of habitats, it causes you concern as it is just as adept at growing in your stomach as at the bottom of a pond.

Regardless you drink up whatever substance it is that Chloe shares with you and sure enough you can feel a new surge of strength returning to your legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette slides down and off your massive form just before you lift yourself up your added girth increasing your height just a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" Chloe comments with a quick clap, \"now follow me and I'll lead you right on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the door?\" you ask as you attempt to adjust to your new weight and the fact that must you now lug around nearly two tons of weight around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know an alternate route. The fact that you ate so many of the brownies meant I could assist you and lead you down a different path.\" Chloe explained as she led you onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..thanks. Ugh...\" Walking around with as much weight as you had was definitely going to take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I can't rid you of all that weight.\" The much smaller brunette could tell you were struggling yet you still smile at her. Even if it was for a little while it was nice to have some company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright I'll get used to it somehow and at least you're leading me out of here. That and I'm probably too fat to fall down any more pits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you share a laugh as Chloe continues to lead you on the two of you conversing as you head toward the exit she knows of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time you can at last see daylight and finally alongside Chloe you stomp your way out of the underground. You thank her for the assist and she nods with a smile. It appears she about to turn away perhaps needed elsewhere but just before she goes what do you do?</span></div></div>",
