It's a large city, featuring a booming economy, with some of the largest tech companies in the world in both Blackridge Inc. and Pauntech. The city is surrounded by rural farmland and a giant swamp to the South, Citiville to the West, a large Ocean to the East, and an expansive evergreen forest to the north. Despite being one of the fastest growing and most proserpous cities on planet earth, it's also one of the most unsafe, due to a large population of Super Villains constantly attempting to do the city and its residents harm. The good news is, with Super Villains come Super Heroes, and Metropolis has two of the best in Birdboy and Catgirl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you knew all that already. What you're here to do is to peak into the lives of the citizens of Metropolis, and to see how they go about their day, and, more importantly, how they deal with all of the Villains running around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough with the formal intro, though! Let's get started! </span></div></div>",

With it being the largest bank, it tends to get robbed, a lot. Some days, just by some masked thugs, but on other days, unfortunately, a villain and their crew will show up and decided to help themselves to the drawers and the safes, in order to fund their evil schemes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, Kelly was running twenty minutes late to work, due to traffic, which in turn was due to the road work that was being done, in order to fix the massive crater that lay in the middle of fifth street, after Catgirl and Braun Beatdown were doing battle last night. Kelly ran to her window and opened it, hoping her boss hadn't noticed her late punch in just yet. Kelly sat down and started to straighten her drawer up, when suddenly, Kelly's arm knocked over her coffee, spilling it all over her blouse. Kelly sighed, frustrated with how the day was going so far. Kelly ran off to the restroom to attempt to clean herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly wasn't in the restroom for a full minute before the sound of a shotgun going off, and a voice yelling \"Everyone on the ground, this is a stick up!\" could be heard from the lobby. Kelly thought quickly and decided to hide in one of the bathroom stalls, sitting on the toilet and tucking her knees to her chest, in order to hide the fact that she was sitting in the stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly tried to keep quiet and pull out her phone to call the police.

Kelly made note to herself that it was probably time to move away from Metropolis, and get away from all of these horrible villains that plagued the city. She silently tried to calculate her own savings, to see if she had enough to pay for moving expenses and and a new apartment somewhere else. Kelly's thoughts were interrupted as the door to the bathroom burst open, and several pairs of feet marched into the room, along with a woman screaming and crying. Kelly recognized the woman making the commotion as her coworker, Samantha. Samantha's teller window was right next to Kelly's, and the two frequently talked during work- not enough to call each other friends, but enough that Kelly had grown fond of Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't do this!\" Samantha screamed, as she was drug further into the bathroom. Kelly clasped a hand over her mouth and nose, trying to suppress her own breathing. Whoever had been dragging Samantha spoke, and Kelly was surprised to not recognize the voice. She thought she'd gotten to know most of the Villains in Metropolis pretty well from the frequent hiests, but this one was brand new to her. The voice tucked away just a bit of a Louisiana southern drawl, while somehow being haunting enough to send a chill down Kelly's spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you, Samantha. If you didn't open the vault, I was going to shit in your mouth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly held her breath and closed her eyes tightly shut, knowing that her coworker was about to experience the hell these Villains could cause first hand. Outside of the stall, Abigail and two of her servant girls held Samantha captive. The two servants held Samantha's arms as Abigail hiked up her dress, revealing her gigantic, pale, sweaty ass. Samantha screamed in horror once more, before Abigail plopped down on her face and unleashed a torrent of diarrhea down onto Samantha, not only getting it into her mouth, but blanketing Samantha's face in hot, liquid shit. Eventually Abigail got off and fixed her dress, before ordering the girls up as well. They left Samantha lying in a puddle of Abigail's shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find another teller.\" Abigail barked at her girls. \"One of them will open the vault. Especially after they see what we've done to their coworkers...\" Abigail and her girls marched out of the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was confused. Why did this woman seem so hell bent on getting into the vault? Doing that would take time, wasn't she afraid Birdboy and Catgirl would show up? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had to do something...</span></div></div>",

In the few years she had been working for the bank, she picked up a few ques as to what type of robbery she was dealing with. Whenever their phones were rendered useless, it was usually the result of some high tech device made to stifle communications with police. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A shudder went through her body as she realized that she was dealing with a super villain of some sort. With no one to call, all she could do was huddle on top of the toilet and pray that Birdboy or Catgirl would come to save them all in time. She took in deep breaths as she heard the chaos unfolding outside the restroom. She could vaguely make out the sounds of someone's voice barking orders to the tellers, though she couldn't quite make out who it was from where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough, everything went quiet. For a moment Kelly thought that she was in the clear, though she wasn't willing to go out and check. She had no idea whether or not they were still out there, plus she still didn't know which villain was pulling the heist. If she were lucky, it would be someone like The Cougar, who only focused her attention on young men. On the other hand, she could poke her head out the door and find herself bound and gagged at the feet of Footgirl. No amount of submission or compliance would ensure her safety in that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she weighed her options, a sudden noise caused her to freeze in place. She slowly pressed her ear to the door and held back a gasp as she could hear the sounds of footsteps approaching the restroom. She prayed that whomever it was would just pass her by, and her heart sank as soon as she heard the door creak open. She held her breath, both to keep from making any noises and because of the pungent odor that seemed to follow whomever it was that had just entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A lump formed in Kelly's throat as she could see a shadow just underneath her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>'Please don't find me... please, </i>please <i>don't find me...'</i>, she silently plead as nervous tears streamed down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alas, it was not to be. The door shot open and to her horror, she found herself staring at the barrel of a shotgun. The man before her was decked out in elaborate, face concealing armor. On the chest was an insignia, indicating that he was under the employ of...</span></div></div>",

Normally she would just attach her self to the most powerful person in the prison for protection but in here that changed on a weekly bases. Worst the guards where no use at all unless you where trying to escape they didn\u2019t care what you did or what happened to the other inmates. Fortunately she had a cell to her self for the first week though she was told if any more prisons came about she would have to share. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly morning came and the cell doors all opened at once, she rushed out not wanting to be slow to the mess hall or one of the more disgusting villains may get there first. Fortunately the prison was still 90% normal prisoners but that didn\u2019t make them any less dangerous. Wendy was still deciding if it was better to act tough or meek to get by them. The super villains however they where a huge problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOften they would have fights, take a prisoner for their own personal use. Sometimes they just got bored and decided the rest of the prisoners would make good sport. The guards did nothing to prevent this. After a day Wendy understood why as she walked past two guards mindlessly licking Footgirls feet in the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting her food she sat down purposely at a crowded table with the queen of misfits Veronica Other. Veronica had a little gang of punk rock teenagers but the safety came in there where many of them so none knew if Wendy was all ready a member and in a moment she could just slip away. The punk queen\u2019s table smelt awful of body odour but Wendy learned fast that a bad smell was the least of her problems here. Once sat she got out her little notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to start writing a survival guide for herself to get around the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExceptional dangerous subject 1: <br>\r\nFootgirl: real name yet to be determined.<br>\r\nSpends most of her time in the basement of the prison tinkering with technology. Have not had the courage to spy on her down there.<br>\r\nPreferences: Appears to prefer to torment men lucky for me. When bored she has them devout themselves to her feet.<br>\r\nAllies: None that I can tell.<br>\r\nEnemies: really seems to hate MegaButt.<br>\r\nIf confronted: Try talking about science? <br>\r\nIf hostile: Don\u2019t run she seems fast on her little feet, try flattering her poor hygiene.<br>\r\nComments: Little contact so far, lets keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer notebook was snatched up. Wendy looked to see Veronica the queen of misfits her self reading over her writing. Bringing her body odour with her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA survival guide I\u2019m making for myself.\u201d Wendy always believed the truth would set her free.<br>\r\n\u201cJust one page?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve only started today\u201d and she wasn\u2019t dumb enough to write about Veronica right next to her. Wendy\u2019s eyes where starting to water from the body odour but she kept her calm face.<br>\r\n\u201cNeat idea, what\u2019s your name again?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWendy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell Wendy,\u201d She sniffed next to Wendy\u2019s armpit. \u201cAre you wearing deodorant?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cErm yes Ma\u2019am\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck! You don\u2019t need deodorant to live that's just something the state wants you to think freedom smells like this\u201d She presented her armpit to Wendy.<br>\r\nWendy sighed, she knew this was bound to happen when you hide amongst these people. She closed her eyes moved her nose next to the reeking armpit and breathed in loud enough for Veronica to hear.<br>\r\nVeronica grabbed Wendy\u2019s red hair with her free hand and jammed her head right into the armpit. The stench was awful an unwashed sweaty pit but at least it wasn\u2019t one of the big villains pit\u2019s.<br>\r\nAfter an entire minute she was finally released. Her face had sweat dripping down it, she was sure her entire face stank of BO now.<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the smell of independence. Don\u2019t forget it.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cThank you Ma\u2019am\u201d Wendy said keeping her face unemotional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast she avoided the exercise yard where Havoc had corned some unlucky prisoners. She was going to go to the library but the Duchess was making rounds there with her twins. Going to the showers she saw Sluggette messing with the pipes, the sight of her made Wendy\u2019s blood boil. So Wendy just went back to her cell. This was dangerous as well yesterday Skunketee would jump into random open cells and spray the poor inmate lying there. You just had to take the chance today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvening came and as your door was supposed to close to guards approached with a very short prisoner. \u201cYour cell mate\u201d They said than eagerly left. The very short person walked in. Wendy gasped as she saw them, how could a mere child be sentenced to maximum security the poor thing must be so scared.<br>\r\n\u201cHello I\u2019m Wendy are you okay.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d She shrugged.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know the people in this city just don\u2019t understand quality television.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWha-\u201d She gasped at once recognising the child like person. \u201cOh no\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m Sue but most people know me as The Brat.\u201d She smiled wickedly at you. \u201cNow cell mate, some ground rules when I\u2019m around you do not walk, you stay on your hands and knees.

Look me in the eye and say that.\u201d<br>\r\nShe bent down to get on eye level but as soon as her mouth opened she lost her thoughts. Those eyes where so perfect, the wonderful blue circles. The way they swirled around like hypno discs. <br>\r\n\u201cYou want to sleep on the floor tonight.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd she did the bed wasn\u2019t for her but the floor that was so much more appealing. So much space to lie down on a nice hard surface to be secure against.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d she said leaving her mouth open a little drool came down.<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d<br>\r\nWendy silently agreed. Talking was silly it would only get her into trouble. <br>\r\n\u201cYou want to change my wet nappy and wear the dirty one.\u201d<br>\r\nShe was starting to feel rather exposed in just her prison outfit an extra layer would be more comfortable. At once she changed the Brat\u2019s wet diaper. The Brat laid down allowing Wendy to gently undo the elastic straps. Applying a new one to her, she carefully taped it up under her tummy. Wendy than lowered her pants and attached the old used diaper to herself. It made a crinkly noise when she moved and she could feel the wetness spread across her crotch but it felt right to wear it. Pulling her pants back up she finally felt secure.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t reach the bed, be my footstool.\u201d<br>\r\nWendy understood because the Brat was so short it was only good manners to kneel down and let her step on her back to reach the bed. Wendy just waited in that position in case her new cell mate needed to get down.<br>\r\n\u201cBed time, suck your thumb and go to sleep.\u201d The Brat called from above. Wendy felt a sudden emptiness in her mouth, laying down she slowly moved her thumb to her mouth. She found it rather comforting to have her thumb in her mouth, slowly suckling upon it she drifted to sleep at peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate in the night Wendy realised she was on the cold floor. Her mind raced to what happened, first she disgustedly removed her thumb, it was slobbered with saliva. She than slowly noticed a very itchy and uncomfortable feeling from her never regions. She groaned as she remembered the used diaper now tied to her waist. She was going to spend a lot of time in the shower in the morning. <br>\r\nSighing She got out her guide and began writing under the moon light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExceptional dangerous subject 2: <br>\r\nThe Brat: Sue unknown last name.<br>\r\nMy new cell mate, will have frequent contact with. Has already dominated me. Seems to posses some kind of mind control powers, how is still unknown.<br>\r\nPreferences: enjoys making me act like a child and wear her used diaper.

It was difficult with the filthy diaper attached to her rustling with every turn but she once again fell asleep.<br>\r\nShe awoke to someone poking her. Looking up Wendy saw the child like villain, \u201cchange me,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you change yourself?\u201d Wendy said bitterly still waking her self up. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to, I have you. Now change me!\u201d<br>\r\nConsidering the consequences Wendy complied and once again had the Brat on the floor taking a wet nappy away and replacing it with a fresh clean one. <br>\r\nWendy than went to change her own well used wet diaper. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think your doing?\u201d Brat said watching her from the floor.<br>\r\n\u201cEr changing my diaper, Miss?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKeep it on.\u201d She said disinterested like she didn\u2019t really care.<br>\r\n\u201cBu- can\u2019t I-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor getting mouthy with me this morning.

She generally clothes herself in dark formal attire for her campaign events and rallies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rise to political power began shortly after the dastardly Havoc launched a plan to destroy the city with the force of her BO alone, an attempt the Metropolis PD were helpless to stop. Only the intervention of Birdboy and Catgirl subdued her in time. This was followed shortly by the villainess FootGirl nearly coating the entire city in her toejam, covering an entire district before being stopped once again by Birdboy and Catgirl. It was clear to everyone at that point, that serious changes needed to be made in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Maria launched her political career, calling for an end to the cities dependence on Birdboy and Catgirl to save the day, advocating changes to the local Police Department that would make them better equipped to face the stinky villains of Metropolis. She also called for the construction of new, advanced prisons capable of holding even the smelliest of them without fear of frequent breakouts. Her ideas caught on, putting her neck and neck in the run against the longstanding mayor of Metropolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this success came at a price, with her central issue being crime, she'd be bound to draw some unsavory attention.

She'd spread word all throughout the city that she'd be holding one in Metropolis city park, and sure enough, by the time she arrived, it'd already been filled to capacity. Maria joined her staff backstage where everyone was preparing for her big speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss Anderson, glad you could make it.\" John Ross, her chief of staff, approached and held out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria returned the smile as she shook his hand. \"I wouldn't miss it for the world. We seem to have gathered quite the crowd, think it'll be enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn laughed cheerfully. \"Certainly, our opponent can barely scrounge up a crowd half this size. If we keep up at this rate, claiming victory will be easy.\" He heard the crowd cheer again and smiled. \"Now, I'd better get started on your introduction, good luck with your speech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stepped aside to let him pass, hearing a loud cheer go up from the crowd as he walked on stage. She took a deep breath and straightened her collar. One had to look the part to run for mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Miss Anderson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's gaze turned to a young woman stumbling towards her, an intern, if she remembered correctly. \"Can I help you Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia,\" the intern answered, brushing a few loose strands of her red hair aside. \"I'm an intern, just signed on, and I need to tell you, I really don't think you should go through with this rally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria scoffed. \"You want me to cancel my speech, after I've already arrived?\" She shook her head and started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, wait!\" Amelia ran in front of her and held up her hand. \"What if one of the villains shows up? I don't think you have enough security here to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine,\" Maria insisted, pushing past her and stepping out onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia bit her lip as she watched her go, praying her hunch wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria walked out to the applause of the crowd, stopping to shake John's hand before approaching the podium. \"Good people of Metropolis! Our city has long since suffered under the thumb of dastardly villains, who've terrorized this fair city with the power of their stink alone.\" She began in a solemn tone to invoke the right mood. \"The Metropolis Police Department has been overwhelmed and under equipped to handle these new and ever multiplying threats. It is only through the efforts of Birdboy and Catgirl that this city hasn't already fallen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd murmured their agreements. There seemed to some sort of confusion near the entrance, but it wasn't large enough to disrupt anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that will all soon change,\" Maria continued. Her tone rising to inspire confidence and courage. \"When I'm elected, I will bring about the changes this city needs to overcome these threats! Soon our Police Department will no longer be helpless in the face of these villains, and once they're captured, they'll remained locked away for good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar or victory from the crowd quickly faded into mumbles of confusion as all heads turned towards the park entrance. Where someone was pushing their way to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria furrowed her eyebrows. Who could possibly be disturbing her rally?</span></div></div>",

Her and her all girl gang where considered an annoyance and nuisance to the new clean city. <br>\r\nThe crowd parted covering their noses from her reeking body odour, she marched straight ahead making a beeline for Maria. Maria stood her ground against this unwanted intrusion not even twitching as the malodorous biker stood just before her stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust what the fuck do you think your doing!\u201d Alysa shouted to her crossing her arms in front of her.<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me, I have not had the pleasure of making your acquaintance.\u201d Maria said keeping calm in the face of this aggressor with her finger subtly on her silent alarm.<br>\r\n\u201cCan it you prim and proper bitch. I just heard about this \u2018remodelling\u2019 5th street. Thats my fucking turf! You don\u2019t fuck with my turf, turn it in to some kind of 50s housewife bakery.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think you will find the remodelling of outdated and under repaired areas will have an exceptional increase in living standards.\u201d<br>\r\nMaria kept Alysa attention towards her allowing some of her bodyguards to move in closer. <br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m not having any of that you soap smelling prudes touch my street.\u201d<br>\r\nAs the first security guard went to grab her arm she easily dodged him, in one quick motion she had him under her stinking pits and unconscious. The second guard leaped into action only for Alysa to turn towards him and unleash a horrendous burp into his face. The poor man became a sputtering wreck as he fell to the floor gasping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria pressed the silent alarm on her suit. <i>Keep her talking keep her away from the crowd.</i><br>\r\n\u201cStop this at once! If you want attention than you have it but don\u2019t think I will stand by and let you terrorize the people of this great city.\u201d<br>\r\nThe people in the audience panicked all trying to escape. \u201cWhere do you think your fan clubs goin?\u201d Sneered Alysa. <br>\r\nA lot of different rumbling sounds where coming from outside. <i>Oh no,</i> Maria knew that sound. <br>\r\nDozens of motorcycles crashed stormed into the park. <br>\r\n\u201cSo this is how its going to go.\u201d Alysa said walking up the stage to Maria. \u201cYou are going to tell this crowd that your pulling out the election, than your going to crawl over here and kiss my butt.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbsurd.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t my gangs going to go nuts on this crowd hmm starting with that one.\u201d She said pointing to Amelia, her newest intern, who had just been caught between two bikers. The bikers where laughing at her tying a rope around her waist.<br>\r\n<i>Get used to this, these villains won\u2019t stop when you are mayor just keep calm and deal with them.</i> Maria thought to herself. </span></div></div>",

She remained standing in a poised manner. \"Aggravating me now will only make things worse for you in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysa scoffed. \"Yeah, and messing with us will make things worse in the now.\" She nodded at Samantha who promptly stuffed Amelia's face in her pit, causing the intern to let out a high pitched squeal as she struggled to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria winced on her behalf. Whatever college credit she was getting from this, definitely wasn't worth it. She made a show of scoffing and turning away. \"Oh, enough! Actions like this are precisely why I decided to run in the first place! Do you think proving my point will make me drop out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysa grinned in a devious fashion. \"Oh, you telling me you don't care about your little friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stiffened at her words. \"Of course I care,\" she said indignantly. \"I care about protecting her, and the rest of this city. It's why I'm running, and why I won't let myself be bullied into submission by a group of has been criminals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysa's eyes widened. \"Has been criminals!?\" Her surprise faded into rage. \"You're going to regret saying that you prissy bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria bit her tongue. Perhaps she could be a little <i>too</i> brave sometimes. She drummed her fingers against the podium, praying that the police arrived soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give them a taste of your stink girls!\" Alysa called over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once the Fifth street filth gang ran amok in the crowd, grabbing whoever they could. Stuffing people into their pits or sitting and farting on them with their butts. Others were rendered unconscious from loud belches, which was probably a blessing considering how the air itself was starting to grow thick with stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria watched the scene unfold from the stage.

Where she promptly released a barrage of gas on the helpless girl. Who could only scream and flail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took a couple steps toward them before she stopped herself. <i>\"There's nothing I can do now, I'm no fighter!\"</i> She chewed on her lip anxiously. Promising to make it up to the poor girl later. She glanced at the crowd, who seemed equally horrified by the turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drop out!\" a panicked citizen yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't give in!\" another cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was any consolation, the crowd seemed as divided on what to do as she was. Maria turned back to Alysa. \"Stop this at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysa snorted. \"Yeah, or what?\" She stalked toward her. \"You can't win the election while sniffing the exhaust of my motorcycle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh crap.\"</i></span></div></div>",

The large biker Amber was driving around a supersized motorbike spraying crowds in a green gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria however was focused on the biker approaching her, Alysa was practically licking her lips in anticipation. She backed up to her podium as the stench of body odour came close with Alysa rising up the steps taking her time to reach the poor mayor candidate.  <br>\r\nHer head was buzzing with sounds, high pitched loud sounds. <i>Sirens</i>? More and more came making Alysa stop and look at the nearby road. Sure enough several police cars sped towards the park. <br>\r\n<i>Oh thank god.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolice cars quickly stopped setting up a barricade by the park. Officers flooded out guns drawn at the biker gals in the park. The bikers stopped having their fun as the police got their attention.<br>\r\nAlysa whistled and her biker gals each took up their own human shield. Maria was quickly dragged into Alysa reeking body as she was held by the gross leader against her will. <br>\r\n\u201cCall them off or I\u2019m ganna make you suffer.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust stop,\u201d Maria said between strained gasps. \u201cLet the people go\u201d gasp \u201cand we can solve this dispute.\u201d Gasp \u201cBetween us.\u201d Maria felt that bargaining might win over this woman, she could after all pull strings to lighten her sentence. <br>\r\nOne of the officers was on a megaphone as his forces spread out to cover the area. \u201cAttention everyone, this is the MPD we have area secured. Release your captives at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<i>Oh shes not going to take threats well.</i><br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck that noise.\u201d She put her phone to her ear, causing her armpit to be exposed releasing its horrendous odour onto Maria. \u201cSally fuck em up. We need an exit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike I would keep my gals in one place.\u201d She said smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore engines where coming from beyond the streets. Maria looked on in worry as dozen more bikers came behind the police cruisers. More chaos followed. Some police fired rubber bullets off into the gang making them crash but far more made it to their line and attacked them. <br>\r\n\u201cLets go gals!\u201d<br>\r\nThe bikers in the crowd got on their bikes some carrying hostages with them, Maria noticed Amelia was among them. \u201cLeave them alone!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry your joining them, your coming with me.\u201d<br>\r\nThe muscled biker easily man handled the smaller Maria towards her bike. Rubber bullets went in every direction some bikers got hit hard enough to keep them down but most where un touched as they ran amok around. Alysa snapped a handcuff over one of Maria hands and the other cuff to her bike. \u201cMight want to hold on tight sweet cheeks.\u201d She taunted. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay girls where breaking their line and going back home.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis is insane! You have to understand this can\u2019t end well for you! They know where you live they won\u2019t give up. Stop now I can help you. I can help everyone in this city you just have to let me.\u201d<br>\r\n<i>She must be able to see that!</i><br>\r\n\u201cNice, very nice ready to go?\u201d She said getting on her bike as Maria was still left standing attached to it. </span></div></div>",

All the while rubber bullets flew in every direction. Though none of the cops fired at any of the bikes with hostages on them. <i>\"This isn't good!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysa leaned forward and chuckled. \"Alright girls, let's burn rubber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gritted her teeth. <i>\"Oh God, this better not be another villain.\"</i> She grimaced at the thought of another interrupting. Especially one of the stronger ones like Goth Goddess or FootGirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smoke bomb fell and enveloped the area in smoke. A silhouette sprang into the fray and started taking bikers down left and right. Until only Alysa and Samantha remained. When the smoke cleared none other than the heroine Catgirl stood in their path. She struck a heroic pose. \"Sorry.\" She lightly tapped the nearest bike with her foot, causing  a domino effect that knocked all the bikes down. \"But it looks like you just burned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria tried not to cringe at the awful one-liner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Alysa drove straight at her. Holding her arm out to catch and stuff the heroine into her sweaty armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl ducked underneath her arm and grabbed onto Maria, swinging herself onto the back of the motorcycle. \"Mind if I hitch I ride?\" She wrapped one arm around Maria to keep herself from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Maria answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysa blinked. \"What the, hey! Get off my ride!\" She swerved violently to the left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl maintained her balance as she produced a small gadget from her belt. \"Hang on!\" She slipped it into Maria's handcuffs and twisted it once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria felt the cuffs fall off her wrists at once. She smiled in relief. \"You did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysa frowned. \"You want out, fine, have a nice fall!\" She raised her butt to eye level with them and farted straight into their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria barely took a whiff before being overwhelmed. <i>\"Oh God!\"</i> It had to be the worst thing she'd ever smelled. She leaned back into the heroine as dizziness overtook her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl tightened her grip. \"I got you!\" She pulled out her grappling hook and shot backward, hooking onto a low hanging tree branch. Allowing them both to swing off the back of Alysa's motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Catgirl both rolled to a stop beneath the tree. Maria sat up. \"Ugh, not the most, graceful of landings. Especially not a cat.\" She rubbed her head. Watching at the cycles came around for another run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl shrugged. \"It's either that or staying on the cycle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, I'll take it.\" Maria glanced at her. \"By the way, how did you handle that horrible stench so well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl scratched the back of her head and laughed. \"You could say I've, built up an immunity over time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha drove straight at them from the right. \"I'm taking you down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria found herself pushed out of the way by Catgirl, where she fell on her butt. <i>\"Not the most graceful of heroines in general, actually.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl dodged Samantha's attack and repeated the same motion as before. Grabbing onto Amelia and swinging herself onto the back of the motorcycle. Freeing the terrified intern before grappling to safety. She landed near the same tree. \"Here you go miss.\" She set Amelia down next to Maria. \"Stay here until it's safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia could do little beyond nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl took a deep breath before leaping back into the fray. The police joining in now that the hostages were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria glanced at her intern. Trying to think of something to say. \"I, guess you were right.\" She watched Catgirl tackle Samantha off her bike and start grappling with her. Wincing sympathetically as the heroine's face was stuffed in the gangsters armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia stared at her blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatgirl broke free and wrestled Samantha onto the ground where she cuffed her. Taking the opportunity to let out another (no doubt cringe-worthy) one-liner. Before she turned her attention to helping the cops take down Alysa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the villains, I mean,\" Maria blurted out. She cleared her throat. \"I should've listened. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia hugged herself. \"It's fine, I mean, I doubt you would've gone up there if you thought anything like this would happen. What I'm trying to say is, forget about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh!\" Alysa fell off her bike, onto her back. Catgirl landed on top of her. One heroic quip later and the gang leader was also in cuffs. The weary crowd together with the police cheered and applauded. Within minutes reporters flooded the area to hound Catgirl with cameras and microphones. Asking question upon question, only some of which were related to the topic at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria rose and dusted herself off. Relieved that the whole ordeal ended without her or anyone else being dragged off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Anderson!\" a series of reporters swarmed over to her. \"What do you have to say about today's incident!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was your security under prepared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still plan to renovate Fifth Street?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Maria trailed off at all the questions. Usually she was pretty good at handling the media. But being farted on, manhandled and nearly kidnapped by a gang leader made her feel a little disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, everyone!\" John Ross stepped between her and the reporters. \"Miss Anderson's had a long day, she'll answer all questions at tomorrow's press conference!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria sighed in relief. Now all that remained was to see what the rest of the day held, or the next day at that. Something told her it was going to be a long campaign...</span></div></div>",

Sitting in her pyjamas and a bath robe she lazily watched the news. Naturally it was covering the attack on her, Catgirl was receiving heaps of praise and the police where being condemned for their lack of control. Than came the over opinionated nosey journalists \u2018speculating\u2019 if this would spell and end to Maria\u2019s campaign for mayor. <br>\r\nShe listened for some time at the news casters. \u201cA sever lack of discipline has allowed these villains to run amok with no regard for the law abiding citizens of our city.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYet what can Miss Anderson hope to accomplish? She proved quite unable to defuse the attack today.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact you could say she was sat on her behind,\u201d Maria glared at the telvision. \u201cwhile the true hero of the city acted. Is this what we can expect from our candidate? Someone who is hapy to sit back and let others suffer to pull her out of her own messes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe television started showing shots of her falling on her butt, being dragged around by that gross biker Alysa. Clearly the media enjoyed the idea of her being humiliated than showing her speech earlier. Regardless her approval ratting was up. People in the crowd returned to their families to tell how the city needed better police.<br>\r\nPolls where showing a dissatisfaction with the current mayors cuts to law enforcement. Something Maria could pounce on in the upcoming debate. Honestly this attack was a blessing, if some low life\u2019s like the fifth street would dare attack citizens in broad daylight, well it only showed how far the city had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia had been given the week of, she hoped she would come back but understood if today\u2019s event had been too much for her. Her assistant John was preparing her best responses for her debate.  So she had nothing to worry about for the evening just a chance to put her feet up and relax. <br>\r\nIt had been several hours since her little ordeal but she felt more ready than ever to take on the city and drag it into the modern age. Picking through her campagin folder she looked through her renovation, anti corruption log, her new budgets. Strangely she felt like parts of it where missing. Maybe John took some with him and forgot to tell me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to her kitchen counter for a hot cup of coffee she noticed an odd smell in the air. It wasn\u2019t there when she came in this afternoon. It was a stale odd smell. Turning on the ventilation she hopped it would remove it before the morning.<br>\r\nGoing by the front door she froze. The lock was undone, she always locked her door after coming in. She immediately went up to it and re applied the lock only for her hand to touch something sticky on the lock. She rushed over to the bathroom and used her multiple soaps to try to clean her hand of the sticky gunk on her. <i>Someone\u2019s been in my home!</i> They must of come in when she was in the shower but who? She rushed into her bedroom closing the door behind her, she grabbed her phone and called the police. </span></div></div>",

Maybe if they were a simple burglar they'd let her leave. <i>\"But then again, what kind of burglar leaves gunk like that attached to my door. And why would they steal my campaign files? I really hope it's not another villain.\"</i> There weren't many villains that liked to act subtle. Most were loud and upfront about who they were and what they wanted. Which made her fear which one it might be.</span></div></div>",

Somehow, she didn't think a bottle of perfume would be quite enough to defend herself against the city's smelliest super villains... suddenly, her eyes happened upon something out of place. \"911, what's your emergency?\" the operator's voice ringed in her ear. But the sight of the tape recorder, resting patiently on her bed, overwhelmed Maria's instinct to reply. She felt almost hypnotized by the object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"911, can you hear me?\" Maria hung up. Whoever left the tape was miles away, by now. There was really only one thing to do: listen what they had to say. She took a deep breath, and hit play. A sultry woman's voice pierced the silence of her bedroom. \"Good evening, Miss Anderson. I've been following your campaign... very closely, indeed. I hope you don't mind me taking some notes from your campaign folder - Amelia here hasn't done a very good job of explaining your policy.\" Maria's heart sank as muffled cries turned into desperate gasps. \"Miss Anderson!

She'd already put hundreds of lives at stake earlier that day - she was not about to let anyone else get hurt. She was going to get dressed, and she was going to meet whoever sent her that dreadful message!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had listened to countless interviews and interrogations with the city's most dangerous super villains while doing her research.

Maria had called for the construction of a fully-automated, biocontainment facility just to hold her - and now that Footgirl was trying to rattle her cage, she was ready to double down on the project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tight campaign schedule had taught Maria how to groom herself in virtually seconds. Before long, she was back in her trademark suit and black pumps, grabbing her car keys out of the bowl and driving down the city's waterfront, to meet one of its most dangerous villains in her home turf: the abandoned Tootsie Co. factory. It was once the country's largest footwear manufacturer, long since bankrupt. Renovating the industrial complex was another of Maria's policies, which (she hoped) would root out one of the worst criminal hot spots in the area. For now, it was home to smugglers, drug dealers, and of course, Footgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria parked her car as close as possible to the loading bay doors, positioned ideally for a quick get-away. Her heart was pounding as she stepped out into the cold midnight air. Maria knew she was almost certain not to make it. At least, not in shape for next week's debate. But for Amelia, she had to do what she had to do. She put on her big girl face, and took a confident step toward Footgirl's lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ocean breeze carried the distinct smell of raw sewage, probably the perfidious work of some other villain, but even that wasn't enough to mask the thick scent of Limburger cheese which lingered inside the factory. The loading bay was stacked to the ceiling with rotten crates, thousands of unsold running shoes spilling into the aisles to serve as nests for the countless mice lured in by the stench. There was a single light in the middle of the warehouse, beckoning her to advance, deeper into the bowels of Tootsie Co. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Point of no return. Maria took a deep breath, before moving into the light. </span></div></div>",

But alas, beyond the skittering and jittering of the rats, she seemed to be completely alone in the warehouse. Could it be this was some kind of sick joke? An ill-conceived prank? Or maybe even a lousy attempt at intimidation... whatever the case, she wasn't going to stick around in an abandoned factory, waiting for an actual criminal to waltz in. She turned on her heel and *OWW*!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria yelped in pain as an excruciatingly sharp object landed on the back of her neck. And it seemed to be... moving?! \"What the...\" She reached for the site of the sting, and her heart stopped upon feeling the small, many-legged metal creature that was stuck to her neck. \"I wouldn't mess with that, if I were you.\" a familiar voice echoed through the noisy factory loudspeakers. \"Footgirl!\" Maria growled, soldiering through the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maniacal giggles of the stinky-footed villain resonated through the empty building. \"Well, aren't we the clever sweat-rag? Teehee!\" Like a true psychopath, the cold and calculating tone of her tape was completely replaced with a sadistic, over-the-top inflection. \"I demand you show yourself at once! A-and take this fucking thing off me!\" Maria was trying her best to seem fierce, but deep down, true fear was settling in. And it showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, Miss Mayor McPants, I demand you KNEEL!\" In a moment of pure horror, Maria felt a debilitating zap in the back of her neck, and 90% of the muscles on her body going limp. Falling heavy on her knees, the distressed politician could utter but a few words before running out of breath. \"... just... let... Amelia... go!\" More mad laughter followed, only interrupted by a coughing fit worthy of a cartoon villain. \"Don't worry, sweetheart - <i>I will</i>. You see, Amelia was only the appetizer. You, my dear, are the main course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's heart sank even more. Of course it was a trap. What else did she expect? \"F-fine... torture me... ya bitch!\" she managed to spit, along with a lot of drool from her slack mouth. \"Torture? Nooo... nothing so crass! We're gonna play a little game, you and I... and thousands of fans watching us on YouTube. That's right, honey, we're live!\" From the corner of her eye, Maria could only just recognize the flashing red light from the camera mounted on one of the service catwalks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, the true reason I wanted to lure you here wasn't politics. I could brainwash the entire town into voting for me, if I really wanted! Truth is, I've been working on a little, hmm... challenge course, not for the weak of stomach. And I needed someone special to play with. You handled yourself pretty well with those bikers. If 'pretty well' means making a fool of yourself, of course! But hey - humiliation sells! Isn't that right, guys? Remember to smash that like button and subscribe for more -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to play none of your sick games, Footgirl!\" Maria interrupted, as her muscles slowly regained function. \"Well, aren't you forgetting something? Do I need to get your minion on the phone again?\" \"... M-miss Anderson... please... p-please...\" the broken voice of the intern echoed softly through the loudspeakers. Damn it, she couldn't abandon Amelia now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besiiiides... what's that little bug on your neck? Oh, silly me, it's just happens to contain a supersaturated solution of my foot sweat, ready to be injected into your spinal cord at any time I please. It would instantly lobotomize you... even more than you're already are, of course! Though slightly more addicted to my stinky feet. Not very good for your polling numbers, I bet. So don't even think of disobeying me, bitch! How's it gonna be, then? Ready to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria sighed, not with fear, but with resignation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> With large array of supervillains that infested the great city of Metropolis, it only stood to reason that there would be a facility built to accommodate them once they've been successfully apprehended. The Metropolis Correctional Facility (or the MCF as it was more commonly known), was designed with such a goal in mind. Fitted with the most advanced security system that money could buy, the institution was more than capable of housing and monitoring the many super powered beings that were brought their way. The primary investor of the institution, Jake Blackridge, hoped that it would also be a place for the criminally insane to be rehabilitated and make into productive members of society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unfortunate for him, this was not to be. Not long after creating the facility, a man by the name of Ian Johnston took the reigns, having been personally appointed by Blackridge himself. While he was a noble, selfless man of principals, he wasn't as attentive as he could've been. Incidents happened in an almost constant basis, ranging from breakouts to prison riots. Desperate to have order in his prison, Ian turned the reigns over to his eldest son Ralph, appointing him as head of security who promised to bring in some much needed discipline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And he did just that. In less than two months the hungry young instituted changes that saw a dramatic decline in misconduct and a sharp increase in inmate compliance. Noteworthy troublemakers such as Havoc, Footgirl and Megabutt were forced into a state of begrudging obedience under his watch. It was these results that made him a hero among the citizens of Metropolis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn't hard to see why so many people thought highly of Ralph. He was a lithe man of diminutive stature, standing only 5'5, with a youthful face and light blue eyes. Initially, the public scoffed at the idea that someone so scrawny and meek looking could prove effective in keeping such dangerous criminals in check. That said, what the young man lacked in appearance he more than made up for in his intellect and wit. He was quick to charm his detractors with a lighthearted, self-deprecating humor, often poking fun at his height to the amusement of others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of his affable nature, he was also seen as even handed and kindly to those who would take the time to see his handiwork. Three weeks into his hiring, he gave a tour of the facility with several news outlets hanging off his every word. They were blown away to see vile criminals such as Miss Manure and Amazon in their cells, engaging in recreational activities in such a way that one could be excused for believing that they were just normal everyday citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The closest thing to an incident came when the mischievous Nasty Neko attempted to lure a journalist away from the group. Ralph was quick to spot this and sternly lectured Neko about prisoner conduct, threatening to take away his television privileges for a week should he get into any trouble. Truly, it was an amazing sight to see the bold and independent Neko slink back and meekly apologize before heading back to his cell. With results like that, how could they not help but hold the bright eyed security manager in high regard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All that said, they had little idea of Ralph's true nature. All his life he had been looked down on for his small size. His classmates mocked and bullied him, his coworkers thought little of him and his father saw him as unfit to follow in his footsteps due to his physical shortcomings. With society pressing down on him constantly, he dedicated all his time into improving his mind rather than his body. He learned how to best people using nothing but his keen wit and intellect, and while he did eventually manage to earn the respect that had been denied to him for so long, by then it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While on the surface he seemed sociable and friendly, it was merely a mask that hid his true contempt for his fellow man. He had long since concluded that everyone around him, regardless of how much they insisted otherwise, was secretly mocking him for his size. This bred a fierce napoleon complex that would manifest whenever he was put in a position of authority. It brought him a great deal of joy and satisfaction to torment those unfortunate enough to work under him. His cruelty would often go unnoticed however, mostly in part to his unassuming appearance and the amiable persona he had perfected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n One would think that even he would hesitate to push his weight around in a facility filled with the most dangerous criminals in the city, but they'd be wrong. Each inmate was fitted with a strength dampening collar, as well as a deodorizing jumpsuit that would kill any potent stenches that they could potentially weaponize. Without their abilities, they were as vulnerable as the average human and thus, were subject to Ralph's cruel treatment.<br>\r\n'<br>\r\n Every morning would begin with a gushing torrent of freezing cold soap water shot out from a fire hose. After their \"bath\" the inmates were brought to the yard where they were forced to do backbreaking labor, from pulling giant stone slabs back and forth without rest, to digging holes only to fill them back up again. It was wise not to inquire as to the purpose of these activities, lest one wished to be hosed down for \"undermining authority\". After working in the yard, they were brought inside where they would eat the most heinous slop imaginable. Afterwards they would be sent back to their cells and allowed to waste time watching television or reading before the time came for them to go to bed. Anyone caught up and about would be subjected to another hosing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n For those with hyperactive libido's like Hippo Girl and Nasty Neko, imprisonment under Ralph's rule was nothing short of hellish. They were forced to wear a chastity belt that kept them from getting intimate with other inmates -- or themselves. To make it even more painful, their television screen were set to broadcast pornographic channels 24/7. The incident which helped cement the public's approval of Ralph, the one in which he \"saved\" a reporter from Nasty Neko was the result of his inhuman treatment. The tortured cat boy had approached the frightened reporter, pleading for him to relieve him. So desperate was Neko that he was entirely willing to be used like a cheap whore just so he could finally get some release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His was a life that many inmates were forced to live under Ralph Johnston. There was a distinct pleasure he felt in using such high profile criminals as his playthings. The feeling of superiority he felt as they hung their heads low in an attempt to avoid eye contact with him was nothing short of intoxicating. Truly, this was a job that was made for someone like him; a job in which he could lord his power over those who had once lorded their power over others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His dream job wouldn't last however, as karma has a habit of catching up with the wicked of heart, even when they're doing evil onto other evildoers. The pint sized terror sat in his office with mug of coffee in hand, humming to himself as his eyes scanned the security monitors in front of him. Things seemed to be running smoothly as the inmates sat quietly in their cells in anticipation of the buzzer that would signal the guards to come and escort them out to the yard. Their good behavior greatly displeased Ralph as he drummed his fingers along his desk irritably. As much as he enjoyed toying with them, he still maintained some meager level of professionalism in that he only acted out once they've done something to initiate it. Granted, he was quite fickle and pedantic in what he would punish them for, but it was the only principal he abode by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You'll slip up sooner or later, you little punks...\" he muttered to himself as he stood up from his chair to ready himself for the day ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, it happened. Something that Ralph never once thought to prepare for. Just as he reached for the knob to exit his office, the lights began to flicker. He wasn't grant much time to process what was happening before the he was standing in near total darkness. In the months he had been working there he couldn't recall a single time when the power went out, though he wasn't the type to look into the details of his position that he found uninteresting, such as paperwork and maintenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he tried to find his way in the dark, he heard heard his walkie talkie buzzing at his hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Johnston! Are you there?! We have a really big problem right now!\" A voice cried from the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know, the lights are out. Just fix it and get back to work\" Ralph stated coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-It's not just the lights! The building is completely without power! The collars are have shorted out and the inmates are on the loose! I repeat, the inmates are on the loose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A nervous sweat trickled down Ralph's cheek and for the first time since he was in middle school, he felt helpless and uncertain. Taking in a deep breath, he collected himself and held the walkie talkie back up to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, lets try to keep our heads on our shoulders. Where is the emergency generator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was no response on the other end save for the light hum of static. Ralph growled and shook the device in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I said, where is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I heard you the first time\" An unfamiliar voice spoke from the other end. \"It really doesn't make a difference. I'll find you before you come anywhere near it, and then we're going to have a little talk about my present living conditions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ralph's eyes widened and his blood ran cold as he heard a sickening crunch on the other end before all he could hear on the other end was white noise. One thing was certain, whomever it was on the other end was obviously one of the inmates with a vendetta against him. Fear overwhelmed him as he tried to think of his next course of action.</span></div></div>",

Just about every single inmate in the prison had something, or many things, against him! For all he knew, whoever was on the line was just one member of an entire angry mob of villains headed his way! And that might not have even been the worst of Ralph's troubles! The fact that the emergency generator hadn't come on by itself was troubling in its own right, but the weather forecast had shown clear skies all week! There was no way the power could have just \"gone out\" in the area like this. The both of these things together made Ralph absolutely certain that the building's power had been sabotaged. However, Ralph had no clue as to who or why. It couldn't have been one of the inmates, as they had all been accounted for last night. He supposed it could have been one of the few villains who had thus far either eluded capture or had proved themselves too difficult to capture like Waft or any of the Ancient villains. That explanation still didn't make much sense though. Why would they go out of their way to free the other villains when their competition had been reduced by at least ninety percent because of this place!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither explanation made much sense to Ralph, and both were equally terrifying. Either one of the inmates had managed to somehow bypass all of the prison's security measures to kill the power, or there was at least one overly-powerful villain running amok in the place amongst all the other freed villains! The fear and uncertainty of the situation was too much to bear. He didn't dare step outside the room! Luckily, the warden's office was designed to act as a safe room. There was only one entry point, and it was behind a heavy, metal door. He just had to stay in his office, and wait for help to arrive! There was no need to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph froze up in terror when he heard a metallic clunking sound. It wasn't the door either! That's when Ralph looked up, and saw the one fatal flaw with his little office bunker. The vent. Normally, the vents were electrified in order to keep anyone from getting into them, but with the power out, there was nothing stopping the inmates from crawling through them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph looked on, paralyzed in fear as the vent grate clattered to the ground, and out of the vent came...</span></div></div>",

He was sure, someone was going to crawl through that opening and attack him! Any moment now. Any...moment? Ralph blinked, wondering why nothing had happened. No inmates seemed to be crawling out of the vents, and no rescuers were either for that matter! Just, the vent was opened and then...nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph sat frozen in his seat for a good five minutes before he finally worked up the courage to stand up. He cautiously walked over to the vent grate and picked it up. The grate hadn't been unscrewed, just struck so hard that it had been torn from the vent! \"Who in the hell would go through the trouble of smashing this withou-GAHK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grate clattered to the ground once more as Ralph held his throat with both hands.

Too awful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...someone...h-help..m-m...eeeeeee...\" Were his last words before everything went dark. The smell was just too bad!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of rustling was the first thing Ralph could clearly perceive as he returned to consciousness. The foul stench of feted body odor was next. His vision followed slowly\u2026very slowly. Though the thick veil of darkness, he could identify vague shapes of chain-link cages filled with boxes and shelves. From just that, he realized he wasn\u2019t being held in a cell, but in the prison's storage room; where villain paraphernalia and contraband were held under lock and key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph heard the rustling again. Though now with the aid of consciousness, he could also make out something scraping against metal. His eyes followed the noise to a large dark figure squatting on the floor a few feet away from his chair. The mystery giant had their back turned towards Ralph as it poured over something that gave off a faint glow. The light might have been dulled, but it was enough to reveal a thick flank bulging out of a tight-fitting orange prisoner\u2019s uniform in tatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScattered on the floor around the shadowed figure, Ralph noticed a mess of mangled crowbars, emptied cans of WD-40, shattered pliers, a pack of spearmint gum, a wallet and a key ring with only a small MCF personnel ID attached to it. The ring\u2019s keys were removed from their cradle and strewn across the floor, bent out of shape. Even with the limited light, Ralph could make out the last three items as his own, stolen from his pants pockets. It made him feel a bit violated, but he knew full well it wouldn\u2019t even compare to the potential harm he\u2019d suffer if the inmate managed to open whatever they were fixated on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it seemed Ralph wouldn\u2019t have to stay long enough to see it. Whomever his captor was, they weren\u2019t very good at tying knots. As he brushed his nimble fingers against the rope binding them to the back of the chair, he managed to push, prod and pull his restraints expertly enough to loosen them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Not out of the woods yet\u2026just gotta stay quiet until I can find a way out of here,\u201d Ralph though a second before a forceful sneeze escaped his unprepared lips.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaxons screamed in Ralph\u2019s brain as he watched his mysterious captor rise with a start. The moment he saw them stand almost seven feet, he frantically tore at the ropes with hands glazed in dread and adrenaline. The figure was only a foot away as he finally freed himself from his bindings. With panic saturating every move he made, he flew out of his chair and bolted. In the cover of darkness, he couldn\u2019t tell where he was going, but he was sure it was better than where he was now. Ralph moved only two steps away from the chair before the discarded rope seized his ankles, and brought him down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph second desperate fight with the rope lasted only seconds as a large foot landed on his back. Grunting in pain, he turned around to learn the identity his attacker. With the light from a phone clutched in her hand \u2013 his phone \u2013 he found himself staring into the pudgy face of one of the last prisoners he wanted to confront: Prisoner F-567. Brook Turner, also known as Hippo Girl. One of the most infamous villains in Metropolis.<br>\r\nRalph had good reason to fear Brook. Of all the villains in lock-up, she was one of the few who refused to fall in line. Thanks to the tailor-made, triple-reinforced Duramantium-plated chastity belt denying her any sort of contact with her intersexed genitals, her carnal frustration manifested in an abominable and often violent attitude. Brook had regular confrontations with both prisoners and guards which would often end with black eyes, bloodied noses, broken bones, and busted teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThreats of being blasted with water failed to deter Brook\u2019s abrasive behavior. She\u2019d once managed to steal a hose from a guard and discharged brutal torrents of water into anyone who tried to take it back from her. In response, Ralph had the walls and ceiling of Brook\u2019s cell embedded with powerful hoses. During her mandatory pornography viewing sessions, on days she would misbehave, she would be thoroughly drenched with one of the hoses; usually when it seemed her exasperation had reached a boiling point. On the occasion that he was feeling particularly spiteful, Ralph would activate a hose to force a sleeping Brook to flail out of her bed as she bellowed gruesome swears and death threats. The threats did little to deter Ralph, as he interpreted the prisoner\u2019s outbursts as chips of her resolve flaking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the thing that made Ralph the wariest of Brook was her strength. Throughout her incarceration, she\u2019d been desperate to overpower her inhibitor collar, so she could remove her chastity belt. She\u2019d work extra shifts in the yard, push herself in the gym, anything she could do to build her natural muscle. Of course, since the collars were made to actively adjust themselves to their bearer\u2019s power, it was a hilariously futile effort. The only thing she\u2019d succeeded in doing was molding her flabby body into something more fitting for an extra bulky sumo wrestler. Although now that Brook\u2019s collar was out of the equation, all her new gains were now stacked on top of her terrifying natural strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrook rolled Ralph over on his back with her bare foot before planting it on his stomach. She aimed his cellphone\u2019s light on her crotch, where her jumpsuit had been torn away to reveal her chastity belt; a device created almost as copious as its wearer to completely contain her considerately sized attachments. Without any obvious catches, buckles, or openings of any kind, the belt was virtually impossible to detach. The apparatus\u2019 slick surface was covered in many, many scratches. Obviously inflicted by Brook and her stolen tools. Ralph found some relief knowing that, despite her newfound strength, Brook was still couldn\u2019t remove her belt. The relief quickly evaporated as the light of the phone exposed the searing anger flickering in Hippo Girl\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it off,\u201d Brook demanded through gritted teeth. Her voice quaked with both boiling rage and strung-out desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrook responded by putting all her strength into a hard stomp into Ralph\u2019s gut. Miraculously, she missed his ribs. Though he swore she broke something else as a shockwave of pain forced a long loud agonized groan out his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake. It. Off. NOW!\u201d Brook thundered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrook\u2019s foot left Ralph\u2019s stomach to deliver a hard kick straight to his own crotch. A scream and a bit of bile escaped Ralph as a new storm of pain and nausea overwhelmed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you realize how fucked you are right now, dick head?\u201d Brook said as she kicked Ralph\u2019s head to the side before pinning it underneath her sole. His head erupted in agony as the convict\u2019s fat plush feet pressed his skull harder and harder into the cold hard floor. The pain was nothing compared to the horrors haunting Ralph\u2019s nose. Apparently, without soap, Brook\u2019s regular hosings did very little to curb her natural odor.  Neglecting to dry her off after each spray allowed the water to stew inside her jumpsuit during each of her strenuous work out sessions. The result was a fungus living between Brook\u2019s toes that smelled of overripened Limburger. It didn\u2019t smell quite as bad as Footgirl, but right now, that wasn\u2019t saying much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGet this fucking thing off me before I bust your head open like a watermelon!\u201d Said Brook, adding more pressure to Ralph\u2019s head to stress her threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go ahead and kill me if you want, F-567,\u201d said Ralph. \u201cI\u2019ll die happy knowing you\u2019ll never get to touch your cock again. Because I\u2019m the only one who knows how to open your belt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hard-throbbing pain tremored through Ralph\u2019s skull as Brook removed her foot from him. She kept on beaming her furious glare into him, but he didn\u2019t care. Just so long as he\u2019d gotten through to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d He said, smiling as a surge of confidence surged through his body. \u201cNow Prisoner F-567, I want you to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Brook growled. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to call the shots anymore. I do. Take this fucking thing off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can shove your thing down my throat? That\u2019s not happening,\u201d Said Ralph. \u201cNow unless you want your fat ass stuffed into the chair when this is all over, you better start listening to me, F-567. Because there is no amount of bargaining, no amount of pain, no amount of torment you can offer me to get me to remove that belt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brook kneeled to stare him directly in the face, Ralph couldn\u2019t help but slowly question the integrity of his own words. Perhaps he\u2019d rode a little too high on his wave of confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Brook asked as her grimace slowly stretched itself into an unnerving toothy smile. \u201cLet\u2019s see about that.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She started by grabbing him by his collar and throwing him across the room. The dull impact of the wall stung a little, but that was the least of his worries. He was far away from the room's exit and the angry prisoner stood between him and freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an unsettling calmness she walked over to the man, each step sending a tiny shiver down his spine. He was almost back on his feet when she reached him and delivered a heavy punch to his gut. Her strength, paired with her girth gave even her lightest blows a tremendous impact. He fell down, curled up and clenching his aching gut. Ralph didn't get long to whimper before Brook planted one of her heavy feet on his left ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just make sure you're not getting away first.\" Brook said calmly as she leaned forward. Pain shot through the man as she brought all her mass down on his ankle. Finally, a sickening crunch echoed through the room. The pain increased tenfold and Brook slowly stepped back to admire her work. His left foot was twisted out of shape, bright red with bruising. Ralph cried out in agony, but Brook seemed surprised at his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crying already? I haven't even started. Are you sure there's no amount of torment that can get you to be a little more... helpful? Maybe we should try the other ankle first.\" Ralph grunted and spat curses at his tormentor, but Brook just smiled. She had him at her mercy and he was about to feel just how much of that mercy had been washed away over the last few months of her imprisonment. With little fanfare she planted her foot on his other ankle, causing him to whimper and beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrook chuckled with sadistic glee. \"Tell you what. You release this thing from my dick and then we'll talk.\" His eyes widened with fear. Brook wasn't going to stop. He either had to give her what she wanted or hope to last long enough for the other guards to restore order. But the villain had no patience for his pondering. Her foot came down and crushed his other ankle, making the man scream even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this sound? if you release me now, I might not even ram my dick into you like you so very much deserve.\" Ralph knew she was lying. A villain of her caliber couldn't be trusted, especially given all the times she's threatened to kill him. She once spent an hour in interrogation meticulously describing her fucking him to death. With all the defiance he had left in him he looked up to his tormentor. Brook smiled at the whimpering man, knowing her victim was close to breaking. He spat at the looming villain, hitting her square in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" She growled. \"If you want to play rough, let's break out the big guns.\" </span></div></div>",

As he struggled against his binds, Nasty Neko emerged from the shadows, his normally cheerful face replaced by a cold, dreary eyed expression. He paid little mind to Ralph's struggles as he continued forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know, I wasn't the one that knocked you out. I tailed behind someone else so I could get into your office. You had something I desperately wanted\" he explained before reaching behind his back and pulling out a set of keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you even need those for? The cells were unlocked by the blackout! You can leave at any time!\" Ralph snapped as he continued to fight against the ropes that held him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could care less about leaving right now. This is about fixing a personal problem\" Neko stated in a time that bordered on being deadpan. He quickly stripped out of his prison uniform, exposing his lithe yet muscular form, and the chastity belt that kept him from being fully exposed. Ralph froze and swallowed as Neko calmly examined each key for the one that would unlock the horrid device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Neko, don't do something you'll regret later... Cat Girl and Bird Boy are on their way. If they find out you did something to me, they'll--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lying. And even if you weren't, I don't care\" Neko said as he began the process of unlocking the belt. He frowned as his hand came across multiple locks, but they didn't hinder him from his task. The chastity belt fell to the ground with a loud 'clunk', exposing Neko's genitalia. His massive dong was swollen with need and leaking precum while his balls were swollen to frightening proportions. So sensitive were his privates that a light breeze brought Neko down to his knees, his eyes wide and his body shaking with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-damn... damn it...!\" He cried as he struggled to stand to his feet. \"You... forced me... to do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neko, let me go! If you don't I swear to Christ I'll make you pay!\" Ralph shouted, his normally authoritative voice cracking under the sudden fear he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I wouldn't have to do this if it weren't for you! I don't like fucking people I hate... but... but I can't help it now! I'm reduced to using you to get off!\" He cried as he fought off tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You don't have to do this! I--\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ralph's words were cut off as Neko pounced on top of the chair, the thick head of his cock aimed at Ralph's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just do it and get it over with!\" Neko ordered sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n How does Ralph escape Nasty Neko?</span></div></div>",

He wasn't a magically or scientifically beefed up superhuman who could melt brains with stink. He was just human, and he definitely couldn't get free of the ropes! Not for lack of trying, of course. He squirmed and writhed against his bindings as Neko brought his cock closer to Ralph's lips. There was no way he was going to just give in an...and...Ralph blinked a few times as a slightly spicy scent entered his nostrils. The smell made him feel warm, and he started to part his lips, but immediately realized what was going on and pressed them shut! Neko had to be forcibly washed three times a day in order to keep his potent pheromones from messing with the guards. By now, he had missed one, maybe two of those washes, and his crotch musk had already returned! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, Neko didn't actually know he had this power. He had always assumed that people just really, really wanted to have sex with him. And that blowing him made others just feel really good. He certainly didn't think that Ralph deserved that kind of fun, but he needed this! The nearly crying catboy pressed his tip against Ralph's lips and whined in frustration. \"Come oooonnn! Just suck it already!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph tried to keep his lips pressed shut, but Neko's scent had already started to affect his brain. He looked up at Neko's weary, tortured face and felt a pang in his chest. He was cute...and Ralph had reduced him to this...it didn't feel right! Ralph didn't even realize that he'd never bothered to hold his breath, and by now, he was already growing attached to Neko. He'd done awful things to the cutie, and now he needed to make it right! Ralph parted his lips yet again, and let his captor slide his thick dick in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeko threw his head back and screamed as he finally got a mouth around his cock after months and months of hellish torture! He'd been forced into a chastity cage, and made to watch and read nothing but porn every day. The most sexual interaction he could get was when the guards occasionally groped his ass or stuffed it with their batons, or when he was strapped to a chair and forcibly edged by a \"specialist\" for two hours. Months of teasing and torture with no relief...finally being undone! It was pretty understandable that Neko lost control of himself as soon as Ralph's lips wrapped around his shaft. He grabbed Ralph's head and let out another echoing moan as he started slamming his schlong in and out of Ralph's throat. In mere minutes, he was already ready to blow, but just before he could, he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeko glared down at Ralph through his blushing, aroused face. His hands reached around and undid the ropes binding Ralph to the chair. \"You...I want you to...fix this yourself. N-no help from me. Suck it until I cum!\" After the thorough facefucking Ralph had received, he was in no position to argue. He immediately started to bob his head and suck like his life depended on it! He wanted that catboy cream so badly, and he was going to get it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the warden eagerly sucking his cock proved to be too much for the overly pent up Neko. He shouted far louder than he ever had in his life as pleasure overwhelmed his body! Tingles of ecstasy shocked every bit of his body as he finally, finally got to cum! It was easily the greatest orgasm Neko had ever felt, and though it didn't make all the torture worth it, it came close! Ralph's throat was flooded with Neko's cum! The warm, sweet, thick liquid poured into him, and there was no way he could swallow it all! He coughed up a good portion of jizz, and it splattered over his face and Neko's dick, but neither of them seemed to really care. Ralph just kept on milking Neko's thick, tasty cock until the catboy couldn't take anymore! Neko let out a sigh as he fell back onto the floor. A rope of cum splashed Ralph right in the face as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was stunned from the pheromones and the sheer volume of semen he'd just been forced to ingest. His own cock was rock hard and had tented his pants. He didn't try to jerk it though. After what he'd put such an adorable catboy through, Ralph felt he didn't deserve it. However, the sound of approaching footsteps made him immediately duck under the bed in the cell! He made it just in time as Hippo Girl pulled open the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippo girl looked down at Neko, and grinned when she saw the keys in his hand. \"Well, well, well! The cat slut got the keys to these damn chastity cages! Now I can free my cock, AND have an ass to stuff with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeko's eyes widened in fear, even he was afraid of Hippo Girl's massive chick dick! \"No, no, nonono!\" He shakily stood up and tried to bolt out of the cell, but he was too tired to make it! Hippo Girl grabbed him by the skin on the back of his neck, and like a cat, Neko immediately froze! Hippo Girl smirked as she went about taking the keys and freeing her cock. She then slammed Neko up against the wall and pressed her throbbing, over-tortured cock against his pucker! \"Hope you don't plan on walking anywhere, kitty. 'Cause I'm about to pulverize you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph watched from under the bed as Neko hastily begged Hippo Girl not to fuck him. He couldn't help but feel responsible for the poor kitty's predicament, but Hippo Girl was terrifying! In the end, he...</span></div></div>",

If he jumped in to help, Hippo Girl would turn her attention over to him, which was the last thing he wanted. He quickly ducked under the bed and pushed himself back as far as he could. His heart ached with guilt for not doing anything to help Neko, but his fear of Hippo Girl kept him from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please... H-Hippo... Don't do this... we can find one of the guards... we can share...!\" he pleaded fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, keeping begging~ I love it when they beg~\" she slurred in an almost drunken manner. Words alone wouldn't be enough to sway her, as her mind was clouded with lust and desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Ralph watched from his hiding place, he noticed something different about Hippo Girl. All the time spent toiling away in the yard had a clear effect on her body, as her normally flabby face was taut and smooth. She still looked quite thick, but he could less fat and more muscle on her. His eyes traveled down south and he was stunned to see that her already huge cock seemed just a bit bigger, managing to push past Neko's by an inch or so. He wasn't grant much time to examine it as it slowly began disappear into Neko's vulnerable asshole, her precum acting as an effective lube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gawd... your ass is sooooo tight~\" Hippo Girl moaned as the base of her cock pushed against his narrow rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Neko couldn't muster a response other than hushed whimpers. He had hoped that his previous experience in taking the guards batons up his ass, but Hippo's girth was something entirely different. He could feel his tender sphincter being stretched to their very limit, barely able to accommodate her massive chick fuck. Yet as uncomfortable as it was, his own cock was rock hard from the sudden penetration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... see? This isn't so bad...\" she cooed as she began to piston her hips against his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n All of Neko's fears seemed to melt away as he was reduced to a hot moaning mess, his mind racked with pleasure as he was pushed against with wall with every thrust. Despite his cock remaining untouched, she managed to bring him to his climax at least three times in the span of five minutes, a pearly white puddle beginning to form beneath him. Had it been an average person that Hippo chose to violate, the unending pleasure would have resulted in their heart giving out from the strain. It was by her good fortune that she ran into someone with a libido almost as ravenous as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A nervous sweat trickled down Ralph's brow as he bore witness to the debauched spectacle. His mind was slightly more clear from the sexual haze that he had been forced into and he began thinking a little more logically. With the two of them distracted, he could easily make a break for it. Even if they wanted to chase after him, they'd put more priority on sating their pent up needs than capturing him. He was about to bolt for the door when something caught his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He looked back over to the depravity going on in front of him and his eyes widened. The residual effects of Neko's pheromones began to take root once more as he eyed the growing puddle of cum on the floor. Nasty Neko's precious seed was being wasted and his swollen cock was throbbing with need. Ralph felt his mouth water at the sight as he was tempted to come out of his hiding spot and tend to his aching member. His survival instincts were at conflict with his burning lust and he wasn't sure which he wanted to listen to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hippo Girl's eyes were wrenched shut as she pounded her prey as hard as she could. Her stamina was downright incredible, given that her cock torture schedule had been the same as Neko's! Somehow she still hadn't blown her load into Neko's ass yet! Still, this was good because as long as Hippo Girl was fucking Neko, she was distracted. And since Neko was in no position to stop Ralph, he could get away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph braced himself to run, but as soon as he crawled from under the bed, his legs wouldn't move towards the door! In fact, he could hardly even look at the door! He was far too focused on the blushing, moaning catboy and his needy cock. Ralph was salivating at the thought of having that tasty kitty cock back in his throat, and without even thinking, he changed course and stumbled over towards the two villains. He knelt down and stared at Neko's cock. Neko was starting to sweat from all the sex, so his pheromones were even more potent! Ralph took a deep breath in and his brain was flooded with desire! Seconds later, he had his lips wrapped firmly around Neko's shaft and was sucking away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeko started to scream louder as his cock was plunged into something warm and wet. He looked down and was shocked to see Ralph choking himself on Neko's length! The catboy was utterly confused now! Why didn't he run? Did he WANT his dick all of a sudden? Maybe Ralph was apologizing, or maybe the cock torture had all been an elaborate ploy to set up this very scenario. Either way, Neko greatly appreciated the attention, especially with the danger of Hippo Girl present. He started to purr and pet Ralph's head as his penis tensed up and shot a fourth load right down Ralph's eager throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Ralph didn't let a drop of Neko's precious seed hit the floor. He wanted all the cum he could handle inside him! Each time he slurped at Neko's shaft, a wave of euphoria would wash over him. Sucking Neko off was the greatest thing he had felt in a long time. He was nearly addicted to that cat cock! With his inhibitions thoroughly smothered by musk, Ralph dropped his trousers and boxers, and started jerking himself off as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little orgy continued for quite some time. Neko's balls were completely drained of fluid, and Ralph was a fair bit pudgier from his stuffed stomach. That didn't stop him from continuing to suck Neko to a multitude of dry orgasms that still made the cat feel wonderful. Even Ralph managed to splatter the floor with his own seed before Hippo Girl finally let loose what she'd been storing up. Her massive girl meat slammed all the way to the hilt inside Neko, making him go cross eyed! Hippo Girl bellowed as she finally achieved sweet, sweet release and Neko was filled to the brim with her spooge. Hippo Girl kept thrusting and pumping Neko full of cum for a good while before she finally slid her dick out and let Neko slide down to the ground. She'd never felt so winded in her life! Likely because she'd never fucked an energy siphoning catboy before. Her cock was still hard and ready to go again when she noticed Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! It's my lucky day, isn't it? Not only did I get this stupid cage off, but now I get to turn the man who put me in it into my personal fucktoy!\" Ralph's eyes went wide as Hippo Girl reached for him, and he...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Ralph didn't have the energy to try and escape as Hippo Girl grabbed him by the ankle and tugged him over to her. He looked over to his beloved Neko to come and assist him but he was completely indisposed, his stomach even more bloated than his own as his face was frozen in a blissful smile. Hippo Girl cleare her throat, drawing Ralph's attention back forward where her massive tool dominated the entirety of his vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how long I've wanted to do this~\" Hippo snickered as she gave her meat a few slow strokes, making a large glob of precum splatter into his face. He should have been revolted at this turn of events, but his mind was still disjointed from Neko's influence. All he could think about was how impressive her cock was. While he didn't like it nearly as much as Neko's, it was still quite the amazing specimen to behold; a towering pillar of meat with thick, pulsing veins and an angry, bullet shaped head that continued to leak precum onto his face. Could he even get his mouth around something that thick and powerful? His mouth watered at the very thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hippo Girl raised a brow in slight surprise as the man responsible for her torment slowly grasped onto her cock and leaned in to try and fit the head into his mouth. As expected, her girth was a little to big to get all the way in, though she was content to let him fumble with it for a few minutes. Soon enough she grow tired of just watching him and pulled the tip of her cock out with with a wet 'pop'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Ralph, I never took you for a cockslut. It's nice to see that at the end of the day, you know your place in life\" she said before stand up and pushing her hips out. \"Make yourself useful and get me nice and lubed. My cum was good enough for Mr. Pussycat over there, but something tells me I'm gonna need a little more than that for you\" she said with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ralph was quick to obey, crawling over and lavishing her mighty cock with licks. Up and down he went, from the top to the base and back again, competely coating her coat with his saliva. He soon took a small detour from his task and turned his attention to get massive balls, which even after pumping gallons of jizz into Neko's asshole just minutes ago, still sloshed with seed. Once he was done prepping her up, he went to work using his to tongue to worship her swollen nutsack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jesus... you're an even bigger slut than I thought...\" she moved as she grasped the back of his head. Ralph paid her words little mind as he focused on his task, his mind making more of the differences between her and Neko. While Neko's musk was spicy and slightly sweet, Hippo's was potent and virile. It suddenly made sense to him that the normally independent Neko would be so quick to submit. She was an alpha, someone who belonged on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough of that. Gotta save that load for that sweet virgin ass of yours~\" she said before roughly grabbing him by the back of his neck and nonchalantly tossing him over to the bed, his naked rear end tooted in the air. The though of complaining never once crossed his mind as he patiently waited for her to commence. Why would he complain? She was his better, so she could do whatever she pleased with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His thoughts were interrupted as he felt her massive tool flop down in between his buttcheeks. Uncertainty began to blossom in his mind as he finally soaked in the shear size of the object about to penetrate his virgin asshole. He could feel it throbbing against his ass, a waterfall of precum flowing from the tip and forming a puddle on the small of his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From this point forward, this ass is my official property...\" She said before tracing her cockhead down to his unclaimed anus. Without another word, she finally penetrated his asshole, popping his anal cherry. Ralph's eyes shot open and his mouth hung open, though his words quickly died in his throat. There was no care or concern in her approach as she just thrusted more and more of her cock into his ass, her technique not unlike someone trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually, Ralph managed to find his voice, though all he muster was a pained whimper as his sensitive asshole was mercilessly ravaged by the cruel hermaphrodite. Sensing his discomfort, she responded by giving him a swift slap on the was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, bitch... I'm almost halfway in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That statement drew an audible gasp from Ralph as he glanced back to make sure she speaking in jest. Judging by the distance between them, it was clear that she was being entirely honest. Their gaze met and Hippo Girl have him a toothy smile before pushing three more inches of cock flesh into his ass, earning a yelp from the helpless guard. After what seemed like an eternity, he finally felt his bottom making contact with her groin, indicating that she was finally completely inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a rare act of mercy, Hippo Girl allowed him a minute to adjust to the sensation before she began to slowly pull out with only the head remaining inside his ass. Oddly enough, he didn't feel all to happy with the sudden reprieve. He felt a sudden emptiness and longed for it to be filled once more. His wish was granted as Hippo thrust forward again, this time pumping her hips afterword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pain and pleasure became indistinguishable in Ralph's mind as he was rode into the bed, his eyes watering and his fingers clenched tightly on the cheap bedsheets. The area came alive with the sounds of Hippo's hips slamming into his ass, a chorus of grunts, moans, and whimpers echoing throughout the cell. Just as he was beginning to get used to the brutal fucking, he felt her hands clasp onto his waist. He was suddenly turned around to face her, her cock still buried deep in his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was greeted by the sight of Hippo Girl vigorously fucking his ass, her eyes crossed and her tongue hanging out as she plowed into him. Somewhere deep down, he knew did wasn't right. He was a man who inspired fear and respect in all who were unfortunate enough to cross his path. He had the city's villains obedient and subservient, uttering his name in hushed murmurs as they tried to stay on his good side at all times. He had the admiration of the entire city of Metropolis, including the highroller himself, Jake Blackridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yet here he was, getting fucked up the was by one of the inmates he once controlled. He wanted to be angry, to show some bit of defiance and attempt to fight her off... but he couldn't. It felt wonderful getting dominated by someone so large and powerful. The scent of her cock was all he needed to know where he stood in the grand scheme of things. He was never meant to stand above anyone else. All the years spent fighting for control of others wasn't nearly as satisfying as yielding his control to someone larger and stronger than him. After all that, there was only one conclusion he could come to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was a weakling. A beta male. Nothing more than a walking hole for people like Hippo Girl and Nasty Neko to fuck at their leisure. This epiphany brought him an inner peace that he never had before and he immediately felt an immense amount of gratitude to Hippo Girl helping him discover himself. He felt obliged to do all he can to satisfy and went to work doing just that, wrapping his legs around her waist, moaning and screaming in a manner that he was certain she'd enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh~ You're perfect~ you're the perfect bitch~\" she moaned with a deliriously happy smile, drool seeping from the corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, Nasty Neko had finally began to recover from his romp with Hippo and was quick to take notice to the fun they were having in front of him. As arousing as it was to watch, he knew that it was only a matter of time before she finished and noticed that he was up and about. He began to crawl away before he noticed something. He watched as Ralph's cock remained untouched, spurting out precum as it throbbed with need. For a moment, the lustful feline felt a pang of sympathy. The poor sod had went out of his way to help him out while he was getting railed by Hippo Girl. Maybe he could return the favor...</span></div></div>",

He considered himself to be their biggest fan, and often went about collecting any sort of merchandise he could get his hands on, of the vigilantes that kept Metropolis safe.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Trouble was just around the corner for Scott, as a stretch limousine sped down the street in complete disregard for the safety of any pedestrians nearby. Sitting in the back was Brooke Armstrong, the spoiled aristocrat with a propensity for tormenting others for her own sick amusement. Her disposition was far from positive, as she had once again failed to get Jake's attention while out on at a social gathering for the city's most wealthy. Many times she attempted to pressure him into dancing with her, often while in the company of roving photographers, but he would expertly weave a narrative that excused him from her presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sting of rejection still lingered in her mind as she sat in the limo with her arms folded and her face in a permanent scowl. Her driver did his best not to make eye contact with her, as he knew of her propensity for abusing the staff whenever she was in a bad mood. Or a good mood. He could practically feel the anger radiating off of her as she looked around for something, anything to take her frustration out on. Then, without warning, her face suddenly became calm and a bright smile spread along her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jeeves, I want a pet\" she said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I beg your pardon, madam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I said I want a pet. You know, a nice cuddly little creature that will always love me\" she said with childlike optimism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah. Excellent idea, madam. You would make an excellent pet owner\" Jeeves said with a half smile. In truth, he shuddered at the thought of someone so cruel and selfish as her taking care of an animal of any kind. Even the most fearsome of predators would crumble and cower after spending five minutes within her presence. Still, he was willing to humor her if it meant that he wouldn't suffer the brunt of her unbridled aggression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Drive to the nearest pet store then. I think I'll get me a giraffe... or maybe a lion cub\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um... I don't think there are any pet stores open this time of night, madam. You needn't worry though. I will inform the staff to acquire the animal you seek first thing in the morning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a matter of seconds, the atmosphere in the car grew darker as Brooke's face soured. Jeeves sighed and mentally kicked himself for forgetting the golden rule of dealing with his employer: never tell her something that she doesn't want to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't want to wait until tomorrow. I want a pet <i>now</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Armstrong, you will get your pet. All that's required is a bit of patience\" he said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I want it now!\" she cried as her face reddened and her fists clenched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Armstrong, behavior such as this is unbecoming of one as lovely and intelligent as yourself. The nearest pet store opens at seven in the morning, which is only nine hours away. There are plenty of things you can do in the meantime that will make those hours fly by. Now, how about we get home and I prepare you a nice hot bath?\" he asked with a polite smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brooke continued to glare at him, though her expression quickly faltered. At first Jeeves thought he had gotten through to her, but that thought was undercut by the immediate tantrum that soon followed. She spoiled billionaire bawled her eyes out, kicking and stomping her feet much like she would do as a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I WANT A PET! I WANT A PET! IWANTONEIWANTONEIWANTONE!!\" she screeched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'This is why we soundproof all the vehicles' Jeeves thought to himself as he continued to drive down the empty streets. For the time being, he decided to start driving around the block in a continuous loop, waiting for Brooke to tire herself out before they arrived home. Had she returned in such a state, the other staff would surely suffer because of it. Jeeves had been with her since she was but a wee girl and as such, knew how to best placate her and curb her foul temper. That said, it was still taxing on his mind to constantly deal with it. For almost an hour he drove around in circles, patiently waiting for Brooke to calm down. Eventually his plan worked and Brooke back in her seat sobbing quietly, muttering about how the world hated her and how unfair life was. He was about to head back home when she suddenly let out a gasp and jolted from her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Stop the car!\" She ordered sternly as she stared out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jeeves screeched to a halt and followed her gaze over to the unremarkable sight of a scrawny young man walking down the street with his head hung low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There! I want that!\" she cried excitedly as she pointed at the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you mean, madam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's the pet I want!\" She explained in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jeeves stared blankly at her, unsure of what to make of the bizarre request. It wasn't uncalled for to see her single out a complete stranger to use as her plaything, but generally speaking she would always regard them as people. By the tone of her voice, it was clear that she didn't regard the young man as a person, further driven by her referring to him as \"that\". After a minute he simply shrugged and brought the limousine over to the poor boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Better him than me...\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sound of a car horn jolted Scott from his thoughts, bringing him back to reality. Somehow had been completely oblivious to the large limousine driving along beside him from the last five minutes. He wasn't given much time to thinking about it before the door swung open, revealing a full figured blonde haired girl looking at him with hungry eyes. Something about her expression made him feel uneasy, though her physical attractiveness proved to be disarming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You are SO CUTE! You wanna come home with me, little fella? Huh? I can give you a nice warm bed to sleep in and all the food you can eat~\" she cooed in an oddly affectionate manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Scott glanced around expecting to find a stray animal nearby, but saw nothing. Looking back up at the strange woman he pointed a finger at himself to make sure he was certain that he was the one being address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes you, silly! Come on out of the cold and sit with me!\" she giggled patting the seat beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His instincts told him to simply walk away and hope that the strange woman wouldn't follow, they conflicted with his raging hormones. He had spent most of his teenage years being laughed and and rejected by girls and suddenly a pretty and presumably wealthy girl pulls up in a limousine, calls him cute and invites him inside. It was a lot for him to take in at once. Eventually, the temptation became to much and he hesitantly walked up to the limo. He was barely a foot inside before the girl yanked him inside with surprising strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aren't you the cutest widdle thing~\" she cooed as she embraced him in a vice-like grip, his face being mashed against her plump breasts. After a minute of suffocating him, she pulled back and looked at him with a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll name you... Jake! And you'll be my best friend forever and ever and ever!\" she chimed before kissing him on his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Scott was somewhat taken aback by her odd behavior, though he didn't think to voice his confusion as he found a small bit of perverse enjoyment from it. He had no idea that he had signed away his humanity the moment he decided to enter the car. In his naive mind, he thought that she was nothing more than a weird eccentric with some odd kinks. He could only imagine the looks of jealousy he would receive from his peers when she dropped him off at his school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He could see it now: strutting down the halls confidently with his buxom girlfriend's arm hooked around his, dressed in the most expensive clothing line that money could afford. His fellow nerds congradulating him for his success while the jocks and bullies fell to their knees in awe of his evident superiority. In fact, he wouldn't even need to go to school. With his girlfriend's money, he wouldn't have to go to school ever again. The rest of his days would be spent in the lap of luxury, playing video games and enjoying her company. The thought of it brought a smile to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His fantasy was interrupted as his new \"girlfriend\" said...</span></div></div>",

In this place, researchers work hard to study what makes villains tick, and how to either neutralize, replicate, or weaponize their various powers. Of course, given the guidelines the researchers have to follow, gathering data can be...difficult. Informed consent is a must, even though the test subjects are all villains who have already been convicted and jailed. As such, finding willing participants can be difficult. Additionally, researchers have to ensure that their subjects are comfortable and treated humanely. That wouldn't be a problem if subjects didn't demand that researchers smell, worship, or have sex with them in order to ensure said comfort. Among the researchers in the facility, Connor's good looks, sexual openness, sensitive genitals, and even more sensitive nose make him the favorite toy of many of the subjects held within. Life can be pretty rough, and most of the time, researchers are tricked into doing things without getting what they need from their subjects. But the few bits of data they have gained have been invaluable. Especially in upgrading the police department with nonlethal Lust Bombs synthesized from Nasty Neko's pheromones!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor groaned as he sat up in his bed. From the looks of things, he'd been brought home after he'd foolishly agreed to smell Neko's socks in order to get a blood sample. Connor wasn't sure if Neko had honored the deal, as he had fainted after only a handfull of sniffs, but he was sure he'd find out. After a quick bowl of cereal and a shower, Connor donned his lab coat and headed down to the lab. The huge complex looked more like a fortress than a research lab, but how else would you build a place made to study the most dangerous individuals in the world? Especially when funded by Blackridge Inc.! Connor parked in his designated spot and hurried inside the building. Late workers were often punished by having to work in the Ancient wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped inside the building, he saw the big sign that everyone saw when they entered the complex. Said sign detailed the various categories by which villains, and the various wings where they were held, were sorted into. Researchers were routinely switched between research wings, which, while it slowed the process down significantly, was a necessity to prevent any one villain from gaining too much of a hold over a person. The test subjects in the facility were separated into the categories of Mind, Body, Nonhuman, and Ancient. Subjects in the Mind wing were the sort that used their powers to play mindgames or avoid physical contact like Goth Goddess or Waft. Body subjects were all physical combatants, those who used sheer strength, skill, or stench to overwhelm like Havoc. Nonhuman subjects were subdivided according to power as well, but this is where robots such as Skunkinator, and anthros like Skunkette were held. Finally, the Ancient wing was where the villains who'd been alive for at least two centuries were held, their immense power meant that they had to have more space and distance from other subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor ran through the facility, tripping several times as he tried to clock in before 8:00. After he reached the device and entered his employee number...</span></div></div>",

He only had one assignment today- that was either because the facility would be taking it easy on him after yesterday's incident, or because his assignment today was potentially more dangerous than usual. His assignment was in the body wing, room 122. Conor quickly gathered his bag and moved to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, he found his subject sitting on the provided cot, facing the wall. A large, stocky woman, clad completely in a black robe, with fiery red hair flowing down to her mid-back. The woman turned her head to look over her shoulder, revealing a beautiful, young face. The woman giggled as she turned around. \"You must be my slut for the day...\" Conor felt his collar tighten out of nervousness, but he kept his air of professionalism about him. \"I'm your researcher for today. My name is Conor Slate. You must be Abigail.\" He said, looking down at his clipboard. Abigail turned around to fully face him. \"I go by many names. My children call me Goddess. My enemies refer to me in hushed tones as The Destroyer. But you may call me Abigail.\" The woman stood to reveal her frightening height. She stood right around 6'8, and also appeared to have quite a bit of both fat and muscle on her. \"This program, its run by Jake Blackridge, is it not?\" She asked, stepping closer to Conor. Conor felt himself start to sweat a bit, but he managed to regain himself. Her presence was intimidating to say the least. \"Yes, Mr. Blackridge is the core sponsor of our program here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail grinned widely, almost laughing to herself a bit. \"Tell \"Mr. Blackridge\", that once I get out of here, I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna rape him, I'm gonna enslave him, and then, once I've dragged him through his own personal hell... then I'm gonna kill him.\" Abigail broke into an evil laugh, but Conor did his best to shake it off. He had tests to run!</span></div></div>",

Even with the GPS, Roan Jones pretty much had to know the layout of the city and its surrounding suburbs like the back of his hand. This wasn't the most difficult part of the job, however. Often, when they wanted to have fun, villains would actually place orders rather than resorting to theft. And once the delivery person arrived at their door, they would have a free plaything along with their order. Many delivery men, along with their vehicles, would go mysteriously missing in the middle of a delivery. The job payed wonderfully due to the lack of drivers, but you had to be pretty tough to take it on, given the risk of kidnapping and torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoan was one such tough guy. His skin was well-tanned and adorned with ink, and his face was well-scarred due to a history of street fights. He was fairly muscular, and stood at a solid 6'3\", with green eyes and long black hair. He was an intimidating figure, so he figured he could handle the job.

She slid out from her bunk, and shook some of her other \"sisters\" awake. Rebecca's sleeping cabin was shared by ten girls, ranging from ages 15 to 38. Rebecca herself was 23 years old, and had been a member of Abigail's family for the last four years. She didn't remember much of her life beforehand- Abigail's toejam conditioning made sure of that. No, the only parts of her life she could remember were the ones she spent serving Abigail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca made sure the other ladies in the cabin were up, before pulling on her clothes, slipping her clogs on, and heading out to the fields for the morning, to check the chore list for the day. The majority of followers either spent the days working the fields, or cleaning the main house of Raven Falls. Rebecca, however, was one of Abigail's personal servants, and spent most of her day directly servicing her mistress. Today, her instructions told her to report to the cellar of the main house. The cellar was where Abigail housed all of her \"new recruits\" (I.e. Prisoners who had yet to be converted), and they also were home to Abigail's Punishment Rooms, filled with various torturous mechanisms and nightmarish contraptions, that she used on misbehaving Whipping Girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, when Rebecca went down to the cellar with Mika and Georgia, two more of Abigail's personal servants, they were surprised to see Abigail already awake, and coming out of one of the rooms.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Smelly Super Villains is a story that focuses mainly on the lives of Birdboy and Catgirl, as they attempt to keep the city safe from the villainous horde that constantly bombards the city of Metropolis. While this is fun and all, it doesn't leave a lot of room for exploration, or self-insertion. Well, you all wanted it, so you're all getting it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitizens of Metropolis is an interactive story based in the SSV universe, but instead of focusing on Birdboy and Catgirl, the focus is more on the civilians, as they go about their everyday lives, and truly their best to live in a city populated by some of the most depraved, disgusting, and evil beings that have ever been dreamed up. As one could imagine, it could be rather hard to go a single day without bumping into one of the villains, and for some, the results of that meeting could be life-changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitizens is an alternative choice to the very storyline driven Smelly Super Villains. You wanna insert? You wanna skip the chapters upon chapters of story and cut right to the smut? Go for it. That's what this is here for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rules here: <br>\r\n1. This story is meant to focus more on the citizens of Metropolis, rather than Birdboy and Catgirl. Please leave them out of this story, besides maybe some occasional cameos. If you want a storyline about Birdboy and Catgirl, go read/add to Smelly Super Villains<br>\r\n2. Please, and I can not stress this enough, proper spelling and grammar are important. I will delete poor entries. <br>\r\n3. The deletion warning also goes for additions that are a mere few sentences in length. Please. At the very least, your entry should be 1000 characters. <br>\r\n4. Please only feature Villains who are already established in the canon of Smelly Super Villains. Want to add your own, brand new villain? Go add it to Smelly Super Villains and come back. Otherwise, use those already established. <br>\r\n5. You should probably have a good sense for Smelly Super Villains before you come here anyways. I mean, that's why you wanna be tortured by said Villains, right? Because you read about them, and liked them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing is really off limits here. You wanna fuck one of the Villains? Go for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet in there and smut, y'all. Have fun. Be nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd stay safe! Some of those Villains don't play fair. Especially with the civilians... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmelly Super Villains link, if you need it: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains</a></td>",
