I will make them pay for taking what was dear to me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been ten long years since you had killed your father in a call of revenge.  You remember what happend that day as if it had just trasnpired before your very eyes.  You were 7 years old, your father shunded you for your \"Demonic\" aperance so he had hid you inside of a cloak so that no one could see your \"Features\".  One  day your father after coming home from a meeting had been asked rumors about you and that you were not from this dimension.  To keep this rumor or as he would have put the truth from being found he had desided to kill you or atleast try to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said \"Son I feel as if I have been neglecting you so how bout we go fishing.\" so sincear and kind he sounded.  I was a pitiful fool back then and didn't know a trap when it was right in front of my eyes.  I foolishly followed as the good boy I was.  When we got to the lake frozen over except this one hole big enough to fit a small child in. <br>\r\n(play get out alive by three days grace) [Idea credited to Bmao who uses this real well]<br>\r\n I asked \"Daddy where are the fishing rods?\"  He pulled only one out and said \"I am the only who will be fishing tonight DEMON\"  After this he pushed me into the hole in an attempt to drown and freeze me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather had left a note on the table saying he had gone to the fishing hole with me so mother decided to bring us lunch finally happy that we were bonding.  When she had got there all hell broke lose.  She sceamed as she saw me drowning and my father laughing. She punched him for what he just did and then dove in after me.  My father cried \"NO dont its not worth it we can always try again!\" She didn't listen because no matter what she loved me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was able to bring me back up from the depts I was in but just as I surfaced the current came and swept her under. My mother died that day and I swore that my father would rot in hell for what he did to me.  Several years later when I was around thirteen years old I grabed my mothers old farming scyth and waited in the kitchen for my father.  He would feel my wrath and suffer the consequinces.  When he returned home asked \"Son why do you have your mothers old scyth?\"  My answer was  \" it just an old memory and I wanted to bring it back.\"  He just stared blankly at me as if I were mad.  I yelled at him \"YOU TOOK THE ONE THING I LOVE FROM ME!\"  I proceded to cut his head off.  He layed there head sperated from shoulder and body.  The neighbors heared and saw what had happend in which the whole town agreeded that I had to be removed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey through me out of MY HOME I will make them pay every ones house but my will be razed and burend to the grouned!  You then proced to walk into town right up to where your old house was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout out This is my Home !  after which the whole village just laughs at you. One man came up to you and said prove it.  YOu....</span></div></div>",

They were traveling top-speed in the aircraft so in about five seconds, they would reach shore. He was gonna jump:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5.4.3.2.1... NOW!\"<br>\r\nHe jumped and did a splendid dive into the water below at an altitude of 60,000 feet in the air. He hit the water with a force to kill a regular human. But Draco was no human. He was part dead so duh he couldn't die very easily.<br>\r\nHe swam the 200 feet to shore without being attacked by sharks. He was at the coast of Hawaii. Filled with sharks these waters were.

They may be dumb carnivores, but they were not so stupid as to attack a demon. even if Draco wasn't all demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The person who wrote this was King Tsi Sini I think I got that right and all credit for this chapter goes to him)</span></div></div>",
