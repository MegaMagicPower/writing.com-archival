            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being a police officer in New York was hard. Dangerous criminals and long hours, leaving little time for private life, like going out to eat or on dates.  Aya Brea finally found the time to go on a date with a charming man to the opera. Having worked herself to the bone, a night at the opera would be a splendid activity. Dressing herself in a gorgeous dress, Aya gleefully strode into the theater, amused by the glances of admiring men. She was rather slender, her demanding job kept her body well maintained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no they've already started!\" Aya could hear distant singing and rushed to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya sat her firm butt in a seat along side her date and watched the performance. It was a typical opera, people sang and acted out scenes of love and tragedy, what one would expect. It wasn't until the woman, an actress named Melissa Pearce, began singing that things got weird.  Her vocals left Aya in a bit of a daze. Ditzy, Aya focused on the singer noticing how Melissa was beautifully adorn in a fabulous dress that tightly wrapped her thin figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly people began bursting into flames. Experienced from years of being a police officer, Aya kept her cool and observed how Melissa was unfazed and continued singing. Every man combusted along with most women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh what's going on?!\" screamed a portly woman unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here!\" Aya ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portly woman rushed out of there along with several other hefty ladies. A trait that Aya tactically noted. With no one left Aya approached Melissa with gun drawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze!\" Aya commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you seem to be fine. You must be awakening.\" Melissa mysterious said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Aya nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, your fat cells are calling out. They're trying to communicate.\" Melissa spoke in a seemingly soothing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fat cells?!\" insulted, Aya than fired upon the actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa laughed as Aya's bullet proved futile. Suddenly Aya's dress felt tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening...? My body!...It's..It's getting hot!!\" Aya cried out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought.\" Melissa smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to me!?\" flying bullets accompanied Aya's shrieks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our bodies are communicating with each other. Can't you feel it?\" Melissa teased. \"Use it. Use your power. You will become like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you?\" Aya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Eve. You should know me well Aya...\" informed the actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image flashed before Aya of a chubby girl lying in a laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" Aya demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Eve disregarded her orders and ran off. Aya chased after her. The short distance was harder than usual for the officer. She was sweating and out of breathe. Her dress was feeling really tight. So tight that a tear split along her side. Aya pressed on and reached a massive hole in the ground..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya knew she had to follow Eve but a crippling hunger struck her. She decided whether she should immediately pursue or wait for backup to come perhaps with food.</span></div></div>",
