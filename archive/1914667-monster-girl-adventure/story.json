The soon you could prove those pompous ingrates wrong about you the sooner you could make them lick the mud off your boots. Wade cared all that he ever had. The tradition of the village was to make attire that instilled fear into your enemy and to use everything as a weapon. Wade Stood a stout five foot eleven. With a Black White and blood red tipped Dreaded mohawk that came down to about chest length. He Had Tanned white skin. Being the summer months he wore a black Short Sleeve shirt dyed with intrinsic patters of war from his tribe. His pants were baggy for movement but covered in straps, chains and pockets. Everything he wore served a purpose, the down side a lot of it were heavy so it required a sturdy belt. One that he was particularly fond of since it was made from Zalt's horse that he won a few years back. Wade smiled thinking back to the look on Zalt's face when he lost his horse in a bet and found out that he would slaughter his horse for food and make its hide into a belt. Wade loved the insult to injury it gave cause it was a small retribution to the hell he had lived for the past 16 years. His belt buckle was one of the few things that his mother ever gave him of value it was one of great bloodshed the executioners guild. The symbolic cross poleaxes and decapitated head in the center was renowned as people of gore, but like everything he had he made his own. Originally it was a buckle to the pack his Grandfather once wore. Now his belt buckle. His Black mud stained boots were obtained after he killed a rouge attempting to pouch on the little land he had. The boots were simple black mountain warfare boots. On his back he bore a pack he had crafted from deer and alligator hide. It bore his essentials, and finaly slung on his shoulder was his grandfathers ceremonial Executioners Poleaxe. This also was made his own after he broke the haft of the axe. The haft now fashioned together with a dragon spine. The dragon was a small one that was injured in there territory. After killing the dragon of course no dirt warrior was allowed to partake of the meat but left only the stuff no one wanted. He took the spine. \"Wont break now'' he said to himself with a wicked smile as his fingered fitted in between the vertebrae of the haft.

He refused to stop just cause the past couple of weeks had been filled with isolation. Monster always sought the same thing from them, to fullfil there sexuall urges driven by instinct. The few people had attacked him on the premises of him meaning to do them harm without further cause. They had all met the same fate. He had no desire to kill those that could not last longer than  1 minute against him. As he returned to his camp about a mile from the mountain range he was about to cross. He drops a few rabbits that he had field dressed and began to stuff one with vegitables as put a spit into the meal and placed it over the fire. The other two he would smoke for later meals. Wade was no idiot. He knew that meals would be hard to come by in the mountains and the few that were there were hard to get. As he lay back against a tree he could hear the noise of a large group traveling down the path close to his camp. He readied himself for what was to come. \"Hope for the best prepare for the worst.\" a phrase that held alot of truth to him. He smothered the fire  applied war paint and readied his axe. \"Two minutes till they get here, better find a good place to attack if it comes to that\" he thought. The land was nearly bearin near the foot of the mountains he was already drawing close to the edge of the wood line. His only option was to stay in what little consealment he had and go up in the trees. \"Top predators never look up,\" he thought with a smile.

They were in a shape similar to a wedge, good for all around fighting. The group was about 7-8 people strong all females and all younge. Wade wasn't completely sure of how big the group was less he risk being discovered. The group was heading down the path at a speed faster than any normal human could maintain. As the troop drew near the one in front called the group to a halt. Sniffing the air she began to walk towards you. Wade had never encountered this species before and knew nothing about them. The turned there attention towards your camp as the first one broke into the wood line towards your camp. \"Hmm i've never seen them before but theres only 7 of them so cant be to hard to beat them.

The group tore throught the woods from the path they had originally been on to see what there comrade had found, with the sole exception of the smaller lizard girl. \"Shes bluffing like she always does to get attention.\" yelled the girl. \"Shut up Carndra, we've found a campsite.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Years ago, before a lone succubus became the new dark lord, there was a long war. The Seven Sin Crusade is what it became called later in time. The reason for the name was because there were seven sides to the war. Six different human nations and religions against each others and the monsters. The Crusade lasted for years, until the final battle on the border. It was the moment before the new Dark Lord came to be was when the battle ended and the Border Wasteland was made.<br>\r\nSince that battle, it was decided that the Crusade would be more of a cold war. But many pacifist humans saw the war as pointless. A small group of these people, the Universal Haven League, was formed. They chose to be truly neutral with the six nations and religions imploding on civil war and the Dark Lords slow change of monsters into monster girls so that the two races could unite to create a new race to be 'taking too long'. But the League was small, made up of 20 humans and only hold small lands in the Border Wasteland.<br>\r\nThe League did grow, but with the growing power, they had to flee from their home nations that they've been citizens of for so long to keep from the treason punishment. When they all moved to their new homes, the Universal Haven League became Unihaven League. A former general in the war, Anton Tristan, was chosen to lead the people. By this time, he knew that there was no way an actual nation could come forth, so he settled on a city state. He died of old age 40 years later, when the city of Unihaven was built.<br>\r\nThe city was divided into multiple districts. But the center-most district was named Tristan in honor of the general. The city hardly expanded much to not cause conflict with the other nations. Tristan's son and successor, Robert, was adamant about this plan. But Robert wanted to keep Unihaven truly neutral, he never allowed the gates to his massive walls be allowed open for fear of attack on 'the legacy of traitors'. But 5 years into Robert's rule, famine, plague, and pestilence. So Robert did an unpopular forced labor of farmers, miners, doctors, and exterminators.<br>\r\nHowever, most of the work was wasted because of the infertile land and weak workers. This became the Unihaven Famine Crisis. Robert slowly began to lose trust in his people, and several of his associates were preparing the Brutus Coup, lead by his adviser Brutus. Robert was left no choice and decided to open the doors of the city-state and humans and monster girls (Mamono) started pouring in by the hundreds daily. But Unihaven was still adamant about neutrality.<br>\r\nRobert himself turned the numbers from hundreds to thousands when he made a passionate speech about how he got the plague himself and would die soon and his son, Daniel, would be his heir and want peace for his son and city when he's gone. Weeks later, Robert passed away. By this time, statues were made in honor of him and several others. Now the city is a site for people who want peace to live in, tourists to visit, and travelers to pass through. Since then, peace seemed easier.<br>\r\nToday, Unihaven is one of the most prosperous nations in the world. It is just as stable as the Human Nations and Monster Realm. The city is inhabited in districts by both Mamono and humans. There are districts designed for the Mamono, but don't affect humans to become an incubus. And since the opening of doors, the city has tripled in size by mostly farmland. The Border Wasteland became the Unihaven Border Farmlands. Would you like to know the Destricts?</span></div></div>",

It helped to hide her from any travelers who hunted and when she was enticing men to her liking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used her tree branches to pick Gavvin up which caused him to wakeup. He found that both his arms were entangled by the branches and couldn't move. He then gazed upon the dryad in her beauty. Hair as yellow as the sun, skin tann as a tree, and eyes green as grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello young travler.\", she spoke. \"Speak your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gavvin Wake.

I am not a hunter so please believe me when I say I come in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hunter sleeps on a tree. I will give you the benefit of the doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wish to catch my breath until I can travel again. Will you let me stay here in your care Saria? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria thought about it and looked at Gavvin. He was quite good looking and was very compassionate given the circumstances. She then agreed to watching over him except,  \"You can only rest with me on top of the tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Uh, fine but can I you release my arms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tree will still bind your body but yes I shall release them.

He felt the rush of euphoria in his body and the feeling was intoxicating. Saria intended to have sex with Gavvin and would have him permenantly connected to her tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her kiss were traces of pheromones that made Gavvin want her and make him easy prey. She broke the kiss with Gavvin breathing in the pheromones. He tried to think straight but it was too hard for him. Saria undressed herself and let Gavvin feel her breasts. He was starting to return her affection but he was reminded of why he was cautious in the first place when he tried to move his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he succumbed to her charms he would have to stay with her forever. He then took out a hidden knife and took it to Saria's neck. \"I know what your doing and refuse to be forced into marrying a dryad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me but it's just my nature. Having you here meant I could have a husband. If you wish to leave then go. But if you do want to stay with me and it's your choice, then let me make love to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavvin pulled the knife away from her neck and she awaited his choice.
