As he walked he saw something, a small place to sit and on a bench was a girl. She had short blond hair, a green jacket with buttons, a skirt and sneakers, but the most important thing was how big she was, 300 pounds at least, her belly pressing against the table and a nice decent bosom on her. Souji couldn't shake this odd feeling, like he knew her. This warranted walking towards her and greeting her. \"Urp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was eating burgers, her breakfast? There were about four wrappers that once contained burgers, scratch that five now. \"Excuse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie slowly got up and looked Souji in the eyes. \"Never seen you around here before...you new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and explained he was a transfer student. \"Ohhhh okay. Well I'm Chie and by the sounds of it we're going to be classmates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded with a bit of delight, he didn't know why but he felt something about this girl, like he knew her in a past life, and that they were close. \"Hey wanna walk with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded. \"Thanks, ever since I started packing on the pounds I haven't had the best luck with guys, except one but he'd date anything with a cup size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked to school together Souji noticed how her butt was visible because of her skirt and panties. \"I started having sudden hunger urges about a week or two ago, and I just felt like eating and eating, I'm still in shape though anyone says otherwise I'll smack em with my Kung fu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her leg and shouted like an action movie star her belly jiggling but was hard to see under her jacket. Upon reaching class Souji was rudely introduced by King Moron and Chie offered to have him sit next to her due to it being the last seat, even if her butt risked taking it at time. Lunch didn't come soon enough for the silver haired boy as he got up he saw Chie. \"Hey Souji-kun, I have a friend who didn't come cause she was working for her family I could call her and we could hang out for lunch. Then again we could rush over to my favorite place for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji pondered the offer Chie gave him. Meet Chie's friend or go with Chie to her favorite place.</span></div></div>",

Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded, and began to follow the chubby Chie towards the stairs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Well, at first. Souji was quickly able to get ahead of Chie before they were able to stairs, with his stride being a tad bit faster than his new classmate. By the time had reached the intermediate floor between the second floor and rooftop, Chie was already trying to catch her breath, her green jacket starting to get a sweat stain, making the fabric cling to her big body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo... You go o... On...\" Chie panted opening up the lunch box, taking what appeared to be yet another burger from it. \"I... I told Yukiko wh-what you looked like... And... And I'll catch up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded as he proceded up the stairs, hearing the rip of a wrapper echoing behind him, followed by a loud chewing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Souji reached the top of the stairs, opening the door to the roof to see the rain had finally dwindled down, allowing people to actually be out on this day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching his attention to the side, Souji saw a rather thin girl sitting at one of the partritions on the roof top, her long black hair held back by a red hairband. Her thin body was dressed in a red sweater and a black skirt, but Souji was able to see that she was wearing the school uniform that other girls of this school wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just like with Chie, Souji couldn't help but feel like he knew this girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Souji-san,\" the girl replied with a slight bow. \"Chie told me to look for a... Well... Your hair gave it away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji pulled a strand of his gray hair, a few times that made him stand out... But whatever, he was good with it. At least it wasn't blue hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm Amagi Yukiko,\" The girl said with a shy look on her face as she turned away. \"Um where's Chie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji explained that Chie was still on the stairs, catching her breath/eating some of her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I... I see,\" Yukiko muttered, taking in a deep breath. \"Well... We... We could still enjoy lunch while we wait for her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded, taking his own homemade lunch from under his arm, and taking a seat next to Yukiko. Just then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No more then hers and his combined! \"I-I...feel bad that Chie is alone now with her new weight, I can't stand to see her be so sad. She's the only thing keeping me going, and I don't want both of us feeling bad. I'm...not getting one anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji pondered what she meant with that but before he could question it the sounds of grunting as Chie broke her belly free of the door. \"Ahhh, HEY YUKI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chie...\" Yukiko said wondering what her friend's reaction to her extra super jumbo sized lunch was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yukiko, how did you carry that? That box looks like it weighs as much as you...\" Chie said plopping down between the two pushing them a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...was kind of hard.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm so hot!\" Chie said removing her green jacket, Souji's eyes caught a glimpse of her jiggling boobs and rolls as she put it down to let it dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...how can you still fit in that jacket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just go to a big and tall store and buy one there.\" Chie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie aren't you ashamed of how fat you are?\" Yukiko said depressed as she dug into her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko...you're eating so much to make me feel better aren't you?\" Chie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko simply ate as fast as she could, Chie feeling sorry but Souji told her that her lunch might being spoiling. \"OH RIGHT GOT TO EAT MINE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie got her large lunch out and began feasting. \"So, enjoying the town yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji stated how he just got to town yesterday and hasn't seen much. \"Well if that's the case we should be your guides! After school we'll hit up all the good food joints first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji was worried, Chie seemed like a very hungry girl, so she would probably know where to go. \"We'll start with the Chinese Diner, then hit up my favorite steak place and then we can go see about something to eat in the Junes Food court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded, he was a bit worried, how could he afford most of these places, thinking he wouldn't need it he passed his lunch to the girl who shared it before returning to their respective lunches, Souji was a bit afraid how much food these two would eat.</span></div></div>",

Mr. Morooka) spat, snapping his lesson planner shut. \"Normal lectures will start tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that Morooka said that, the school announcement jingle played on the intercom, gathering all of the students' attentions, \"Attention, all teachers! Please report to the Faculty Office for a brief staff meeting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All students must return to their classrooms and are not to leave the school until further notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Morooka spat out before he quickly opened the door. \"You heard the announcement, stay in your seats until you hear otherwise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the over-bite teacher slammed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji rubbed his chin, and immediately turned to Chie... Who was stuffing her face with what appeared to be... Meat Gum?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just made Souji turn his head towards the window, hearing sirens echoing outside. Did something happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That announcer's staying at your family's inn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't discuss such things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji blinked a few times as he turned towards the seat ahead, seeing another male student questioned Yukiko, who was wincing slightly as she held her slightly bulging stomach. Obviously that gorging session was starting to have an effect on her stomach, probably pushed herself too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the male student ran off, Chie oozed out of her desk (Getting stuck once or twice due to her large gut and behind) and walked up next to Yukiko's desk, \"Sheesh, how -smack- much longer is this -munchmunch- going to take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji noted that Chie was going a mile a minute with that Meat gum as she and Yukiko were talking, with Yukiko wincing every once in a while and Chie smacking her gum loudly, \"I heard a guy in the class next door yell something like, 'My soul mate is Yamano, the announcer!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jingle played once more, \"Attention, all students. There has been an incident inside the school district...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Souji!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from his desk, Souji blinked as both Chie and Yukiko walked up to his desk, \"I hope you didn't forget that we're going to guide you around this sleepy old town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded as he stood up from his desk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Miss Satonaka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transfer student, the plump Chie and the fattening  up Yukiko turned, seeing another male student, this one with slightly messy brown hair with a pair of headphones at his neck. Immediately, the young man lifted up a small DVD case towards Chie, \"This was really awesome. Like, the way they moved was just amazing to see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie slowly took the case as the young man gulped loudly, \"And... I'm really sorry! Please just have mercy until my next paycheck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the nervous young man began to run off as Chie opened the DVD case, immediately making her eyes widen in surprise at the sight of it, \"STOP RIGHT THERE! WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY DVD?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, Chie gave chase...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Minutes later...~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji rubbed his nose slightly, removing the tissues that he had put in after that last instance in the classroom. Never before had the silver haired teen see such small lime green panties barely cover a butt (especially one that was Chie's size) nor had he seen a guy get kicked into a wall, and get stuck into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was stronger than she looked... Souji guessed those meaty legs had more muscle than flab to them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me. You think Yukiko's cute, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji shook his head slightly, realizing that he was in the streets of Inaba, both girls to his right. Asking to repeat the question, Souji noticed the blush that crept on Yukiko's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you think Yukiko's cut, huh?\" Chie asked, jabbing her elbow into Souji's rib. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I think so, yeah.<br>\r\n-Its hard to choose which of you is cuter...<br>\r\n-...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji said the second one, taking note that Chie's face immediately turned redder (she was already sweating due to the slight heat) and Yukiko's face was as ripe as a tomato's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" Chie questioned, nearly spitting out the gum she had in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Come on, s-stop it,\" Yukiko pleaded turning her head to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji would've laughed loudly if he didn't realize that there was a large group of people gathered around a street corner, police cars and restriction tape cornering them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, what's going on over there?\" Yukiko questioned, diverting attention from the previous question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whispers of the crowd couldn't even be considered whispers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that high schooler left school early, and as she came down this street...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, who could imagine something THAT BIG would be hanging on an antenna? How the hell did it stay up there for so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing it was so huge, I was able to sneak a peak at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even with all their numbers, the police and fire department just took that FAT thing off just a moment ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its just weird seeing a dead body like that showing up! And a fat one like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie gulped... Actually swallowing her meat gum, \"D-Did she just say... A d-d-dead body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio of high school students turned to the side, seeing Dojima standing in front of them, his jacket slung over his shoulder, \"What're you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji quickly stated that he and the girls were just passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDojima sighed loudly, rubbing the back of his head, \"Yeah, that figures...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dojima could say anything else, another detective ran behind him, heading for a nearby bush...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... To describe what happened next, well, the sounds that Souji heard were quite digusting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Adachi!\" Dojima moaned with a slap to his forehead. \"How long are you going to be acting like a rookie? You're supposed to be used this stuff already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing loudly, Dojima turned back to the three teens, \"Listen, you three should head straight home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Dojima headed back to the scene... The nervous detective Adachi running after him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, when Souji heard that name... A chill ran down his spine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys...\" Chie muttered. \"Maybe we should go to Junes another time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Good idea...\" Yukiko agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then its settled...\" Chie replied with a cherubic smile. \"Well, we're off. Well neighbor, starting tomorrow, let's do our best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded, watching as the two girls began to walk off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... A murder occurred in Inaba... All of this was familiar somehow... And yet, it was different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well... Souji decided to return home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were two open desks since the girl who usually sat behind Yukiko was absent this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough out the homeroom teacher - King Moron's boring lecture, Souji couldn't help but let his eyes wander a few times around the classroom, and the new faces that greeted him - Quite the refreshing change when compared to his previous schools. One thing he noticed though was that some of the girls in the class were... Thicker than what Souji was used to seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Souji turned his attention back to the rather plump Yukiko who only sat a seat in front of him (well, it was more of a diagonal view) who was constantly trying to adjust her rather tight uniform, after all it looked like it was two sizes too small. A few times Souji would catch himself looking at Yukiko's impressive butt that pressed into the metallic seat, the meaty backside oozing in between the metallic bars, and the black skirt slid down a few times to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING! DONG! DANG! DONG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji snapped out of his daze, immediately turning his attention back to the overbite of a teacher in the front of the classroom. Apparently time flew by when you were ogling someone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... S-Souji-san?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji turned to his right, seeing Yukiko free from the constraints of her desk... Only to be constrained by the shear tightness of her red top, the buttons that were stretched by her impressive bust and stomach barely hanging on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... Are you free for lunch?\" Yukiko asked, her plumped face completely red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Souji began to sit up from his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... W-Would you mind heading to the roof?\" Yukiko asked putting her meaty arms behind her body (which was a little difficult). \"I... I have something I need to ask the main office... Something about a uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded and began to head towards the classroom doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n0-0-0-0-0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Souji to find the stairs to the roof, and it only took a few moments for him to reach the roof, shaded because of the clouded sky above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around the fenced in roof, a rather meaty smell lofted around Souji, making him blink a few times as he turned towards the right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Seeing another girl dressed in an interesting fashion of the uniform that Souji had seen the other girls wearing. This girl had light brown hair that looked to be somewhat like a bowl cut and wore a baggy green jacket with several buttons adorning the fabric. Unlike most of the other girls in the class (heck even the school), Souji noted that the girl was rather slim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SSSSSSSSSSSSSLLLUUUURRRRPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course with the way she was going through that kingsize bowl of ramen... And the fact that there were several more empty bowels of instant ramen at her feet...

You see, around a month or two ago, Yukiko's boyfriend, Keiji Hazaki, broke up with her due to he prefers petite girls when he saw that Yukiko gained 10 pounds. Sure, it broke her heart, but this Yukiko to find comfort in binging on food. However, this caused her metabolism to crash and gain more weight out of stress, not just from Keiji breaking up with her, but also from the pressure of becoming the heir to her family's Inn. So yeah, you can say that Yukiko packed on the pounds due to stress, Souji.\" Chie replied, as Souji now understood what caused Yukiko to get so plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, an idea popped into Chie's head, as she looked at Souji and said, \"Say, since you actually do like her, what do you say I hook you and Yukiko up for a date, huh?\" \"Wait, you'll do that for me?\" Souji asked, being a little surprised that Chie was going to help him,,, as Chie then answered, \"As long as you don't break Yukiko's heart like Keiji did, I'll consider you a friend.

Souji nodded while a part of him was just a tad bit curious as to what was bringing her this far out into the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course another part of his mind wondered if she was at all angry with him for indirectly spying on her, up to now she had yet to say a word about it and her demeanor was actually rather calm and collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he ultimately decided to cast the first stone and went ahead with asking what was bringing her out to Inaba?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, oh just heading down there for a bit of R and R, how about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji explained how it was due to family matters that he\u2019d be spending the next year with his uncle and younger cousin. The young lady held on to every word and smiled as she finished stating that she too would be staying with a relative, her grandmother actually. At the very least they had one little thing in common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sudden sigh however caught his attention afterwards she made a move to remove her hat\u2026but not before asking if she could ask him another quick question. Once again Souji agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, seeing as we\u2019re alone I guess its safe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind unintentionally peeked with interest wondering what the young woman was getting at. He remembered they were seemingly alone but was this girl really <b>that</b> bold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026to tell you who I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what? Come again. Having removed her hat and now sunglasses she reintroduced herself as Rise Kujikawa! Yes that Rise, or rather Risette the renowned pop idol!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was actually rather surprised when Souji was able to control himself and unlike other people not melt into a stuttering mess of a person after being introduced to her. Not to say that he was complete stoic just that rather then completely freaked out he was more puzzled and perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay so maybe it was understandable considering someone of her stature just came up to him and dropped something of a bombshell on the poor fella. So she laughed for a moment apologizing if her sudden reveal was rather heart-stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji as well apologized for being stunned into silence, admitting that he wasn\u2019t really one to be star-strucked Rise piping in that many are quite the opposite. The boy then took a moment to introduce himself to Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure to meet you, Souji-kun\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as he might Souji couldn\u2019t fight off the slight sudden blush, Rise giggling playfully at his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to change the direction of the conversation and put his embarrassment behind them he asked her about the overcoat. The temperature in town wasn\u2019t expected to be too high but she\u2019d still sweat up a storm wearing that darn thing for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this well\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

He noticed that her stomach was pooching slightly underneath the blouse, but it was barely noticeable Souji tilted his head slightly wondering if Rise was just trying to make her disguise work really well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise blushed as Souji looked at her, turning her head away, \"Is... Is it really that noticeable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Is what noticable?<br>\r\n- That gut on you? Yeah.<br>\r\n- That's a cute outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji quickly chose the third option that popped up in his head rather quickly, making Rise jump slightly in surprise, \"... Are you just trying to be nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji just said that he didn't know what he was supposed to be looking at, which made Rise's face turn red, \"You don't have to play dumb about it, I've got a gut here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate her point, Rise moved her arms over her stomach, her face getting redder by the second. Souji knew what was going on here, and he had seen how girls often stressed over their figures, and to be a pop idol it would\u2019ve been a lot worse. It was obvious that Rise was embarrassed by the small stomach she had, and not wanting to make the situation worse, Souji tried to change the subject\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Rise muttered blinking a few times at the question that Souji just asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s Inaba like? Well, I haven\u2019t really been there since I was a little kid, so I don\u2019t really remember much about the town\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, his one chance to get rid of the awkwardness of the conversation, Souji was about to say something\u2026 Until his phone began ringing, playing a weird song that Souji had found on the internet before he left. Jumping with a little surprise, Souji began to look for the phone desperately trying to find the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Rise just smiled as the cool and calm Souji freaked out at the sound of the embarrassing song. With a quick beep, Souji silenced the cell phone with a loud sigh of relief, only to realize that some giggling replaced the embarrassing song. \u201cW-Was that the theme song to Phoenix Ranger Featherman R?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji turned his head to the side, trying to cover up his blush, which just made Rise snicker a little bit more at him. That\u2019s when an exclamation point appeared over Souji\u2019s head as he turned back to Rise, asking how she knew where the song came from. Which immediately made Rise\u2019s face red as she waved her hands in front of her face, \u201cI\u2026 Um, well, you see, I just\u2026 Made a lucky guess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Souji snickered slightly, making Rise\u2019s face a little bit redder, until finally they both just laughed at each other. After a few minutes of laughing, both Souji and Rise slowly began to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji thanked that his cell phone played music\u2026 And that theme song was just one of the songs that he received every other week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their small talk conversation, Souji keeping the conversation from turning back to the small stomach Rise had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 And so, they wanted to me to be in some miko role,\u201d Rise wrapped up her story. \u201cIt was really weird though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Souji was about to say something, the intercom on the Train came to life, announcing that the train would be arriving in Inaba within the next five minutes. \u201cAw\u2026\u201d Rise moaned as she fitted her overcoat back on. \u201cAnd it was just getting good\u2026 So\u2026 Sempai\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji was a little surprised that he was getting called that, but he didn\u2019t really mind it so he allowed her to continue. \u201cC\u2026 Could I get your phone number? Well, I was thinking that since you haven\u2019t been to Yasobina before and I hardly remember anything, m-maybe we could walk around town sometime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji smiled brightly as he agreed and lifted up his cell phone to give Rise his number, \u201cThanks! And I\u2019ll give you mine as well, just don\u2019t sell it to the paparazzi later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made them both share another laugh as the train began to slow down...</span></div></div>",

It was obvious to him that the child was still getting used to the idea of having her older cousin suddenly come in and live under the same roof she shared with her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well at the very least he hoped that in the time he\u2019d spend here there be a chance for the two of them to actually bond with one another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case it was almost time for the first day at his new school to officially begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued on toward the academic building his thoughts lingered back toward the charming redhead from the day before. Rise Kujikawa more commonly known as the pop idol Risette had by pure chance boarded the same train he had and strangely the two of them had really hit it off chatting away with one another as if they were already long established friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeeting Rise was something he hadn\u2019t told a soul, not even his uncle or cousin, the redhead did seem to want to come into town and blend in without so much as a bang which Souji did find rather odd given her celebrity status he almost expected the town to throw out a huge welcome but nothing of the sort had occurred. Just another average day in the countryside and he could only assume that maybe Rise preferred it that way instead of the usual expected buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe momentarily stopped when his phone buzzed this time set on vibrate, he and Rise had shared a laugh at his current ring tone but Souji certainly didn\u2019t want to take that risk with anyone else. A text message more specifically a morning greeting and he smiled at the end after being referred to as \u201c<i>Sempai</i>\u201d he knew exactly who it was from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up and ahead a lone figure waving happily in his direction, her bright red hair shining in the morning sun. Rise decked out in the standard issue uniform for their high school shared a quick friendly hug with Souji stating she was glad she didn\u2019t have to head up to school on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t in the same grades however and for whatever reason this did seem to bother Rise just a tad but she figured he didn\u2019t need to know that\u2026at least not now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless the two continued on their way and once again breaking into conversation rather easily.</span></div></div>",

Curious the girl focused her eyesight completely on the approaching duo, their unfamiliarity making her a bit cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything else Rise apologized if they had interrupted her workout.

Had Rise really just caught a lucky break?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment he placed those thoughts aside as Chie stated that they should follow her to the school so neither of them ended up late on their first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise agreed but before she could take a step Souji quickly pulled her to one side asking what was the deal with using her actual name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2026well to be honest not a lot of people actually know it and with this wig on even if anyone gets suspicious I can just play it off that it\u2019s a common name or something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Souji could briefly make out the actual redhead\u2019s face fall for a moment before lighting right up again, what was it that made her express herself in such a way whenever it came to her idol persona?

After their new acquaintance Chie led them to the doors, she ran up the stairs saying that she had to meet someone this morning, which was somewhat perfect, since both Souji and Rise had to go to the offices anyway, in order to register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Souji was a second year student and Rise was a first, it was obvious that the two would be sent to different classes. Yet the only thing that was different was the fact that Souji was on the second floor and Rise was on the first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell\u2026 That wasn\u2019t the only difference\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo wait outside the classroom,\u201d The bucktoothed teacher with a bad comb-over barked as he looked through a planner. \u201cDon\u2019t move an inch from there and keep your trap shut till I get there, you got it?! In fact, keep your trap shut even when I get there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji couldn\u2019t help but blink a few times. He had a few teachers who were borderline mean and rude\u2026 But this guy looks like he could take that to a whole new level. But, shrugging it off for the moment, Souji exited the office and promptly headed towards his class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 The classroom wasn\u2019t that hard to find either\u2026 It was only a few feet away from the stairs on the second floor. So, watching as a few students running through the halls to their classroom, Souji merely leaned up against the wall next to the door, waiting for the overbite teacher to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich according to Souji\u2019s watch, wouldn\u2019t be for another ten minutes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Souji was about to sigh loudly, a loud crash of thunder echoed through the halls. The weatherman did say that it would rain this morning, but Souji just guessed that he and the two girls just missed it. Thankfully, he brought his umbrella if the rain would continue\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! There you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji blinked a few times as he realized the door to the classroom was opened to reveal Chie standing in the doorway with a large smirk on her face, \u201cMr. Transfer Student from the city!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking what she meant by that, Souji tilted his head slightly as Chie laughed, \u201cYou should hear the rumors buzzing about you in here. Some people are talking about the two transfer students that are transferring\u2026 One of them going in my class!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji chuckled slightly at Chie\u2019s declaration, but then realized that Chie wasn\u2019t the only one near the door to the classroom. There stood another girl who seemed to be the complete opposite of Chie herself \u2013 Long black hair held back by a red hair band, creamy skin with a calm demeanor, dressed in a red button-down sweater over the uniform\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 However, the biggest difference (excuse the pun) was the fact that she seemed to be three times Chie\u2019s size, horizontally. With a chubby, yet cute face that had the makings of a double chin, two large breasts (which Souji didn\u2019t dwell on too much, as to not be rude) that strained the uniform and red sweater, a makings of a large spare tire (which would make Rise\u2019s stomach look like a washboard stomach by comparison) and thick thighs that pushed the black skirt and leggings to the test (he could only imagine how big her behind was). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Chie gasped, completely oblivious to the fact that Souji was sizing up her friend. \u201cThis is Yukiko Amagi, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie and even the big Yukiko jumped slightly as they quickly disappeared into the classroom, closing the door quickly. Souji was confused until he realized that the same bucktoothed, balding, and rude teacher was walking towards him, \u201cDon\u2019t think about getting any ideas about getting fresh with any of the girls here! Now listen you sad sack, I hate wasting time, but I\u2019m going to have to introduce you to the class, you loser!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the teacher opened the classroom door, Souji growled loud enough for everyone in the classroom to hear\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell are you calling a loser, King Moron?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, a chorus of gasps echoed through the air as the teacher shook his fist, \u201cTHAT\u2019S IT! YOU\u2019RE ON MY SHIT LIST! EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You guys must be new in town because I'm pretty sure I've never seen you before and in a place as small as Inaba, that's saying something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji and Rise look at each other then back at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah I'm Rise and this is my friend Souji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji gives a quiet wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you two I'm Chie the best martial artist in Yasogami high, and you can quote me on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two new kids decide to take her word for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, Chie-San?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please call me Chie we're all friends here right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, well Chie what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practicing of course a martial artist has to stay fit ya' know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Chie flexes her arms, and instead of a muscle she just sends a slight jiggle through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fit?\" Rise asks totally on reflex, before bringing her hands to her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah okay maybe I'm not fit by most peoples standards but I'm still tough and flexable. and being as big as I am, I'm harder to take down, my fat just absorbs the blows like a built in airbag!\" Chie emphasises this by giving her gut a slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise is stunned, in her line of work if you were so much as a pound overweight you could be subjected to ridicule, but this girl she was so confident so accepting with how her life whent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any way judging by the uniforms you guys are on the way to school right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two slim kids nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great I'll show you the way, then later I can introduce you to my best friend Yukiko, and maybe we can show you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie drapes her large arms over Rise and Souji's shoulders and brings them in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this could be the begining of a beautiful friendship.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Souji thought he might have still been sleepy from the train ride. The girl he saw behind his uncle was rather fat, far larger than the tiny girl in the photo. Her face was quite spherical and nearing a double chin while her bulging tummy stretched out her dress close to the seams. Nervous as she looked, she gave a small wave to her cousin. Even her hand looked to be coated in a layer of chubbiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello, Souji-kun.\" Souji smiled and waved back, saying it was nice to meet her. He then heard a low growl from Nanako, who blushed and patted her stomach. \"Sorry, I'm a little hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There should be some snacks around here.\" Ryotaro gave his daughter a few yen. \"Hurry back, okay?\" Nanako nodded and waddled off to fill her tummy, bouncing all over which each step. Dojima then turned to his nephew. \"I know you have questions about Nanako's weight,\" he said as if he read Souji's mind. \"I'm not really sure what happened myself, but Nanako developed a much bigger appetite not too long ago. She'd always feel hungry even after stuffing herself full at dinner. I wasn't really sure what else to do, but since she usually cooks anyway, I let her feed herself until she started growing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji then asks if Nanako was in any danger. \"Her doctor's appointments never showed anything wrong. In any case, it's made her happier since her mom passed. She has enough to deal with since I'm always busy and she does so much around the house. Figured if she wants to spoil herself a little and fatten up, I won't stop her. Besides, I don't think she's that unusual these days. Take a look around.\" It was then that Souji finally noticed what should've been obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nanako got her snacks, Souji took a tour around Inaba and found something he didn't expect. There were an exceedingly high number of women around town who were overweight or downright fat. Primarily those who were around 35-40 or younger were all about double the weight they should've been. Any one of them who wasn't wearing a dress had her belly exposed. Schoolgirls some years below Souji's age dug into large steaks from Souzai Daigaku, popping buttons on their shirts. A couple of housewives stood around talking and laughing at some of the latest gossip. Their bellies quivered and fell even lower on their skirts. A little girl around Nanako's age ran as fast as she could to chase some boys around Tatsuhime Shrine. She didn't seem to mind that her skirt rode up enough to expose her panties as she ran. Not to mention she was somewhat winded, but still had a decent amount of energy. Souji had no idea what to make of it, especially when trying to remember what the man with the long nose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of your Social Links are on the verge of growing.\" Is this what Igor meant? Were these women all getting fatter because of his choices? Souji didn't even remember who these people were, but he felt some kind of concern when he wondered about Nanako's health. Were these women going to be okay, too? Even stranger was that it may not have been limited to just Inaba. The girl in the soda commercial, the one in the swimsuit. She was much larger than he thought. She had to weigh about 100 kg and there she was, saying she's not worrying about diets anymore. She embraces herself and drinks the soda to prove it. Was that what caused this wave of weight gain? Did it spread outside of his awareness? His mind continued to race as he returned to the Dojimas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the car, Souji thought he saw a girl in white and red by the gas station and swore he heard her muttering \"Who am I?\" She seemed to disappear as soon as Souji saw her. Nanako already started on a candy bar as Souji entered the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see her, too?\" Nanako asked her cousin. He shrugged as he didn't know what he saw. He didn't even know if she was big like the rest of Inaba. \"I wonder what she was doing?\" Nanako went back to her candy and continued eating as the trio entered the house. When she finished, she gave her belly a few gentle pats. \"That was delicious. Well, time for dinner.\"  Souji had to wonder if Nanako really had that much room so soon after eating. Her dress started riding higher as she started. Souji tried averting his eyes but caught a glimpse of white underwear as Nanako reached for a high can. His uncle had gone into the bathroom, so he walked into the kitchen to help his cousin. \"It's okay, I-I can handle it,\" she insisted. Nanako had gotten used to doing things herself and Souji was still technically a stranger in her house. It'd take some time for them both to adjust to this new situation.</span></div></div>",

You're family, so don't forget it.\" Souji nodded, thanking his uncle for his hospitality. Nanako looked more at ease and was about to dig in when a phone rang. Her face fell when she realized it was her father's cell. \"Hello? Damn it, can't Adachi--no of course he can't. Give me a few minutes.\" He reached for his coat after hanging up. \"The station needs me. I can't go into details, but apparently they can't handle it without me.\" Nanako rose and took a container out of the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of guessed this would happen.\" As it turned out, she'd thought ahead and packed some dinner for Ryotaro. He patted her head and waved goodbye. \"Dad has to work a lot. He's a detective.\" Souji asked Nanako if she ever got lonely. \"Sometimes, but I'm used to it.\" She sat down and started eating to take her mind off things. \"You should start eating before the food gets cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji expected Nanako to want to eat as much as she could after seeing how plump and happy Inaba's women were. Despite this, she never acted greedy at all. As hungry as Nanako was during dinner, seemingly reaching for endless bowls of rice and beef, she was always willing to give some helpings to her cousin. Souji had all he needed, so the little girl was free to eat until her tummy bulged even further than before. Manners weren't an issue; she ate normally and cleanly. It didn't seem like she wanted to waste a single bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pwah, I feel so full!\" Another thing Souji noticed about Nanako; she loved giving herself belly pats after eating. She really seemed proud of how much she'd grown. \"Did you like it?\" Souji nodded, thanking her for the meal. \"Dad says I do a good job with meat.\" Her mood definitely lightened since Ryotaro left for work. \"Could you pass the remote, please?\" She turned on the TV and the cousins watched a report about a city council secretary. Namatame Taro was accused of an affair with reporter Yamano Mayumi. That was about all Souji got before Nanako changed the channel. This was still enough to make his hair stand on end. He knew something seemed eerily familiar about the story. The major difference, however, were the women. Souji caught glimpses of the reporter and Namatame's wife Misuzu, both short-haired and overweight women about thirty years of age. Were they always this fat or did he somehow make this happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Verge of growing,\" Souji repeated under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Nanako brought his focus back to reality, just in time for her to sing along to a commercial about the local department store. \"Junes sounds like a great place. I want to go there with Dad as soon as possible.\" Souji had a lot on his mind, but something about the commercial felt good to him. He was interested in Junes as well, as if he'd find answers there.</span></div></div>",

I can eat more and get a little fatter every time I do.\" She stood up and wobbled a bit from being overfilled. \"There's a lot of other girls in town that like to get fat, too. All the girls in my class do it. Some of their moms have gotten really big, too.\" She spread her arms out to demonstrate, but after saying this, she sat back down. \"I think my mom would've wanted to get fat with me.\" Souji apologized for bringing up the question, feeling he brought up bad memories. \"It's okay,\" Nanako replied. She turned her attention to the quiz show that just started. \"Risechi has gotten really fat, too. There she is now, helping with the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver-haired boy saw a girl with long, brown pigtails assisting with the show's host on stage. This was the same girl in the soda commercial on the train. She wore a rather revealing outfit, a white midriff-baring shirt, suspenders and a pink plaid skirt. The latter two were strained to their limits, as was the outfit of the sole female contestant. She was an office worker that looked around twenty-five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mount Haku,\" she and Nanako answered together. Apparently the host asked about the shortest of Japan's Three Holy Mountains. The office worker jiggled with glee and was so excited she popped a button on her blouse. Risechi's energy carried the show and the audience seemed entranced by it, not caring at all about her weight. Either that, or some people seemed to enjoy it. Nanako certainly did; she danced around whenever Risechi started to move, ignoring her dress riding up and flashing her panties to Souji. He averted his eyes as best he could, though from what he did see, Nanako was a fairly graceful dancer. Her movements were like those of an adorable kitten. A well-fed kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the show was over, the worker had won the game and popped three buttons. Her belly quivered out in the open as she prepared to face Risechi in a bonus round. No one seemed to care about her wardrobe except Souji. Given this Risechi's confidence in flaunting her body and the charisma she brought in her act, Souji thought it possible that this contributed to the massive amount of weight gain amongst Inaba's females. No, not just Inaba. This looked like it spread to more parts of Japan. That woman came from Saitama and she was just as big as Inaba's ladies. The strangest thing, however, was that this girl exuded a sense of familiarity. Why did this girl feel like she'd be a good friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That office lady was really smart, right?\" Nanako was the only reason Souji never stayed in his stupors. He agreed and also complimented Nanako's efforts, having correctly guessed all the questions she attempted. \"Thanks. I watch a lot of these shows.\" That may be another reason why she'd gotten fat. Sitting around and snacking after doing chores. Doesn't quite explain how she gained so much so quickly. Same with Risechi and these other ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Souji looked around the room he was given for the year. It was a bit messy, but he wasn't tired enough to avoid cleaning. Nanako offered some help earlier on; the eating and dancing hadn't worn her out too much. When it finally did, Souji carried her down to her room. Her stomach rising and falling was one of the more fascinating sights of the evening. It pulled her dress higher and higher, so Souji pulled the hem back down to try and keep his cousin decent. He returned to his own room, finally ready to fall asleep himself. He needed it if he was going to get to school tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

He found a narrow red road below his feet, but that was the only sign anything was there. He walked for what felt like hours until the road ended at a floating red square. He hesitated, but touched the square and found his hand went through it. He moved through and more fog awaited him. However, a figure in the distance blocked the way forward. \"You've come.\" Souji was once again blinded, so his opponent remained a mystery. As did the reason he now held a katana in his hand. He raised it and struck a blow, feeling like he connected but not knowing if he did any real damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain yourself,\" Souji commanded, but he received no answer. He attacked again with the same result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth is not so easily given.\" The figure exuded a strange aura and Souji found the fog growing thicker. He tried another attack, but missed. With his vision fading, the boy's slashes became more desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" He stopped upon hearing a new voice. Somehow, he saw Nanako waddle over to him from within the fog. Her belly quivered from the excessive movement. \"I don't think fighting is the right thing to do.\" Souji dropped his katana, realizing that the figure may not truly be a threat. He was the attacker, after all. \"I don't know what they want, though. I can barely see anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, we will meet again.\" The being vanished and the cousins' eyelids started feeling heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Souji, what's...\" Nanako dropped to the ground and fell asleep, Souji following her shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Souji found Nanako at the stove with a pan of eggs frying. Once again, the hem of her dress was starting to ride up, but she either didn't notice or didn't care. At this point, Souji had felt he might have to get used to the sight of her underwear if she decided to keep wearing smaller clothes. Given that she seemed to enjoy her fat, that might be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Nanako called as her cousin sat down at the table. \"Dad left for work already, in case you were wondering.\" She sat down to a large plate of toast and eggs, ensuring her gain would continue. \"Could I ask you something?\" Souji nodded. \"I had a weird dream last night. I was walking down a foggy road and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see me?\" Nanako froze when Souji relayed his own dream. It was strange to hear that the cousins apparently shared their experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What do you think it means?\" Neither of them knew what their joint dream was, but they didn't have much time to think about it. They had to get to school soon. \"Maybe we can figure it out on the way to school. My school's on the way, so maybe we can go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just a second.\" The weather report mentioned rain, so Souji grabbed a pair of umbrellas. As they walked, Nanako made a few comments to herself, watching her stomach carefully. It was filled up from breakfast, more so than usual from what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, that might've been a little much. Anyway, does what that person say bug you? What is 'the truth'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" He didn't really have any words as they approached the Samegawa Flood Plain. \"They said we'd meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kind of scared. Is it real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. The high school's over there.\" Nanako pointed a chubby finger at a large school past some houses. Some rotund young women dressed in black crossed the gates inside. Like the little girl beside him, Souji found the hems of their skirts starting to rise. \"I'm going this way. See you at home!\" Nanako joined some other little girls that clearly had a lot to eat this morning. After walking away, her cousin had a strange idea come into his head. Could the person in the fog be fattening up these girls? And what if they're trying to make it part of something nefarious? For the time being, Souji had to clear his head and begin his year at Yasogami.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just before Souji could enter the gates of Yasogami, he heard a shout from behind him. A brown-haired boy was losing control of his yellow bike, crashing into a couple of trash bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww...\" Souji wondered whether or not to help the boy up, though he smiled up at the silver-haired youth. \"Don't worry about me. I've been in worse crashes!\" He got up slowly and walked even slower: it looked like he hurt his groin. \"I'm fine, just got to, ouch, walk it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Classroom 2-2:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few boys had been lamenting their luck. They learned their homeroom teacher would be none other than Morooka Kinshiro, or Morokin as he was well known amongst the students. Bad-tempered, quick to judge, boring as hell. The perfect package of suckiness. And Souji was about to find this out firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you, shiny!\" Souji pointed at himself, confused at the buck-toothed man's shouting. \"Yeah, you! Ya see any other silver haired punks around here?\" The boy rolled his eyes, annoyed that this guy was giving him attitude without even knowing who he was. \"You Seta Souji? I was told to look for your hair. You're in my homeroom, so listen up. Just write your name on the board and keep your trap shut when I bring you in.\" As the teacher turned around, he looked back. \"Oh yeah, and keep your eyes off the girls here. I know guys like you get that way, especially considering how they're blowing up right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the boy Souji found by the trash walked up to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Late already?\" Morooka glared at the brown-haired boy. \"At least your hair's dyed a natural color. Get in there and shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" Under his breath, however, \"Douchebag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up!\" Morooka entered after him with Souji in tow. \"I'm Morooka Kinshiro, your homeroom teacher for the next year. As long as you're in my class, you listen to me. I don't want any of you slacking off, getting any ideas about any romantic nonsense and if you're a girl-\" He stopped to stare at a rotund blond haired girl in a green jacket that was ill equipped to cover her belly button. \"Stop eating, I'm sure you've already had enough as is.\" The girl had opened her jowly mouth to eat a burger and pouted when ordered to stop. \"Now there's a new student joining us. Hopefully, he won't be a disrespectful asshole to the girls here. Not that they'd have any interest in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be the perfect person to teach me about that, sir.\" The whole class went silent as a vein popped up on Morokin's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I told you to keep your trap shut! Who do you think you are talking to me that way?\" Just then, Morooka caught a glimpse of something terrifying. Souji had a vicious look on his face in the teacher's eyes, one that crackled with electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone who doesn't take crap from other people when I don't deserve it,\" the boy said. The rest of the class just saw a defiant and extremely cool-headed student, but to Morokin, Souji's visage grew more horrible, like it wasn't even human anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-stay back!\" Morooka struck back in fear. Souji now wore a white mask, leaving only his eyes that turned gold and deadly. \"Please, don't hurt me!\" The teacher ran screaming out of the room, leaving his students confused but somewhat happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorooka had to take a leave of absence. His hallucinations didn't have an explanation yet, but he refused to teach in his current state. Souji's appearance seemed to break him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly did you do?\" The brown haired boy was enamored with Souji's \"handling\" of Morooka. He introduced himself as Hanamura Yosuke, another recent transfer from a big city. His father ran the local Junes and he helped run the store. Souji had no idea what happened, so he had no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was still pretty cool.\" The green jacketed girl bounced excitedly on her chubby heels, letting her bowl cut and stomach flow. \"Name's Satonaka Chie.\" Ironically enough, Souji had several girls' attention, all of whom threatened to crush him if they got to crowding around him to closely. Thankfully, they seemed to know their limits and kept their distance, except for Chie who looked to be the biggest of all of them. Her belly squished on Souji's desk. \"What do you think, Yukiko?\" Chie turned her head to a girl in a too small red shirt, brushing back her long. black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was certainly interesting,\" Yukiko said. She was just smaller than Chie, but from Souji's point of view, this didn't mean much. She kept her face to the side, letting the admired boy see her two chins in profile. He estimated that the two largest girls weighed around 160 kg each. \"Hey, Chie, shouldn't we head up to the roof? It's just about time for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Gotta put some fuel in the tank!\" Chie slapped her drum of a belly. \"Hey, you want to join us?\" She gave an expectant look towards Souji, who agreed. \"Awesome! Hanamura, you're coming too! You've still got a DVD to return, you know.\" Chie and Yukiko lumbered away to the door. Souji caught glimpses of both their underwear as their blubbery butts flipped their skirts. Lime green for Chie, similar to her jacket, white for Yukiko. What's more, Yukiko's stockings had a rather odd look about them, almost like they used to be whole. Once again, questions raced through Souji's mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"WHAT THE HELL, HANAMURA?\" Chie's giant cheeks flushed red from anger. Souji found out that Yosuke had borrowed one of Chie's movies on DVD and badly scratched it. Yukiko had to hold Chie back to stop her from pummeling Yosuke. Despite both girls' size, Chie was considerably stronger, so Yukiko's task wasn't easy. Souji, meanwhile, chose to harbor Yosuke, albeit somewhat reluctantly. \"I TOLD YOU TO KEEP THAT DVD SAFE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Satonaka! I couldn't help it! I'm no good riding my bike in the rain!\" He should've kept the disc in a case rather than his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, it was an accident,\" Yukiko added to calm her friend. \"Hurting him won't solve anything, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll make me FEEL BETTER, that's what it'll do!\" There didn't seem to be much reasoning with the giant blonde, but Souji stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if Yosuke gets you a new copy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can do that. I'll get you some steak, too. The good stuff!\" The boys' bargain at least piqued Chie's interest as she stopped struggling against Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Chie answered with a pout. \"But it'd better be Aiya. Their Mega Beef Bowl is on sale today. I've got to do their Rainy Day Challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure they're still going to offer it? Looks like the sky might clear up.\" Yosuke noted that the rain had let up, so there was the potential for some clearing. If that happened, Chie's challenge would likely be cancelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'd better hope it rains again. Or at least find a suitable alternative.\" Chie pulled out a couple of giant instant ramen bowls, handing now to Yukiko. \"Sorry about that, Yuki-chan. You've gotta be pretty hungry now after holding me back, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, thanks, Chie-chan.\" Yukiko set down the ramen bowl and began tying her hair back. Her headband apparently wasn't enough, though Souji was more focused on her shirt riding higher and exposing more of her prodigious belly. \"This is so I don't get food in my hair,\" she explained to the boys. \"It rarely happens, but I just want to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes her look kinda cute, right?\" Chie touted Yukiko's looks, causing the black haired girl to blush. Souji thought to himself that her cheeks could be seen much better now. Their fullness and redness combined made them quite appealing. Souji watched as they swelled with noodles, while Chie slurped alongside her. Every now and then, he could hear gurgling and bubbling, most likely the broth making its way into the girls' stomachs. He turned to Yosuke for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two have known each other since they were little kids,\" the store worker informed his fellow transfer. \"They've played together a lot, so I guess it makes sense they'd get fat together, too. Thing is, this might not be anything new to them.\" Yosuke pulled out an old photograph of the two girls when they were about Nanako's age. Little Yukiko's dress strained from trying to keep the girl's fat body inside, while little Chie pressed her belly on Yukiko's back, squishing both their fat selves. Souji knew something had definitely gone sideways with this new timeline. He was pretty sure these girls didn't grow up being this plump. \"I don't know, maybe it's a girl thing,\" Yosuke continued when asked why they had become so fat. Once again, the gluttonous girls around him interrupted his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that hit the spot!\" Chie slapped her belly with pride once she drained the last of the broth from her bowl, making it slosh around like a balloon. Yukiko gave herself much more gentle pats, but her tummy made waves just as big as Chie's. One of the buttons on Yukiko's red shirt burst off from the movement, but she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same thing happened with her tights and Chie's spandex shorts,\" Yosuke quietly said to Souji. \"I think they like it, though. Otherwise, they wouldn't let everything peek out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that was nice. Chie, let's make sure the boys try some of this next time. They'd love it.\" Yukiko showed an odd (or was it typical?) satisfaction in her engorged state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but for today, Hanamura still owes me some Aiya beef.\" The blonde's satisfaction didn't allow her to forget Yosuke's debt to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Satonaka, I'll get you your steak,\" he responded. \"We should get back downstairs, class is going to start soon.\" The girls slowly raised their bodies, huffing slightly on their way back to class. \"It's not a totally bad thing,\" Yosuke whispered to Souji. \"Remember what I said about peeking?\" The boys watched as their classmates joined several other enormous girls back to 2-2. They got a view of a veritable rainbow of panties as the girls squeezed through the doors and into their desks. Many of them were rubbing or patting full stomachs and their bodies quivered with fat, providing Souji and the other boys some interesting entertainment. Despite this, Souji's brain wasn't ready to handle all of this. It can't be this easy to just accept such a world, can it?</span></div></div>",

I think she's the one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" Some the other boys were talking about that reporter Souji heard about yesterday. He asked Yosuke and Chie what that was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Midnight Channel,\" Chie answered. \"You're supposed to turn your TV on at midnight when it's raining and your soulmate appears on screen. I want to try it, but I keep getting too sleepy.\" Chie looked tired even now, probably from so much ramen. She yawned and stretched, leading to her jacket creaking. Souji and Yosuke wondered if it was going to break open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds too strange for me,\" Yukiko chimed in. She went to try and undo her hair but Chie reached for behind to stop her. \"Hey, come on, Chie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come on! You look more adorable like that!\" The girls continued to struggle when an announcement came over the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention. All faculty please report to the staff room. All students remain in your classrooms until further notice.\" Chie and Yukiko stopped their scuffle for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think that means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got me.\" The students buzzed with speculation about what this news could possibly be. Souji felt a pit form in his stomach; he had a feeling he knew exactly what this was. The PA came back on just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention. All students are to be released immediately. The school day will be ending early. Again, all students must leave the school immediately and return home. That is all.\" Confusion ran rampant throughout Yasogami. What was so important that they all had to leave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I called Aiya and they'll still offer the beef bowl if we get there in the next ten minutes,\" Yosuke confirmed to the others. Chie licked her lips at the thought of the egg and beef melting in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man, Yukiko, am I drooling? Come on, we have to get to Aiya right now!\" Chie started running, or rather waddling, as fast as her meaty legs could carry her. Yukiko sighed and followed suit, secretly feeling she could use a few slices of beef herself. The boys kept up as best they could, astounded that the girls moved so quickly at their size. Just then, the foursome came across a throng of people gathered in a street. Many of them had worried expressions and spoke of something that filled Souji with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear how they found her?\" One of the large housewives spoke with one of her friends, who had several bulging bags of groceries in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanging from an antenna? How could that be? She was at least as big as us!\" The teens looked around, finding an ambulance and several police cars. Soul's uncle had arrived on the scene, taking notes and muttering something about death. Chie's face paled as she pieced things together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I think we just walked into a...a...muh...\" She shook, being unable to finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Dojima found his nephew and new friends standing nearby and approached them. Souji explained the dismissal to his uncle. \"This'd prompt a release, I guess. I can't really talk about it, but yes, someone died here.\" Chie suddenly fell with a thud on her cushioned bottom. Yukiko and Yosuke helped her up, but they didn't look all that strong themselves. Souji himself had an internal argument, saying this had to have happened already. The murder was all too familiar, Yamano being hung from the antenna and all. He didn't see the body, but he knew it was her. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Adachi, how many of these have you seen? You're still acting like a rookie!\" Ryotaro's shouts were directed at a younger detective with messy black hair. He'd vomited in the bushes next to his senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, boss. Doesn't get much easier for me.\" Despite his nervous demeanor, Souji also sensed a horrifying familiarity with this man. Adachi, was it? Why did he seem like he couldn't be trusted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji entered the Dojima house not long after Chie postponed the trip to Aiya. She was too freaked out from the murder scene to eat anything, but demanded they try again tomorrow. The group split up and Souji found Nanako setting up places for the two of them at home. It was obvious that Uncle Ryotaro wasn't going to be home tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the little girl said, turning on the TV. \"Did you like the high school?\" Her older cousin nodded and sat down with her. \"I hear the girls there can get so big, they can roll themselves everywhere. I want to be able to do that, too.\" Nanako seemed determined to fatten up as much as possible, and to that end, she began eating while the TV showed a picture of Yamano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The deceased has been identified as Yamano Mayumi, a 27-year-old reporter at a local television station.\" Nanako shook for a few seconds as the announcer relayed the events behind the death, as did Souji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Nanako clearly didn't have the same recall as he did, even if it was spotty. \"Dad said you were around the place they found her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sort of. Something else is on my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanako, you ever get the feeling you had something happen to you that might have already happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was starting to get fat, sometimes I'd eat food I thought I'd already eaten,\" she said. \"Is that not it? Maybe it's that dream again. I thought about it a lot at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dream is definitely familiar. But I don't remember you in it the first time.\" The cousins sat in silence until Nanako found a commercial playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyday's great at your Junes!\" She sang along with the jingle, playing her belly like a drum with each beat matching the song. Her mood lifted with her favorite store around, distracting her from the odd events. \"That's another reason I like getting fat. I can play along to the Junes song with my tummy.\" Souji ended his discussion there, not wanting to burden her with potential nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

It wouldn\u2019t do well for him to be caught slacking so early in the year, he chided himself silently.  Besides, he had something to do today. Getting up from his seat, he made his way to King Moron\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was April 25, and it was the day the art clubs began, according to Mr Moonka.

He was hoping that the one here would be just as enjoyable. *Little did he know how enjoyable it would be....*<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n20 minutes of King Moron yelling at him later, and a minute or 5 of him looking for the practice room, Souji was outside the Drama Club\u2019s door in the practice corridor.

Even if she is weighted down by her growths, I suspect that Elisabeth will still be a handful at times.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, steeling yourself for what could be to come. \u201cI am utterly sure. This is the path I will take.\u201d Igor nodded. \u201cSo be it, then.

Soon, the limo that is the Velvet Room comes to a stop. \u201cThat is strange....\u201d Igor remarks, seemingly confused. \u201cHas the fog of the future rolled in so thickly we cannot see where our futures go? Or perhaps....\u201d Igor turns his head to look out the window, and so does Margret. A sparkle of blue light catches your eye, and you look out the window as well to see a blue sparkling butterfly float by the window. \u201c....yes, something is wrong...\u201d Igor mutters gravely. \u201cIt would be best if you return to the physical world now, Souji Seta....\u201d</span></div></div>",
