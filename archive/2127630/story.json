In fact, she was on her last strike, and her parents had promised a particular nasty punishment if they caught her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, she wasn\u2019t particularly worried. Her parents were full of hot air, they\u2019d never give her <i>that</i> bad of a punishment. Or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when the lights came on and she saw the stern faces of her mother and father, she knew she was in real trouble. Her mother spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca! This is the last straw, young lady! Night after night, you\u2019ve been gone well after midnight, doing god knows what with your friends! You\u2019ve shrugged off punishment after punishment without changing your ways,  so I think it\u2019s time we tried something more unorthodox.

Her father spoke up next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly what your mother said. All bathrooms are off-limits, until we say otherwise. I\u2019m sure after a week or two of being unable to wash, nobody will want to hang out with you, after curfew or otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rebecca\u2019s punishment was finally sinking in. And it was nastier, both figuratively and literally, than she could have possibly imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, but, but what about toilets?! If I can\u2019t go into bathrooms, where am I supposed to... relieve myself?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot our problem. You should have thought about that before you continuously disobeyed us. I suppose you can go on the floor if you want, just keep it in your room. Speaking of your room, go to bed now. You\u2019ll have a lot to get used to come morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was too stunned to reply. Did her father really just suggest she turn her bedroom into her own personal toilet? And what, live in her own waste?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her feet moved by pure inertia, and before long she found herself asleep on her bed, hoping the night\u2019s events were just a bad dream.</span></div></div>",

As such, at the young age of 17, she was already a budding social activist, doing whatever she could to protest against injustice in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why she was so troubled as she read the latest article on GoReform, her favorite activism blog. According to said article, the soap industry was in bad shape. The soap they used in the US was imported from a number of third world countries, where workers produced it in hazardous conditions for just pennies a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an outrage, and Lindsay wouldn\u2019t stand for it! But what could she do to help? Hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, soap was important, but it wasn\u2019t really essential, was it? She could simply refuse to support such an abominable industry by refusing to buy or use their products. A boycott! Sure, she might smell a bit ripe after a little bit, but that would just draw attention to her cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided. Lindsay simply wouldn\u2019t wash until industry standards improved. But one person might not be enough. Hmmm..</span></div></div>",
