Everyone, even those in her house, made fun of her for her almost fever to answer ever question in class not to mention her photographic memory that allowed her to easy do her homework.  Gazing out over the edge of her copy of <i>History of Magic </i>Hermione looked at her classmates and saw Harry Potter who showed that just because you were famous that did not mean you were popular.  The scrawny boy only had about two friends the red haired bully, Ron Weasly, and the walking disaster, Neville Longbottom yet here she was without even one friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough was enough,\" she muttered to herself shutting her book and deciding if no one would befriend her on their own she would force them to.  Stuffing her book into her bag Hermione headed to the library to do some research.  It was not long before she found a potion that would help her archive her goal of getting a friend.  With a smile Hermione went to right to the common stores to gather the ingredients before brewing it now all she had to do was to find someone to test it on.  As she wondered the halls Hermione happened to look out the window and saw Harry outside alone fly on his broom after practice for that wizarding game.  A smile spreading across her face Hermione went out to \"make a friend\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the \"pitch\" Hermione saw that there was no one she used her superior magic talent to transform the potion bottle into a water bottle and called Harry down.  \"I saw you working hard out here and thought you would like something to keep your hydration up,\" Hermione said holding out the disguised potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hermione that was rather nice,\" Harry said taking the bottle and taking a large drink of the mixture.  Hermione smiled as she saw a look of surprise cross Harry's face.  \"What is this Hermione?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is just a potion to help wizards hydrate sort of like the magic equivalent of Gatorade,\" Hermione lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks I guess,\" Harry said and took another sip and winced.  Hermione smile grew larger as she saw an aura that showed the potion taking effect.  Hermione saw that the potion had the right effect that would make Harry into her friend by making him dependent on her as the potion...</span></div></div>",

According to the book she had read, the potion had the effect of taking away the drinker's greatest particular magical talent or strenth or ability. The effects would remain the drinker drank the antidote potion (which the book also gave the recipe for), but it's not like Hermione had any intentions of making the antidote for Harry. In Harry's case, Hermione suspected that the potion would take away his ability to fly. Whatever magical potential he had in other areas was being suppressed by Ron's laziness, which Harry gravitated towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if Hermione was right and the potion took awa his ability to fly, then it would also be an added bonus that it would take away the one thing he was better than her at as she didn't feel comfortable flying yet (a flaw she wanted to get rid of). In this way, Hermione would be better than him at everything and she could offer a \"helping hand\" if he would agree to be her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to test to see how Harry would do at flying, Hermione picked up his broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've had a long enough break, Harry. Why don't you start practicing again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Hermione,\" replied Harry as he reached for his broom, but...</span></div></div>",

For the next ten minutes Harry tried to summon his broom into his hand his tone becoming less and less calm until he was basically shouting at the now seeming muggle broom.  \"Oh let me try,\" Hermione said finding it harder to prevent herself from laughing as Harry almost had tears running down his face.  Shouldering Harry aside Hermione who had studied after the first broom flying class placed her hand above the broom and barely uttered the \"u\" of \"up before the broom zoomed to her hand.  \"Maybe that day in class was a flute Harry,\"Hermione said feeling the broom respond to her touch as if it was a magic wand who had just changed owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stared wide-eyed as Hermione jumped onto the broom side saddle and put it through its paces even better than Harry had been doing.  Hermione could only smile to herself at how well the potion had worked not only zapping Harry's talent of fly but adding it to her own meager skills making her better than he had ever been.  Landing as gently as a gust of air Hermione put the broom back on the ground and had Harry try again.  Having seen Hermione used his broom with such skill had filled Harry with a mixture of both anger, for the broom not working for him, but also jealousy at how easy everything seemed to come to the bushy haired muggled born witch.  With gathered determination Harry stood above his broom and ordered it up into his hand only for the broom to...</span></div></div>",

As usual Hermione weighed both options in her mind thinking if she showed up with Harry cradled in her arms everyone would see she was not to be trifled with and make it easier to get friends which would most likely include Harry whose rep would fall so fast nearly everyone would turn their backs on him.  While if she pretended to get her wand she could double back and have fun with Harry alone, as she thought of some stuff she might do to he she could not help but give his ass a forceful squeeze making Harry let out a yelp of surprise but she was too lost in thought to even notice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry had been having a relatively quiet Christmas<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Hermione telling him to read up on Nicholas Flamel, since the moment she had left the school he had not set on foot inside the library. This was his Christmas holiday, not some enforced study period and Harry was going to jolly-well relax and enjoy himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had never really had a Christmas before. Oh, the Dursleys did take part of course, not that they were all that religious. They did decorate a tree but they forbade Harry from going anywhere near it. They ate Christmas dinner although they never shared any with Harry. They watched Christmas TV shows, but they banished Harry from the room when these were on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome years, when they decided to take the easy option and keep Harry out of the occasion completely, or when they were entertaining visitors such as Aunt Marge, they locked Harry in his cupboard under the stairs and ignored him completely. There were some years when Harry had been locked in his cupboard from Christmas Eve until Boxing Day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course they never bothered to give Harry christmas presents, even though Dudley was given so many gifts that there were stacks of broken and forgotten toys in his 'second bedroom'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was, that Harry had decided to ignore Hermione's advice and allow him to enjoy his first ever real Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not as though the occasion had been completely without incident, there was the discovery of the Mirror of Erised for example, but that was an accident, he hadn't set out to go looking for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Christmas Day, Harry was delighted to receive a number of gifts, including his invisibility cloak and a top from Ron's mother. He didn't even feel guilty about receiving a gift from Hermione, even though he had ignored her completely for the last week or more. Christmas was a time for gifts, not for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day when Hermione and the other students returned to the school, Harry was sat in an armchair in the Gryffindor common room, reading a book. This was not a book on Flamel that Hermione had asked him to reasearch though, he had not bothered even looking for books of that nature. What he held in his hand was a qudditch book, and he was deeply engrossed in a historical account of one of the qudditch teams; the Chudley Canons when the portrait door opened and Hermione wandered into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since that is not a book on Flamel, what have you learned about him?\" she demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was not in the habit of having her instructions ignored. If Harry had not done as he had asked, there would be consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Hermione. Have you had a good Christmas?\" Harry initially ignored her question, sticking instead to the pleasantries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't change the subject, Harry. What can you tell me about Flamel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! You have been goofing off all this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called Christmas, Hermione. Learn to relax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax? Really!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then</span></div></div>",

Gerroff!\" Harry mutters from behind his book. <br>\r\nHermione ignored that as she sat, and snatched the book from his bands. <br>\r\n\"I'm reading that.\"<br>\r\n\"you are reading trash, Harry\" she retorted \"you should be studying Flamel, not reading some stupid sports book.\"<br>\r\n\"It's not stupid.\"<br>\r\nShe laughed out loud as she prepared to burn the book down to ashes. Controlled magical fires was one of her specialities. It was Harry's next works that encouraged  her to take another approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am on the quidditch team, Hermione. I need to study that book, digest what it says.\"<br>\r\nThis made her smile. \"Very well Harry, I'll let you digest your book.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll give me it back then?\"<br>\r\n\"You won't digest it all at one, it needs to be taken a page at a time. Bite size chunks, as they say.\"<br>\r\nShe ripped one of the pages out of the book.\"<br>\r\n\"Hermione!\" Harry exclaimed.<br>\r\nHe didn't get to say any more, as Hermione crumpled up the page and shoved it in his open mouth.\"<br>\r\n\"Eat it!\" she ordered.<br>\r\nHarry stared at her in shock. He tried to spit the page out of his mouth but Hermione clamped his mouth shut with one hand and gripped it firmly. <br>\r\nWith her other hand she pinched his nose shut. <br>\r\nHarry tried to struggle free when he suddenly found he couldn't breathe, but his struggles were futile. Hermione let him writhe for a few moments before she casually released his nose for a moment. In the time it took for Harry to get his breath back, she had taken control of one of his hands, then the other and trapped them under her knees. She then grasped his nose once more, knowing that Harry was completely immobile beneath her.<br>\r\n\"I'll let you breathe again once you have swallowed that page.\" she advised him.<br>\r\nRealising he had no choice, Harry started to chew on the paper in his mouth, then he swallowed.<br>\r\nHermione opened his mouth at that point, and looked inside. The page was gone.<br>\r\nShe wasted no time in tearing another page and forcing it into his mouth. This time she gave him a choice.<br>\r\n\"You can eat that paper now, or I'll continue to smother you\" she informed him. Harry wasted no time in chewing up and swallowing that page too.<br>\r\nPage after page was ripped out of the book and fed to Harry until there were no pages. At this point, Hermione fed him the cover too.<br>\r\n\"There you go, Harry\" Hermione giggled \"now you can digest the entire book and you won't ever need to read it again.\"<br>\r\nHarry groaned. \"I.. also... have... to... learn... that... stuff...\" he spoke slowly as though to a small child. <br>\r\n\"No, Harry. You don't.\"<br>\r\n\"I... am.... on.... the.... team.\"<br>\r\nYou were on the team.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Harry resumed his normal voice, although his tone was becoming resentful.<br>\r\n\"You have been ignoring your studies, Harry.\" she reminded him \"one word to McGonagall and you'll be off the team before you can say 'bludger' \"<br>\r\n\"You are going to tell McGonagall that we are studying Flamel.\"<br>\r\n\"I have been studying, you were goofing off. No, Harry, I do't need to tell her what we were meant to study, only that you have been shirking your responsibility.\"<br>\r\n\"I have been studying my school work?\"<br>\r\n\"Have you really? The last time I checked, you and Ron were both asking me to help you with your homework. I'd wager you have been failing your school work as well, or at least not been as studious as you should have been.\"<br>\r\n\"I am not a know it all like you, I have learned a few things.\"<br>\r\n\"Have you really, Harry?\"</span></div></div>",

She looked at Harry, \"What do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Professor, I'm on the Quidditch team, I need to read that sort of thing. I've been keeping up with my studies - I can do plenty of magic!\" Harry replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall rose an eyebrow, \"Well, we'll see about that.\" She took out her wand, and conjured a wooden box. \"Levitate this box, please. It shouldn't be too heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled; this he knew he could do. He took out his wand, aimed it at the box and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa,\" He felt the tingle of magic being released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then his trousers and his boxer shorts disappeared, leaving him naked from the waist down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall was not amused. \"Mr. Potter!\" She said, looking straight at his withering cock, which was no more than two inches long, \"You have exposed yourself most disgracefully! It is shameful to yourself, and your house. Stop trying to cover up!\" She waved her wand, and Harry's hands were by his sides and would not move towards his genitals, no matter how much he strained. \"If you want to expose yourself, you'll expose yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the semi-hard boy, Hermione smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" Said McGonagall, \"Calls for punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she punish Harry?</span></div></div>",

She sat on it, her green robes shimmering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bend over my knee, Mr. Potter\" Ordered McGonagall, she seemed slightly less angry than before, though no less strict, and humour was in her dark blue eyes as she watched Harry's little penis sway as he moved toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked on eagerly as Harry draped himself over his teacher's knee, exposing the curve of his backside to her. With a deft hand, Professor McGonagall pulled his small testicles back, her cool hand making him gasp and writhe, so that they stuck out of his silhouette. Hermione almost laughed at the sight of the smooth, hairless balls so vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, on the other hand was in tears; he could feel his lower half, so soft and small, rubbing against McGonagall's dress, and he knew that his friend and his teacher could see his testicles and every inch of his bottom. He was, however, holding back his tears; the Dursley's had hardened him to hardship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Potter,\" Said McGonagall, \"You will count each slap after it happens,\" She then raised her hand and brought it down firmly on his backside. Harry jumped, embarrassed partially by the stinging pain, but mostly by the noise. Her hand made a solid, meaty sound as it hit his bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One,\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Replied the Professor, \"Just so you know, I'm taking you off the Quidditch team - we can't have little perverts playing Quidditch for Gryffindor.  I'm also confiscating your broom. You won't be needing it, and First Years aren't supposed to have brooms anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry would've protested, if she'd not slapped him again. He cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two,\" He said eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother came down sharply and it drove him into his thighs. It was then that he realised, with renewed embarrassment, that his penis was between Professor McGonagall's thighs, and each strike was hardening his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three,\" He squeaked,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall raised her hand, but looked toward Hermione, \"How are you Ms. Granger? I never got the chance to ask. seeing as I had to deal with this little exhibitionist here,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's face burned all the way down to his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled, \"It's been great. Professor! I've been so excited to learn all about magic, and I'm glad to get the chance!\" She looked down at Harry, half naked, bent over his teacher's knee, his bottom red and his balls exposed, \"Though I suppose managing Harry has been a pain,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall glared down at the boy, \"Yes. Well talk about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spanked him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four,\" Said Harry. His testicles jiggled as her hand came down, and Harry's ears burned with humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall looked on, amusement behind her strict personal. She slapped his bum again, this time harder. It drove Harry down into her thighs, and this time Professor McGonagall felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potter, you pervert,\" She said, \"Ms. Granger, do you know what Mr. Potter has just done? He has humped my thigh with his shameful erection.\" McGonagall reached down and fondled his balls, rolling them between her fingers, \"Is that how I boy is supposed to react to a spanking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there was a knock on the door.</span></div></div>",

Penelope was attractive, with long yellow hair the colour of straw and clear blue eyes. Her blue eyes widened as she saw his nakedness draped over Professor McGonagall's knee, and she almost forgot to close the door, but then she giggled and recovered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt himself shake with humiliation. Silently, McGonagall firmly grasped his exposed balls and squeezed. He stopped shaking, and she stopped squeezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ms. Clearwater,\" Said the Professor. Then her hand came down on his bottom, \"Is there anything I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six,\" Harry muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearwater smiled beautifically, her eyes never leaving the curve of Harry's behind, \"I just wanted to ask you about yesterday's Transfiguration homework, Professor, but I can see that you're... Busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not at all!\" Replied McGonagall, \"Ignore the pervert,\" She spanked him again, and Harry dutifully counted 'seven'. \"What was it you were wondering about Ms. Clearwater?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Clearwater, still looking at Harry. The sixth year then jumped in to a very technical description of a Transfiguration law, one which Harry did not understand, and which was punctuated by the slap slap slap of hand meeting naked bottom. McGonagall interrupted, politely, occasionally,  so as to correct Clearwater's mistakes, which were few, and very minor, as Professor McGonagall was clear in outlining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione listened in politely, though her eyes did not leave the half-naked Harry Potter on Professor McGonagall's knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the spanking drove Harry into McGonagall's thighs, shiny with the green robe, and by the twenty-eighth spank Harry felt hot. He was sweating greatly, humping the Professor's thighs with every slap, and there was a tingling in his testicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty nine,\" He said, humiliation washing over him again. It only made him hotter. They were still almost ignoring my him, still talking about Transfiguration, whilst Harry was almost spent in McGonagall's lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned lowly; one more might do it. One more might make him release.</span></div></div>",

Once, twice, three times his little penis speared forward and backward.

Harry blushed as he locked eyes with Hermione, \"Pl... Please don't look!\" He cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Professor McGonagall slapped him lightly, but firmly, on the balls, \"I suggest you cease your protestations at once, young man; no amount of whining will change your punishment,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in full sight of Hermione and Penelope, she took ahold of his soft cock and began to stroke it. Up and down her hand shuttled, in fast, small movements, and in her lap Harry began to cry and writhe, \"Noooooo! He begged, \"It hurts! It hurts! Please stop! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione and Penelope looked on enthralled as, despite the boy's weakly flailing limbs and cries of dislike, his small penis began to grow rigid again beneath their Professor's firm hand. It stood up from his body, red and slight and, for the first time, the two female students could observe it completely; with each stroke of McGonagall's hand, she pulled back the skin to reveal the small and vulnerable head of the pervert's penis. From there, pre-cum was already leaking, regardless of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd below his little stalk, Harry's testicles, smooth and hairless and bigger in proportion to his cock, bounced with Professor McGonagall's short manipulations; already, Harry was humping into her hand, though he still cried out otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... Why is he crying out?\" Hermione asked, staring, as ever, at her friend's short penis, \"Surely, he should enjoy this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he's over-stimulated,\" The Professor explained, \"His dirty little penis can't take more than one ejaculation in so much time. It's normal for boys,\" Then she trailed her free hand up Harry's taut, pale stomach and began to rub his Nipple; soon she was pinching it, twisting the hardened nub, and Harry wailed and bucked to feel the bizarre pleasure, \"What is abnormal,\" McGonagall continued, ignoring the pervert's outbursts, \"Is his response to the stimulation; he is engrossed by masochistic pleasure. Pain is being inflicted to his genitalia as much as pleasure, yet he's eagerly thrusting into my hand,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope observed the pervert's face, watching the unthinking arousal manifest by way of a drooling mouth and those beautiful green eyes made bleakly, glassy. Still, she saw that he still recognised her; perhaps, she thought, the pain kept him cognizant. The sight stirred something aside her, and, as she trailed her eyes down to his slight chest, she let that feeling fill her up, \"Why are you rubbing his nipple?\" She asked, watching the pervert shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall looked down at her manipulations, her stern eyes turned dominating, \"Some naughty boys find pleasure not only in their penises, but in their nipples too,\" She pulled Harry's nipple hard, happy to hear the boy cry out, \"And some enjoy stimulating their little bottoms,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope bit her lip, and Hermione's brown eyes lit up to hear this. Meanwhile, Harry had suddenly gone limp and his breaths came in fast gulps; his exposed chest rose and fell quickly, exposing his ribs every few moments. McGonagall's hand became a blur, \"Watch closely,\" She said, \"This little pervert is about to ejaculate again,\"</span></div></div>",

Harry could not help himself but turn and look at them; both were looking straight at his cock hanging down, completely ignoring his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be anymore than three and a half inches,\" Said Clearwater, blue eyes alight, \"Who knew the Boy-Who-Lived had such a small penis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unfortunate for Harry, that as he was reeling from this cruel comment, his penis throbbed and twitched and released a white strand of pre-cum that trailed all the way down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew,\" Said Clearwater, \"He's... Leaking,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall looked down and said, \"Naughty boy! This was a punishment! I let you off earlier out of kindness for your parent's memory, but now you act so lewdly in front of your fellow students?\" She punctuated this with a slap on his reddened bottom, and a harsh squeeze of his exposed balls, \"Get up! Get up and get on all-fours on my desk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Professor!\" Harry replied quickly, practically instinctually, \"I-,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! The more you argue, the worse this will be for you. Take your punishment like a good boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pre-cum began to drip through Penelope's silky hand and onto the oaken desk, leaving an amusing puddle on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are you here?\" Said Penelope, slowing down her manipulations.

Harry is also too much of a celebrity, we need a real player to take his place.

Let it be known that only girls need apply. The final decision is mine of course, so I can guarantee that the next seeker will be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Potter\" McGonagall added \"you are also banned from the quiidditch pitch, and that includes that stands.

Potter, I am just getting started \"that is your punishment for choosing quidditch over your studies. There is a far more serious matter that needs addressing. She glanced one at Harry's exposed genitals then looked away. \"That will never do. Miss Granger, would you please attend to that tadpole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly\" Hermione sniggered. She grabbed Harry roughly and threw him against the wall. She immediately raised her knee and drove it swiftly into Harry's exposed tiny penis once, twice ,three, four, five times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry fell to the floor, writhing in sudden agony. He would be clutching at his damaged organ if his arms were not still pinned to his sides.

It did stop him rolling back and forth though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he a comfortable seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" Hermione smiled \"but I must confess that I knew that already. I sat on him and made him eat his own quidditch book when I found out that he had been goofing off over Christmas\" She felt that the professor was coming around to her way of thinking, she certainly didn't object to anything she was doing to him. In fact the woman seemed almost to be suggesting it first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor actually laughed at that, and Hermione was pleased to see that her opinion of her head of house appeared to be correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fant, I'd say he is a far better seat than he is a wizard, or a boy.\" She added, offering another implied suggestion.

I recall you telling me that they would murder you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said they wouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said they might not. I can't presume to speak for them. Would you murder Potter, Hermione?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, professor. I intend to keep him alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, Potter. The possibility of death with the Dursleys or the guarantee of life with Miss Granger. Which is your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione\" Harry muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Hermione replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose you.

You now belong to Miss Granger for the rest of her time at Hogwarts, and all decisions regarding your treatment are hers and hers alone. I shall inform the rest of the staff of this new arrangement. Miss Granger. You may be assured that if any member of staff tried to punish your for anything you do to Harry, I will know about it and I will reverse the decision immediately. If a staff member tries to come between you and Harry or punish you for anything you do, they will be fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I am no longer a student?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is no longer the responsibility of any of the professors to teach you, Potter. That is unless Miss Granger wishes it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Professor, I do not. From now on Harry is not allowed to study any form of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So noted\" McGonagall nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I involve other girls in my plans for Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they have your authority then they will have the same protection. The final authority however will always be yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, as Potter should be allowed to stay with you at all times, I shall reverse the charm which keeps boys out of the girls dorms in his case, and his alone. The charm will now prevent Harry from ascending the boys' staircase, but he may freely walk up to the girls' dorms unimpeded. This change will be effective by the time you return to Gryffindor tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor\" Hermione nodded, liking the fact that she could dominate Harry in her dorm now as well as the rest of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One other thing\" McGonogall added \"please remain seated whilst I get my camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled as McGonagall opened one of her desk drawers and took out a wizarding camera. <br>\r\n\"Smile she advised\" and Hermione smiled whilst her and Harry's picture was taken, with Hermione still sitting on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have this framed and hung on the wall\" McGonagall laughed \"there is also a spell which will enchant the picture so I can use it to see everything you and Potter are doing. I said I would know immediately, this is how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione laughed at that\"  I hope I entertain you, she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure I will.

From what Hermione and Luna were doing, there was also no possible means for him to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender looked down and laughed as Harry's face started to turn red. \"If you want to breathe, Harry then you need to get to work with your tongue\" she advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harry didn't understand at first, Hermione explained further. \"Start licking Harry, taste of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed and stuck out his tongue, letting it enter Lavender's most intimate area. <br>\r\n\"That's right, Harry, start licking\" Lavender advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did so, getting his first ever taste of a girl's inner juices. \"That's right Harry, like that\" she purred, rewarding him by allowing him to draw a couple of breaths. By now, Hermione had withdrawn her hand, and Lavender controlled the position of Harry's head with her thighs, suffocating him but still allowing him to draw enough air to remain conscious whilst he worked on her with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deeper, Harry, go in deeper, probe my inner depths with your tongue.\" Again, she smothered him with her pussy, only allowing him to breathe when he complied with her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's tongue found her clitoris, and Lavender let out a deep sigh. \"Yes, Harry. Right there, Don't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry continued to work on her with his tongue, he was surprised to find that the taste was not unpleasant at all. He actually started to enjoy himself whilst he worked on her with his tongue but not as much as Lavender was loving the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself building up to a climax, a torrent of need and desire and she would not be satisfied until Harry had fulfilled that desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the orgasm came, Lavender gripped Harry's head so firmly against her pussy that Harry though that his skull might crack under the pressure. A torrent of her inner juices squirted forward hit hit Harry squarely in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Harry\" Lavender breathed at last, not releasing Harry's head until the last vestiges of her orgasm had subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Harry had been servicing Lavender, Hermione had pulled down her own painties, and once her friend released him, Hermione grabbed his face and pulled him towards her own waiting womanhood. \"My turn now\" she told him, looking down into his now-glistening face \"Ooh,Lavender, you've really soaked him\" she laughed, not bothering to clean him up before pulling Harry's face into her own snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what to do now, Harry\" she advised \"so do it. I won't be satisifed with less than three orgasms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lavender had done, Hermione gripped Harry's face between her thighs as she pressed his face against her crotch.<br>\r\nAs she squeezed him, Harry was given a demonstration of the strength of Hermione's thighs. Whist he thought Lavender might crush his skill between her legs, Hermione left him with no doubt that she could do precisely that if she wished as she held him in place firmly between her perfect thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry extended his tongue once more, he immediately discovered that Hermione's pussy was even tighter, he had very little room to maneuver as he started to lap at her inner folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lavender had done, Hermione continued to control his breathing as she forced him to eat her out, demanding the three orgasms she had requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry continued to work on her with his tongue, knowing now what was going to happen, not once but three times. His tongue probed deeply, finding her clit and focusing his work there; he did not want to displease his former best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Harry. Just like that\" Hemrione complimented him as he worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first orgasm came after just a few minutes, but Hermione did not let Harry slow down his ministrations as it hit, she demanded that he keep working, and so a quantity of her juices sprayed onto his tongue and found their way into his mouth as he worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for Hermione to build up to her second orgasm, and she would not allow Harry to slow up at all. Every time he tried to slacken his efforts, her thighs would grip his head, and force it so firmly against his opening that he could not hope to get any air at all. She would smother him like that for some time before she relaxed and ordered him to get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the second orgasm hit, even more violently than the first, and Harry felt the torrent hit him as his face was once more lathered with her pussy juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen, finally her third orgasm came, that was even more powerful. Just before it came, Hermione felt her pussy tense up in preparation, and she encouraged that along. With Harry's tongue deep inside her, probing at her clit, she bore down hard, holding his tongue in the vice-like grip of her inner folds, and squeezing it firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt the force of her grip immediately, his tongue felt like it was being squeezed in a mangol, he could not hope to move it at all, Did he still have a tongue at this point or was it being utterly crushed and pulverised?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the stream flowed once again, hitting him hard in the face and blinding him for a moment. All this time, her grip on his tongue never lessened; in fact it seemed to increase even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Hermione finally released him from her womanly prison and looked down at his face, which was a sodden mess at this point. \"Thank you, Harry\" she complimented him on his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, by this time was certain that his tongue had been utterly destroyed. It felt strange, severely squished and misshapen. He doubted he would ever be able to talk again after what Hermione had done to it, and the taste of both girls, he could still taste both of their juices in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should at least clean him up\" Lavender advised \"we don't want Harry to go around with his face covered the way it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True\" Hermione smiled. She produced a cup from somewhere, and using her wand she produced a cup from somewhere and transferred their combined secretions from his face into the cup before offering it to ihm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink it all up, Harry\" she advised \"you've been tasting us anyway, so you might as well finish the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed and drank from the cup, one sip at a time and as he drank he was reminded constantly of the fact that a few minutes ago he had his tongue inside both girls, licking up the exact same substance. Hermione waited for him to finish the drink, which he did eventually and then she used her wand once again to clean any remaining stains from the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done Harry\" Lavender added her own compliment \"next time, I might even sit on your face whilst you are working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione laughed at that as both girls pulled their panties up once again and sat in their seats.</span></div></div>",

She tapped her chest for a moment, felling Harry's wand still buried there. No, there was no reason for Harry to learn anything, ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Harry was now almost at the point of collapse under her perfect backside, she decided to help him along in another way. Of course she would punish him for it, make out that it was his fault.

He was still laid on the floor, his hands broken but Hermione didn't move him very far. She simply pulled him across so he was resting before the next seat across from where she had been sitting on him previously, and lifted his head onto the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could feel his head being lifted until it came to rest on a soft surface.

She started to rock back and forth on his face, gently at first as though she was just shuffling in her seat but in reality she was grinding herself against him, After a few minutes she quickened the pace a little; not too much though as she didn't want to attract any more attention from the librarian. A small amount of her juices dripped from her young pussy and into Harry's mouth and this pleased Hermione even more. Now he would be forced to taste of her whilst she continued to own his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's face was still buried deeply under and within her perfect ass, He was surrounded by and encased in her butt flesh which held his face firmly in her womanly grip as she remained seated firmly upon him. She felt his nose between her butt cheeks and she quietly giggled to herself as she clenched her anal sphincter, wriggled back and forth and bore down heavily on the face buried beneath her. The crunching sound as his nose shattered in the grip of her backside was most pleasing to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry would have screamed in pain at that point, but Hermione quickly ground her pussy against Harry's mouth, cutting off his airway and preventing any sound from escaping his lips. She maintained that position for some time, forcing him to smother in her womanly embrace until she was sure that no further outcry was likely to escape his lips. It wasn't until Harry was on the verge of unconsciousness that she relented and allowed him to draw in some much needed breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his nose gone, Hermione's next wriggles ground Harry's face even more firmly into her butt Harry could no longer breathe through his nose, so was forced to keep his mouth open slightly in order to draw in the much-needed air, as he did so it seemed that his every breath tasted of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A short while later, the librarian levitate a large stack of books from her desk and carry them off to some distant shelves.

His lips were still pressed against her pussy and now and again Hermione rocked back and forth, sending shockwaves of pleasure through her most sensitive parts. Her skirt remained pooled around him, hiding Harry from the view of anyone who might be in the vicinity and keeping him in total darkness under her. There was nobody else nearby though; at least not at the nearest tables which were deserted. If she didn't cry out too loudly, she was sure she could do whatever she wanted to Harry and nobody would notice. There was never a better time to take full advantage of the boy beneath her perfect ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered forcing to give her oral under there, but decided against it. She didn't want Harry to do any of the work. Harry was a lazy boy who never did anything asked of him, he had demonstrated that already and she didn't want him to mess up the act of pleasuring her as well. NO! What she wanted from him she would take her herself, and she would bask in her complete ownership of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst keeping his face planted firmly under and within her butt flesh, she started to grind her pussy against his lips with even more force; squeezing, caressing and compressing him within her folds as she worked. She also managed to cast a couple of spells with her wand which she knew would give Harry the full benefit of her vaginal secretions then they inevitably struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped fondling his genitals with her feet and lifted them off of him as she rocked back and forth upon him, She rocked back and forth upon his face; steadily at first then faster, faster. As she came forward, her pussy sealed his mouth shut, cutting off his air supply again, but coming back he found he could take the occasional breath of life-giving air. So it was that Harry was forced to time his breathing with the rhythm of Hermione's thrusts if he didn't want to suffocate under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, Hermione was riding his face hard. seemingly caring nothing for Harry's comfort or even his life, and concentrating entirely on her own carnal desires. She pounded his face repeatedly with all her strenghth. The harder she rode him, the more pleasure she derived. The lust built within her to a crescendo; a lust that needed to be satisfied, needed release. She would not be fulfilled until she had ridden Harry's face to orgasm once, twice, or however many times she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's face was hers now, and her anointment of him was only a matter of time and sheer feminine lust. Her pussy's ownership was relentless. She ground, she pounded and crushed his face under her pussy over and over again. She never eased off at all but only increased the force as her pussy continued to work upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before her orgasm struck, Hermione's pussy was already dripping onto the boy beneath her, coating his mouth and lips with her juices and there it stayed. As it stuck to him, not even a drop was able to drip down to the chair or onto the floor. One of the spells she had cast meant that her cum seemed to stick to Harry's face wherever it touched, so firmly that it would never wash off. Hermione's body and clothes however would not allow any of it to stick to her, even though she was sitting firmly upon him her own body and her clothes would remain clean. Harry and only Harry would be stained by her cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow and again she would shift her position slightly, directing her flow so that it soaked the whole of Harry's face whilst still seeming to sit fully upon him and keep him buried under her skirt. She knew that she could sit as forcefully as she wanted on his increasingly lathered face and none of it would rub off onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her first orgasm hit, she again directed her flow so that she would wash his entire face in it. She followed that up with a second orgasm and then a third; each one more intense than the last. By the time she was spent, and it took quite a while before she was completely satisfied, she wondered if any of Harry's face would be recognisable under the pussy juices which now covered it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally spent, she waved her wand once more and her juices soaked into his flesh, giving his face a creamy complexion and forever marking him as her own.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Actually he was still wedged in by her butt flesh that had claimed his face as its own and was refusing to release him. She chuckled softly to herself, as with a fair amount of force she prised him out of her butt cheeks. She could easily put him back later of course, but for right now she wanted to take him back to the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Harry was free of her backside, he dropped to the floor, out cold; or as cold as it could be considering the warm butt flesh that had encased him for the last couple of hours. Whether from the force of her body's exertions upon him or the fact that he had been suffocating whilst she was in the throes of multiple orgasms on his face, Harry had passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly checked his pulse. It was still strong. Harry was unconscious, but alive. <br>\r\nThis pleased her, she had plans for Harry that rather required him to still be alive to experience them. If she had wanted him dead, she could have easily smothered him out completely whilst he rested in the confines of her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled up her panties, she took a look at his face and she smiled once more. He was as white as a sheet. His face had so completely absorbed her pussy juices that they had stained his flesh a creamy white colour. Even his famous lightning bold scare seemed to disappear under all that whiteness and of course without his glasses she doubted that anyone would recognise him at all. The glasses were a crumpled ball of twisted frame in her own pocket; the glass gone from them and his wand was still hidden under her top;resting between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched his face for a moment, it didn't feel any different; it still felt like his regular face  She slapped it, not has hard as she would if he were awake and she didn't want to wake him just yet. It was definitely the same face, only much more creamy in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left him there for a moment whilst she took her books back to the counter, then she grabbed him under his right arm and dragged him to his feet. He couldn't stand on his own as he was still unconscious so his feet dragged along the ground as she carried him out of the library and led him back to the Gryffindor common room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did wonder what would happen if they met anyone, but as it turned out nobody crossed their path as Hermione pulled Harry along corridors and up and down staircases, finally arriving at the portrait of the fat lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portrait asked for the password, which Hermione gave and as the portrait hole opened she dragged Harry through, and into the common room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Hermione quickly pulled Harry into the common room, she quickly saw that it was as empty as the corridors had seemed. <br>\r\nShe did wonder where everyone else was, but she wasn't all that fussed as this gave her the opportunity to keep Harry to herself for now.<br>\r\nShe dragged Harry over to the nearest seat, and lowered him into it, in a posiition that made it look like he had merely fallen asleep in his chair. <br>\r\nShe considered turning around and sitting down on him immediately, but she felt she should attend to a few small matters first. For one thing, Harry had not yet lost his place on the quidditch team.<br>\r\nShe hit him with a stunner to make sure he would not wake up in a hurry, then she headed upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe firstly went to her own dorm, took out quill and parchment, and wrote a note for the attention of Oliver Wood. Hermione had seen Harry's untidy handwriting often enough, and she was skilled with her quill. She perfectly matched both his handwriting and his signature as she wrote the letter offering Harry's resignation from the team. The letter was brief for it did not need ot be long but she did add a few insults directed at not only Oliver but also the rest of the team, and berating the sport in general. She drew on Harry's muggle upbringing to make it sound as though Harry felt nothing but contempt for non-muggle games. She even managed to offer some scathing insults against Angelina, Alecia and Katie, even suggesting that girls were took weak to play sports. She had nothing against the girls herself but if any of them read that note, it would surely offend them and if they turned on Harry, all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe folded the resignation letter, wrote Oliver's name on the back in Harry's handwriting and took over to the fifth year boys' dorm where she dropped it onto the quidditch captain's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she wet back to the first year boys dorm, found Harry's trunk and opened it. She quickly located his Nimbus 2000 broom and removed it. She also found a strange looking cloak which she hadn't seen Harry wearing before along with a note from Dumbledore which explained that the cloak had belonged to Harry's father. She almost ripped the cloak to shreds in her hands but for some reason she decided to try it on instead, and that was how she discovered the cloak's true purpose. She decided to keep it instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed and locked Harry's trunk with a spell, knowing that without a wand Harry would be unable to open it. She then went back to her own dorm for a moment, stuffed his wand and his broom in an empty drawer in her bedside table and magically locked it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she put the cloak back on, she decided to strip off her regular clothes. If the cloak made her invisible, it did not matter if she was naked beneath it, in fact it would bring herself and Harry closer together. Modesty wasn't an issue if nobody was even going to notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was totally nude, she then put on the invisibility cloak and disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was humming softly to herself as she went back down to the common room and saw the sleeping Harry still alone in his chair. With deliberate purpose she approached him and as she did she canceled the stunner she had cast earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed Harry was slumped in his chair, so she pulled him into a more natural seated position before, still hidden in the invisibility cloak she turned around and sat back down, settling her full weight upon him and quite intentionally crushing him under her perfect backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she remained, seated upon him once more, waiting for him to wake up.<br>\r\nA few minutes later he started to come around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he was surprised to find himself back in the common room, in one of the seats apparently and he felt this somehow-familiar force seeming to hold him there. There was a weight pressing down upon him, keeping him in his seat and yet he didn't see anyone. The weight was there though, also a warmth and a warm fragrance that reminded him of Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get up, but somehow this phantom weight was holding him down, keeping him in the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are awake\" her familiar voice issued from seemingly empty air a short distance before him \"good, it is no fun sitting on a boy that doesn't know you are there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione?\" he asked then \"I can't see you. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are dense Harry. Can't you feel my presence? Didn't I just tell you where I am?\" She sat even more firmly upon him, grinding him into the seat \"Here I am\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I see you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My new invisibility cloak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cloak, you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Harry. Mine. It was yours, in the same way your wand was once yours, your broom also but now it is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My broom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be needing it any more, Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't be needing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" She didn't want to spoil the surprise she knew was coming as soon as Wood read that note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple more points, Harry. Firstly you will not try to take the cloak from me, and you will not tell anybody that I am here. Nobody is to know that I am sitting on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I obey you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you don't, I'll pull you down until your face is resting on the seat, and then I will sit on you until you smother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you did in the library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you woke up from that eventually. You want to stay alive, don't you Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do as I tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" he sighed.</span></div></div>",

The boys sat together in the compartment, opposite each other, talking about various matters, especialyl quidditch which Harry had never heard about before but which Ron seemed most familiar with, and was keen to teach the other boy. In time though Ron started complain about his pet rat which he called \"Scabbers\" that had been a hand-me-down gift just like the robes he was wearing which clearly didn't fit him all that well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he raised his wand, a girl appeared at the entrance to their compartment. The girl had bushy brown hair and teeth that looked like they had never seen a brace. She was already wearing her Hogwarts robes, although she wore a skirt and top beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anybody seen a toad?\" she asks \"A boy called Neville has lost one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" they both respond in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed that Ron had his wand out \"Oh are you doing magic, let's see then?\" she instructs him in a somewhat pompous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon waved his wand at the Rat... <br>\r\n\"Sunshine daises, butter mellow... turn this stupid fat rat yellow\" he chants... nothing happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl eyed him oddly \"Are you sure that is a real spell?\" she asked \"well it's not very good is it. I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed her wand at Harry's glasses which she noticed were cracked, but she didn't cast any spell. Instead she noticed what looked like a scar underneath, shaped like a lightning bolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Harry Potter\" she remarked, then without any further comment she walked towards him, then she turned as though preparing to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry thought she was about to sit next to him.<br>\r\nShe didn't though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat quickly, and she sat direclty upon the part of the seat that Harry was already occupying, as though not even noticing that Harry was already there.  Her movement was so sudden that he didn't have time to react. One moment she was standing in front of him, the next she was occupying the same space, his lap occupied and utilised by her feminine butt cheeks. She smiled as though Harry was a target she had aimed for and hit precicely. She settled in to place, her back against his chest, Her butt cheeks against his groin and hips, her knees bent over his, the contours of her body closely matching his own. She kept her feet off the floor though so her full weight was centred entirely upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Hermione Granger\" she informed him as she continued to sit. Ron could see this upstart girl suddenly sitting on his new firend and he raised hs wand, aiming it at her. \"Get off him?\" He bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione simply shrugged that off \"we both know you can't do magic\" she informed him, then she raised her own wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expelliarmus!\" Ron's wand left his hand and, smiling Hermione reached up and caught it. \"I told you I'd managed a few simple spells.\" she continued \"if you don't want me to turn to jinxes then I suggest you don't try to interfere.\" She now pointed Ron's own wand at him as she continued to sit on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right\" Harry groaned \"get off me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no Harry\" Hermione smiled \"you are far too comfortable a seat for me to abandon you so easily, I think I'll stay here a while.\"</span></div></div>",

Well, you know what they say about gift horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make sense at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of coruse it does Harry, just look what sort of ego a history like that will bring you.

As she had pointed out, he had all thse sweets now to himself, and Ron always did like stuffing his face. So it was that he reached for one of the sweets and almost ignored what Hermione was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help looking across at the girl ocHcasionally. She had her butt planted firmly upon him, more firmly than he would normally expect a girl to sit on someone's lap. He could see her legs emerging from her skirt, perfect legs, thighs together up to her knees which bent over Harry's own and her legs hung loosely and didn't touch the floor. It was not merely as though Hermione was sitting on his lap, it was like Harry was simply a cushion for her and her presence upon him was deliberately squishing him as one might flatten a cushion if one put enough weight on it. Was she flattening Harry? Was that possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to imagine what it might feel like for Harry, being so completely sat upon, he imagined himself in Harry's place and for a moment an expression of arousal crossed his face. It may only have lasted a moment but Hermione noticed. \"You like what you see, Ron?\" she asked him, she didn't wait for an answer \"sorry but it is Harry who is my seat, now and always. If another girl comes in, I could ask her to sit on you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon nodded, what else could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could feel Hemrione's weight pressing down on him, using him. Her presence was everywhere, owning him. He had not really known many girls, everyone in his old school had ignored him, the girls as well as the boys. The only people who hadn't had been Dudley and his cronies, and quite frankly he would have rathered they left him alone. The first girl of around his own age to really pay him any attention had immediately sat upon him, and was continuing to do so.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girl was younger than Ron; not even a first year but like him she had red hair and a number of other similarities that told Hermione immediately that she must be Ron's younger sister. She wasn't too much younger though, Hermione suspected she would be around 10 years old. The girl was not wearing Hogwarts robes but a pink skirt and top. Clearly she was wearing muggle clothing to try and blend in as much as possible at Kings Cross Station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny!\" Ron gasped \"what are you doing here? Mother will be frantic.\"<br>\r\n\"Hush, Ron!\" She responded \"my business is not yours.\" Hermione could tell that this Ginny was a strong willed girl who was not going to be ordered about by her brother.<br>\r\n\"You aren't starting at Hogwarts until next year, Ginny. Get off the train.\"<br>\r\n\"Plans can change, Ron\" she answered \"and besides, the train is already moving\" She glanced out of the window that the countryside that was moving past.<br>\r\nGinny introduced herself to the older girl \"Ginny Weasley\" she held out her hand.<br>\r\nHermione took the hand and shook it warmly \"Hermione Grainger.\"<br>\r\n\"You came to see Harry Potter, didn't you?\" Hermione suggested.<br>\r\n\"Do you know where I might find him\" Ginny queried, glancing around.<br>\r\n\"He's right here\" Ginny looked confused for a monent, before Hermione muttered \"say hello, Harry\"<br>\r\n\"Hello\" the voice that emerged came from behind Hermione's back. <br>\r\nIt was then that Ginny noticed that Hermione was not sitting directly on the chair, there was a boy under her and it was from that boy that the voice had emerged. <br>\r\nGinny laughed out loud \"How very appropriate\" she approved. \"Doesn't he normally wear glasses.\"<br>\r\n\"He used to\" Hermione pointed out \"he won't be needing them any more. He's mine now.\"<br>\r\n\"So I see. May I see the scare though, just to be sure he is Harry Potter?\"<br>\r\nHermione leaned fowards, and Ginny came forward, brushed his head aside and noticed the scar. <br>\r\n\"That is definitely Harry Potter\" she nodded then before she struck him a resounding slap across the face.<br>\r\n\"Oops\" Ginny feigned innocence, which made both girls laugh out loud.<br>\r\n\"Oww, what was that for\" Harry burst out.<br>\r\n\"It amused me\" Ginny explained \"you don't mind do you?\" she asked Hermione.<br>\r\n\"Not in the least\" Hermione answered, leaning Back against Harry's chest once more \"I'd probably have done the same if I wasn't sitting on him.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so\" Ginny cast a glance at Ron at that point.<br>\r\n\"You're not going to hit me\" Ron informed her.<br>\r\n\"Ron\" Ginny shook her head \"if I wanted to hit you, then you would be hit. She glanced back towards Hermione had Harry once more \"My brother is so dense\" she sighed.<br>\r\n\"He is a boy\" Hermione pointed out \"go ahead. I know it is what he wants.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh really\" Ginny purred. She took several steps towards her brother and stood directly in front of him. <br>\r\n\"Ginny, you are blocking my view\" Ron complained.<br>\r\n\"Your view of Hermione sitting on Harry Potter. You really do want it, don't you Ron?\"<br>\r\n\"That is an understatement\" Hermione pointed out \"he was so aroused by what he saw, he wanted me to ask the next girl who came in here to do the same to him.\"<br>\r\n\"Gladly\" Ginny smiled as she quickly turned around and seated herself upon her older brother. In an instant Ron came to realise just how Harry was feeling as Ginny had put her full weight on him and started crushing him firmly into the seat.<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you ask me before, Ron?\" Ginny asked \"all those years wasted when I could have been sitting on you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" Rion muttered from beneath his sister.<br>\r\n\"He deserves a slap\" Ginny advised Hermione \"feel free to attend to it when we get off the train.\"<br>\r\nHermione nodded.<br>\r\nWhilst she continued to sit on her brother, Ginny started tucking into the sweets that Ron had been eating a moment before. When Ron reached for one, she slapped his hand away.<br>\r\nShe did throw a few sweets to Hermione though.

It was clear to Hermione that Ginny had quickly learned to take care of herself, that she was extremely strong willed and she had no doubt that her companion could easily hold her own not only against Ron but in fact all of her brothers. Ginny also pointed out that she was a pureblood witch but that she did not consider that to be of any great importance. She did not put on airs and she did not set herself above people of mixed or muggle heritage. She did warn though that there were some purebloods who did think they were better than others, but that she treatest people who acted that way in the profoundest contempt. She also explained that there was one particularly foul insult that the most hateful purebloods directed towards muggleborns, so that Hermione would know what the word meant when she heard it; which was bound to happen occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and if Ron ever uses that word against you, then you have my permission to kill him.\" Ginny concluded<br>\r\n\"Sure.

She explained about getting her letter, and learning that she was a witch, and about wanting to know as much as possible about the magical world. She explained that one of the most fascinating books she ever read was 'Hogwarts: A History'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've not read it\" GInny confessed \"but then I have learned about the school from my parents and my brothers.\"<br>\r\n\"There's so much in that book, I doubt you will have learned all of it from your family. I'll lend it to you sometime.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Ginny smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Ginny and Hermione had become close friends and they were enjoying each other's company almost as much as they were enjoying sitting on their boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think they'll let you into Hogwarts?\" Hermione asked,<br>\r\n\"I hope so, Ron is my seat now, so by all rights I should be at Hogwarts with him; upon him.\"<br>\r\n\"What about your school supplies?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, since Ron will only there to serve under me, he won't be studying magic now. I guess that means I inherit all his things, including this.\"<br>\r\nGinny snatched the wand out of Ron's pocket and held it in her lap. As she did so, she noticed that the wand somehow felt right in her hand.<br>\r\n\"Give that back\" Ron reached for his wand but Ginny knocked his hands away and dug her arms into his sides. \"That is two slaps you owe him now\" she advised Hermione.<br>\r\nHermione laughed at that.<br>\r\n\"Do you know how to use that wand?\" she queried.<br>\r\n\"Yes.

GInny cancelled that spell after a few minutes so Hemrione could relax her own feet but she did magically bind Harry's legs with rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe avoided casting curses on either of the boys, as Hermione had advised her that she didn't want her seat to become too uncomfortable but she did amusingly cast a tickling charm upon Harry, which made Hermione laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lovely\" she giggled \"I have my own vibro massage chair\"<br>\r\nGinny smiled back at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny cast several more spells during her demonstration, some of which she wasn't expected to learn until her second or third year. This really did impress Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this and you haven't even handled a wand before\" she commented.<br>\r\n\"As I said, I have read my brothers' books, including Bill; my oldest brother who has already graduated from Hogwarts. We are talking NEWT level spells in his later books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded and smiled, as Ginny cancelled all the spells she had cast so the girls could relax.</span></div></div>",

Harry and Ron were both concealed by their skirts, and being crushed firmly into the seats themselves.<br>\r\n\"Does it look like Harry Potter is anywhere around here, Malfoy?\" Ginny asked in an amused voice. Being a pureblood witch she recognised the boy immediately.<br>\r\n\"Well no, but...\" He glared at the red haired girl \"What are you doing on this train, Weasley? You aren't old enough to go to Hogwarts.\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't place any large wagers on that\" she advised.<br>\r\nDraco ignored that, \"Who are you?\" He asked hermione, not noticing where and upon whom she was sitting.<br>\r\n\"Hermione Granger\" she replied coldly. She didn't like the boy's tone and she could see that Ginny wasn't impressed with him either.<br>\r\n\"I don't recognise your name, you must be a mudblood\" the boy sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get to say any more. In an instant GInny had her wand pointed at the boy and had started firing spell after spell at him. Unlike when she was demonstrating with Harry, she was perfectly happy to add curses into the mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point, Hermione saw just how powerful a witch Ginny was. She started with a leg locker, she tied him tightly in ropes, she caused boils, welts and legions to spread all over his body, she made him puke his guts out and then hit him with a strong bat-bogey hex. She caused his body to twist, contort and deform, She made him itch so hard he nearly scratched his own skin off. She then raised his body off the ground with her wand and continued to bombard him with so many curses she had to silence him so he wouldn't rouse the whole train with his screaming. She let him hang in mid air whilst she magically tied him in knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she used a sommoning charm to cause Draco's wand to fly into her hand, then she negligently snapped it in half. She then sent the two halves of his broken wand back at him with such force that they lodged themselves in each of his nostrils, going in so deep that he would not be able to remove them without magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco suddenly noticed that he couldn't breathe through his nose and so he opened his mouth and took in huge gasps of air as Ginny let him fall back down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have two choices, Draco\" she advised \"leave now, or stay and continue to suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a piece of filth\" Hermione muttered after he had left.\"<br>\r\n\"Draco Malfoy\" Ginny nodded \"and yes, filth perfectly describes him, and his father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see now that you were holding back when you were demonstrating on Harry.\" Hermione commented.<br>\r\n\"You did tell me you wanted your seat to remain comfortable\" Ginny nodded \"but I'll be glad to show you those spells.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, well then you'll have to join me in Hogwarts. I don't imagine we have enough time to go through all those spells before we get to the school.\"<br>\r\nYou have a point there\" Ginny nodded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sat with her back against him, deliberately obscuring his vision so he couldn't even look out of the window and watch their progress. In fact he couldn't see very much except her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long though before the other occupant of the carriage, Ron came forward in an attempt to grab his own wand back. The moment Ron left his seat, Hermione slipped Harry's broken glasses off his face and stashed them in her pocket along with the other boy' wand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon made a lunge for that poket, in an attempt to grab his wand from her, but the moment his face came in range Hermione closed her fist and punched him squarely in the gut. She quickly followed that up with a punch to his face and Ron slipped to the floor, winded and with a trickle of blood coming from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back Ron, unless you want more\" Hermione waned him, she still hadn't moved at all from her seat upon Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon didn't listen though, boys never do. He came directly for her with his own fist clenched, not even caring about the fact that she was a girl.<br>\r\nHermione grabbed his wrist and twished it roughly, spraining it, then she followed up with severa slaps across his face.  \"If I have to teach you the hard way, I will, she continued her warning \"next time I'll put your down.\" She laid an open hand on his forehead and pushed him backwards, causing him to lose his footing and drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon tried one last time but Hermione then delived a sold blow across his jaw that sent one a couple of teeth flying out of his mouth. She hit him again just as hard and he dropped to the ground again. This time he didn't get up. Hermione looked down at him and gave him a satisfied smile. He was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Harry gasped, what was all that commotion. What happened to my glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that\" Hermione shrugged \"Ron here wouldn't listen to me so I took steps by hitting him a few times. He's now unconscious on the floor.

I have them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, you've been sitting on me the entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you take my glasses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they could have been damaged, if they'd splintered and a slither of glass had caught you in the eye you could have been blinded completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see, can I have them back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll hold on to them for a while, they were digging into my back. You don't need them anyway since I'm here with you. Trust what Itell you Harry. Ron didn't and now he is sleeping soundly on the floor of the carriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed his hair with one hand as she said this, slipping several strands into place above his eyes and concealing his scar.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't long after Hermione had put Ron to sleep that a blonde haired boy staggered into their compartment, and almost tripped over Ron in the process. There were two other boys with him, and these looked both muscular and thick. The kind of boys who looked like they could be the perfect cronies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard Harry Potter is in this compartment\" he drawled \"is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just me and my chair here\" Hermione informed him \"oh and that lump on the floor that you almost collided with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChair? Well, that boy, whoever he was did seem to be acting rather like a chair, the girl was certainly sitting on him as though he was one. Perhaps it was her pet name for him or something else that girls liked to do, he didn't care for girl stuff himself. The boy appeared to have dark hair, but he wasn't wearing glasses as Harry Potter was reputed to do, and there was no sign of that famous scar. He was probably some nobody from nowheresville, and therefore not worthy of his attention. Malfoy was like that, if he didn't think someone was important enough, he tended to either not waste his time on them or gloat about their shortcomings. He decided to stick with the former, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly the rumours about Potter being here were unfounded, but who was this other boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see that the sleeping lad had red hair and freckles though, there was blood on his face and his nose had been broken at some point. The boy had been in a fight with someone, and had clearly lost. \"Did you do this?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I've been sitting here the entire time. I believe he was fighting with someone but I didn't get a good look at them. Whoever it was though knocked him down and left him on the floor.\" He wondered what the boy's name was for a moment, then it came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be a Weasley\" he sneered \"they all have red hair and freckles like that, a family of blood traitors if ever there was one. What do you say boys, shall we show this one what we think of the Weasleys?\" The other two both clenched and unclenched their fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Hermione didn't offer any objections, except one. \"Not here though\" she requested \"I don't care to see a bunch of boys fighting in this carriage. If you are going to beat him up any more than he already is, take him outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Malfoy agreed \"come on boys, let's get Sleeping Weasley here out of her hair and get to work on him. His compantions, Crabbe and Goyle grabbed a leg each and started pulling him towards the corridor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I believe this is his\" Hermione offered then, taking Ron's wand out of her pocket. She negligently snapped it in half as she threw it onto the boy's chest, making it look like she had done so by accident. \"Oops\" she uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy looked down at the broken wand but made no further comment. The three of them manhandled Ron out into the corridor and the door closed behind them. There were sounds of a body being pulled to some other part of the train, but even they faded away before long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy who thinks that Joke he called a spell is real magic doesn't deserve a wand anyway\" she pointed out to Harry as she continued to sit on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they going to do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I imagine they'll knock the stuffing out of him. He'll probably be all covered in bruises by the time he gets to Hogwarts. His troubles won't end there either, I passed him his wand but it appears to have snapped in half. He won't be able to use it, so he'll have to use a replacement instead. That wand will not have chosen him though, he'll most likely struggle with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should help him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do no such thing, you'll stay right there and be the comfortable little seat cushion that I know you are.Ron made the mistake of defying me by trying to take his wand back, and now he will pay the price. I am looking forward to seeing him again actually, whilst all the bruises are still fresh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he is my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was your friend Harry, now you only have me. You can call me a friend if you wish, but I know where you truly belong and what your real designation is. As long as you are a good seat and aceept your position and all my plans for you, I'll see to it that you won't suffer Ron's fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply remain here and accept that you are sitting on me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is your role Harry, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you think I might at least have my glasses back.</span></div></div>",

Hermione was everywhere, her feminine weight a constant pressure that continued to bear down upon him. It wasn't unbearable, but she was all-encompassing. She as sitting so completely upon him hat he wondered if he would even be able to move her, but then what. He was as blind as a bat. He would still be in this carriage with her and in his hindered position he would be totally at her mercy. He remembered what had happened with Ron and he really didn't want the same fate to befall himself. All things considered, he felt the only course available to him would be to accept his place under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could definitely feel her sitting on him, her butt cheeks fed upon his lap relentlessly, he could detect, every contour of her young figure and the warmth coming from her body even through the thin articles of clothing they were both wearing.There was a delicate fragrance too, some purfume or other that she was wearing. He didn't have to be able to see to know that a girl was sitting firmly upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going to happen to Ron?\" he asked then.<br>\r\n\"Oh I imagine those boys will tear him apart\" she responded casually \"the two big lugs with the blonde one were the muscular type. Don't waste your thoughts on him though, he is not your concern any more. You are mine now Harry, don't ever forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I am yours in that you ae sitting on me.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes am I and will of course continue to do so, but that is not what I meant. You are mine, you will always be mine and even though we have not met before today you always have been mine.\"<br>\r\n\"You are not making any sense?\"<br>\r\n\"You'll come to understand in time Harry, as comprehension begins to dawn on you and you finally begin to accept that you are mine. She took her wand out of her pocket pointed passed it behind her back, aiming it at him. With his weakened eyes though, Harry didn't even notice what Hermione was doing with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are mine Harry\" she repeated, and as she said this there was a faint, barely noticeable glow that came from the tip of her wand. \"What did I just tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, I am yours\" Harry responded in a flat sounding voice, not understanding the significance of the statement he had just made. The glow from Hermione's wand shone a little brighter for a moment, then faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't even aware of it, all he heard was Hermione repeating the line that her was her's, but it didn't actually make him feel any different at all.Once the glow died down, Hermione pocketed her wand once more.</span></div></div>",

It was the perfect test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Hermione?\" Harry asked her, but without even being aware of it he lifted his right hand and stuck his middle finger up his nose. He did not remove it, even when it dawned on him that he had just carried out her instruction. He desperately wanted to remove that finger, and perhaps even take a swipe at Hermione but he made no move to that effect.

You should have come across the name by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man who invented those rules for robots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thatis the one, and I believe they should also apply in your case too. The first rule I hereby give you is that you may not ever cause me any harm, nor through inaction are you permitted to allow me to come to harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd really like to punch you in the mouth right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure you do, but you won't do it. You can't. The second rule I give you is that you must obey all instructions I give you, no exceptions. I know that Asimov said something about it not contrevening the first rule but you don't need to woorry about that part. Oh, I may at one point extend this rule to other girls as well, and if I do you will not obey any instruction they give you unless it conflicts with rule number one.You will also not obey any instruction that would promote another girl above me as your owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obey insructions? Owner? You really are crazy Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is your finger right now? \"Your third rule is that you must protect your own continued existence unless that protection defies any of the first two rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly would have a death wish if any of the idiocy you are sprouting has any revelevence at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you won't do anything about it Harry. One last rule for now, you will not confess our arrangement to others, not verbally, not in writing and not through the use of magic. I may include other girls in our arrangement but that is my choice, not yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Hermione. I'll shout it from the rooftops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't Harry, you really won't. You'll keep our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell she had cast upon Harry wasn't the imperius curse, that spell was banned by the ministry after all. It was a clever little spell though, designed to make any absolute statements that the victim made really count. The fact that through her manipulation, Harry had offered himself to her of his own free will whilst the spell was being cast was what made the spell make the way it did, and why Harry was forced to stick his finger up his nose and keep it there until she told him he could remove it. Hermione had cleverly used a simple little 'word binding' spell for her own purposes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the boy leaves I'll let you get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older boy, Percy walked away off to give his isntructions to the people in the next compartment, and as soon as Herminoe had made her remark he gladly took his finger out of his nose. He had hated having it up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemrione slid in the chair opposite and moved to take the seat that Ron had occuplied earlier, her eyes fixed upon him. \"Change in to your school robes, Harry\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to turn away while I get dresed. he asked, already starting to remove his travelling outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I won't. Just keep getting dressed Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stripped down to his underwear, and then started to put on his school things. Hermione's eyes remained on him the entire time and this made him feel quite uncomfortable but he still continued to do as she had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was dressed, Hermione instructed him to sit down again, then she slid back into his lap. The train started to slow down and eventually stopped but she did not move from her seat until most of the students had already left the train. She then got off him and told Harry to follow her as she made her way out of their compartment and down on to the platform \"Stay with me, Harry\" she told him then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firs' Years, Firs' years this way\" a voice called out, and a giant of a man emerged from the crowd. \"That's Hagrid, I've met him before\" Harry told Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right\" Hermione nodded, this was apparently one of Harry's former acquaintances and Hermione didn't want him to get chummy with anyone else at the school. For this reason she didn't even look at Hagrid, telling Harry to ignore the man and to stay with her. She did take him down towards the lake shore where Hagrid was leading the frist year students and a number of small boat waited for them, and after Hagrid entered one of the boats Harry desperately wanted to join him but found himself unable to do so. Instead Hermione led him told him to take a seat in an empty boat instead, and sat on him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more than two to a boat\" Hagrid said then, but that was fine with Hermione. She and Harry would have their boat to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boats moved off from the shore and through some magical means they made their own way over to the opposite bank. There were no oars, no clear means of propulsion but the boats continued to travel of their own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they caught sight of the castle, there were collective gasps from most of the students, including harry. The magnifance of the place was somewhat marred for him though by his continued presence under Hermione and her apparent control over him. She however looked delighted by the sight before her and by Harry's presence under her. For her this was going to prove to be the perfect magical education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had crossed the lake, and everybody had disembarked Hagrid took a disappointed look at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might have said 'hello' at least Harry\" he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting acquainted with Hermione here.\" Harry informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is good to see you are making friends\" he responded, his voice still a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid then led the first year students towards the large doors that were the entrance to the castle, and knocked. The door was opened by a strict seeming witch who led the first years in to the castle and to a small side chamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts\" she told them all, then explained about the four houses and that the sorting would commence shortly. She then told them to wait quietly until they were summoned before leaving them alone in the room. For ancient looking ghosts also appeared in the room for a moment and gave their own greetings before they too disappeared.</span></div></div>",

I thought I might fill you in on the Weasel. My nam's Malfoy by the way, Draco Malfoy\"\"<br>\r\n\"Hermione Granger and I have to confess, I don't see him in this room, anywhere.\"<br>\r\n\"He's not. Crabbe and Goyle, he indicated the two burly idiots that had been with him on the train \"well let's just say they took him to another compartment and beat the stuffing out of him. By the time they'd finished with him he was a bloody mess. I wonder why he was unconscious when we found him though.\"<br>\r\n\"I hit him a time or two myself first, he clearly irritated the both of us.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes well, as these two were finishing with him, two girls came and looked him over. He was barely recognisable at the time but the plump one of the pair said she thought she knew who he was. She dropped on top of him and told him he needed to be sorted into Slytherin house. She said she wouldn't get up until he agreed.. I think she and the other girl have some plans for him. I hope he dos get in Slytherin and they do to. It'd be fun to watch the show, I'll tell you that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how come he is still not in here? How can he be sorted into Slythern if he isn't even going to attend the ceremony?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, he was passing in and out of consciousness at that point and I saw no reason to wake him. He'd probably still be on the train but someone has probably spotted him and carried him to the Hospital Wing by now. Maybe they'll carry in there at one point so his house can be identified. Who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't even want to listen to the conversation, his glasses were still missing though so this Draco person clearly hadn't identified him yet. Then he noticed the scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you are Harry Potter are you. Well I have to say, this Granger here did a very good job of concealing you. Aren't you said to wear glasses though?<br>\r\n\"I have his glasses, he didn't need them on the train. He didn't need to see them on the train to go anywhere, because quite frankly he wasn't going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh right, erm fine. See you around Granger.\" The truth was he didn't know what to make of Hermione. Her name was unfamiliar and that suggested that she was a mudblood. She seemed to have some plans for Potter though, and he didn't quite know what they were. He didn't want to judge her too much until he learned more about what those plans were. She may be a mudblood but if she went out of her way to dethrone the famous Harry Potter then perhaps she could at least be tolerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione though had already made her mind up about Malfoy, she didn't trust him and didn't like him. He sounded like a cruel boy who took a perverse delight in boasting about his exploits and those two boys who were with him sounded like mindless thugs. \"I don't like that boy, Harry\" she told him quietly \"you are not to associate with him two burly companions. You are not to engage him in conversation or even acknowledge him if he talks to you ore tries to get your attention. In fact you should just ignore him completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long though before McGonagall returned.</span></div></div>",

They at least knew where the Hospital Wing was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the school was waiting in the Great Hall, the two girls encountered noone as they walked up staircases and along corridors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we find Weasley, I'll sit on him and you cast the spell\" Millecent advised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me. We want our slave to be in as much discomfort as possible, so feel free to sit heavily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will\" Millicent laughed \"what about that Hermione? I mean she is a mudblood, but if her spell works...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If her spell works, then she will have done us a real favour. Weasley is a blood traitor, I can't wait to make him our slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically he'd be your slave if you cast the spell. I couldn't be friends with a mudblood though, even if she does help us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe neither, but at least we could decide not to be her enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. If she has given us Weaseley then we don't bother her, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the hospital wing, Ron was laying on the closest bed on his back. His body was severely bruised and his nose was broken, but most of the cuts had been treated and he wasn't bleeding any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent wasted no time at all, she strode purposefully over to his bed and fell on him, heavily. From beneath her a cracking noise could be heard. \"I think I just broke a rib there, Weasel\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon groaned, he had heard the crack, and felt it, and now he felt the weight of a girl that appeared too big to be allowed sitting on him, and bearing down with the force of a young elephant. How could any girl be that heavy? It was almost impossible to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent continued to laugh as she ground herself into the boy beneath her, causing another cracking sound. \"Make that two ribs\" she corrected \"I wonder how long it would take me to crush the rest of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Pansy took out her wand and cast the spell that Hermione had given her. Millicent nodded as she deliberately snapped another of Ron's ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon desperately tried to push the girl off him but Millicent was exceptionally heavy, he couldn't budge her at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling you want to keep the rest of your ribs, Weasel\" Millicent commented \"well you won't stop me tha way. Do you want to know how to save your remaining rib bones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say to Pansy here 'I am yours', that's all. Those three words, no more broken ribs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon hesitated for a moment, and so Pansy broke another one. \"Of couse, if you want me to utterly destroy your rib cage, feel free to remain silent but what then? What will happen to your internal organs; your heart and lungs with no ribs to protect them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother crack. \"Fine, fine\" Ron gasped, turning to Pansy \"I am yours\" he declared. As he spoke, a wave of magic swept over Ron, binding him to the girl before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't so hard was it slave?\" Pansy had already decided that she would not address Ron by his given name any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't hard\" Ron agreed. He looked up at Millicent. \"You said yould get off me\" he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent slapped Ron sharply across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millicent will get up when she decides\" Pansy told him \"now apologise for speaking out of turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" Ron gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not convinced by that apology\" Millicent remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither, a slave needs to know his place\" Pansy nodded as she....</span></div></div>",

Unlike most people in the room, she had read Hogwarts: A History and she knew the procedure that would be followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Professsor McGonagall returned and instructed the students to line up; Hermione instructed Harry to remain directly behind her as they made their way out of the side chamber and through the double doors of the great hall, towards the front where a hat and a stool awaited them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall gave her instructions, although Hermione knew what was coming. She gave Harry some more instructions of her own, she had been using Harry as her seat cushion since she had met him and she didn't think that the sorting should be any excuse to change anything. He was surely far more comfortable a seat than that old wooden chair. She also knew that she would be called before him as her name was earlier alphabetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the professor calls my name, you will sit on that chair and remain there so I can sit on you\" she informed him \"no matter what I or anyone else says, you will not leave that seat until we have both been sorted into one of the houses. Whichever house I join, that is also the house to which you belong, remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both watched a number of students being sorted, and each of the four houses started to swell their numbers before finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granger, Hermione\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the cue, immediately as Hermione's name was called, Harry came forward and took his place on the seat and Hermione followed behind him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall was not pleased at all by Harry's actions. \"Is your name Hermione Granger?\" she challenged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Harry Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Hermione Granger\" Hermione informed the woman \"Harry, in about ten seconds I will sit in that chair, regardless of whether or not you are occupying it and I will remain there until the sorting hat has made its decisions.\" She used the plural form of 'decision' since she fully intended to remain seated until after both she and Harry had been sorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor saw no objection to Hermione's statement, it was fair warning after all and Harry was apparently disrupting this girl's sorting. \"You heard her, Potter\" she confirmed the girl's ultimatum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after ten seconds, Harry had not moved and Hermione sat on him again, this time in front of the entire school. Her movement as she sat was so natural that it would appear to those watching that she wasn't even aware that Harry was already occupying the seat. She of course knew precisely where he was and she sat firmly upon him, using her full weight to press him into the seat beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs McGonagall placed the sorting hat on her head, Hermione asked \"Does anyone have a camera handy, I think this moment should be recorded for posterity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl sat at the Gryffindor table produced a camera and pointed it at the front of the room, taking a picture of the stool and its two occupants. Hemrione smiled her thanks and felt that it would be really nice to be sorted into Gryffindor so she could thank the helpful girl in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my chair is not comfortable enough, is it?\" the hat spoke in Hermione's head \"you feel the need to bring a cushion to the sorting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry is such a comfortable cushion\" Hermione thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see in your mind that you have been using him in that capacity for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I am loving every minute of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does Harry feel about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has no objections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't object though, can he? You have bound him to you with powerful magic, a magic which has ensnared his very will and smothered it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is your puppet, you have been pulling his strings since you first sat on him on the train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to tell anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not, I too am bound by magic. The magic which gave me intelligence and will also prevented me from speaking aloud anything I find in a student's mind other than their house. I may not reveal the secrets of the soul, but I can tell you that your actions today would have pleased Salazar Slytherin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Slytherin\" Hermione begged \"I suspect Weasley and those girls he was with will be Slytherins, I don't want to be sorted with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" the hat mused \"if not SLytherin then where else shall I put you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see more in your mind\" the hat added \"and what a mind you have, so bright, so quick and agile. You have already memorised all the spells in your books i see. You could be a good fit for Ravenclaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Hermione agreed, although she still remembered that a Gryffindor girl had taken her picture. Did she belong there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have a strong sense of right and wrong, you believe in honour and doing what should be done. I see that trait most keenly, far more than any other. In fact you belong in....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait please\" Hermione added then, sure the hat was going to make its decision. It had still not said a word out lould but had instead spoken only in Hermione's mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have reached my decision, you don't wish to hear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but don't announce it to the school yet. I am perfectly comfortable where I am for the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Okay, I suppose I can hold of for a time. Incidentally, I have decided that you shall be a Gryffindor but as you say, I won't announce it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Do you suppose you could also sort Harry into Gryffindor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is in his mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be grateful, also can he be sorted directly after me? I know you are sorting alphabetically but as you have pointed out yourself, he is also occupying this seat, directly under me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good idea, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The record for a sorting is a little over 15 minuites isn't it?\" Hermione had read Hogwarts: History<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you suppose we might break that record? First with me, then with Harry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't people get bored?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't think so, not when they are enjoying the entertainment\" Hermione had noticed that more people had been taking pictures of her sitting on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might get hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they'll appreciate their dinners all the more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, I think we have a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiles and continued to sit on Harry whilst she waited for the sorting for which she already knew the answer. She continued to sit on Harry the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 17 minutes later when the hat told her it would be wrong to hold the sorting off any longer and announced \"Gryffindor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gryfffindor table cheered  but Hermione did not stand, she remained seated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may join your new housemates now, Miss Granger\" Professor McGonagall informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet, We agreed that I should sit on Harry until the hat has reaced its decisions - plural. The hat has not yet chosen Harry's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tradition is that students are sorted alphabetically, Miss Granger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but since Harry is already here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall asked the hat it it was willing to sort Harry next and the hat bent forwards slightly in an unmistakable nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" McGonagall raised her voice \"Since Potter is already occupying the seat, the hat has agreed to sort him next. Miss Granger will remain seated upon him until the hat has reached its decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall then removed the hat from Hemrione's head and placed it on Harry's. Neither Hermione nor Harry moved from their combined seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hat could clearly detect this as it could sense Harry's awareness of his position beneath her. For a few moments, the hat said nothing, it seemed to be reading everything it could in Harry's reaction to being beneath her, if he even had a reaction to speak of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mr Potter\" the hat said at last \"or rather what remains of him, which doesn't appear to be much of anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the hat going to degrade him now, or was it just the girl. Was the hat just describing what he had become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What remains of you, boy? You may have had a mind once, may have had a will of your own but what was is now gone, ensnared and subdued by the girl who has also claimed your body as her seat. What is left, Mr Potter? What is there left for me to sort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her claim on you is absolute\" the hat added \"absolute and unbreakable, you will belong to her for the rest of your life. That is all you now are, so I wonder again what is left to sort. Whichever house you join, you will have nothing to other it for you have not the will nor the means to control your own destiny. She controls you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I feel pity? No. It was your actions which bound you to her, when you promised to obey her in exhange for nothing on her part. She has no obligation to you but you are bound to her by powerful magical bonds. You are in a prison of your own making Mr Potter and there will be no escape. You deserve no pity for your own foolishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am duty bound to sort you Mr Potter, and I have already made my decision. I will leave you to abosrb my words whilst I enjoy your unique sitaution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hat went silent, and Harry was alone with his thoughts. He had done this, he had given himself to Hermione and as he hat todl him, he could do nothing about it. He only knew that he had to obey the girl. He had to obey her every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt no anger or hatred towards her though, emotion required will and his will had been effectively crushed, all he could do was accept his new place in life, under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry waited<br>\r\nThe hat waited<br>\r\nThe school waited, and was amused<br>\r\nHermione waited, and relished<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hoped that she might be able to sit on Harry during the sorting and the experience was turning out even better than she had hoped. The hat was being so accommodating, delaying their sortings so that she could sit there, upon her Harry for the longest time. It was all so perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than 15 minutes later when the hat spoke again in Harry's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, you do not any longer have any discernible mind or will of your own, you belong to Miss Granger now so it is only right that you should join her in Gryffindor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last word was spoken aloud and finally, more than half an hour since Hermione had sat on Harry on the sorting  chair ,they had been sorted into their house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione lifted the hat off Harry's head then she stood up before pulling Harry to his feet.<br>\r\nAs an afterthought she then placed the hat on the chair and sat back down for a moment, squashing the hat beneath her. When she got up again the hat had been flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall had to wave her wand over the hat to restore its shape before she called forth the next student. Hermione led Harry over to the Gryffindor bench where she sat on him once more to watch the remainder of the sorting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay we are ready for you now, if you would all please line up and follow me to the Great Hall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students lined up, Hermione eased Harry in to position directly behind her and slipped his cracked glasses back over his eyes. \"So you don't slip and hurt yourself\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Harry found himself able to see this room for the first time. They were in a small antichamber and a group of students, all around his age were lining up. Harry could now clearly see Hermione in front of him and another girl had moved in to position directly behind him. As McGonagall led them out of that room and across the hallway, Harry looked around him in wonderment at first sights he was ever seeing of the building they had entered. He had no idea what it looked like from the outside as he wasn't wearing his glasses then and had relied on Hermione to guide his steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the Great Hall, Harry could see the four great hosue tables and the platfrom at the front of the room in front of the staff table. He also noticed that the ceiling was enchanted somehow as it seemed to show a representation of the sky outside. As they walked to the front of the room, towards a lone chair and an old hat that was resting upon it, Hermione quietly gave Harry some further information and instructions.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will all line up in front of that chair and then when our name is called we sit down and the professor places the hat on our head. It is the hat which tells us which house we will call our own. I read all about it in Hogwarts: A History. I strongly suspect our names will be called in alphabetical order, in which case I will be sorted before you, \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was when her advice turned to further instructinos. \"In that case I want you to listen carefully to which house I am sorted into, and you will convince the hat to sort you in to the same house as me. That is vitally important Harry, we have to be in the same house. Once you are sorted you are to come to the house table and eithr sit directly next to me, or if thee isn't room you will stand behind me and wait for me to get up, then take my vacated place. I don't think I need remind you where I will sit at that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor had by now started calling out names, ind it did appear to be in alphabetical order, as she started with the 'A' surnames and moved on to the 'B's. He watched as each student the was called would sit on the chair for a time wearing the hat, which would then announce the name of one of the houses and the child in question would then remove the hat and go to sit with their housemates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Professor McGonagall called out \"Granger, Hermione.\"<br>\r\nAs Hermione went to sit on the stool, Harry couldn't help but look at the chair itself. The thing looked like a perfectly ordinary chair, as chair's go but from the amount of time Hermione had spent sitting on him on train so firmly and for so long, nervous impulses from his upper thighs were still being transmitted to his brain. If he closed his eyes he could easily picture her still sitting on him, and whenever he looked at the chair he could feel himself in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long though before Herminoe was sorted in to Gryffindor house and she gave Harry a nod before she went over to join her housemates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of her earlier commands, he didn't even notice Malfoy, Draco being sorted into Slytherin, nor did he pay any attention to Crabbe and Goyle who were already there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after Parkinson, Pansy also became a Slytherin he found his own name was called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potter, Harry\"<br>\r\nThere were collective gasps from the hall when his name was spoken and he felt all eyes on him when he sat down on the stool. There were only two eyes that he was really seeing though, and they belonged to a girl at the Gryffindor table. As the hat started somehow talking to him inside his mind, speculating as to where he belonged, Harry started pleading with the hat. 'Gryffindor , Gryffindor, please I beg you, hat I have to be sorted in to Gryffindor'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you are so sure\" said the voice in his mind \"better be...\" then the hat cried out GRYFFINDOR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were cheers from many of the people in the room, especially those at the Gryffindor table. The Slytherins ignored him completely but Harry wasn't paying any attention, not even to Dumbledore at the staff table who had rasied his goblet in salute. His one concern was getting back to Hermione. He made his way over to the Gryffindor table, down the lines of students, ignoring several large gaps on the bench. He spotted Hermione and saw that there was a space next to her. He sat down in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Harry had taken his place beside her, Hermione stood a moment, moved across so she was directly in front of him and sat back down. \"Welcome to Gryffindor\" she told him as he felt her full weight pressing down upon him once more, then she whispered in his ear \"I want you to stay nice and still and continue to serve as my seat cushion, just like you did on the train. I'll feed you so you are not to reach for anything on the table. Just relax and accept your place under me. You are mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorting had not yet finished, McGonagall had moved by now to \"Weasley, Ronald\"... nobody came forward \"Weasley, Ronald\" she repeated.<br>\r\nSomeoen from the staff table came forward and started talking with the McGonagall for a second. \"It seems Weasley won't be joining us, very well Zabini, Blaise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZabini was the last person to be sorted. After that, McGonagall folded up her list and moved the hat and the chair out of the way. At this point Dumbledore stood up to give his start-of-term notices.</span></div></div>",

Her instructions bound him to her more firmly than rope and he could do nothing to change his position beneath her.  She didn't even ask him if there were any foods he liked or disliked as she filled his plate, she didn't care. She would see to his nutrition, make sure he was fed but whether he liked the food she gave him or not, she couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl had by this time taken the place that Hermione had previously occupied before she sat on Harry and another girl was sat on their right side.

I'm far too comfortable to allow it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose\" Rachel sighed, then she seemed to have a idea, she leaned across and whispered something in Charlotte's ear, who in turn whispered something back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like us to squash you between us, Harry?\" Charlotte asked him \"since you are already Hermione's seat, you might enjoy being squeezed on both sides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would like that very much wouldn't you Harry. Tell them you accept their offer. Address them by name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please, Charlotte, Rachel. I would very much like to be squashed between you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said it\" Rachel smiled, edging closer to Harry whilst Charlotte eased herself towards him on the other side.  He soon felt their thighs against hin, and still they edged closer and closer until Harry felt as though he was held in a vice grip between them with Hermione still sitting on him. Harry could feel their warm flesh and their thighs digging into him, and they were not being gentle, not gentle at all. A stitch was forming in both his sides where Rachel and Charlotte's hips both dug into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being squashed, Harry?\" Rachel asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do, don't you Harry?\" Hermione led<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could keep this up all though dinner if you like, would you like that Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please\" came from Hermione, Harry followed with a \"Yes please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls both relaxed and maintained the pressure as they settled into their meals. Hermione tucked into hers too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte was the first to clear her plate, but it was several minutes before she did. \"Does Harry want that one?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can give it to him if you like, make sure he eats it all whether he likes it or not, it is his\" She leaned forward a fraction, allowing Charlotte room to spoon-feed Harry his food, but she continued to sit on him the entire time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least it filled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the plates had all cleared and dumbledore rose, instructing the prefects to lead their students, specifically the first years to their dorms. Hermione then recalled that one of the prefects was Ron's brother and she felt a sudden urge to keep Harry hidden from him. [b]\"When we get up, we should surround Harry\"[/b] she advised [b]\"keep him hidden in the middle of our group, and Harry, you are to remain silent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other two girls and smiled at this, so in the crowd of rising students, they in turn stood and formed a circle around Harry, They were not conspicuous, there was no sign of guilt or ulterior motive on their faces. They just stood in a group with Harry in a position where he would be easily overlooked, if he was even seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey joined the line of first years, and followed the Gryffindor Prefects up the main staircase, along passages and more staircases, listening to advice that was given about staircases moving of their own accord and the occasional greeting from portraits as they passed. In the middle of their group, Harry remained silent, as he had been instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time they stopped in front of a portrait depicting a friendly looking, plump woman. \"The Fat Lady\" Percy informed them [b]\"the guardian of the Gryffindor common room. He faced the portrait and spoke a couple of words, clearly and precisely, and the Fat Lady in turn acknowledged them, then turned as though on a hinge revealing the entrance to the common room. \"The password, try to remember it.\" By this time the entrie group of First Year students had piled inside. Percy then informed them of the two staircases leading to the dorms themselves, one staircase for the boys and another for the girls, and told them that their belongings were already in their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left them then and the students split into two lines, a line of boys who took one staircase and the girls who headed up the other.

It stands to reason that he should also be allowed up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Charlotte pulled Harry over to the bottom of the staircase leading to the girls' dorms and Hermione stood behind him. \"Climb\" she instructed \"when you reach the top, wait for us outside the entrance to the First Year Girls' dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry began to climb the stairs, with Hermione standing behind him. He did not climb quickly, but he climbed none-the-less. The girls waited with baited breath, ready for any sign of Harry being knocked back or the staircase collapsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't though. Harry passed through the invisible barrier and reached the top of the staircase, he turned and saw a corridor before him with a number of doors leading off, each with signs on them which stated they were girls' dorms for this or that year group. He stopped outside the one that indicated that it was for 'First Year Girls'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hunch was right\" Hermione grinned, coming up behind him \"I told you that you are mine, the staircase agrees with me. This will be your room now, from now on and throughout your time at Hogwarts you will sleep in my dorm, in the place that I assign to you. I forbid you from ever setting foot on the staircase leading to the boys' dorms, that staircase and those rooms are out of bounds to you, and will remain so forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, this instruction was from her and it had to be obeyed like all the rest.

I would ask you not to do any permanent harm to him without my approval.\"<br>\r\nThe girl nodded \"fine by me.\"<br>\r\nHermione glanced around at the other beds, most of the occupents had not dozed off yer but a couple were asleep. \"The same goes for the rest of you too\" she informed them \"and feel free to pass the same on to any of us who are not listening right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, which bed is his?\" Charlotte asked then<br>\r\n\"The one next to mine, it is conveniently unoccupied Harry will sleep there. Harry, I want you to strip down to your underwear as you normally do when going to bed, leave your clothes in a neatly stacked pile by your new bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry dutifully started to strip off his clothes and laid them down neatly in a pile next to his bed, just as he was instructed. He removed his socks too but not his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in to bed now Harry\"<br>\r\nHe nodded, and slipped into bed, pulling the covers over him.</span></div></div>",

Can I please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled. \"Sure you can\", noticing this girl seemed eager to be given the opportunity. Had she found a new ally in her plans for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, you will take your place in a nearby seat, then ask Rachel here to sit on you for as long as she wants. Ask her nicely, and allow her to fulfill your request, you will then allow her to remain seated upon you for as long as she chooses as you would any girl to whom you would make such a request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hermione\" Harry nodded, moving to the nearest seat and sinking in to it \"Rachel\" he called \"I would like to make a request of you, will you please sit on me, You can sit on me for as long as you want. Please, Rachel.\" He noticed when he spoke that Rachel, like Hermione was wearing her Gryffindor robes over a skirt and top. The girl had long brown hair and miscievous blue-grey eyes. She was around the same height as himself and whilst she was not clearly overweight, she was not exactly slim either. He suspected that she weighed a little more than him, which wasn't surprising really considering the meager portions that the Dursleys had been dropping on his dinner plate. Her appearance did not matter though, Hermione had given him his instructions and his compulsion to obey was just as strong as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel came to where he was sitting and quickly sat down directly and firmly upon him, although she wasn't even aware of his presence and his was a seat like any other. He felt her weight upon him instantly, and as Hermione had instructed him he should, he simply accepted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and comfy\" Rachel approved \"you are a truly delightful seat cushion, Harry. I think I'll stay here for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded as she took another seat nearby, as did Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, girls\" Hermione informed them \"Harry is mine, and he does everything I say, without question. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Charlotte raised an eyebrow \"anything at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything he is capable of doing, yes. He has to have the ability and the knowledge, but if it is something he can do, he will do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to test that claim by asking Hermione to make a request of her that he surely would never make of his own accord. \"Make him ask me to slap him across the face\" she requested, then added the single word \"hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, ask Charlotte her to good hard slap in the face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlotte, please will you slap my face, as hard as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd love to\" Charlotte grinned, then came over to stand in front of Harry, her right arm raised. \"Lean forward for me, Rachel\" she offered, she gladly obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPick a cheek, Harry\" Hermione countered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right cheek\" he responded instantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte measured Harry then truck him firmly across the right cheek with her open hand. The cheek quickly turned red and a hand print was clearly visible. \"Any time you ask, I'll be happy to oblige\" she smiled and returned to her seat. Rachel relaxed against his chest once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank her for it\" Hermione urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for slapping me, Charlotte\" Harry automatically responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Harry\" Charlotte laughed in response \"OK Hermione, I am convinced that he really does carry out your instructions, I can't think of any boy who would ask to be hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one\" Rachel asked \"he just did\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did indeed\" Hermione nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is Harry, now?\" Charlotte asked \"he was the Boy Who Lived, the child who defeated You Know Who, the most famous boy in the wizarding world.... now he is... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine\" Hermione finished \"that is all he is and all he will ever be. It is all he ever was too but he didn't know it until we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where did you meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the train, coming here. I sat on him as soon as I knew who he was. I, or rather we have been sitting on him ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we might be permitted to share him?\" Charlotte requested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you are doing so right now. When it comes down to it though, he is still mine. One instruction from me and Harry can be, less co-operative. I would like to hope that won't happen though, and that we can continue our arrangement, all be friends and all enjoy Harry together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is fine with me\" Charlotte smiled.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, my friend\" Rachel responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry\" Hermione said then \"you will accept our new arrangement and follow instructions that Rachel and Charlotte give you, just as you do mine, except for any command that could cause harm to any of the three of us, or any instruction that might undermine my authority over you or counter any instructions I have given. You are still mine, and always will be. If I cancel our arrangement at any time then you will revert to obeying me and me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me that you feel honoured to be my seat cushion\" Rachel advised me \"and ask me to continue to use you in that manner for as long as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel truly honoured to be your seat cushion, Rachel. Please continue to use me as such for as long as you possibly can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy to Harry\" I don't feel tired, I think I could stay here for another hour or me. Tell me that pleases you Harry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It pleases me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we are both happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and Charlotte\" she added \"remind me never to offend you, the way you slapped Harry just now, you don't do things by halves, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no problem hitting a boy who asks for it or deserves it\" she shrugged \"and I am happy to let him know that. I rather enjoyed it to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them remained in the common room, chatting for some time about various matters and getting to know each other's histories, origins and motivation. Rachel was a smart girl, a half-blood, not quite at Hermione's level when it came to sheer brilliance of mind, but Hermione saw someone with a great deal of potential.. Charlotte was the younger sister of two older brothers from a muggle family, neither of these boys were attending Hogwarts but Hermione got the distinct impression that both had learned quickly not to annoy her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey did indeed spend the next hour talking amongst themselves and getting to know each other. Eventually though, Charlotte yawned and looking over at the other two she suggested that it was time to go to bed.</span></div></div>",

You will sit with your back against the seat and tilt your head back so it rests on the seat cushion.

She then sat back down directly upon the seat cusion his fface was occupying, burying him beneath her skirt. She lifted her feet off the floor and settled her full weight upon him. Harry suddenly found his airway completely blocked under her as her butt flesh covered both his nose and his mouth. He couldn't breathe at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and comfortable\" Hermione approved \"and now you are suffocating down there Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could only accept that she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the cotnrol I have over you Harry, this is why you are mine. If you were not mine then you could push me off easily, draw as much breath as you liked. Instead you have no air at all and you can do nothing about it. My command that you not move has bound you so securely that it overrides even your own survival instinct. If I wanted I could just sit here until you smothered to death, you can do absolutely nothing to prevent that. The only person who control whether you live or die now is me Harry. You are utterly mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione continued to sit and Harry began to think that maybe she was killing him As much as he might want to remove her presence upon him, he could not command his limbs to move, his own mind somehow blocked those instructions. He remained completely still and airles beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was in position, Hermione also remained completely still Harry could feel her weight and her butt cheeks pressing down upon his face but he could do absolutely nothing about it. The seconds passed on and nothing changed, he was still buried under her, still suffocating  He started to think that he really was about to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the darkness came, Harry welcomed it, hoping that his strange enslavement at the hands of this girl might finally be at an end.</span></div></div>",

Being a typical Ravenclaw, I've read ahead a bit and I've only just discovered it.\"<br>\r\n\"Discovered what?\"<br>\r\n\"Ligilimency, the magical art of penetrating minds. It's too tricky though, you won't be able to do it - not yet.\"<br>\r\n\"I may surprise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He did start shaking uncontrollably, writing in agony but Hermione showed another of her great talents and managed to keep her seat the entire time. Eventually though, Heather nodded and told Hermione she could stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A number of those are not first year spells\" she gasped \"maybe you are capable of NEWT level magic.\"<br>\r\n\"You are not the only person who has been reading ahead\" Hermione explained \"Standard Book of Spells Grade One, it stands to reason that there would be other grades and those would be targetted at specific years of study. I also picked up books two, three and four.\"<br>\r\n\"You should have collected book six as well\" Heather hinted \"that book contains the spell I am now going to show you. There isn't a great deal of wand movement involved, althouy you will need your wand, at least at first. A keen ligilimens doesn't even need to use the word. A lot of the magic involves a kind of reaching out with your mind, you push your mind out towards the target and force your way through. Once inside, their mind is completely open to you, their every thought. A skilled ligilimns can even control their host's mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thake makes sense\" Hermione nods \"but you say I'll ned my wand at first?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, you aim your wand at the target and utter the word ligilimens whilst at the same time reaching in with your own mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's first few attempts were not successful, and Heather was not at all surpised as this was indeed very advanced magic. She continued to explain though, helping Hermione to refine the technique until.<br>\r\nCou<br>\r\n\"Ligilimens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione suddeny found an imaginary barrier calapsing before her, and wave and wave of Harry's experiencesand feelings suddenly entered her own mind. His every memory, his every idea was hers to read, and she was a keen reader. The entirity of Harry's life history was now known to her, but there was more too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could read his thoughts, in this way Harry could talk to her even though his voice remained silent, this was so useful, she could enjoy his responses to whatever she was doing to him but could this be a two-way street? Her own thoughts, she noticed were not being read, the traffic was entirely one-way He would not know her intentions and motivations, but everything of Harry's was hers for the taking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had an idea though, she wondred if she could plant a thought in his mind. Coheuld she speak to his mind? She formulated the qeustion \"when is your birthday\" and pushed it out towards his mind and was delighted when the thought came back \"July 31.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was wonderful, she could speak telepathically with Harry Potter, the boy she was sitting on, the boy she had enslaved. She knew he had to obey her every instruction and now she could feed him instructions even if she was in a room full of people and nobody would ever know she was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke openly to Heather though \"I'm in\" she told her \"whisper me an instruction to give to Harry and I'll make him do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather hadn't realised that Hermione had succeeded but if she had managed it,... no surely not. She would offer the test though, she whispered in Hermione's ear  \"Tell Harry to slap his own face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slap your own face with your right hand\" Hermione instructed him \"make it a hard slap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry immediately swund his right hand which connected with his own cheek, it was a strong slap and his cheek started to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible!

You do not decide anything for yourself, ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hermione\" Harry thought back as his thought processes suddenly stopped.

She sat firmly upon Harry's groin area and relaxed. Both girls were now sitting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will happen when the train gets to Hogwarts?\" Hermione asked then \"how will you get home?\"<br>\r\n\"That's easy. I'll go to Hogsmeade village, that is where the train stops. From there I can use floo powder to get home.\"<br>\r\n\"Floo powder?\"<br>\r\n\"You throw it into a lit fireplace and state clearly where it is you want to go. When you step into the fireplace, you will travel there instantly. Many of the shops in Hogsmeade are connected to the floo network.\"<br>\r\n\"Useful, you have it all planned out then.\"<br>\r\n\"Almost all. I should let mother know that I am on the train so she doesn't worry. Isn't that your owl Harry?\"<br>\r\n\"He won't answer, I've asked him to be quiet. Yes, that is Harry's owl, Hedwig.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you think he'll mind if I borrow it to send a letter?\"<br>\r\n\"Even if he does, I don't think with us both sitting on him he is in any position to object.\"<br>\r\n\"Fair point.\" Ginny sribbled a note and attached it to Hedwig's foot and Hermione then opened the window. Hedwig gave Harry an inquiring look.<br>\r\n\"Nod at your owl to let her know she can send Ginny's letter\" Hermione told him.<br>\r\nHarry nodded and Hedwig set off through the window.<br>\r\n\"From now on Ginny and I can use Hedwig to send our letters\" Hermione told Harry, who nodded his acceptance. <br>\r\n\"Wonderful, that way we can stay in touch\" Ginny agreed. She was liking Hermione, they had plans for Harry which were mutually compattible, it seemed. She was sure they would soon be great friends.<br>\r\n\"You should come to my place over Christmas\" Ginny suggested \"bring Harry with you, we can have loads of fun together.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be happy to, Harry will be there as well.\"<br>\r\nGinny and Hermione continued to talk together, whilst they sat on Harry.

She is a Ravenclaw, I know that so she should be pretty smart.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know many smart girls who would like to be dictated to, do you? Why do you think she goes out with him?\"<br>\r\n\"No idea, I wouldn't put up with him that's for sure. Perhaps you could encourage her to put her foot down, to take charge.

By the time she had finished , Ron was moaning on the ground, still under the effect of a bunch of spells and the only movement he seemed to be making was that his body was jerking in occasional spasms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was conscious though, Hermione had made sure of that, one of her spells had prevented the red haired boy from passing out, for she wanted him to go right on experiencing everything she had done to him. If not for that spell then the pain he was now feeling would have knocked him unconscious in moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last spell she cast was a confundus charm which fogged his mind so that she and Harry could talk together without Ron acknowledging anything of what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few spells\" Harry asked, aghast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayble a little more than a few\" Hermione smiled back</span></div></div>",

You're already beginning to realize that you need me, that your life revolves round me\" said Hermione as she placed more pressure onto Harry's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that, Hermione realized that they were about to reach Hogwarts soon and Harry (and Ron) needed to change into their Hogwarts robes.

After a moment of Ron staring at his trunk, he opened it and got out his uniform and left the compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem my confundus charm made him an even bigger idiot. I guess he won't be missing his wand not being snapped. But then again, he did attack me twice.\" said Hermione to herself as she puled out Ron's wand and snapped it in two before tossing it right into his trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I change myself, Hermione, with you sitting on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not. I'll change you since you can't see.\" Hermione then used her wand to nlock Harry's trunk and summon his uniform and robes to her. She then used her open left arm to grab Harry's left arm and pulled him to her feet with her. Harry was to embarred to say anything as Hermione undressed him to his underwear, following her instructions to sit or stand as needed and then as she dressed him up. It was a strange feeling to have a female his age see him nearly naked and dress him. And when Hermione asked him about his silence after they were again sitting down (with Hermione sitting on top of him again, of course), Harry told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better get over that, Harry. I could tell you were embarrassed and you wern't thinking about me or my needs; you were thinking bout yourself. You need to be comfortable enough, regardless of your clothes or lack of clothes, to do what I tell you. Got that?\" said Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Hermione and Harry heard that it was time to leave the train and go to Hogwarts.

He would miss Hagrid of course, but Hermione had given him an order and Harry knew he had to obey everything she said if he wanted her to help him pass his finals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione led him to the shore of the lake and guide him as to where to place his feet as she helped him on board. Once he was on board, he guided him to sit down on the wooden bench, then she in turn resumed her seat - upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sat on him just as firmly as she had been when they were travelling on the train. Harry once gain felt her familiar presence and her weight upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before two more girls boarded their boat, one was a blonde who seemed evem less intelligent than Ron had been, the other was of Indian descent, they too were dressed in their Hogwarts robles and they took the seat opposite Harry and Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Parvati\" the Indian girl introduced herself.<br>\r\n\"I'm Lavendar\" spoke the other.<br>\r\n\"Hermione, and this is my Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two new girls suddenly noticed that Hermione wasn't alone in her seat?<br>\r\n\"That is Harry Potter isn't it!\" Parvati exclaimed, his scar was more noticeable without his glasses.<br>\r\n\"Why are you sitting on him?\" Lavendar asked<br>\r\n\"Because he is mine and I like sitting on him.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you like being sat upon?\" Parvati asked Harry<br>\r\n\"Tell he you love being under me\" Hermione stated \"also do not answer any more questions without my approval.\"<br>\r\n\"I love being sat upon by Hermione\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Lavender gave Harry a curious look. \"Would you like me to sit on you?\"<br>\r\nHarry could not answer, Hermione had not given him permisson<br>\r\n\"Please address any questions regarding Harry to me, I speak for him now.\" Hermione stated<br>\r\nCan I sit on Harry?\" Lavender asked her<br>\r\n\"Later perhaps, for now he is my seat and will stay that way. Remember that he is mine though.\"<br>\r\n\"I take it the same applies for me as well?\" Parvaiti queried.<br>\r\n\"It does indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the discussion turned to the hogwarts houses. \"I'd love to be in Gryffindor\" Hemrione remarked then \"it sounds like the most noble of all the houses.\"<br>\r\n\"I would love to be a Gryffindor\" Lavender sighed<br>\r\n\"My sister has her eye on Ravenclaw, but I guess if Harry here is sorted into Gryffindor...\" she pondered.<br>\r\n\"I can guarantee that Harry will be sorted into whichever house I decide\" Hermione announced. She had read a great deal about the sorting and she knew the hat based its decision on your own choice. She could determine which choice that would be.\"<br>\r\n\"Then lets make a pact, let's all be Gryffindors\" Parvati declared<br>\r\n\"Done!\" came two responses, with a slight nudge from Hermione, Harry also agreed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lavender and Parvati got out first, and watched as Hermione led Harry from the boat, holding him by the arm. Harry looked particularly unsteady on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't he see where he is going?\" Parvati asked.<br>\r\n\"Not when I have his glasses, no.\"H<br>\r\n\"That explains it I guess\" Lavender giggles \"but you should give them back, now. After all everyone knows that Harry wears them, he'll be expected to arrive at Hogwarts bespectacled.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess, and that Hagrid will want to know he hasn't lost them\" Hermione sighed. She reached into a pocket and gave Harry his glasses back. \"You will return them to me when I tell you\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls, with Harry now walked up towards the front gate. Even though Harry was wearing his classes and could now see perfectly well, Hermione did not release her grip on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could see Ron, some distance away. He still looked dazed and unsure of himself, so clearly Hermione's confundus spell was still in effect. Ron was being led to the castle by a couple of girls he did not recognise, who were whispering something in his ear. Harry suspected that the girls, being first years too did not know how to lift a confundus charm, or maybe they didn't want to remove it. Hermione was keeping hold of his arm so he could not get close enough to Ron to ask him. The girls seemed to have less-than-friendly expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry reached the front entrance, the door opened and a stern-looking witch appeared before them. \"Welcome to Hogwarts\" she informed them, introducing herself as Professor McGonagall then lead them off to a side room on the ground floor. Harry stood silently against one wall, and Hermione came over and stood in front of him, pressing him stepping backwards and pinning him against the wall with her backside, listening as McGonagall explained about the four houses, about house points and the cup, then she said she would return later and lead them to the sorting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione, Lavendar, and Parvati had already chosen their houses, making the sorting a formality for them. \"Remember Harry, you are a Gryffindor\" Hermione reminded him. pressing him even more firmly against the wall. The girls who were still surrounding Ron kept talking quietly to him but Harry was close enough to hear the word 'Slytherin' kept cropping up. In Ron's confounded state, Harry suspected Ron might not be able to shake that word from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione too caught sight of Ron, she had not forgiven him for the two times he had attacked her on the train, she also noticed the girls who were surrounding him. She wondered what those girls would to to him if Ron were to suddenly collapse at their feet. She was sure those girls were not trying to be his friends.</span></div></div>",

They walked back and forth over him, crushing him under their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pale blonde boy with an unplesant sneer on his face then apprached Harry and Hermione. \"So it is true, Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts\" he drawled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is true, not that it matters since Harry is now mine.\" Hermione repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Potter, got yourself a girlfriend have you?\" Draco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it is any of your business, but no I am not his girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care for your tone, filth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd watch your own mouth if I were you\" Hermione advised him, she pointed to Ron. \"Who do you think hit that boy with all those curses, and the body bind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was you?\" Malfoy \"I thought those girls had done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just told them who Weasley was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weasley, you say?

That boy still needed to be sorted after all, and less questions would be asked if he was sorted with the rest of the students. Having been trampled by a group of girls though, he looked even worse than he had before. For some reason though, McGonagall didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are ready for you now, line up single file and follow me\" she instructed. Hermione stood in front of Harry, Lavender and Parvati stood behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way out of their little room and through the large double doors that marked the entrance of the Great Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I is bewitched to match the sky outside\" Hermione was saying \"I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in single file towards the front of the hall, where an old hat had been placed upon a stool. Soon the hole opened in the brim of the hat and it started singing. Harry wanted to hear the song but Hermione was speaking to him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I don't think I'd be permitted to sit on you during the sorting\" she commented \"but that doesn't matter too much. I believe we will be sorted in alphabetical order, so Lavender will be called shortly, I'll be summoned a little while later and Parvati sould be sorted just before you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Harry, you are a Gryffindor. You will convince the hat to sort you into Gryffindor, there is no alternative for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you have been sorted, you will come to the Gryffindor table. I will be sitting there waiting for you. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will sit on me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will say 'Hermione, please will you use me as your seat cushion'' I will then stand up and you will take my seat, I will then resume my place - upon you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the students were called, and as the names were read out, it was clear that they would indeed be sorted in alphabetical order of surname. Lavender was shorted soon after and became a Gryffindor, then before long Hermione was also sorted into Gryffindor.\" I'll see you in a few minutes\" she reminded Harry as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco Malfoy, the boy who Harry had seen first in the robe shop, then had tried to talk to him in the other room became a Slytherin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati Patil was sorted info Gryffindor, even though her sister was Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPotter, Harry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry walked over to the seat and took his place. Just before the hat was placed on his head, he looked over at the Gryffindor table and saw Hermione sitting there, waiting. He was sure that very soon he would be joining her not only at that table, but in that seat and he would be the one underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hat dopped on his head and the hat spoke to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" it pondered \"I see your mind, I would have thought you would be difficult, Potter but your mind is made up. Miss Granger has claimed you and you are determined to do as she asks, so determined in fact that you won't even listen to an alternative. You are ensnared by great magic that not even I can penetrate. Therefore I have only one option for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gryffindor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, he had done as she asked. That was all that mattered to him, he would always do as she asked and now he had another instruction to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe removed the hat and laid it down on the chair, before he walked off towards the Gryffindor table. Hermione was waiting for him, a smile on her face. On either side of her sat Parvati and Lavender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Harry, welcome to Gryffindor\" Hermione remarked \"was there something you wanted to say to me?\" She acted innocent, but she knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione, pleaase will you use me as your seat cushion\" Harry spoke the words in a voice which carried throughout the Great Hall. There were gasps from a number of places as he spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will, Harry\" she smiled as she stood up. Harry then took her vacated seat and a moment later Hermione sat back down, reclaiming both her place at the table and Harry at the same time, she brought her full weight to bear once more upon the boy she was once again sitting upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, glasses\" she said then. Harry understood the instruction and removed his glasses, returning his vision to what was once more just a sea of shades and shapes. Hermione took his glasses and pocketed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's world was once again filled with sound and sensation, the sensation was the increasingly familiar presence of Hermione sitting on him but this was joined by two more bodies, either side of him. Lavender and Parvati had closed ranks, and were now pressing their own thighs into him, squashing him between them as Hermione continued to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his seat at the staff table, Professor Snape looked over at Harry but Harry did not feel any pain in his scar this time, he did not get any sense of hated aimed his way. Snape had heard the boy's remark and he was sure that the girl who was now sitting on Harry was controlling him, dominating him. He could just amuse himself by watching proceedings from the staff table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorting continued and soon it was Ron's name that was called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

Harry could see she had resumed whispering in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did not hear what the hat was saying inside Ron's head, or his silent voice which spoke back. That conversation was private, between student and hat alone but he did hear the hat's announcement to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slytherin!\" it called. For whatever reason, Ron was the first person in his family not to become a Gryffindor, his path had been altered by Hermione and two other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon did not seem happy to be joining the Slytherin ranks, nor did the Slytherin table seem to welcome him. His name was certainly not welcomed among the snakes. The Slytherin boys turned their backs on him, including Malfoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a couple of girls however who knew that their plan had succeeded and that they had managed to pull a Weasley into the Slytherin ranks, where they undoubtedly had plans for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was speaking now to a third year girl, who looked at Ron and began to grin mischievously. As Ron reached her, she grabbed him and pulled him onto the seat beside her. Another third year sat on the seat on the other side of him, she had taken out her wand and seemed to be wondering which curse to use first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see him as a Slytherin\" Harry commented to Hermione who was sitting on him.\" Without his glasses, he couldn't make out what was happening at the Slytherin table but he could hear Ron's sorting and knew where he had been placed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about him any more\" Hermione responded \"I doubt you'll see much of him any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Slytherin girls girls have claimed him, and now so have the older girls. I'd say that Ronald Weasley is in for some real torment amongst the Slytherins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your plan all along wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it turned out sort-of how I expected. I just wasn't sure how long it would be before the Slytherins got their hands on him but I knew they would soon enough. Now, he is doomed. He will spend the rest of his days living under the thumbs of the Slytherins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to do that to me are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you keep obeying me, you are doing a wonderful job of that, doing everything I tell you.

As Hermione was eating her dinner, people kept asking her how she got the Harry Potter as her seat cushion. The very first time, she was honest and told them that Harry was hers and that he enjoyed his new place in life but when people still asked her, she started spouting facts from Hogwarts, A History to shut out the idiots who were bothering her. It was no shock to her that only guys were asking her, after all; the Gryffindor girls didn't bother her and gave their own subtle nods of respect. Hermione was also really annoyed by Percy Weasley because he said how improper it was for her to be doing such things to the Boy-Who-Lived in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry meanwhile, was starting to get very hungry. It had been a very long time since he had eaten snacks with Ron. To Harry, it felt a lot longer since that was before he met Hermione. He did not say a word about his hnger, however, becase he trusted her. He knew that she would feed him eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was busy talking with Lavender and Parvati about Harry's sleeping situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do abut Harry when we go to bed? Girls and boys sleep in separate dorms?\" asked Parvati.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question, Parvati\" responded Hermione. \"Harry is mine and he has accepted this fact. With luck, Hogwarts will see to it that Harry is allowed into our dorms. Besides, I'm afraid what will happen to Harry if he sleeps with boys. After tonight, Harry won't be liked by his male peers and they may resort to bullying if I am not present. But I'd like to hear Harry's opinion about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If possible, I'd like to be with you Hermione\" said Harry, with images of the Hogwarts boys morphing into Dudley and his gang in his head. \"I'd be much safer with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione, Lavender, and Parvati smiled at his answer and Hermione replied \"Good answer, Harry. You have been so good today, I'm giving you a full plate of food that you like as a reward. But if you ever displease me, I'll make sure your meals become not so pleasant.\" Hermione then slightly turned her head as she fed the nearly blind Harry his food so he wouldn't make a mess. This occurence shocked a lot of peope in the Great Hall. But since Harry wasn't used to eating a lot because of the Dursleys, he could only finish off three-fourths of the plate full of great food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Harry. From now on, I will only feed you three-quarters of a plate of food during a meal. Should you ever not finish even that, I'll reduce your portions even more. This is your punishment. Food should not be wasted; this time I will finish it for you. Understand, Harry?\" asked Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione\" said Harry in a sad voice. Harry felt like he let Hermione down by not eating all that she had offered him. He did not want to let Hermione down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded her head in response and true to her word, ate the rest of Harry's plate. Eventually, Professor Dumbledore gave some announcements, most notably about avoiding the right hand side of the third floor corridor, and then led al of Hogwars in singing their school song. After everyone was done singing, he let them go to bed.     </span></div></div>",

The girls snickered to themselves as he ascended the first step, then the second, the third... and so on. It took a few minutes but he eventually made it to the top. The girls followed along behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you will be sleeping with us from now on\" Hermione told him at that point.<br>\r\n\"Isn't this the boys staircase?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"No, the girls\" Lavender informed him.<br>\r\n\"If you didn't belong up here then the staircase wouldn't have let you up, it would have collapsed and dropped you down to the bottom.\"<br>\r\n\"Perhaps that is what will happen if he tries to go up to the boys' dorms\" Hermione mused \"he is mine, so he belongs with me. This staircase knows that.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's try and find out\" Parvati giggled.<br>\r\nThey led him back downstairs, and to the foot of the boys staircase.<br>\r\n\"Climb, Harry\" Hemione informed him.<br>\r\nHe had crawled up no more than the first couple of steps when the staircase fell away and Harry dropped down to the common room floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That confirms it\" Hermione nodded \"you don't belong with the boys any more, you are mine and you live under me. You will join us in our dorm, you will sleep there from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione\" Harry agreed, realising he had no choice in the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey led him back up to the top of the staircase which led to the girls dorms and the first doorway they came across said 'First Years'.<br>\r\n\"We are in here\" Hermione told Hermione as she brought him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in a room filled with four-poster beds, beside each of these beds was a trunk which had been brought up from the train, one of the beds though had two trunks beside it. There was also another doorway against one wall which led to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked at the two trunks which were together, and giggled \"I told you that you were sleping with me, your trunk has been brought up and placed with mine.\" she told Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First though, I will relieve you of your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, remembering that she had changed him into his robes on the train, and realising that she would probably be dressing and undressing him from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione unfastened then removed his robe first, and then his tie and shirt. She then removed his belt and unfastened his trousers and started pulling them down. She then helped Harry to sit on the toilet whilst she took off his shoes, socks and his troursers. At this point Harry was dressed only in his boxer shorts. Hermione folded his clothes neatly and placed them in a pile on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Harry\" she advised \"since you are an the toilet, you may as well make use of it. I would suggest you lower your boxers though since we don't want you to have any littlIe accidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Harry really needed to pee, it had been some time since he had last used the toilet but he wasn't happy about Hermione being in the room with him. Still, he managed to drop his boxers so they hung around his ankles and remained seated on the tiolet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must you?\" he asked, embarrassment in his voice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must I what? You need some encouragement to go pee, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came over to where he was sitting on the toilet, and joined him. When she sat upon him this time, her presence was even more noticeable. In his practically-undressed state, she was even closer to him than before, her own body made contact with his in several places; most significantly the underside of her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not moving until I am sure you have relieved yourself\" she informed him \"so go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was by now used to being under her, but the fact that she was now sitting on him on the toilet clearly showed how natural the act had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a couple of minutes, and Harry could feel Hermione upon him the entire time. Eventually though, he started to urinate into the bowl. When he was finally dune, and Hermione was satisfied that he had finished, she flushed and then stood up, lifting Harry with her. She even helped him to shift his boxers back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took Harry over to the sink where she brushed his teeth and washed his face and body with soap, water and cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better\" she approved as she was towelling him off \"now let's go back and rejoin the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took up the pile of Harry's clothes and then unlocked the door so they could leave together.</span></div></div>",

Harry you will lay on my bed, face upwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender and Parvati slipped off the bed to give Harry room, and he dutifully laid down on top of the mattress, his head on the pillow. Immediately, Hermione came over and sat down upon his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Lavender who opened Harry's trunk and took out the sweets, \"When did you get these?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry purchased them on the train, he and Ron were sharing them when I arrived but they hadn't eaten many at that point. I sat on Harry of course, so he wasn't going to eat any more, and despite my suggestion that Ron finish them in peace, he tried to attack me. I stopped him, easily I would add so he wasn't going to be stuffing his face either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you took them?\" Parvati nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see any reason to leave them on the train, so I tidied them away whilst I was helping Harry into his robes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to share them with Harry now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Harry didn't finish his dinner, he shouldn't have anything more to eat. I don't think Harry should eat sweets any more anyway, he clearly doesn't have the appetite for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be a shame to let them go to waste\" Lavender sighed as she joined Hermione, sitting upon Harry's groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thoughts exactly girls, let's have a little late night snack of our own.\" Hermione agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes let's\" Parvati giggled as she came over to Hermione's bed and sat down on Harry's legs. All three girls were now sitting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could now feel all three girls upon him. By now he had gotten used to Hermione sitting on his lap but when she sat on his chest, there was an increased pressure, she felt even heavier than usual and now hwo other girls had joined her. Between them they were pressing him firmly into the mattress beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, they talked among themselves and tucked into the sweets he had purchased on the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly was the arrangement which bound him to you?\" Lavendar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him that if he obeyed my every instruction, I might help him with his end-of-year tests.\" She put the same emphasis on the word 'might'. \"He told me himself that on his own he never learns anything, so on his own he is hopeless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you help him when the time comes?\" Parvati queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did not see the shake of Hermione's head at that point. What she said out loud was \"It doesn't matter either way, Harry has given himself to me willingly, and there is no obligation on my part to do anything in return. He is obliged to obey my every instruction. Whether I assist him or not, the fact remains that he now belongs to me. He is mine, forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't just change his mind?\" Lavender asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he has bound himself to be and I would say his magic or mine has enforced that bond. Why else do you think he can come up our staircase and not the one to the boys' dorms? The fact that he could not get to the top of those stairs means he could not overcome his commitment to me, and of course his trunk is right here. He belongs to me now. Isn't that right Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true you can do magic already?\" Parvati asked her \"I seem to recall you said to that Malfoy boy that you had done loads to him. Was that just bravado?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. I hit him a few times, knocked him out then when he came round I used his own wand on him. Harry was there, he'll confirm it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true\" Harry confirmed \"I couldn't see much of what was going on but I heard it all. She beat him senseless, cast loads of spells on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you teach us?\" Parvati asked \"clearly you are smart if you know so much already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Hermione smiled \"starting tomorrow I'll teach you everything I know, then we can study some more spells and become powerful witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm comfortable right now, I don't want Harry to start jumping around under me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't he learn the spells as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might hear the words, but his eye sight is so poor he won't have a clue about our wand movements. There is no way he can reproduce our magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, from tomorrow then\" Lavender agreed, then she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should get to sleep\" she remarked \"goodnight\". She got off Harry then moved over to her own bed, drawing her curtains around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\" Parvati added \"see you in the mormning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Parvati left, Hermione was alone, still sitting on Harry and considering where he should spend the night.</span></div></div>",

She pulled back the covers and guided Harry back to the bed, but this time facing downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not want you drooling on my in your sleep, Harry.\" Hermione then pulled out her wand and pointd it at Harry. \"Petrificus Totalus! Silencio! There, now you won't move around in your sleep or snore\", said Hermione happily as she got out her nightie from her trunk and then went to the bathroom to change and get ready for bed. She came back to her bed and put Harry's glasses in her bedside drawer and locked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Harry\" said Hermione as she completely laid on top of him and pulled the covers over them, knowing full well he could not answer her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they did not know it, they both shared the same dream, but from their own perspectives. In the dream, Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender were practicing spells in their very dorm room. They were all drassed in their own casual clothes so it must have been at night or on a weekend. They were all sitting on Harry on Hermione's bed as the girls were all laughing and having a good time. But what was very odd was Harry's clothes. He wasn't wearing his old Dursley hand-me-downs. Those old hand-me-downs could actually be seen burning away in the fireplace. He was appearing to wear an old pillowcase as clothes and they looked remarkable similar to the pillowcase on Hermione's bed and that Harry was directly resting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream Hermione was even telling Harry that from now on, when he wasn't in his Hogwarts clothes, he was going to be wearing his current attire or nothing at all. And if she was lucky, then she might even be able to have Harry wear the pillowcase as a substitute for his Hogwarts uniform as well. When morning came, only Hermione remembered the dream and she was wondering why on Earth Harry was wearing what appeared to be her pillowcase. Being fairly new to the Wizarding World, she decided to ask Lavender and Parvati if that meant anything significant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was so wonderful to be able to sleep on Harry all night. And since I paralyzed him and made him silent, no snoring and no tossing around in bed from my Harry. However, I had an odd dream last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd? In what way?\" asked Parvati.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then told her new friends all the details she remembered from her dream. As she was finishing, she asked them what was the significance in Harry wearing her piillowcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender and Parvati giggled as Lavender said \"In the dream, you're making Harry dress like a house elf. House elves are beings that are mostly enslaved by witches and wizards. The only way to free a house elf is to give them a piece of clothing. As such, enslaved elves normally wear pillowcases. Harry is not a house elf of course, so those clothes rules do not apply even though he is essentially enslaved by you. However, in your dream, you are making Harry dress like one anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interresting. Harry is my property and if our culture says slaves are not worthy to wear clothes, then that would make sense if I were to enforce that. My dreamself also mentioned perhaps having it replace his Hogwarts uniform as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati and Lavender just burst out laughing at that. \"Well you would make a good argument to the staff. Generally, only house elves are enslaved but Harry's a unique circumstance.\" said Parvati. \"Going by those rules, you could make the argument that Harry is not worthy to wear even his Hogwarts uniform. But if that's indeed the future, how were you able to see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it had to do with the bond that Harry and I now share. Like you said, it's unique for a wizard to be enslaved by a witch like this. So maybe we can see certain things involving the two of us. Who knows? It hasn't been a full 24 hours yet\" said Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So should we burn his non-Hogwarts clothes tonight like in the dream?\" asked Lavender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, maybe. We'll see how the day goes. At the very least, I'd like to do it within a week. It would make dressing Harry every day much quicker after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry. How about we get ourselves and Harry ready for the day and go to breakfast?\" asked Parvati as Lavender and Hermione nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think all I need is find some way to get the approval of the professors, then we can make him dress like one of those elves.\"<br>\r\n\"How are you going to arrange that?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I can think of something by the end of the day.\"<br>\r\n\"If you are giving him a bath, do you want to borrow any of these?\" Lavender asked.

She then turned and seated herself upon his back. \"Wake up, Harry\" she told him.<br>\r\nWhen Harry did not initially stir, she bounced on him a couple of times. \"Wakey Wakey\" she spoke a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, Hermione stood up and lifted him from the bed. \"Good morning, sleepy head\" she told him \"let's get you cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender had left the bathroom by the time Hermione dragged Harry inside, Lavender's cleaning products were laid out on the shelf behind the bath, Harry and Hermione's clothes were in two piles on the floor. Once they were both inside, Hermione closed and locked the door. Waving her wand at the bath, she enlarged it so they would both comfortably fit in it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the taps, she started to fill the bath whilst she pulled down his boxer shorts. She then instructed him to sit on the toilet again which he did, she removed his boxers at that point and sat down upon him. Harry was now completely naked under her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Harry had relieved himself, she got up and instructed him to lay in the bath. She then stripped off her own clothes and sat on the toilet herself, as she did so she reached over and applied some of Lavender's salts to the bath water, turning off the taps when she could see that the bath had filled sufficiently. Harry could hear her using the toilet whilst he waited obediently in the bath, then he could hear the sound of the toilet being flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then got in to the bath with Harry, sitting firmly upon his chest, facing forward with her legs on either side of him. She sat like that for a few minutes then she started to wash his face and neck. She moved back and forward across him, sitting where was most convenient was she washed him all over, including his hair upon which she applied used feminine shampoo and conditioner. She remained seated upon his chest whilst she also cleaned herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished, she pulled Harry out of the bath, let the water drain away then used her wand to return the bath to its normal shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed his teeth at the sink, then whilst she was applying Lavenders talc, deodorant and purfume she game him some more instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone asks about your glasses, Harry, tell them you have decided to stop wearing them\" she advised. She was already devising a plan for how she might win over the professors and this was the first part of it. Also, it would stop people from wondering what happened to his glasses. Some people, such as that Hagrid knew that he wore them and he could not disguise the fact that he was almost totally blind without them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving also applied her own cosmetics, it was time to get dressed. She gave Harry some of her own underwear to put on rather than his own boxer shorts. If all went well he would not be wearing any regular clothes after today. She then gave him fresh socks and a clean shirt before putting on his trouses, tie and robes. Instructing him to stand or sit on the toilet seat as necessary. Before she assisted him into his trousers, she felt inside the pocket and removed his Gringotts key. She would be keeping that from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point she dressed herself then unlocked the door and led Harry out of the bathroom. \"Thank you for the use of your bath products\" she smiled at Lavender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then led Harry over to a  chair beside her bed and sat on him whilst Lavender, and then Parvati used the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat she applied an intricate little locking charm over Harry's chest. Unlike the regular locking charm, it would remain in place and could only ever be opened after waving your wand over it in a very specific pattern. As Harry could see so little without his glasses, there was no way he would ever be able to duplicate the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all ready, the girls as group led Harry down to the Great Hall for breakfast</span></div></div>",

Parvati's body was tanned, but that was not what Harry detected. She had come from a warmer climate though, and her body seemed to radiate a certain warmth though which reflected through to him, there was also a different texture to her skin. He was sure he could tell instantly whether Hermione or Parvati were sitting on him, he could not say the same for Lavender though for she had not sat on him alone yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he could tell was that Hermione and Lavender had sat on either side of him, so closely that they were squashing him between their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati had taken Hermione's instruction that she could sit on him as firmly as she liked quite literally.

The plate contained three slices of buttered toast and nothing more.<br>\r\n\"Here is your breakfast, we know you haven't got much of an appetite\" she informed him \"when you have finished those, I'll give you some water to drink.\"<br>\r\nHaving so recently arrived at the school, Harry didn't know all that much about butterbeer or pumpkin juice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione noticed, as she ate that there didn't appear to be any sign of Ron at the Slytherin table, \"I wonder what happened to Weasley\" she mused.<br>\r\n\"I'll go and nose around a bit\" Lavender responded \"Slytherin table, yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\nHarry felt the pressure on his body ease on one side as Lavender left the table, it returned a couple of minutes later.<br>\r\n\"Apparently he is in the hospital wing\" she informed them \"I heard a group of third year Slytherin girls gloating about it.\"<br>\r\n\"Clearly they have been having some fun\" Hermione smiled \"as are we.\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed we are\" Parvati agreed \"Harry is such a squishy seat, I like feeling him squish.\"<br>\r\n\"As do I\" Hermione nodded \"that privilege is yours for now.\"<br>\r\nParvati applied even more pressure upon Harry at that point.<br>\r\n\"Do you think that if I sat on him firmly enough, and for long enough that I might squish him completely flat?\" she asked then. <br>\r\n\"I'm not sure Hermione would want a flat Harry\" Lavender remarked.<br>\r\n\"I'd like to know I can restore him afterwards\" Hermione commented \"he is far more comfortable a seat when you can feel him under there.\"<br>\r\n\"But do you think it is possible?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I wouldn't have thought so but this is a school of magic, I don't think anything is beyond the realm of possibility. Don't try anything like that until I have researched it though.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Parvati admitted, but she did not ease up in any way upon the boy she was still sitting upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had all eaten their fill, and Harry had finished his toast and water, the discussion turned to their first classes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is our first lesson today?\" Lavender asked?<br>\r\n\"Double Potions with Professor Snape\" Hermione replied as she consulted her timetable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wandered up a few flights of stairs to the Hospital Wing. The nurse didn't appear to be around, but she saw Ron in a nearby bed.

We would not have minded Hufflepuff which is house of decent, hard working people, and whilst we knew you hardly qualified, we would of been okay with Ravenclaw but now you have chosen to shack up with the snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your father and I have never been so disgusted. As a result of this most grave of insults, we have decided to expel you from our family. Your picture has been dismissed from the family portraits, your likeness has been burned from the family tree.

We will ship all your belongings to the school, you can collect them from Professor Dumbledore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncidentally Gunny has been asking about Harry Potter, if you see him then can you please ask him to write back to her. She eagerly awaits his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the last letter that Errol will ever send you, and he knows it. Don't bother asking him to write back to us, he won't accept any of your mail. I am sure he is already on his way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur home, but no longer yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith disregards<br>\r\nYour mother (formerly)<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut tut tut, Ron\" Hermione uttered as she finished reading \"it seems you have lost everything, except perhaps your Slytherin identity. You still have a place in their house, even though they clearly don't want you either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying this aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ron. Very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped him again.<br>\r\n\"Forget that word, Ron unless you want me to keep on hitting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I even have the letter back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This letter?\" she showed it to him so he could read it for himself, but still kept it out of his reach.<br>\r\n\"No\" she added, once she was sure he had read it all. She scrunched it into a ball and laid it on the palm of her hand. Waving her wand over it, the letter bust into flames but the flames did not harm her at all. Once the letter had burned down to ash, the flames died leaving her hand completely unmarked. She then blew the ashes over Ron's bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am getting used to enchanted fires\" she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your former sister's fascination with Harry?\" Hermione asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't get enough of him, ever since Fred and George told her who she was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fred and George.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My twin brothers, they both have red hair like all my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No longer brothers, no longer family\" Hermione amended \"I think I saw them at the Gryffidnor table during the feast. Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They told Ginny who you were, and she immediately asked her mother if she could go on the train so she could meet Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were her intentions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure exactly. If Harry wrote to her, perhaps she could tell him. Now will you please leave, I have nothing more to say to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Ronald\" Hermione nodded, getting up but before I go I will give you back something that you have clearly lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sense of befuddlement\" she added as she pointed her wand at him and cast the confundus charm again.

Did she have a crush on him, or was it something else. Were Ginny's plans for Harry anything like her own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had not yet had chance to introduce herself to Harry's owl, she didn't expect for a moment that she would deliver the letter for her, but she rather hoped that she would. Apparently the Weasleys had seen Harry's owl, so Ginny might recognise it if she saw it again. If she saw Harry's owl delivering the message then she might be more willing to write back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the owlery, she started to compose a note on a spare piece of parchment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nGinny<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not know me yet but my name is Hermione Granger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother (or from what I here ex-brother Ron tells me that you asking about Harry Potter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and I met on the train and we had an immediate connection. We have already become very close and as such I have taken it upon myself to provide for his every need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am also told that when you found out who he was, you wanted to board the train and join him. I wonder why this is. As his own request, he has asked me to take care of all his interests, do you have designs on the boy who lived?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you do not take me seriously then I will make sure you never get anywhere near him, so please reply to this message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Harry's own owl flow down and landed on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Hedwig\" she said then \"you remember me from the train don't you, You saw me sitting on Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedwig gave a soft hoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember that shortly after that he gave himself to me completely, and unconditionally.

Harry no longer owned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione quickly wrote on the bottom of the note. \"I am sure you recognise the owl who delivered this. Hedwig will be handling my letters from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then attached the letter to the owl's leg and Hedwig flew off with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to wait a while for GInny's repsonse she was sure, even if Ginny did respond.

She had remained seated whilst she waited for Hermione to return, and she was perfectly happy to continue for Harry was a comfortable seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though Hermione did return and told her about what she had discovered about Ron in the hospital wing, and about her trip to the owlery. Parvati and Lavender both laughed when they heard that his family had disowned him. \"Serves him right, he shouldn't have acted that way towards you.\"<br>\r\n\"No he shouldn't and it seems those Slytherin girls are having some real fun with him\" Hermione agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued and Parvati smiled when she heard about Hedwig.<br>\r\n\"So Harry's owl is yours now?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, she has turned her back on Harry and accepted me instead, I've always wondered what it would be like to own an owl and now I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ought we not to be getting to classes\" Lavender asked \"I've heard Snape can be mean, it would be best not to be late for Potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that means I'll have to get up\" Parvati signed \"I was so enjoying sitting on Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it won't be too long before he as back under you\" Hermione promised \"but Lavender is right, we should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got to their feet, lifted Harry from the bench where he had been pressed by Parvati for so long, and carried him from the Great Hall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way down the staircase which led to the dungeons and entered the Potions classroom. The class had not yet started and there were still spaces, including room for 4 people to sit together in a row near the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one of us should sit on Harry?\" Parvati asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's feel things out first\" Hermione suggested \"we don't know how Snape will feel about Harry being sat upon by us during his class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that Harry was allowed to sit for now between Hemione and Parvati. Lavender sat on the other side of Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each got out their scales, cauldrons and other items they would need for this lesson. Nobody bothered to take anything out for Harry though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Snape entered the room. He have a short speech about 'no foolish wand waving' and talked about 'bottling fame, brewing glory and stoppering death' His eyes swept the room and saw that Harry was not looking his way, or was trying but failing due to his poor eyesight. What was more significant was that there was nothing on the desk in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly though, someone here feels my classes aren't worth the effort\" he snorted \"Mr Potter, our new celebrity.\" He drew out the word 'celebrity' making it sound as ominous as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Potter. What would I get if I added powdered root of aspadel to an infusion of wormwood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know? Where might you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't lmw, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfsbane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity, clearly fame isn't everything, is it Potter? 10 points from Gryffindor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemrione wasn't pleased about the lack of points, but what she had seen of Snape had clearly told her that he was not at all fond of Harry, perhaps she could use that to her advantage. Perhaps she had found the professor who could me most receptive to making her dream a reality. She therefore wanted to get on this professor's good side, Lavender said he could be nasy if provoked so she didn't want to provoke him. She knew the answers to all three of the questions he had asked Harry of course, but she prudently chose not to draw attention to the fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry still had not made eye contact with Snape, the professor had noticed. \"Why aren't you looking at me when I talk to you, Potter?\" he asked \"are you blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione at this point decided the time had come to start leading Snape's mind in a certain direction so finally she spoke up. \"He does wear glasses normally, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape sneered at Harry. \"Really, where are your glasses, Potter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this direct question, Hermione's earlier instruction forced him to speak as he had been told. \"I chose not to wear them any more\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You chose not to wear them, arrogant as well as blind. Do you take anything seriously? Why did you even bother coming to Hogwarts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I, Get out of my sight. I don't want to see you for the rest of this lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione saw her chance. \"May I sit on him, Professor?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may indeed, Miss Granger\" he nodded \"keep him out of my sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir\" Hermione then moved a cross and seated herself firmly upon Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape was well aware of course that Hermione had sat upon Harry during the feat, and the way she had suggested doing so again told him that she intended to make a habit of it. He was intrigued. \"Take back those ten points for your excellent suggestion\" he informed her \"and every class of mine that you spend sitting on Potter will earn you five additional points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione beamed, all she had to do was sit on Harry during Snape's classes and she would amass a ton of points for Gryffindor. She was earning the professor's approval. Perhaps that might make him more receptive to the suggestion she would make a little later. Everything was working according to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could feel Hemrione sitting on him again, and just as fully as she had before. This time though, he knew he would remain under her for at least the next couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something else I would like to ask you sir, but it can wait until we have a quiet time or the end of the lesson\" Hermione offered then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind\" Snape countered \"for now concentrate on your potion, we will talk on this other matter later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded and remained seated upon Harry as she started to work on her potion. She didn't have to go and hunt for her ingredients, unlike the other students either. Everything she needed was provided for her. Snape clearly did not want her to move from her 'seat'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around an hour later when Snape came over to talk with her. He glanced at her cauldron and nodded. Clearly he could see no fault with her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was this other matter you wanted to discuss?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Sir, I was thiking about Harry, I believe you when you said that a boy that arrogant does not deserve to be at the school.\"<br>\r\n\"I do not seek your approval, Miss Granger.\"<br>\r\n\"No sir, well I would like to offer an alternative to simply expelling him, you might find it a little more - entertaining.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n\"Well sir, I think we can both agree that if Harry doesn't care for his education then he has no right to wear that uniform.\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed, yet you you speak of an alternative to expelling him.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think expelling him would serve any purpose. I would lose this seat of mine and he would just take that arrogance elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest.<br>\r\n\"I would suggest instead a punishment which would humiliate him and put him firmly in his place.\"<br>\r\n\"Go on.\"<br>\r\n\"I have been learning about house elves sir, enslaved creatures who are forced to wear nothing more than a pillow case for they are not allowed proper clothing.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, there are a number of them who work in the school kitchens.\"<br>\r\n\"Well sir, perhaps we could compel Harry here to dress in the same way, at least until he agrees to put his glasses on again.\"<br>\r\nSnape actually laughed at that. \"Perfect!\" he cried \"take another ten points Miss Granger. I'll propose it to the rest of the staff, but the one I will really need to convince is his Head of House, Professor McGonagall. She is the one who has the final say with regard to Gryffindors.<br>\r\n\"Of course, thank you sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was delighted of course. By proposing her idea as a form of punishment for refusing to wear his glasses, she might even be able to get McGonagall to agree, and then she and the other first year girls could put Harry in that pillowcase and burn all his clothes. He wouldn't need them again. It did not matter that she herself had robbed him of his glasses, nobody would think that since Harry himself would continue to ascertain that his not wearing them was his own idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potions class continued, and by the end of it Hermione, Lavender and Parvati had all produced perfect potions. Snape gave Gryffindor five more points a piece before he dismissed the class.</span></div></div>",

I think you are more than due.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, thank you Hermione\" she smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was, that whilst Hermione and Parvati searched the Transfiguration shelves, Lavender led him to an empty table in the corner which had three seats surrounding it. She instructed Harry to sit in the nearest seat, and as soon as he had done so, she joined him there by sitting on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could clearly tell that the girl who was now sitting on him was neither Hermione nor Parvati, but curiously, because Hermione had taken his glasses from him on the train, Harry had no clue as to what Lavender or Parvati looked like. He was aware that Parvati was an Indian girl, but Lavender was a complete mystery to him. Like the other two girls, Lavender sat firmly, using her full weight to press him into the seat. There was also a delicate yet distinctly feminine fragrance which reminded Harry of the bath products that Hermione had used with him earlier. He was under no doubt right now that ther person sitting on him was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Hermione and Parvati returned and took the other two seats at the table. \"We've looked at some Transfiguration books and this one is probably the best choice, giving each of them a copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Advanced Transfiguration by Emeric Switch\" Lavender read \"well at least we are familiar with the author.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed the more advanced stuff is really interesting\" Parvati mused \"especially that book I saw about Animagi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is really advanced magic\" Hermione nodded \"and anyone who succeeds in becoming an animagi needs to register with the ministry. We could look into it later perhaps. McGonagall would most likely wrap us all up in red tape for days if we managed to pull off anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, for now we just want to demonstrate that we can transfigure normal stuff\" Lavender agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati leafed through her copy of the book. \"This looks quite tricky\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure between us we can get through it\" Hermione assured her \"which spell should we try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this one?\" Lavender asked \"turning a sock into a glove, we all have socks after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemrione nodded. \"Good point, let's give it a go?\" She took off one of her socks, as did Parvati. Hermione helped Lavender to remove her sock so that she could remain seated upon Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir first attempts were not entirely successful, but it was Hermione who managed to perform the spell correctly first, and then showed the others how it was done. They followed this spell up with two more from the book, and within half an hour they had all mastered all three spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should really impress McGonagall\" Hermione smiled as she collected their books and returned them to the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After leaving the library, the girls guided Harry to the Transfiguration class. They were so excited about what they were set to accomplish, that they wanted to be the first ones in class. When they got to the classroom, it was empty and they found a nice row in front that could seat four people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Harry, you are going to sit between myself and Lavender at the start of class. If Professor McGonagall does a notes section of class before actually practicing Transfiguration, you are not to take notes; you wouldn\u2019t be able to see them anyway\u201d said Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Hermione\u201d, replied Harry as Hermione was already taking him to his seat. After Harry was seated between Hermione and Lavender, with Parvati on Hermione\u2019s other side, Hermione continued giving Harry instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we get to the practical part of class, you will not attempt transfiguration until Professor McGonagall directly asks you to do so. However, if you fail, then you need to turn to me (here Hermione turned Harry\u2019s head gently to indicate where to turn), and say \u2018Hermione, can you please do this for me?\u2019 and give me your wand. After that, I\u2019ll take your wand and do it for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender and Parvati giggled when Harry replied that he would; that would put him in an even worse light with Professor McGonagall as it would give her the impression that he was giving up on attempting his task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, other students (the other male Gryffindors and the Hufflepuffs) started entering the classroom. The Gryffindors were glaring angrily at Harry as they were severely disappointed in him, but made no attempt to talk to him or the girls with him. After a while, Professor McGonagall entered the classroom and started the class. After roll call, she mentioned that she would not tolerate students who didn\u2019t take the class seriously or those who goofed off in class and she sent a small glare at Harry and turned her desk into a pig and then back to a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she began giving them a lot of notes to copy down and she was internally furious that Harry, who was not wearing his glasses as well, was the only one not taking notes. After that, she gave everyone matches and told them to turn it into a needle. Over the next ten minutes, students were attempting to turn their needles into matches. Most students could only turn it silver or pointy and Neville Longbottom was having no luck at all but was trying his best nonetheless. Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender were the only ones to completely turn their matches into needles and got fifteen points each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations, girls. It\u2019s not often that I see such splendid work in one\u2019s first class with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Professor McGonagall\u201d replied Hermione. \u201cWe\u2019ve been practicing even higher transfiguration in our free time. Would you like to see?\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d said a smiling Professor McGonagall. She raised her eyebrows a bit when Hermione and Lavender bent down and pulled off Harry\u2019s shoes, then his socks, and put his shoes back on. To her great surprise, Lavender and Parvati both turned one of Harry\u2019s socks into a glove. Hermione then reached over into Harry and pulled out his tie; she then turned the tie into a very long rope. It was by no coincidence that the girls had chosen pieces of Harry\u2019s clothes to transfigure for their demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastic! That\u2019s very advanced transfiguration. Thirty more points each for Gryffindor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, she turned her gaze at Harry and directly asked him to turn his match into a needle since he hadn't tried yet. Harry was only going off of the spell he kept hearing everyone say, but not knowing where his match was, just pointed straight on the desk and said the spell to no effect. What she heard next, after he had attempted the spell just one time, shocked her to her core and the rest of the students (save for the 3 female Gryffindor 1st years).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHermione, can you please do this for me?\u201d asked Harry as he turned towards Hermione (remembering her subtle instruction from earlier) and held out his wand with his palm open. Hermione took Harry\u2019s wand and then replied that she would and did it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of this, Mr. Potter?! You ask your fellow Gryffindor to do the task for you?\u201d asked Professor McGonagall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it, Professor, so I asked Hermione to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear anymore of this, Mr. Potter. You obviously do not take your education seriously and it is very clear to me that Professor Snape was right about you. Perhaps the punishment idea that he presented at lunch will straighten you out\u201d said Professor McGonagall, to the confusion of everyone who was not in the know. \u201cClass dismissed except for the 4 Gryffindors at this table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the students left the classroom, whispering and speculating what Harry\u2019s punishment would be, she glared angrily at Harry.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAs your Head of House, I declare that until you start wearing your glasses again and take your education seriously, you are not to wear your Hogwarts uniform. You are to wear the attire of a house elf, a pillowcase, and attend your classes as the seat cushion of Miss Granger, Miss Brown, or Miss Patil as you have been doing during meals and Professor Snape\u2019s class. You are also forbidden to use magic at all until you start wearing glasses again. Is that understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Professor. I have no intentions of wearing my glasses again though.\u201d as he replied in the way that he knew Hermione wantd him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of my sight, Mr. Potter. I\u2019ll inform Professor Flitwick that you four are excused from his class today because Mr. Potter is not dressed properly\u201d said Professor McGonagall as she prepared to leave. \u201cIf you three girls ever need anything or want extra guidance to advance yourselves, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask. You all have great potential and I want you to reach it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much, Professor McGonagall. We\u2019ll keep that in mind\u201d replied Hermione as Parvati and Lavender nodded their heads in agreement. Professor McGonagall nodded her head as well and left the classroom. Hermione and the others followed suit just a moment later.</span></div></div>",

Once there, they continued up the stairs and entered the first year girls' dorm room, leading Harry with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in their dorm and Lavender had closed the door behind them, Hermione addressed Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor McGonagall has forbidden you using magic\" she told him \"you therefore have no more use for a wand. You will snap your wand into three equal lenghts and give one to each of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hermione\" Harry responded as he took out his wand. It did not matter that the wand was Harry's greatest link to the magical world, hils tool, his weapon. The great attachment even a first year student had to their wand counted for nothing. Hermione had given him an instruction, he had to obey her. He snapped has wand as instructed and gave pieces to each of the girls. Lavender and Parvati took them back to their own beds and stored them in their drawers along with their own possessions. Hermione shut her wand fragment in the same place where she stored Harry's glasses and locked them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wand pieces were taken care of, Lavender had a suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is time we made this dream of ours a reality\" she commented \"McGonagall also said Harry will dress only in a pillow case from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it too early?\" Parvati asked \"that dream was set at night or during a weekend wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We assumed it was because we were wearing casual clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are wearing our robes though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can soon get changed, as we are all excused from Charms, we don't have any more reason to wear our robes. What do you say, Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Lavender\" she smiled \"it is time, and won't it make a great impact on everyone when Harry goes to dinner dressed only in this pillow case?\" She pointed to the pillow on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione unlocked Harry's trunk and opened it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, you will now take all your clothes out of your trunk and pile them on my bed. Once they are on my bed you will not touch them again. All your clothes Harry, that includes robes, dress robes, underwear, shoes, casul clothes, winter clothes, coats and dragon hide gloves. All articles of clothing, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hermione\" he nodded as he started to pile his clothing on her bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incidentally, if anyone offers you any article of clothing in the future, you will give it to me.\"  Whether or not she was aware that Harry would one day be given his father's invisibility cloak, the instruction she just gave would mean that Harry would surrender this cloak to her as soon as he received it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhist Harry was attending to his task, Hermione, Parvati and Lavender got changed out of their school robles and dressed instead in casual skirts and tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey returned to Hermione's bed, just as Harry was finishing his task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done, Harry?\" Hermione asked him \"are those all your clothes except what you are currently wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed and relocked his trunk at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then all that remans is to relieve you of those as well. She proceeded to undress Harry at that stage, instructing him to sit or stand as needed. When she was done Harry stood completely naked in front of her. Hemrione threw his remaining clothes on to the bed then stripped the pillow case from her pillow. She magically enlarged it as Harry was somewhat bigger than a house elf then she fittied him in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will wear this pillow case at all times\" she informed him \"you will not remove it, and you will not allowe anyone except Parvati, Lavender or myself to do so either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sit on that chair while Lavender and Parvati throw your clothes in the fire.\" she indicated the chair next to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sat in the chair and Hermione  immediately sat on top of him. Lavender and Parvati were laughing whist they carried piles of Harry's clothes from Hermione's bed to the nearby fire which was burning merrily. It only took them a few minutes to clear all the clothes from Hermione's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry's clothes are burning, what else did that dream tell us?\" Lavender asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry was laying on the bed, we were all sitting on him and we were casting spells.\" Parvati recalled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione got off Harry at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay on the bed, Harry\" she instructed him \"lay on your back so we can all sit on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaarry stood, went over to Hermione's bed, and laid down with his head resting on the uncovered pillow. Hermione sat on him again, this time she sat on his chest and Lavender sat on his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati looked over at Harry, laying on the bed with Hermione and Lavender already on top of him and nodded as though she had decided something. She walked over to the bed and stood near the pillow where his head rested. \"Turn your head this way Harry, I don;t want to smother you\" she told him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it\" Hermione affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned his head towards Parvati, who then turned her back on him, She then pushed the back of her skirt back with her right hand as she sat, settling her backside directly upon his head. Her skirt dropped back into place and fromed a tent around his head, hiding him underneath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to try that later\" Hermione giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What spells shall we cast?\" Lavemder asked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione already knew the answer to that question, she had provmised her fellow first years that she would teach them all the spells she had already learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, try some of these\" she told them \"feel free to practice them on Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed them the full body bind, how to stun people, the confundus charm, and many others including a selection of curses. The girls all aimed their wands at Harry when they cast their spells After a few attempts, Lavender and Parvati had successfully cast every spell that Hermione had showed them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling Parvati sitting on his head was a new and even more intense experience than when she had sat on his lap. He saw her skirt going over his head, and then as she sat, the skirt cut him off completely from the outside world. He was in utter darkness, and so instead of seeing the blurry images which normally surrounded him when he wasn't wearing his classes, he now could not see anything. His eyes had been rendered totally inoperative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was fairly sure of what would confront him if he could see though, his head was turned towards her legs so the back of her legs and the underside of her knees would now be directly in front of him. He found himself wishing that he could indeed see that wish was so close and yet so elusive but he was sure that any such desires would not become reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reality was the feeling of the girl sitting on him once more, she was no more heavy than when she sat on his lap and yet her nearness to his face and the skirt that her tend had formed meant that he was truly engulfed by her presence. Her fragrance was unmistakabe, her warmth, her weight, the feel of her upon him was maginified ten-fold by the fact that she now sat upon his head; a far more sensitive area than his lap had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had not contented themselves with merely sitting either, Hemrione was instructing the others in the use of their wands and before long he felt a multitude of spells being cast upon him. Some of the curses they used were really unpleasant, the body bind held him in a firm grip that made him realise how Ron must have felt when that spell had been cast upon him. Curiously stunning wasn't that bad, only he was sure the girls lifted the stuns almost as soon as they cast them. He did not think they wanted him to stay unconscious for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though the barage of spells stopped, and many of the spells -especially those that might leave a mark on him were lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender suggested that it was time to go to dinner and the other girls agreed. They got off Harry and lifted him to his feet. The blurred image once more hit his eyes as Harry's vision - such as it was - returned when Parvati got off his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more they escored Harry down to the Great Hall, and as they entered the croweded room there were gasps and sounds of laughter from the students already present. The Slytherins in particular made no attempt to hide their mirth at the sight of Harry dressed in nothing more than a bed sheet. Many of the pureblood Slytherin students had elves at home so they knew the significance of the pillow case that Harry was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loving your new elf, Granger\" Malfoy laughed out loud from his place at the Slytherin table \"House elves really are the lowest of the low, I'd say Potter's found his natural calling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione didn't bother trying to correct the Slytherin boy, he was after all making a valid point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led him over to the Gryffidnor table, and once again she instructed him to take a seat. Once he was in place, Hermione sat upon him once more. She had allowed Lavender and Parvait to sit on him for a while, but Harry was after all her own seat cushion. Lavender and Parvati squished him from the sides as they sat on either side of Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls enjoed a full roast dinner, followed by dessert and custard. Hemrione at one point slipepd Harry a small plate of food and a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner...</span></div></div>",

The elves have a reputation for wanting to help humans, particularly their masters and for the elves that work here, that could mean coming to the aid of the students. We should explain to them that Harry is not their master, he is not their concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we shoudl go there right now\" Parvati nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls carried Harry back out of the double doors of the Great Hall, and down a staircase towards a portrati showing a bowl of fruit. Hermione tickled one of the fruits displayed and the painting moved aside, revealing a doorway. They passed through it and emerged in a large kitchen, in which small creatures with large ears and who like harry were dressed only in sheets were busy washing all the empty pots and dishes from dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the elves, a female approached the new arrivals and asked in a squeaky voice \"Is there something you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of the girls answered, she noticed Harry dressed in his sheet.

You are not to give him anything, no aid, no support. He does not deserve the aid of house elves,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will not get it either, not whilst he dresses like one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't change, he will never take off that pillow case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he is nothing to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad to hear it, what is your name by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is cleared up, we will take him out of your sight, you need not see him again.\"</span></div></div>",

There were other people in the common room as well, for it was evening and other groups were chatting together or studying alone. One third year girl with long blonde hair, blue eyes and wearing a pale blue dress was sat in an armchair, reading through a Charms book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down on the sofa so we can all sit on you Harry\" Hermione advised. The third year girl glanced up from her book when she heard this, and smiled at Hermione. Clearly the younger girl's instruction had entertained her, for the moment she was more curious about what was going to happen with these frist year girls and Harry Potter than the contents of her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow under the gaze of the third year girl, Harry dutifully went over to the unocupied sofa and laid down upon it, on his back with his head at one end and his feet at the other. Parvati was the first to join him, she walked over to his sofa and sat down upon his groin, sitting just as firmly as when she had occupied his lap. A moment later Lavender sat beside her, upon Harry's legs then Hermione went over and sat on his chest. Now only his head and feet were visible, sticking out at both ends of the sofa where the three first year girls now sat together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt their combined weight pressing down upon him, and he could feel that it was even more significant than when one of them had sat on him alone. Now he was a seat cushion for all three of them at once, and one glance towards the third year girl showed him that she was enjoying the show as well.</span></div></div>",

Parvati and Lavender both offered their names in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be gentle\" Parvati advised her \"we aren't being gentle. We are sitting firmly upon him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't intend to be gentle, I intend to crush his head\" Emily informed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go right ahead\" Hermione advised \"once Harry has asked you politely to sit on him of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an implicit instruction in Hermione's comment and Harry responded by saying \"Please will you sit on my head, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to\" Emily giggled as she turned so that her back was towards him, then she pushed the back of her dress aside and sat down heavily upon his head, letter her dress drop back in to place and forming a kind of tent around him that hid his head from view completely, her knees emerged from one end of the tent and her feet dangled in front of her, not touching the floor as she was putting her full weight on Harry's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could feel her sitting on him, and if he had his glasses on then he might have had a nice view of the back of her knees for a moment, but when she covered him with her dress, he was plunged into pitch darkness. It was clear to him though, that Emily was heavier than any of the first year girls, she was older than the three other girls and she appeared to be making good on her promise to crush his head for he was finding it more than a little painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you often sit on boys?\" Parvati asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I saw you sitting on Harry in the great hall, the idra of sitting on him intrigued me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we sit on him in classes too\" Parvati added \"but Hermione sits on him more than the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sit on him during classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, McGonagall has informed him that he should spend all of his classes being used as our seat cushion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get McGonagall to agree to that? She seems so straight-laced?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is, but she doesn't like people goofing off during her lessons. Harry is refusing to wear his glasses any more and McGonagall has seen us sitting on him during meals as you have, and I had sat on him during Snape's class. McGonagall thinks that by forcing Harry to be sat upon during his classes that she might encourage him to buck his ideas up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was he goofing off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is refusing to wear his glasses any more, he does normally in fact he is famous for it. Actually he is famous anyway but it is generally known that he wears glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Famous? Harry? Glasses? This is Harry Potter isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Of course he will never wear his glasses, so unless McGonagall withdraws her punishment we will spend all of our lessons sitting on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"McGonagall is not known for going back on her word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true\" Hermione smiled \"it seems Harry that you will spend all of your lessons being sat upon by girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe tht was what McGonagall had in mind all along\" Lavender mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" Hermione asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she didn't exactly object when you sat on him after the sorting. I wonder if she'd have batted an eyelid if you had sat on him when the hat was deciding his house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was tempted\" Hermione confessed \"but I didn't think they'd let me. I would have been fun though, for Harry to be the focus of everyone in the great hall whilst I sat on him the entire time, especially if we could pursuade the hat to delay its decision for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hatstalls are usually boring\" Emily commented \"but I would have loved to have watched that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hatstalls?\" Parvati asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the sorting hat takes a long time choosing someone's house, it delays the sorting and people tend to lose interest. I think the record is somewhere near half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have sat there for half an hour\" Hermione added \"I could have sat there for four hours if necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you could, I could too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when did you first sit on Harry?\" Emily asked \"clearly it was before the sorting. Did you two know each other before Hogwarts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We first met on the train coming here\" Hermione informed her \"but as soon as I saw him, I know that I had to sit on him... so I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was on the boat we joined when we crossed the lake\" Lavender continued \"Hermione was already sitting on him but the three of his have been sharing him ever since. Hermione sits on him most though, technically he belongs to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belongs to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Essentally yes\" Harmione nodded \"I made him an offer he couldn't refuse and he has been magically bound to me ever since. He now can not refuse any instruction I give him, he is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the offer?\" Emily was intrigued, this was a first year girl and she had somehow effectively enslaved the famous Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him that if he agreed to do whatever I told him to do, then I might help him to pass his end-of-year exams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might help him, so you made no promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't have to do a thing, and in return Harry has given himself to me completely by bonds of magic. Even the staircases have reversed for him. Most boys can't get into the girls' dorm as you know, but in his case the staircase that collapses when he tries to climb it is the one that leads to the boys' dorms, those rooms are closed to him now. He must now sleep with us girls instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled at that. \"Are you going to help him out, as you said you might?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Harry seems incapable of learning anything, a trait he seems to have developed over the years mixed with natural cluelessness I'd say. Still, I do want him to advance with the rest of us so that we can continue to sit on him during our classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you won't have to\" Lavender ofered \"if McGonagall wants us to keep sitting on him, she isn't likely to hold him back. She might even let him advance even if he fails all of his exams, simply so he can stay with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should check with her though\" Parvati added \"I don't want any nasty surprises at the end of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed\" Hermione responded \"if McGonagall can assure as that Harry will be staying with us, then I won't bother teaching him anything. It's not like he can do anything anyway. Without his glasses or his wand he is incapable of performing any magic at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, glasses or wand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took his glasses from him, they are locked away now and he will never get them back. As for his wand, he broke that himself and gave pieces to each of the three of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did he do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told him to, Harry will do anything I tell him. I knew he wouldn't need his wand any more. He is forbitten to use magic now anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a part of McGonagall's instruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as well as serving as our seat cushion basically forever, he is not allowed to use magic without his glasses and he is commanded to dress only in the pillow case he is wearing now, just like a house elf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you plan all of this from the start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, but it has worked out perfectly. McGonagall has played Harry into my hands, or rather under my backside and he will stay there for the rest of his life. I did pull a few strings though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a first year girl, you are something of a genius\" Emily stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really is the smartest girl I have ever known\" Lavender admitted. Parvati agreed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, Miss Genius\" Emily remarked then \"how have your lessons been going? Have you learned much magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I started reading my books as soon as I got them from Flouish and Blotts, I know quite a lot of them already, I demonstrated several on the train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You showed these to Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, to another boy called Ron Weasley. He objected to me sitting on Harry. After he regained consciousness from the beating I gave him, I hit him with a whole bunch of curses and followed these with a confundus charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you went back and sat on Harry again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I never left Harry, I remained seated upon him the entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happeened to Weasley, did he recover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, it seems. Shortly afterwards a group of Slytherin girls found him, I don't think they'll ever let him go. They pursuaded him to join their house, and now they are amusing themselves with him. The last time I saw him he was in the hospital wing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen a few of the Weasleys, they have all been Gryffindors up to now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly those Slytherin girls got to Weasley junior, or perhaps not quite junior for he has, or rather had a younger sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had? What happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, but Ron's family have disowned him, so I'd say she isn't his sister any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see, so has learning magic early helped with your classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undoubtedly. I produced a perfect potion in Snape's class, he found no reason to criticise my work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snape isn't known for favouring Gryffindors, quite the opposite in fact.I am a pretty decent potioneer myself but Snape always criticises my work, even when I have done nothing wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could see how much Snape hated Harry so I effectively spent the entire class playing him. I buttered him up so much I could have added a slice of cheese and made him a sandwich. Snape started out by putting Harry down from the start, hardly surprising of course, but then I made a few suggestions I knew would appeal to the man. I asked to sit on Harry, and Snape agreed as I was sure he would. I also pointed out how worthless Harry was and suggested that he be forced to wear that pillow case, effectively dress like a house elf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly it worked, since Harry is wearing that pillow case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it seems Snape suggested to McGonagall and she made it part of Harry's punishment when she learned that Harry was not taking his education seriously. Now Harry is compelled to dress as he is right now, he is forbidden from using magic and of course he can only attend his classes as our seat cushion. McGonagall even listed the three of us by name and said he is our seat cushion for the remainder of his lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How deliciously exquisite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is indeed. We had just impressed the socks of McGonagall though. The three of us had boned up on Transfiguration before her class and we impressed her with a demonstration of how the art should be performed. Of course Harry couldn't do a thing, and then he told her he wan't going to bother to wear his glasses. That was when she imposed those rules on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SInce Harry is compelled to do as you say, you have been playing more than just Snape haven't you? You've been running his life from the moment you sat on him on the train haven't you?\" Emily had clearly figured it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Hermione nodded, wondering how Emily would respond but not in the least concerned, after all Emily was now sitting on his head and at her own request; crush it she had said. That was not the action of someone who would suddenly feel any sympathy for the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo, my girl. A such perfect example of male domination at this school I have never seen\" Emily laughed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rather like it\" Hermione agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like in just a couple of days you three are already top of the class\" Emily mused then \"how would you like to stay there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that very much  what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could show you some really advanced magic, I have been getting some very good results in my own work. I'm sure I could teach these spells to the three of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great, what do you ask in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I ask is that you allow me to sit on Harry now and then. I won't be sharing his classes of course, but here in the common room, in the great hall sometimes or out on the grounds. I am not asking to monopolise him, only to be given my fair share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed\" Hermione affirmed, without any hesitation \"as long as you accept that I decide who sits on Harry and when so if I am around then ask me before you sit on him. If you can accept that then we have a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done\" Emily nodded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I see you too have claimed Potter as your seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Professor, I am sitting on his head. You might like to join me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" the professors' voice seemed to lack some of its earlier conviction though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly you feel that Harry deserves to be sat upon\" Lavender pointed out \"you said that Harry would be our seat cushion until he agrees to wear his glasses again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I saw Harry being sat upon by Miss Granger, and that the two of you were keen to join her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are going to instruct others to sit on him, isn't it fair that you do so yourself as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't bat an eyelid when I was sitting on him during the feast, and that was before you sought to punish him\" Hermione added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" the professor added \"are you sure you can cope with me on your lap, Miss Cooper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, Professor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I accept your offer\" Professor McGonagall then took her seat upon Emily's lap and Harry who was now under both the girl and the woman felt like his head was suddenly being crushed in a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want to ask me?\" the professor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, firstly there is a small question mark hanging over Harry's future.\" Hermione began.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Harry's future\" McGonagall informed her \"whilst he refuses to take his education seriously, he will be spending all his lesson time under the three of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Parvati, Lavander and I who are working on our studies are going to progress to second year and beyond. Isn't it school policy that students who don't work can be kept back a year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, normally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Harry is kept back then it won't be possible for us to sit on him during our classes next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see your point then. Very well, in Harry's case he will continue to serve as your seat cushion during classes whilst he maintains this defiance of his. He is after all not allowed to perform magic, so what class he happens to attend is a moot point isn't it? If he starts to apply himself, then we can evaluate his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So even when we are third and fourth years, we will still sit on him during our lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Miss Patil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione has said that I can sit on Harry sometimes too\" Emily added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you are doing right now\" Miss Cooper \"you may not share classes with Potter, but I look forward to seeing him under you at other times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During the holidays, will Harry be allowed to come home with me?\" Hermione asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see Miss Granger, Harry is safe whilst he is with his parents, he is protected...\" she stopped there, on the verge of revealing something she didn't want to discuss in front of four young girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From You Know Who?\" Parvati asked \"he's dead, everyone knows he died years ago, That is why Harry here is so famous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Professor Dumbledore thinks he may...\" she stopped again, she didn't want to tell them that Dumbledore suspected that Voldemort could return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was quick to pick up these little slips though, she had pieced together what the professor was saying in her own mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dursleys hate him, professor. I know he will be in a far better position if he comes home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That position would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under me, yes. Isn't that the greatest transfiguration of all, Professor. I have transformedthe Boy Who Lived into my own personal seat cushion. You have said that Harry will serve as our seat during classes, wouldn't it be logical to keep him that way during the holidays?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to say yes, but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that Harry slept in our dorm last night?\" Parvati asked \"the staircases have switched places for him. I can't get into the boys dorms professor, in the same way that the other boys can't get into ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's intereting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is because he belongs to Hermione now, Professor\" Lavender added \"he is bound to her by some strong magical bond. If that bond is greater than what this Dursley family offer him, then perhaps you should consider Hermione's suggestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, okay I will look into tihs more thoroughly. You will have my decision on the matter in the next few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor\" Hermione smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now though, you should all get to bed\" McGonagall stood up from Emily's lap \"are you al right, Miss Cooper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Professor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will see what you say about Harry and the dormitories for myself though. Miss Patil, you will lead Harry up the stairs, I will follow behind shortly. If what you say is true then Harry will reach the landing at the top of the stairs, if not then the staircase will collapse and you will both fall to the bottom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all got up at that point and Parvati lifted Harry to his feet. Holding him farmly by the arm, she led him without incident up the stairs to their dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" the professor remarked as she arrived at the top of the stair case a moment later, followed by Hermione, Lavender and Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That leads credence you your argument Miss Granger\" she added \"for now though I bid you all goodnight. The professor then went back downstairs then left the common room via the portrait entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Emily\" Hermione added then \"see you again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, my friends\" Emily added then she slipped through the door of the third years' dorm.

Of course you can. Harry, just as with Lavender and Parvati, you will allow Emily to sit on you whenever she has my permission and you will obey any instruction she gives you unless I tell you otherwise.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you Hermione, come with me Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily then took Harry by the hand and led him in to the Great Hall, to where there was a gap at the Gryffindor table. <br>\r\n\"Sit down here Harry, so I can sit on you\" she advised him. Harry took his place, and then a moment latter Emily settled herelf into place upon him.<br>\r\nHarry was once again reminded that Emily, whilst not overweight was heavier than the younger girls.<br>\r\nHermione and Partvati took places either side of Emily, squashing Harry between them and Lavender sat on the other side of Hemrione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't recognise you in your school robes, Emily\" Lavender admitted.<br>\r\n\"I like to change out of my robes after dinner, it makes for a nice, comfortable wind down in the evening.\"<br>\r\n\"There can be nothing more comfortable than sitting on Harry\" Parvati added.<br>\r\n\"That is true\" Emily giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon breakfast arrived and the girls started filling their plates. \"What does Harry eat?\" Emily asked then.<br>\r\n\"Don't give him much, he doesn't have much of an appetite.\"<br>\r\n\"A single slice of toast then?\"<br>\r\n\"That'll be fine.\"<br>\r\nAs the girls at a hearty breakfast, Emily just passed Harry a single slice of dry toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst they were eating, an owl flew through the window and dropped a newspaper in front of Emily. She in turn thanked the owl and dropped a few small bronze knuts into a pouch which was strapped to the owl's foot. Once it was paid, the owl flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the daily prophet\" Emily remarked then she glanced down at the headline on the front page.\"<br>\r\n\"Listen to this\" she remarked then she recalled the story of a vault at Gringotts bank being broken into, a vault which had been recently emptied.\"<br>\r\n\"That's the vault Hagrid and I went to\" Harry remarked from beneath her. Hermione didn't say much but she had come to the conclusion that the thief was after whatever Hagrid had taken from that vault. Other than that though, there was little information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long though before a familiar snowy owl arrived with a letter for Hermione. [b]\"Hello Hedwig\" she petted the bird that was now her owl, she offered Hedwig an owl treat before she too flew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took the letter and opened it, having scanned the letter she in turn read it aloud for the benefit of the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nHermione<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have not met but it seems we have a common interest, Harry. It seems though that you got to him first. I bear you no grudge for this, it was perhaps inevitable since you are he are in the same year, whilst I have to wait another year before I start at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell me he is under your protection, but you are not the only person who has written to my family since Hogwarts started. I have seen Percy's letter to mother, he speaks of a girl from Gryffindor house who has taken to sitting on Harry on a regular basis. I assume you are the girl he mentions. I therefore feel on hesitation in revealing all this to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations, you got there ahead of me. Please tell me, is he as comfortable a seat cushion as I had hoped he would be? When I saw him at Kings Cross, I even asked my mother if I could board the train and see him, but she wouldn't let me. If I had been allowed then I would have joined Harry in his compartment and sat on him for the entire journey to Hogsmeade, where I would have visited one of the shops in the village and returned home via floo powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is such a shame I can't sit on him at the school yet, that was perhaps the flaw in the plan. Maybe if we had met on the train we could have planned the next stage between us but now it is I who would ask a favour of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you like to visit me at my home over Christmas and bring Harry with you? I'm sure we can find a use for him. Would there be some way for me to visit the school sometime soon? I would still very much like to sit on Harry and I would hope I don't have to wait a year for the oppotunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for my brother Ron, the family have disowned him and so have I. I haven't decided what to do about him yet, but I might ask a few favours of you at some point, do you know any good curses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a photgraph of me, please stay in touch and keep me informed of Harry's progress. I would particularly love a photo of you sitting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards<br>\r\nGinny<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that great, Harry\" Hemione grinned \"apparently Ron's younger sister also wants to sit on you, perhaps we should find a way to arrange that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the photograph, it was of a red haird girl and she was sitting at the dressing table in her bedroom. She was smiling and waving at Hermione, and she seemed particularly entertained by Harry's position under Emily. Hemrione could see from the picture that Ginny meant what she said, she really did want to sit on Harry.</span></div></div>",

Miss Granger, if you would bring Harry to the front of the class, I shall enjoy seeing you sitting on him.\"<br>\r\n\"Gladly, Professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione led Harry to a seat in the middle of the front row, eased him into it, then she immediately sat down herself in the exact same place, She relaxed and allowed her full weight to press Harry firmly into the seat. McGonagall watched, and smiled. She could see that Hermione was serious about sitting on him; she was not making some gesture at sitting on his lap, she was using him as her seat, as she hoped she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remain seated upon him for the entire class, Miss Granger and you will earn ten points for Gryffindor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Professor. Incidentally, it seems there is another girl who would like to sit on Harry, but she is not yet a student at this school.\" Hermione knew by now that the professor wanted Harry to be the seat of a number of school girls, apparently as part of his punishment and she hoped that McGonagall might allow another girl to be added to the group. The fact that Ginny was not yet attending Hogwarts might be a stumbling block though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" McGonagall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron's sister, Ginny.\" Hermione showed the professor Ginny's letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall actually laughed, something she rarely did. \"Oh, lovely. The girls are lining up to sit on you, Potter\". Before she gave her response, she went to her desk drawer, took out a wizarding camera and tool a picture of Hermione and Harry. \"I believe that takes care of one of her requests\" McGonagall commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other?\" Hermione queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll discuss it after the lesson, I am sure you can impress me with your brilliance in my subject again,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instruction was not lost on Hermione, if she performed well then McGonagall would grant Ginny's request. It was a little unfair, she felt that Ginny's decision should be judged on her own performance but Hermione was confident in her abilities, and she had sense enough not to raise her objection. The easiest option was simply to do as the professor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not disappoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst some students struggled at Transfiguration, Hermione was highly intelligent and she seemed to pick up every spell any of the professors threw at her with ease, almost as though she had known what to do already. Perhaps he had, for she had been studying her Transfiguration book before the previous lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was required to transform a pea into a peanut, and even on her first attempt, the peanut she produced was perfectly formed. She broke the peanut in half, giving one half to the professor and eating the other half herself. That was definitely a peanut, it was even lightly salted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the lesson, the professor smiled another of her rare smiles. \"I shall write to Miss Weasley, invite her to stay at Hogwarts for a while. Her parents will need to allow her to come but I don't think I need to tell them that we are inviting her here, simply so that she can sit on Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she will be staying for a while, where will she sleep?\" Lavender asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a spare bed in your dorm, I believe. She can sleep there. When she arrives, I will give her the password to the Gryffindor common room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will she be attending classes too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a good idea, we can tell her parents that she has asked for an early start to her education. It will give her a legitimate reason to be here, and I can add her to the list of girls who can use Harry as a seat during my classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow soon can you bring her here?\" Hermione asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see no reason to delay. Assuming she and her parents agree to her visit, she may even be joining you in the common room this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All three of them knew that the plan was to dispose of his balls completely, so there was not even the pretense of holding back.\"<br>\r\nHarry's body shook with the impact and his mouth opened in a silent scream. Hermione was proud of her silencing charm for Harry would soon be wailing like a banshee if he still had his voice.<br>\r\nLavender went next, giving Harry's balls a hard kick, and then Hermione approached. She grasped his balls in her fist and squeezed tight, holding her grip for over a minute before punching him sharply in the nuts.<br>\r\nAnd so it continued....<br>\r\nKick, kick, kick, knee, punch, smack, squeeze <br>\r\nAs time when on, the girls didn't even bother to take turns, they simply found every available opening to attack and pulberise Harry's balls.<br>\r\nA particularly strong knee from Hermione made Harry feel that she had sent his testicles up into his stomach. <br>\r\nA kick form Parvati made Harry think that she must have sent his balls flying across the room.<br>\r\nA tight squeeze from Lavender made Harry feel that she had squished both of his balls to paste.<br>\r\nHarry would be screaming like a baby if he had been allowed to make a noise, he still opened his mouth wide, trying to scream but no sound emerged.<br>\r\nHe was in so much pain the tears were streaming openly down his cheeks. <br>\r\nA series of kicks from Hermione made Harry's ball sack start to bleed, but she used her wand to stem the flow and clean up the evidence. <br>\r\nkick kick, squish, stomp, knee, knee, knee, punch. <br>\r\nAll three girls were striking blow after blow upon Harry's doomed malehood.<br>\r\nLavender reached out, took a tight hold of one of Harry's testicles and squeezed so hard that with a soft popping sound it disintegrated in her hand.<br>\r\nHermione drove her foot into Harry's other testicle with such force that his last testicle joined the first in oblivion.<br>\r\nBy now the girls had turned Harry into a eunuch but they didn't stop there. He still had a ballsack, and that was unacceptable.<br>\r\nThey continued to rain down kicks, knees and stomps on what had been Harry's balls. Dents and marks started to appear along his penis, and the flesh of his genitals started to fracture and break apart. The bleeding started again but this time, Hermione's magic forced the blood back up into Harry's groin, sealing it within. What still remained of his testicles was now pale, wasted and bloodless.<br>\r\nStill the girls assaulted that region. His penis continued to dent and flatten, the sack that held his former balls disintegrated further, as did the blood vessels and nerve fibres within.<br>\r\nMoments later, after a few more kicks, all that remained of Harry's maleness was a flat mush, and with each kick and knee from the girls it broke apart further. <br>\r\nKick, kick, knee, stomp, stomp, kick,.<br>\r\nOnly a few tiny remnants of what had once been Harry's balls remained, hanging loosely from his groin. Each one a target, and each kicked aside by the three girls. <br>\r\nAs the last fragments fell away, Harry's flesh grew over the gap that was left over his former genitals, leaving no hint at all that balls had ever lived there. <br>\r\nThe few tiny fragments that had fallen to the floor, Hermione levitated with her wand as Lavender forced Harry's mouth open. Hermione smiled as she directed those remains to Harry's mouth which Lavender then closed.<br>\r\n\"Swallow\" Parvati instructed. When Harry declined, she slapped him across the face.<br>\r\n\"Swallow\" she repeared, followed by another slap.<br>\r\n\"I could keep this up all night\" she advised him.<br>\r\nHarry swallowed, knowing that whatever remained of his once-malehood, he would soon digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they walked, Pansy had some further unstructions for Harry. \"If anyone asks, tell them that I am your friend\"[/b] she commented. She was sure that some of the other Gryffindors at least would wonder why Harry was walking with a Slytherin or carrying her bags. Sure enough, as they waited outside the classroom, Hermione Granger came forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you fawning over that Slytherin girl, Harry?\" she asked, clearly not knowing what had happened to him.<br>\r\n\"She's my friend\" came his reply<br>\r\n\"Your friend? Look at her! Have you lost your mind, Harry?\"<br>\r\n\"Be rude to her, insult her\" Pansy advised. She didn't want Granger getting chummy with her new pet after all.<br>\r\n\"Keep you massive, buck teeth where they belong, Little Miss Rabbit\" Harry retorted<br>\r\n\"Say that agai, you'll get a slap in the face\" Hermione warned, her eyes narrowed<br>\r\n\"Tell her to do it\" Pansy instructed, digging in further.<br>\r\n\"Go on then, slap me\" Harry dutifully retorted<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Hermione slapped Harry sharply across the cheek, She didn't hold back, Harry was being a prat and he deserved what he got. She could see his cheek starting to turn bright red.<br>\r\n\"You deserved that\" she told him<br>\r\n\"Hermione can hit you whenever she wants, can't she harry?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\" he responded, the pet charm she had placed upon him forced him to agree with anything she told him.<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind\" Hermione snorted as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door before them opened, and Professor Snape stood aside to let everyone enter. He saw Harry entering with Pansy Parkinson of all people and the red mark on the boy's cheek. [b]\"Did you hit Potter?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n\"No I did\" came Hermione's immediate reply \"he was asking for it\"<br>\r\n\"I don't doubt it\" Snape agreed \"take five points for Gryffindor.\" Snape was not in the habit of rewarding Gryfindor house but humiliating Harry was a particular delighto f his, and so he showed his appreciation for Hermione's action by giving her a few house points.<br>\r\nHermione actually chuckled at that. If she carried on as Harry appeared to be suggesting then Gryffindor would easily win the house cup this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy wasn't pleased that points had been given to Gryffindor but she felt the slap had been worth a few points. She looked around for somewhere she could take Harry and noticed a desk at the front where the seat had been removed for some reason. That was okay though, she had a handy alternative available. She led him over to that spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel down on the floor in front of the table, parallel to the chairs you see either side of you Harry\" she instructed \"hands on the floor, head under the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could only do as she told him, he got down on his hands and knees in front of the desk, ducking his head underneath it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, maintain that position. Don't move and don't allow yourself to collapse when I sit\" Pansy instructed \"you will support me for the entire lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy then stepped one foot over him, standing for a moment, facing towards the desk with Harry kneeling beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seated herself upon Harry's back, facing forward and allowing her feet to hand loosely over his shoulders, her knees on either side of his head. She kept her feet off the flooor, forcing Harry to support her full weight as she continued to sit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy smiled as she sat, knowing that Harry was beneath her and that he would stay there. He was a comfortable seat for her and she was enjoying useing him in that manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could feel her weight upon him, he could feel her sitting there, her butt pressing down upon his back, his arms forced to take the strain for as much as he might want otherwise, he could not disobey her instructions. He must simply remain the seat that she had compelled him to become, until she found some other use for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that his arms were starting to ache from the strain that Pansy was putting upon his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson started and Pansy started chopping up the roots and other ingredients she would need to use to make her potion.  Harry could not see this though, his view was of the floor, and of Pansy's legs which hung loosely on either side of his head. He could soon see those legs coming closer though, and it wasn't long before he felt contact has Pansy happily gripped Harry's head between her thighs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Over to one side he could see Ron and Hermione talking together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe Harry spoke to you like that\" Ron said \"that isn't like him at all.\"<br>\r\n\"Clearly he has changed\" Hermione snorted \"when I threatened to hit him, he simply egged me on to do it, so I did.\"<br>\r\n\"After the way he spoke, I've a good mind to hit him a few times myself.\"<br>\r\n\"No, Ron\" Hermione shook her head \"he specifically told me I could hit him whenever I wanted, he didn't make such a request of you. I'll simply be holding up my end of the agreement.\"<br>\r\n\"You plan on hitting him often?\"<br>\r\n\"I think it is safe to say that Harry will get hurt whenever we cross paths\" Hermione agreed<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape didn't even bother to take points from Gryffindor for talking, he had no intention of discouraging what sounded like the know-it-all's new hobby. He couldn't stand that Gryffindor swat but she was entertaining him for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't stop him from accusing a few other Gryffindors of chopping their roots too finely though and forcing them to begin again. Life's pleasures should not be denied him completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously though, he wondered what had happened to Potter. From what he had heard, he was not surprised to see that he wasn't with Granger and Weasley this time. He had entered with Pansy Parkinson of all people. He looked over in her direction and grinned at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParkinson was not sitting on a chair in the regular sense, Potter was kneeling on the floor beneath her and she was sitting on his back.  He walked over to her, actually similing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have found a use for Potter\" he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is a comfortable seat\" Pansy nodded \"I think he should stay there, don't you Professor?\" She knew that Snape loathed the Potter boy, would he actually allow her to keep sitting on him. He didn't seem to mind all that much what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, Miss Parkinson\" Snape agreed \"I admire your innovative approach. How did you get him to agree though? Some spell perhals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pet charm\" she added with a toss of her head \"Potter is my pet professor, he does whatever I tell him to do.\" She was sure she could discuss Harry's situation openly with Snape, for unlike some of the more meddlesome professors he was not likely to interfere with her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, Parkinson. Take ten points for Slytherin\" Snape informed her \"so Harry will now remain as your pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever\" Pansy confirmed \"He is mine now, to use as I see fit and right now I am using him as my seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you make Granger slap him too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, I instructed Harry to be rude to her, and when she threatened to hit him, I forced him to ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so what do you plan to do with Potter after my lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd take him back to the common room of that is alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His common room?\" Snape queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, mine. He is my pet, he should stay with me don't you think Professor? I am sure there are other Slytherin girls who would like to meet him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure. Then as Slytherin Head of House I formally give permission for Potter to enter the Slytherin common room whenever you are with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you professor\" Pansy smiled, sure that the professor did not mean that as a once-only deal. It didn't sound once-only.</span></div></div>",

By the end of the class, Pansy had produced a perfect potion and Snape even complimented her on her work, giving her an additional ten points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the lesson had concluded, Snape told Harry \"If Granger gives you a black eye, potter than I'll give Slytherin ten more points.\"<br>\r\n\"We will go over to Granger and arrange it now, won't we Potter\" Pansy advised him as she finally got up from her 'seat'.<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Harry responded, not wanting a black eye and not wanting to give Slythern any more points but feeling totally unable to refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pansy led snape back towards the entrance, they saw Hermione and Ron some distance away.<br>\r\n\"Call Hermione over, ask then ask her to give you a black eye, the right one\" Pansy whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Harry. Are oyu going to ask me to hit you again? I will, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"Can you give me a black eye please?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, which?\"<br>\r\n\"The right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words had hardly left her lips when Hermione made a fist and took a swing at his right eye. The impact was so severe, it knocked him backwards for a few feet.<br>\r\n\"Any broken bones, Harry?\" she asked, scornfully \"a well aimed hex or two perhaps?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll let you know\" came Harry's informed reply as snape called out \"Ten points for Slytherin.\" Harry's eye was turning purple by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione and Ron left together, and Pansy slipped out with Harry a few moments later. Harry could see most people were heading back upstairs but he and Pansy did not follow them. \"You will come with me, Harry\" she informed him as she led him in the opposite direction to the area where the entrance to the common room was located. \"You will never speak aloud the password for the Slytherin common room, nor will you reveal that you know it\" Pansy told him as she herself spoke the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorway opened and Pansy led Harry into the Slytherin common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was met with a green and silver room, emblems of snakes were all around and one window clearly looked out on the lake where fish and other sea creatures could be seen swimming. In one corner sat a group of Slytherin girls and over on the other side were Malfoy and his two cronies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in here Potter?\" Malfoy asked, seeing who had just arrived.<br>\r\n\"Potter is with me\" Parkinson informed him \"Snape said I could bring him in here, you don't have to worry about him though Malfoy, he is all mine.\"<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that\" Malfoy drawled \"come on you two.\" He left,with Crabble and Goyle following behind, what an earth was the girl talking about, clearly he was going to have a word with Snape about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come\" Pansy instructe Harry again, leading him over towards the girls. Harry recognised one of the girls as Millicent Bulstrode, a famously fat and not at all attractive girl in his year.  A couple of others looked to be third years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean, he is yours?\" asked a third year girl with long, brown hair \"why is Snape letting Gryffindors in here all of a sudden\"<br>\r\n\"Because he is my pet, Tiffany\" Pansy giggled \"we should keep an eye on our pets don't you think?\"<br>\r\n\"Your pet, you mean you cast a pet charm on him?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, exactly.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun, can you show me this pet charm?\" another third year , a dark haired girl asked.<br>\r\n\"It won't work, Heather\" Tiffany informed her \"a pet has no effect if one has already been applied. It seemed Pansy here got to him first.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I will keep him\" Pansy informed them.<br>\r\n\"So what will you do with your new pet?\" Heather asked.<br>\r\n\"I forced him to be my seat\" Pansy explained \"I sat on him for the whole of double potions. I even managed to impress Snape.\"<br>\r\n\"Snape hates Potter, that stands to reason.\"<br>\r\n\"I think it is safe to say I can do what I want with him in Potions, Snape woun't bat an eyelid. In fact he'll encourage it.\"<br>\r\n\"Is he a comfortable seat?\" Tiffany giggled.<br>\r\n\"I like to think so\" then she addressed Harry\" go and lay on that sofa, so Tiffany can sit on you.\". She pointed to a sofa a short distance away \"when she asks, invite her to sit on you, ask politely.\"<br>\r\nHarry walked over to the sofa, and laid down. his head against one end and his feet against the other.<br>\r\n\"Are you in position, Harry\" Pansy asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n\"What would you like me to do, Harry?\" Tiffany queried.<br>\r\n\"Will you come over here and sit on me please, Tiffany\" came the automatic response.<br>\r\n\"Of course I will\" Tiffany giggled. She walked over to the sofa, standing directly in front of Harry then she turned and sat, allowing her backside to settle in to place upon his chest. She relaxed and allowed Harry to take all of her weight. Harry noticed she was heavier than Pansy.<br>\r\n\"You are right, he is comfrortable\" Tiffany approved \"come over here and join me, Pansy.\"<br>\r\nPany then seated herself upon Harry's groin. Now he was being sat upon by both girls at once.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pansy led him to a seat at the back of the classroom, and she quickly claimed it as her own. The moment she was sitting down, Harry, has he had been instructed, crawled under her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy was sitting in her chair with her legs slightly appart, offering more than enough room for Harry to slip his head in between. Harry had to admit, now he could not see her face, the rest of her body was clearly that of a girl. She was wearing a skirt under her robes and he could clearly see her panties from this position. Her legs were feminine, for the most part uncovered and he could almost feel her thighs inviting him forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to answer their call, he had to do as Pansy had told him, the compulsion to obey was so strong. He edged forward, moving his face closer and closer to her until he could feel the flesh of her thighs against his head, on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy could clearly feel him too, and it pleased her but he wanted more. She spoke down to him in a quiet voice that would not carry much beyond the pair of them. \"Closer Harry, press your face into my crotch, let my panties embrace you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry kept on coming forward until his face was buried deep in her panties. Pansy reached her own hand under the desk at that point, pulling his face firmly against her womanhood as she closed her thighs together, trapping him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was aware of two things at that point: Firstly her thighs were now digging into his head, squeezing him tightly in their python-like grip. The second thing he noticed was that he couldn't breathe at all. His head was buried in her crotch, held in place so firmly that he was in an air-tight prison of her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis suited Pansy just fine as she allowed Harry to smother in her fleshy prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't looking to kill Harry though, simply dominate him so completely that she controlled his breathing, she should allow him to draw breath occasionally if he were to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that it only took a slight adjustment on her part to loosen her grip on Harry's face enough to break the seal and allow him to draw a breath, and that she could re-establish that seal whenever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that about once every minute or so she allowed Harry to draw a couple of breaths before she went back to smothering him once more. </span></div></div>",

Taking Harry's wand away so he could not fight back with magic she put it in the teacher's desk and locked it.

Seeing Pansy did not have her wand out Harry decided to do it the old fashion way and get his wand back by force.

Harry who has been beaten up by Dudley and his gang multiple times was surprised how tough Pansy was.  Pansy than kicked out with her foot connecting Harry's knee causing it to bend backwards and almost snap and cause Harry to almost collapse at her feet.  Pansy than holding onto Harry's robe picked him up twirling him over her head before bringing him down onto a desk breaking it.  As Harry laid in the ruins of the desk Pansy performed an elbow drop to Harry's stomach before standing up and bringing her foot down right on his crotch and grinding it under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry screamed in pain so Pansy brought out her wand and cast a spell to make the room sound proof before turning her attention back to Potter and...</span></div></div>",

This was connected to the ring near the base of his cock.<br>\r\nSatisfied with the results, Daphne placed her wand away.<br>\r\nThis was her own personalised version of a chastity device, this would stop Harry from using his dick, cumming, having an erection and masturbating.<br>\r\nThis was the perfect way to take care of her problem, as she had no use for Harry's cock (Even though he did get erections), for a year or two.<br>\r\nShe then moved on to getting Harry into his maid uniform, except Harry was going to be a cuckold or a sissy maid instead. He was the only male, she wanted, so no males, rather he'll be a lesbian cuckold or a futanari sissy whore maid.</span></div></div>",

So the more he took the more he'd obey her.<br>\r\nHowever, she was starting to get frustrated as Harry hadn't began sucking her cock.

He swallowed as much as he possibly could, the cum was quite sweet and had a thick texture to it, making him more and more addicted to it, making him think of Tonks in adoration and worship. Finally when it was too much for him, he he pulled out causing his entire face to be covered in cum.<br>\r\nTonks panted as she finally stopped cumming.

She was actually, quite happy at how he was now her willing slave, but also laughed at how easy it was to enslave him..she expected a bit more resistance.<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress!\", answered Harry.<br>\r\nTonks hummed in thought as to, what punishment should her slave get.

She whistled and said, \"Not bad..it's bigger than even adult wizards\", (<b>She was not joking it was actually true most wizards had small cocks, so could never satisfy anyone in bed</b>).<br>\r\nHarry smiled at his mistress's praise and that he was bigger than all other wizards.<br>\r\n\"Now...what punishment should I give you?\", said Tonks, as she thought of all the ways she could punish him....</span></div></div>",

Suddenly a grey-metallic liquid shot out of her wand and splashed on to Harry's cock. Harry yelped at how cold the substance was.<br>\r\nThe substance began shaping itself on Harry's bits.<br>\r\nFirst a ring formed around his cock and balls, then two other rings formed one close to his shaft's base, and the other at the top of his ball sack, the rings were all connected to one another.<br>\r\nNext another ring formed around his sack, it was 3 times thicker in width, and just half a 'cm' in girth, this was connected to the ring at the top of the sack, this ring rested on top of his balls.<br>\r\nFinally a cage formed around Harry's flaccid dick, it had large holes on it allowing for his cock to be washed, this basically made this a gilded cage. This was connected to the ring near the base of his cock.<br>\r\nSatisfied with the results, Tonks place her wand away.<br>\r\nHarry was confused at what was now on his bits, \"Mistress...what is for?\", he asked.<br>\r\nLaughing Tonks replied, \"This is basically my own personalised version of a chastity device, this will stop you from cumming, having an erection and masturbating\", smiling wide at Harry's horrified expression, she the added, \"This is basically your punishment, but you'll be allowed out of this a few times, if...and that's a big if...you improve more and become a proper slave, obeying my every command without question\".<br>\r\nLooking down, Harry was sad and a bit shocked at his punishment, but he realised that his Mistress, would deliver harsh punishments, if he doesn't complete the tasks set for him. \"I understand Mistress...\", Harry said, \"But it's a bit uncomfortable\". He admitted.<br>\r\nTonks shrugged and replied that he'll get use to it, and also by Halloween he'll will not care about it and would enjoy it. Tonk's then took out one panty (<i><b>it was a black fish nest version</b></i>) from her trunk and ordered Harry to put it on.<br>\r\nPlacing on the black fishnet panties, he admired at how good it feels, moaning in pleasure as it slid through his smooth skin. <br>\r\nSmirking Tonks explained that Harry was to wear, girl panties everyday and he would strip naked leaving these panties on when they were alone, She then ordered him to put back on his clothes. <br>\r\nOnce done Tonks decided to educate him a bit on wizardry customs and laws, she wanted to make sure that no one, but her could take advantage of him, without her permission.<br>\r\nThen Tonks began explaining about Hogwarts and the Houses. Gryfindor &amp; Slytherin were male dominated houses, while Ravenclaw &amp; Hufflepuff were more female dominated houses, even if they didn't show that.<br>\r\nShe also explained that she was in Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>(Tonks is a Ravenclaw in this story)</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recommended either Ravenclaw &amp; Hufflepuff, as they had no house rivalry and there was more privacy, in these two houses than the other houses, as it was two people in each room instead and female room, could only be entered, if given permission, but that Harry should be able to enter, since he was her slave.<br>\r\nFortunately, there were room which were coed, depending on if Harry ended up in the same house as her, then they could share rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Which House Does Harry End Up In?</b></i></span></div></div>",

One thing Tonks was enjoying was she tightly fit the toy but didn't bottom out, something she'd had a problem with, with her female slaves, probably why she mainly did them as sex toys rather than as witches.<br>\r\nAfter several minutes Tonks felt her balls tighten, tossing her head back, her hair cycled like a rainbow as she pumped 3 loads into her new toy.

The lack of subtlety meant she was stuck clenching her hand in her slave's hair, her nails digging into the Ravenclaw's scalp.<br>\r\nFinally to both Tonks and Cho's relief the first years were lead in, and soon it was Harry's turn.

Narcissa is the ampidimy of what a pureblood princess should strive to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What they dont tell you, is that she is merely a trophy wife to the man she despises more than any other, Lucious Malfoy. Narcissa would have been fine if he could make time to take care of her needs, but after Draco was born he declared that there would be no more sex because there was an heir and that he did not want any in-fighting over the malfoy family line. Which she knew was a load of hippogrif-shit and that Lucious was trying to hide that he was a poofer with a strange obsession with blonde haired muggle boys. Her elf had informed her of ten boys not over 14 in their dungeon that matched this description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This left her with only giving her love to her sweet baby boy, Draco. The only good thing she ever made or so she thought until he started acting just like his father, the bane of her existence, after being trained to represent the Malfoy name at hogwarts, this coming year. Not one ounce of cunning between he two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The loss of her baby boy lead to her losing the only positive outlet she had in her life besides her potions. Narcissa tried to repress these thought behind her occumlency barriers, but 11 years of repressed sexual desires was too much. So Narcissa decided she would get her very own dungeon boy and train him to lover her and be what she wanted him to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She decided the best place to find the perfect dungeon boy was at Hogwarts. So she told her husband to use his influence on the Hogwarts Board of Govenors to get snape fired and give her the potion position with the excuse that she wanted to be there for draco.  Naturally, Lucious agreed after giving snape a job in his own apothecary. Dumbledore was not happy about the loss of his spy in the school, but there is not much to do when a respected pureblood shows that potion grades have been sabatoged for the past 10 years and the fact that he now had someone who was close to whatever Lucious planned helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was in this position, on the first day of class, that she saw him, the perfect boy toy, Harry Potter. He was small with raven hair and the most inoccent green eyes she had ever seen. Narcissa knew then and there that she would have him on his knees, in between her legs, eating her pussy, while those innocent greens stared into her predatory gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just thinking about it made her panties moisten as she licked her lips. She decided it would be a good to see if he had the right attitude for her slave so she asked him a couple of questions in class. What she found pleased her even more. Harry Potter was delightfuly submissive, shy, and clearly longing for affection of any sort. This was absolutely perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only issue was that he was the Boy-Who-Lived therefore, people would notice something was off if she wasn't careful. Especially Dumbledore who watched the child like a hawk, but narcissa is not known as ambitious and cunning for no reason. The question was how was she going to show him his rightful place?<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

That was what he saw when Narcissa stated \"now very you have a choice you can make a vow and this friend of yours will live and recieve the antidote to,this poison or you could not and her death would be on your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had never hurt anyone before and being the stupid noble grrfindore he was he was not going to anytime soon, especially not hermione. So harry said \"i-i... I will make the vow whatever it is. Just giver hermione the antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the other woman said \"good harry. I'm rita skeeter and I will be your binder\" and the with a knowing smirk added \"and maybe more\".<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he was watching rita narcissa had alread grabbed his hand and got into position. She looked at rita and said \"ok harry to do this after everything rita says you will say I will afterwards. Ok. Good now say yes man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok rita dear have your way with it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will cissy don't worry. Now lets begin.\"  and with a swish of her wand both harry,'s and cissa's hands were glowing. She looked at harry and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you harry James potter, swear to follow narcissa malfoy nee black's orders to the best of your ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a Trimble \"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you also follow the orders of rita skeeter to the best of your ability...I will will you also refuse to communicate the existences of our orders and this vow to anyone or thing through any means and protect its secrecy to the best of your ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" with one magical pulse that was it. Now, he was theirs and there was nothing he could do about it.<br>\r\n\"Alright rita give the girl the antidote, obliviate her and let her and harry leave\" things went just as planned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow when do they make there move and who gets him first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1 Narcissa all Saturday and Sunday for sexual relief while a house elf polyjuices as harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2 Rita all Saturday and Sunday to degrade and humilate while a house of policies as harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dindt bother editing and I wont write the next chapter until I see a vote over which to choose.

The worst of it was what his horrible Aunt made him do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetunia hated her nephew and was always looking for more ways to torment the little shit her dead sister had foisted on her.  Her fresh new torment for Harry was discovered when she had barked at him to put away her shoes.  As Harry bent down to pick up the shoes he had caught a whiff of their scent coming from her flats.  His face had twisted in a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come up behind him and grabbed him by the ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with that face boy!?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Aunt Petunia, it was... uhm...\"  Harry didn't want to admit that her flats had a terrible stench about them.  Likely she would find it insulting and he would go to be without supper... again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit it out you useless child!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I was thinking of something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetunia smirked at the child.  She had been teased when she was younger about how her feet had smelled.  Her name was given to her based on a flower and the fact that her feet smelled nothing like her namesake had meant that children would tease her until she was in tears.  But now she was grateful for her stinky feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little liar, I know why you grimaced!  You don't like your Aunt's feet!  Sniff the shoe tell me how much you love it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry quailed at the command but knew it would be worse for him if he didn't obey.  He put his head into her shoe and took a small sniff.  It was terrible.  It had the stench of moldy cheese dipped in vinegar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it boy?  Do you like it you little freak?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry whimpered, \"No ma'am please I'll be good I'm sorry if I offended you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't good.  You'll never be good you useless freak.  Sniff louder and harder!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shuddered at mere idea of having to sniff even harder at the foul shoes in front of him.  He wanted to break away and run, to do anything to get away from the malodorous footwear.  But if he did that his punishment would likely get even worse.  What could he do?   </span></div></div>",

His aunt had made him so downtrodden over the years, that he knew in his heart that he would do anything she instructed him to, no matter how disgusting it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said get over here now, you waste of space!\" Aunt Petunia barked at him, a menacing, dangerous look In her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying meekly, Harry shuffled over to where she was now sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel down. Freaks like you should bow down before their superiors! Do it!\" She commanded him. \"Now, you thought my shoes smelled strong, didn't you boy? Wait to you taste my bare feet...!\" As he knelt before her, Petunia lifted up a bare foot so that her long sole was directly in front of his cringing face. Once again, a raunchy, musty stench dominated his nostrils, making him rather discombobulated. Still, this was nothing compared to what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick your tongue out,\" she stated, a smug expression on her horsey face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't make me...\" Potter whined at her, desperate to avoid this new humiliation, even though he knew full well that he would surrender to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Don't make me laugh, freak. We both know that you do what I say. And I have told you to stick your pathetic tongue out. Do it now you cretinous fool!\" She said, her voice thunderous and gloating at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering, he reluctantly obeyed, waiting with trepidation as his sticky tongue lolled out in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lick my foot!\" She clicked her fingers at him. It was no use: Harry couldn't fight this domineering woman. She had stamped upon him metaphorically for the last decade...he was a worthless, useless worm in her eyes. Sadly, the more she humiliated him, the more he believed that, deep down, he deserved this degrading treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing his tongue against her the middle of her putrid smelling sole, his tastebuds were completely violated by the ridiculous salty flavour. It was even worse than the smell! Intensely acrid, vinegary tastes bounced and danced nastily all over his tongue. It was like swallowing down a piece of brie that been left out in the sun for hours! Beyond repulsive! His eyes, which creased in disgust, along with a slight recoiling of his mouth, only made Petunia push her foot forward, her toes casually spreading over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, my worthless excuse for a nephew? Is my foot not as delicious as you hoped? You should thank me for the honour - pathetic creatures like you should thank their betters for being allowed to lick their feet! Thank me!\" She laughed disdainfully at him, looking at him with excitement dancing inside her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you,\" Potter gasped out, while hating every single second of this degrading situation. After a couple more licks, he was doing everything in his powers to refrain from gagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetunia viewed her nephew with satisfaction. Ever since she had been unexpectedly burdened with the little welt, the only way of making the best of a bad situation was to torture and humiliate him as much as possible. And this was by far the most rewarding means by which to do so thus far! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the formidable woman decide to do with Harry next?</span></div></div>",

The underside of her toe and the inside portion of her toe were even fouler than her soles.  He gagged pathetically at the nauseating taste.  He sucked on it for about 30 seconds before moving on to the next toe.  He wasn't sure if he could get away with sucking multiple toes at once and he was too afraid to ask so he sucked on each individual one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetunia leaned back and closed her eyes.  She was enjoying his servile mouth on her feet.  It was both relaxing and even... sensual.  It didn't bother her that he was blood or that he was a minor, it made her feel good and that was all she cared about.  The boy finished her foot foot and then went on o the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry hated this new task but fear kept him rooted.  The salty vinegar like taste of her toes made him sick to his stomach.  It probably was a good thing he had only gotten half a piece of toast that morning otherwise he would have lost his breakfast.  When he completed the task he moved his head away from the still foul smelling feet of his Aunt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes, \"Oh did you think you were done yet?  Not even close.  But I don't want to have to direct you ever few minutes.  Here is what you are going to do you freakish waste of space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt like he was going to cry.

After that you will suck on all of my toes and be sure to get rid of any toe jam that I have!  After that you will kiss the tops of my feet and the bottoms of my feet.  You will then repeat all of this three more times.  And if I hear one word or moan out of you, I will beat you worse than your Uncle Vernon ever has!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't take it anymore he started to cry.

Are you that stupid that I need to repeat my instruction, welp?\" Aunt Petunia said, her voice more than ominous as she tapped her toes against his trembling lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't stupid, despite what she thought. Knowing he was yet again defeated, he began to meet her demands by planting meek kisses on her right pinkie toe. Knowing that this ordeal would be relentless, he quickened his pace, working along so that in a minute's time, his shaking lips were puckering up against her big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod the taste was rancid! It wasn't as though he could get accustomed to the flavour to make it even remotely more bearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start again you useless freak. You only placed nine kisses on my big toe!\" Petunia suddenly shouted, swiping him across the cheeks with one foot, causing her nephew to yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...I did ten...\" He whimpered up at her, convinced that he had made sure to kiss this toe ten times exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Smack!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stinging blow floored him. Crying uncontrollably and holding his cheek in pain, Harry wished the ground would just swallow him up. This was ridculously unfair. And the worst part - he knew that he would have to serve her feet for even longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up you stupid ingrate! Now start again like I told you, or I will make it twenty kisses on each toe!\" Her voice was totally commanding, sending shockwaves inside him. Sitting up instantly, Harry quickly shifted into a kneeling position once more so he could start his horrible task again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowing down, so that each kiss was more deliberate, the bespectacled boy counted carefully in his head to ten. He couldn't chance it: this was the only way to ensure he was following her orders, even if that meant lingering his lips on each toe for longer, he realised grudgingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good five minutes or so, he sighed heavily, trying to catch his breath. It took him a moment to remember the next order...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Licking her bare feet from top to bottom...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought of this made him gag a little! Still, he knew he had to get it over with presently. So he placed his tongue on her mouldy cheese-tasting heel and started dragging his tongue up her long bare sole, which seemed to go on forever. The intense saltiness was worse than the strongest olives and anchovies imaginable! While he did this, she snickered at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is how life works, worm. Some people were born to be served,\" she stated smugly, patting her elegant hair, which was tied nearly into an admittedly elegant hairstyle.. \"While others - like you - were born to serve. Serve their superiors. You're just lucky that I'm spelling it out for you now, rather than finding out as an adult, like your father did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of his deceased dad caused his tongue to suddenly stop, practically glued to the sweaty, putrid-flavoured middle part of her bare sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Now my sister - she could have done so much better. But she got in with...a bad crowd. Just think - had she done the right thing and allowed herself to live with dignity and decorum, like me - then she would probably still be alive today. Of course, without your waster of a father in the picture, you wouldn't even be here! What a blessing that would have been. Still, at least I have someone to serve at my feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice trailed off. Talking about his parents in such a brutal and insensitive way had forced him to retract his tongue from her sole, not that she noticed during her diatribe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I tell you? You useless foot licker! Start again - I want twenty kisses on each toe, then five licks up and down each of my feet!\" She stated haughtily, clearly having realised that his licking had ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, there was no chance that Harry could carry out these revolting tasks now...but why?</span></div></div>",

Tears leaked down his face while he choked and spluttered. He hated his life - more than he ever had in the ten years of living with the Dursleys.

His Aunt wasn't heavy but he was a small boy (thanks to them not properly feeding him) and she wan adult.  That meant that after a short time the weight of her feet began to hurt.  But that wasn't the worst part.  No the worst part was the terrible smell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flats had smelled absolutely awful.  They were vile beyond belief but as bad as they were they didn't hold a candle next to the source of that odor.  Worse was that she wasn't fully content just to lay her feet on any part of his face.  No she made him move so his body lay perpendicular to the couch meaning her disgusting feet were resting right on his nose and and cheek!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to be strong but a pathetic moan escaped his lips.  Her vengeance was swift and sharp.  She lifted her foot and then brought it back down sharply on his face.  It felt like he had just gotten hit in the face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you useless freak!  Footstools don't make noise!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry lay there pathetically as his Aunt used him like an object, further dehumanizing him.  Harry's self-esteem had always been low thanks to the treatment he received but now it was spiraling ever further downward.  He was starting to believe all of the horrible things they said about him.  He was stupid.  He was a freak.  He was useless.  Maybe he did deserve to be a foot stool for his superiors.  Maybe this was all that he was cut out for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't make it any easier to bear.  The smell still curdled his insides and the weight was growing more and more unbearable however there was a certain peace in finding your place.  At school he knew better than to get better grades than his cousin but why bother even learning?  A footstool had no reason to learn how to do maths or read.  Maybe he should just stop trying to do anything.  Maybe he should stop trying to sneak food when he could.  Maybe he should just lay there and endure his lot in life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was finally happy that Harry was living with them and now it was all being ruined!  She railed at the unfairness of it all but in the end she realized she had no way of fighting them.  But he would still be there for the summers and when he graduated he would move back in with her for good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had kept Harry's foot duties a secret from her husband and son but there had been plenty of opportunities to indulge.  And on days it just wasn't possible she would make sure the boy had his face stuffed with her socks or hose while his nose was buried in her smelliest shoes.  She no longer had to punish Harry since he was completely obedient but she liked to do it anyway just for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night she knew he would be going to that Freakish school so she had Vernon take their son out for pizza while she had Harry to herself for the last time in months.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slavishly licked her feet, sucked her toes and rained thousands of kisses down.  He tried vainly to keep the cringe off his face but Petunia didn't mind.  She relished seeing the evidence of his suffering.  The worthless freak had learned however.  He had learned that no matter how disgusting Petunia's feet were they were his responsibility to adore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your foot slave Aunt Petunia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your worth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you allowed to stay here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you are the best Aunt in the world.

She had completely broken her nephew.  He had no sense of self worth and would obey every command she gave him.  He truly believed that she was the kindest person in existence.  He truly believed that there was no worth in living outside of serving her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you worthless wretch and waste of space.  You will be leaving me for some time to attend your freakish school.  While you are there you will tell NO ONE about what I have made you do.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Aunt Petunia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetunia was confident he would obey.  She hated his freakishness and couldn't wait for the seven years to be over.  Then she have the worm at her feet where he belonged!  Oh how she wished her sister could see the state she had reduced her precious son.   She hated Lily and how perfect her life had been.

His Aunt had put on a great show, manipulating him so that the school were convinced that his family would happily take care of all of his magial supplies and provisions. Even the headmaster seemed satisfed that the Dursleys had adhered to whatever had been agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he was going to a school of Witchcraft and Wizadry hadn't really registered - he lived to serve his Aunt - well her feet to be specific. Even on the day of departure, she \"allowed\" him to kiss her feet goodbye, which turned on to a full hour's licking of her soles-session without her even having to order him, such was his submissiveness and blind obedience to her at this point. Dropped off at the station, she decided to give him a few final reminders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, boy. You may be going to this school of freaks - there's nothing I can do about that. But you're mine - my property...mh footstool...my slave. In your bag mostly are my socks and shoes. You will make sure to sniff and lick them every single day. And when you come back for the holidays, for Christmas, I will be checking that there isn't a drop of sweat or stain of dirt on any of them. If you fail at this then you will redo them over the holiday, and take back TWO suitcases full of my socks and shoes in January! Am I clear, you pathetic little wretch?\" She was so smug, so superior, and so...right, Harry had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Aunt Petunia. Thank you,\" he added meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting on the train was a complicated business, but watching another family helped him to figure it out. Afraid of talking to strangers, and feeling distinctly odd without his Aunt around to dominate him, he sat in a carriage on his own. A ginger-haired boy tried to engage with him but Harry just smiled politely and walked away. He didn't want others to realise what a worthless, useless creature he was. It was best to keep himself to himself. He even considered getting a pair of her socks out to smell, almost like having a security blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny plan he had of doing so stopped there; it was scuppered when someone opened the door of the compartment and decided to join him...</span></div></div>",

Her robes were perfectly tailored for her small frame and she moved with an easy grace.  The girl was Pansy Parkinson a pure blooded girl who's family was quite wealthy.  She took one look at Harry and was about to dismiss him when she saw the edge of the scar peaking out of his messy hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Harry Potter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was like a deer in headlights.  He nodded and then remembered his manners.  He was a worthless waste of space and this girl (like every girl) was far more important than he was.  Anyone who shared his Aunt's gender was better than him by that dint alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes ma'am.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy looked at the boy curiously.  'Yes ma'am?'  Really?  You don't address another child your age that way!  It was rather strange.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me your scar,\" the child said with usual tact that children had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" Harry replied and obeyed.  He was feeling a little bit more secure now that he was taking on the familiar role of a subservient person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy saw the lightning bolt scar and gazed it.  It was a curse scar, the most famous in the world.  Her hands traced it.

He was strange.  Nothing at all like she had expected.  She had thought Harry Potter would be an arrogant boy like Draco.  Either that or a hopeless Light sided Wizard so good and noble that he was already trying to make friends with all the mudbloods that seemed to be on the train.  She absolutely had not expected this strangely passive boy in shoddy robes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Parkinson girl wasn't quite sure what to make of Harry or what she should do next.  </span></div></div>",

But not because he believed it;  he realised that it was the only way of appeasing her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes he was his aunt's footstool - if his uncle or cousin found out, he could potentially die from shame and embarrassment, but he knew there was more to him...Those times when he had caused inexplicable things to happen - growing back his hair...the snake at the zoo, only the other week.

It was not known where Lily went to school, what she did for a living or what she did for a living. There was a suggestion that she might have married at some point, and possibly had a child but this was not confirmed. Even the census records showed no mention of this woman after the age of 11. It was like she disappeared off the face of the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled, she had found what she was looking for. If this Lily had been a witch, then there would be aspects of her life that were not known in muggle society, that would explain why the records ended so suddenly. Her sister had marred someone called Dursley. She was convinced that this Lily had married, had a son and that boy was now living with Vernon and Petunia Dursley. She even had an address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew where Harry Potter lived, and she knew how to use muggle transport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a train ride and a short bus journey for her to arrive at Privet Drive, and now she was here, she started scanning the houses on both sides looking for Number Four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not however looking down, and as she walked she almost stepped on a six inch tall naked boy who was trying to flee in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaagh!\" Harry cried as he saw the girl's foot coming towards him. That was what caused the girl to jerk her foot back in surprise and look down at the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked down, she noticed this tiny boy had a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was browsing the internet, looking for his favorite porn, femdom, especially anything about foot fetish and ballbusting.

The wards were impressive but only worked on those who wanted to harm Harry, except she had seen him being beat by his relatives....it was even worse than her childhood.<br>\r\nBut she also noticed how Harry's uncle eyed him.<br>\r\nWell that was expected considering how cute and girly Harry looked, meaning he is a androgynous.<br>\r\nShe needed to rescue the boy from his relatives, before they go too far.

Maybe make Harry her slave and have him obey her every need.<br>\r\n'<i>Damn...</i>', she thought, as she got an erection from that line of thought.<br>\r\nShe was a futanari basically a girl that had both male and female reproductive organs. Futa's were high up in society, this was due to the fact that futa's were the first magicals, and were the strongest of all magicals. The only reason she wasn't controlling the wizarding world was due to Dumbledore's political power, oh she'll kill Dumble-fuck, it'll be a slow death..<br>\r\nAnyway's she decided to collect Harry at night since tomorrow was Harry's birthday, she thought that Harry would like to finally get away from his so called relatives, think of it as one of her birthday presents to Harry, the others being her healing Harry of all injuries and scars, the other her enslaving Harry for herself. The reason she want to enslave the 7 year old was due to the fact that she had gained respect and a tad crush on Harry, so she had become slightly obsessed over Harry.<br>\r\nShe then vanished with a crack, then a few minutes later his uncle began beating Harry when he came in and tossed Harry into his cupboard locking him in it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ginny Weasley had been looking forward to her journey to Kings Cross Station, not simply because she would get to see her older brothers on to the train, she also wanted to meet the famous Harry Potter. She knew all about Harry, of couse as she was of pureblood scent and she knew the story of how he had defeated Lord Voldemort when he was just a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny child who was capable of such an incredible act before they could even talk had to be someone special, and Ginny was in awe of him. She wanted to be with him, and hopefully more but Harry was a year older than her, which means that he would be in the year above her. If only she could find a way to keep him down, stifle his magical education during his first year so that Harry could be kept down, then they could study together, she would have even more time with him.  She wasn't sure exactly she might achieve that perfect outcome but perhaps if she joined him on the train, she could find a way to accomplish her goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only two obstacles in her way: Firstly, she only knew he had dark hair and a lighning-bolt scar. Since the night when Voldemort apparently died, Harry had effectively disappeared. There were no pictures of him, no mention in the Daily Prophet, nothing. How would she recognise him on a train full of students? Secondly, how would she get on to the train?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of those questions seemed to answer itself when a dark haired boy with glasses asked her mother how to get on to the train. The boy was alone, she noticed. Not only did he look around Harry's age but none but a first year would ask that particular question. The question itself also proved to her that the boy was either muggleborn or unfamiliar with wizarding society. There rumours that Harry Potter had been living with muggle relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst her mother was answering the boy's question, Ginny took a closer look at her face, by this time almost certain that she had found her quarry. There, under all that mass of messy dark hair... the scar. It was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny smiled to herself. By now only Harry and Ron were the only boys still waiting, and they would go together. As her mother finished advising him he wished him \"Good Luck.\" She knew he would succeed though, everyone did. The luck she was offering him was her own desire to join him on the train, the words were aimed more at herself therefore than at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she suspected, Harry made it on to the platform, a moment later her and mother also passed through the barrier and the train lay before her. Whilst she was trying to work out how she might board the maginificent train before her, Fred and George wandered off. A moment later they were back to tell her and mother what she already knew, that the boy they had met was Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny asked he mother then eagerly if she could go on board and see him, but mother refused. She hardly expected mother to agree though. Just as the train was preparing to leave though, mother turned around, ready to head back to the main station. Ginny quickly took advantage of her mother's innatention, she raced to the train, and jumped on board a moment before it started to move. By the time mother realised that she had gone, Ginny would be on her way to Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, everything had worked out perfectly. Ginny was sure that Harry had not made any friends, he wouldn't know anyone else. EIther he would be alone or her brother Ron would be with him. That wouldn't be much of a problem though. Ron may be a year older than her, but she was stronger and smarter than him, she could wrap him around her finger whenever she wanted.</span></div></div>",

Even though she did not have Hogwarts robes, not being a student yet ,she was still part of the wizarding robes and therefore dressed in magical attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and down the train, trying to find Harry and finally she saw him in a compartment alone, just as she had hoped. His Howarts trunk was under his chair and beside it was a cage containing a snowy owl. The owl and the trunk didn't matter to her though, she had found Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs GInny appeared in his doorway, Harry looked up at her. \"Oh hello, sorry I didn't catch your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny\" she replied, \"you don't mind if I join you do you, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty name\" Harry notcied that Ginny was also a very pretty girl, with a strong yet feminine figure The name seemed to suit her \"are you starting at Hogwarts too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm starting next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how come.....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to see you Harry, I have a surprise for you. Close your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry closed his eyes, thinking she would put something in his hand. She didn't though. As soon as Harry's eyes were closed, Ginny walked towards him, standing directly in front of him she turned around so that her back was towards him, then she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGInny settled into place, allowing her full weight to press Harry firmly into the seat beneath her. Seemingly as an afterthoguht, she took off his glasses and put them in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry suddenly felt her weight on him and he opened his eyes. He couldn't see too well without his glasses and he could feel her weight, her nearness, her warmth, her presence upon him. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sitting on you, what do you think I'm doing\" she replied \"relax Harry. I'm not going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" Harry tried to push her off but his efforts were futle. Harry was a weak, wiry boy and GInny was settled in place upon him, he couldn't budge her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I went to all the trouble of boarding the train just to find you and sit on you, don't be silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry reached for his wand but Ginny got it first and put it out of his reach. \"You're mine Harry, and there is nothing you can do about it\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed. It seemed she was right.</span></div></div>",

Hermione and Ginny pulled Harry into an ampty one, as far away from Hagrid as possible. As soon as they entered the boat, Hermione forced Harry onto the seat and Ginny instructed him to lay down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slap had told Harry that it was best to do as these girls asked, so he dutifully layed across the wooden seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Hermione and Ginny both sat down upon him, using both their butts and their skirts to hide him from view. If Harry came across their boat, he would not be able to see that these two girls were sitting on a boy. Harry knew though, he could feel their combined weight now crushing him firmly into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the oppressive weight of the two girls, Harry was now trapped, nothing more than a hidden seat cushion on a boat which now set off on its journey across the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Harry won't be needing these any more Ginny commented, taking Harry's glasses out of her pocket and laying them on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ocular expulso\" Hermione uttered. A beam of red light shot from her wand, and as it impacted upon Harry's glasses, they shattered into tiny fragments. With a wave of Ginny's hand, the last remnants of Harry's former glasses disappeared into the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey over the lake took over half an hour, and througout it all, Ginny and Hemrione chatted amonst themselves, hardly even mentioning the boy they were both sitting upon, whilst Harry felt more and more squished with each passing moment for the girls both kept their full weight upon him the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they reached the school, the girls knew all about each other, their families and their home lives. Hermione was also pleased to see that Ginny had a keen mind, a great sense of humour and was had spent even more time studying her books then she had. She was sure that the pair of them would make a formidable team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the boats landed, the students started to disembark and Ginny and Hermione made sure to stay well away from Hagrid as they carried Harry up to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the large double doors, they opened and a stern looking witch looked out at them all, including Ginny who was standing among the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Professor McGonagall clearly gave no objection at all to Ginny's presence among the first years, even though she was clearly younger, she was not wearing Hogwarts robes and she was of pureblood descent. That last part should have been all the confirmation the professor needed as to her identity; all the pureblood students knew each other by reputation at least and Ginny's red hear and other facial features would clearly have identified her as the daughter of Molly and Arthur Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had been nervous for a moment, but that moment had passed in the blink of an eye and now she was sure that she had been accepted as one of the group of new students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor gave a short welcome speech, explaining a few things about the school and the four houses as she led the students past the large doors of the Great Hall and into a small room beyond. Hermione and Ginny both knew all about the school already though; Ginny had learned from her parents and her brothers, and Hermione had studied Hogwarts: A History.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were not seats in this room, but the girls both led Harry to the far wall and then stood in front of him, so close that they were holding him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think McGonagall didn't even question me?\" Ginny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you've earned your place here\" Hermone added \"you are here now after all, you have a wand and you have performed magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And without Ron, a place will have opened for me\" Ginny smiled \"I'll still need some new robes though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry will pay for everything you need\" Hermione explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will?\" Harry phrased this in the nature of a question but Hermione had already taken out parchment and quill and was writing out a formal authorisation.

Hermione gave the form to Ginny, who read it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This says I can take money out of Harry's vault whenever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Hermione smiled \"when I said Harry will pay for everything, I wasn't just thinking of one transaction. You'll never have to worry about money ever again. We'll owl that authorisation to Gringotts later and then you'll have full access to all of Harry's money. Sole access in fact, the form also says you need to authorise any future requests he makes on his vault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny laughed at that, and hugged her friend. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they queued, Ginny instructed Harry to take his place between herself and Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were ready, the professor lead them out through the door and to the large double doors of the great hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looed up at the ceiling and nodded. \"It is enchanted to look like the sky outside\" she pointed out to Harry, suspecting that Ginny probably already knew \"I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my brothers told me\" Ginny responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first years were led past the four house tables, crowded with students but with empty spaces here and there, and to the front of the hall where a hat had been placed upon a chair. All eyes fell upon the hat, which a moment later started to sing its song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hat sang, almost everyone's attention was turned upon it but Hermione and Ginny used this distraction to give Harry some more instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect you won't be sorted Harry\" Ginny told him \"since you have just given up your place at the school. Everyone else in this line will be though, including me it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ginny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever a girl's name is called, including ours\" Ginny told him \"you will go over to the chair and politely ask the girl to sit on you whilst she is being sorted. If she is unsure then you will point out to her that you are bound to be more comfortable than a wooden chair. If she refuses then ask her to slap you in the face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a girl agrees to sit on you, you let her do so\" Hermione informed him \"you will take your place on the chair  and stay still whilst the girl sits on you and is sorted. When she gets up, you will thank her for sitting on you and tell her that you hope you were a comfortable seat for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever if a boy's name is called\" Ginny added \"you will get off the seat if you are sitting on it, and you will get out of his way. You will not acknowledge him, you will not answer his questions. If he continues to pester you then Hermione and I will deal with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this works out as we hope, every first year girl will sit on Harry during their sorting.\" Hermione grinned \"they might even enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and the whole school will be watching, it is entirely possible that the older girls will also start to get ideas.\" Ginny added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded. \"The one question is that professor\" Hermione added \"she looks strict. What if she doesn't like the idea of Harry asking the girls to sit on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find out soon enough. With luck she won't object too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorting song ended and McGonagall drew out a list of student names, She looked down to the first one. \"Hannah Abbott\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a girl of course, so Harry, as instructed goes to stand by the chair as Hannah came forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall gives him a strange look but as Harry doesn't try to take her seat, she doesn't object... yet</span></div></div>",

As she approached the chair, she was a little surprised to see Harry standing next to it, apparently waiting for her. So it was that she turned to give him an inquiring look instead of simply sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\" Harry asked her \"could I ask you please to sit on me whilst you are being sorted?\"<br>\r\n\"You want me to sit on you?\" Hannah asked, intrigued \"there is a chair right here.\"<br>\r\nPlease sit on me\" Harry repeated \"I am sure to be a more comfortable seat than some wooden chair.\"<br>\r\nHannah gave McGonagall an inquiring look but the professor just shrugged. \"If that's what he wants....\" was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah actually smiled then \"Sure I'll sit on you\" she told him \"what is your name, seat boy?\"<br>\r\n\"Harry\"<br>\r\n\"Take your place, Harry\" that last was given as in instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry quickly sat down on the chair and Hannah wasted no time settling into place on top of him. Harry felt the now-familiar presence of a girl sitting on him, a different girl to be sure but a girl nonetheless. Hannah was also not being gentle, he had asked her to sit on him and that is precisely what she did. She used her full weight to crush him firmly into the seat as she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students at the house tables were not aware of the conversation taking place at the front but they could see what was happening. When the girl's name had been called, the dark haired boy had approached the seat first, and after a brief conversation with the blonde girl, he had sat in the chair and the girl sat on top of him. At that point the boy disappeared almost completely, although from certain angles he could still be seen under the girl. There was some snatches of whispered conversation starting among both the rest of the students in line and those watching at the house tables. Rumours started to spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your hands\" Hannah instructed as she took his wrists and laid held his hands firmly in her own lap. Even if Hary was having second thoughts, which he wasn't, there was no way he was getting free until she decided to release him, and she wasn't going to do that until after she was sorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good suggestion, asking me to sit on you\" Hannah approved \"you should make a habit of it, my  Harry-seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded as the sorting hat was placed on Hannah's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first sorting took over ten minutes, and all this time Hannah nontinued to crush Harry mercilessly into the seat.<br>\r\nHarry did not hear the private conversation that took place between Hannah and the hat, if he could he would have heard that the hat was looking int Hannah's personality, and made no comment at all about the fact that she was sitting on a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though the hat announced \"Hufflepuff! and Hannah smiled. As she stood up and removed the hat, she smiled at Harry. \"You make a good seat, it has been a pleasure using you\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for sitting on me\" Harry replied \"I hope I was comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very\" Hannah grinned \"any time you want me to sit on you, you only have to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked down the line \"Are you going to ask any of the others to sit on you, or am I a special case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will ask all the girls\" Harry replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, perhaps I can encourage them\" Hannah giggled \"a good seat should be shared after all. Others should also use you, as I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah then went down the line, chatting with the other girls, a number of them seemed interested in their discussion. When she returned to  Harry she told him \"Therre are a number of girls who will gladly sit on you, but for now I'll take my place with the Hufflepuffs and watch the show. Bye for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Hannah wandered off to take her place among the Huflepuffs, taking her place next to a third year girl who was smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was the boy you were sitting on?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry Potter. He simply called himself Harry, but I recognised the scar, it is clearly visible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry Potter, really? Did he  ask you to sit on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he wants all the girls in the line to sit on him, When I got up he even thanked me for sitting on him.  I hope they find him a comfortable a seat as I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfortable, you say. I wonder if he is only going to ask the first year girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we will, what's your name if I may ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you may, I'm Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front of the hall, McGonagall read out the name of the next person on her list, who also happened to be a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan Bones\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He simply remained in place and waited for her to come to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl; Susan Bones wore her heair in a long plait down her back and when she saw Harry occupying the seat she actually smiled at him. \"Anyone would guess you actually wanted to be sat upon\" she teaesed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do\" Harry begged her \"and please continue to sit on me until you are sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan grinned \"Of course, I will. Harry\" she informed him \"Hannah tells me you are a very comfortable seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped on top of Harry, forcing the wind out of him, her plated hair even smacked him in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make any hasty decisions\" she advised the hat as it was placed on her head \"Harry wants to be my seat so let's keep him there for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind she seemed to hear the hat chuckling at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl, Harry noted was sitting just as firmly as Hannah had. She relaxed and allowed her full weight to own the boy she was now sititng upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how much it is possible to squish a boy, buy sitting on him for a long time. We will find out, won't we Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Harry agreed as Susan put even more pressure on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have any other girls sat on you?\" she asked \"before you came here that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny and Hermione both sat on me on the train\" he pointed out \"for the whole journey.\" Harry pointed them out, Ginny and Hermione both waved back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, they taught you your place already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My place is as your seat\" Harry pointed out\" you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Susan agreed \"so now you have been sat upon already, you want girls to keep sitting on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the girls who are being sorted, that is my role here, or so they tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will always do what they say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it should be, they taught you well\" Susan approved. She was more than impressed. A couple of fellow first year girls had turned the famous Harry Potter into their own personal toy, their play thing. She put even more weight on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not the first boy I ever sat on\" she told him \"but he was no fun at all, he wasn't as comfy as you and he kept complaining trying to push me off. It seems though, that you know your place. I am really going to enjoy using you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your seat for as long as you want me to be\" Harry told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you accept that\" Susan approved, it will me the next half hour or more so much more enjoyable. I asked the hat not to rush its decision so you will have a nice long stay under there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Harry responded, which made Susan start giggling. Susan wondered what Professor McGonagall might say but the professor was stood back a ways and didn't appear to have heard their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if you'll be sorted into the same house as me\" Susan said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll be sorted into a house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You're here aren't you. Eventually your name will be called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've given up my place, that is what I told Ginny and Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever they want. They promised to protect me from the bullies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan didn't even bother to point out the irony in that statement, although it did amuse her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of them. So you will stay with Hermione and Ginny now, and be sat upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is what they want from me, it would only be by girls though, they specifically told me to avoid boys for my own protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is sensible of them.\" Susan was openly laughing now. Those two had done a real number on Harry Potter, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, at least nothing that concerns you. Well, maybe it does but it isn't anything you need to know about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next half hour or so, Susan simply enjoyed squishing Harry under her butt. Eventually though, the hat decided the time was right to sort her and it put her in Hufflepuff alongside Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan stood up, Harry thanked her for sitting on him and asked if he was comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you were\" Susan smiled back \"well... until next time.\" She went to congratulate Hermione and Ginny on a job well done then walked off to join her housemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to be sorted was Terry Boot, so Harry got off the seat and went back to join Hermione and Ginny who told him he was doing a great job as a sorting seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Terry had been worted into Ravenclaw, it was the turn of another girl: Mandy Brocklehuirst.</span></div></div>",

She also knew that Harry had been specifically told to avoid the boys so it was no surprise to her that when a boy's name was called, he got off the chair and went back to the two girls who had put him in this position in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept glancing back at him whilst the other boy was being sorted. She knew that when her name was called, Harry would come up to the her and ask to be sat upon but she saw no reason to wait to be ask. As soon as her moment came, she could reach him in the blink of an eye, drag him back to the chair and force him to take his place beneath her. She smiled in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was what happened.<br>\r\nThe boy was sorted and as soon as he had wandered off to join his new housemates, the professor called Mandy's name.<br>\r\nBefore Harry even realised that a girl had been called for the sorting, she was taking a tight hold of his arm and had started dragging him towards the now-empty chair. \"You are mine now, seat boy\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even give him time to ask him the question he had asked of the two previous girls. As soon as they reached the chair, Mandy pushed Harry down onto it then dropped on top of him so suddently that Harry didn't even see her sitting down. She sat on him with such force that Harry felt that she must be deliberately flattening him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask you to sit on me\" Harry admitted when he finally got the chance to speak to her.<br>\r\n\"I know\" she admitted \"I thought I'd save you the trouble of asking. I like to take charge of things, be it school work or seat boys.\"<br>\r\n\"I can see that.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't imagine you can see much of anything right now, I thought you usually wore glasses.\"<br>\r\n\"I did. Ginny took them.\"<br>\r\n\"How much can you see without them?\"<br>\r\n\"Not too much. I can make out outlines of shapes, but not much more. I managed to find my way to the chair twice.\"<br>\r\n\"But you can't read spell books or decipher wand movements?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I can't.\"<br>\r\nHow do you expect to study magic then?\"<br>\r\n\"I won't. I've already withdrawn my place at the school, Ginny and Hermione told me I should stay with them.\"<br>\r\n\"You should\" Mandy smiled \"I am sure they'll take care of you.\" Of course Mandy wasn't saying that the girls would be kind to him, in fact she was sure they wouldn't be but she wasn't going to explain this to Harry.<br>\r\n\"That's what they tell me\" Harry nodded.<br>\r\n'Magical oath' Mandy thought to herself 'the signs are obvious'. She didn't say this out loud but she was a smart girl and she already had been reading ahead.<br>\r\nShe simply continued to grind Harry mercilessly in to the seat as the sorting hat was placed on her head.<br>\r\nIt took the sorting hat around 10 minutes to sort her into Ravenclaw and all this time Harry remained buried under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she eventually got up, Harry thanked her and asked if he had been comfortable.<br>\r\nMandy simply laughed out loud but she did nod too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next girl to be sorted would be Lavender brown</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leavender Brown was a blonde girl who came over as a bit ditsy and not overly bright, but she was clearly a girl with a number of very feminine ideas and attitudes .She had seen a number of girls before her sit on Harry as they were sorted and she welcomed the opportunity to take her own place upon him, but her plans for the famous Harry Potter were not quite the same. She planned to sit on him, absolutely she did but somewhere other than his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached the chair she was pleased to see that Harry was waiting for her, she giggled as she waited for the inevitable question.<br>\r\n\"Will you please sit on me whilst you are being sorted?\" Harry asked her<br>\r\n\"Of course I will\" Lavender replied \"you are my seat after all, you are here to be sat upon.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Harry agreed as he moved over to the chair, but as he was about to take his place, Lavender gave him further instructions.<br>\r\n\"Lay on the floor in front of the chair\" she told him \"and lay your head back so it is resting on the cushion.\"<br>\r\n\"You are going to sit....\" Harry repeated<br>\r\n\"on your head, yes. You asked me to sit on you, and I will. I will sit on your head. You do still want me to sit on you, don't you?\"<br>\r\nNearby, Hermione nodded and that forced Harry to say \"Yes.\"<br>\r\nHarry felt himself compelled to do is the girl asked him, Hermiones instructions had forced him to obey the girl who had agreed to sit on him. It did not matter that she had elected in this case to sit on his head rather than his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid down in front of the chair and laid his head back onto the cushion.<br>\r\n\"Turn your head to the side\" Lavender advised \"I won't be smothering you this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time? Harry thought, Lavender intended to do this again... to smother him?<br>\r\nHe could not voice his thoughts though, he had to obey her. He turned his head towards her, and watched as best he could with his limited eyesight as the girl came towards him, She stepped over him, standing with one leg either side of him and with her back towards the chair. She brushed the back of he robes out of the way, revealing her pink panties; a vision most boys would gladly die for if given half a chance. With his head turned to the side though, and his poor vision he was not offered the opportunity to view her most intimate area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Harry's head ready and waiting beneath her, Lavender sat. One moment she was standing above him, the next she was seated upon his waiting head. Harry was suddenly in utter darkness as Lavender and her robes blocked any light from reaching him. Her feminine butt cheeks settled heavily onto his head, squashing him into the chair. Harry did not even notice, could not know when the sorting hat was placed on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fun isn't it Harry\" Lavender todl him \"I'm going to make your head go all squishy under there.\" To emphasise her point she added even more pressure. Harry noticed in particular that his jaw was feeling squished right now, With Lavender sitting on his head, her weight effectively forced his jaw to remain closed. He could not open his mouth at all. \"Mmmmph\" was all he could say, although he could still breathe through his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I guess you can't talk\" Lavender mused \"no great loss, boys are far more pleasant to sit on than to listen to anyway.\" She sat even more firmly as she spoke, deliberately crushing Harry's head under her full weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of other girls laughed at that, including Hermione and Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls had been using a wizarding camera and taking picture of all the girls in line as they sat on Harry to be sorted. She laughted out loud when she took the picture of Lavender sitting on him. Harry's body emerged from under her robes, his feet resting on the floor whilst hers were hung loosely in mid air, not resting on anything. Harry's head was nowhere to be seen, as it was at that moment covered by her pantie covered butt, hidden by her robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think, Harry\" Lavender said then \"if I hadn't told you to turn your head to the side, you;d be going to sleep right about now. Then too if this sorting takes a while, well you might never have known what it will decide. As it is though, I am happy for you to stay around and awake whilst I am sorted, but your head can jolly well squish.\" She sat even more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls\" Lavender called to the other girls waiting in line \"I can recommend sitting on his head, it is so much fun,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Harry was feeling so completely pressed under her, his jaw was aching. He could only hear out of one ear as the other was sealed under her butt and he could feal severe pressure on his skull, crushing his head into the seat. Harry felt by now he would be used to girls sitting on him, but he was wrong. Hermione and Ginny, and the other girls who had been sorted had all sat on his lap, or on his chest during the lake crossing. Having a girl sit on your head, especially one sitting as firmly as Lavender was doing was far more intense, This girl was perhaps not much older than him but right now it felt like he was buried under a young elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender continued to sit, loving the feeling of Harry's head trapped underneath her, and she remained that way for over a quarter of an hour. As the hat finally declared her a Gryffindor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got up, she pulled Harry to his feet and examined his head.<br>\r\n\"No permanent damage\" she declared \"pity, maybe next time I'll make a better impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed as she skipped over to join the Gryffindor table<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next girl to be called was Millicent Bulstrode, and girl that seemed to be trying to become as wide as Harry's cousin, Dudley</span></div></div>",

Somehow she was so immense that she made Dudley look like he was on a diet. Harry started to feel that she would probably squash him completely flat the moment she sat on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Harry had been given his instructions by Hermione and Ginny, and he was compelled to obey them. <br>\r\n\"Will you sit on me?\" Harry asked, as this enormous female mass came towards him. <br>\r\nMillicent laughed out loud when heard this. \"I don't think any boy has ever dared to ask me that\" she commented.<br>\r\n\"Will you?\" Harry repeated, still not getting an answer to his question and hoping beyond hope that she would decline his offer and that he might get away with just asking her to slap him. No matter how hard the slap, it surely wouldn't hurt as much as being sat upon by a girl like that.<br>\r\n\"Sure I will\" she continued laughing \"you are going squish, seat boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry moved towards the chair but Millicent kicked it out of the way. \"You won't be needing that\" she told him.<br>\r\nHe looked confused for a moment, before she gave him some more instructions.<br>\r\n\"Kneel down on the ground, on all fours so I can sit on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had to obey, he got on all fours as the girl commanded, facing the house tables and looking towards the floor.<br>\r\nMillicent stepped over him, standing with her legs on either side of his body, also facing the front, then she sat.<br>\r\n\"Don't collapse on me\" she told him \"if you do, I'll break every bone in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHary felt her massive weight suddenly drop onto his back, crushing him mercilessly as she sat on him. Within a couple of minutes his arms and legs started to ache and he felt sure that he would give way at any moment. Despite her warning, would it be possible to keep his position with someone as massive as Millicent Bulstrode sitting on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters even worse, she lifted her feet off the floor and subjected him to her full weight. How could he possibly maintain the presence of such a girl sitting on him?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could feel a sharp pain in his wrist as Ginny had in fact sprained his arm with her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon could clearly see Hermione sitting on Harry in the opposite seat, but from that position Harry looked to be nothing more than a boy-sized seat cushion, which in fact he was.

There was no visble spark of glow from the wand but there was a change in Ron that was immediately apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon had been struggling, not happy that his yougner sister was now sitting on him and trying to throw her off. In an instant though, his struggling ceased and he completely relaxed. On his face there appeared an expression that could only be described as sheer bliss, not mere pleasure. Whatever Ginny was doing to him, Ron was enjoying it immensely;; a kind of pleasure that a man would normally only experience during sexual activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you just did to your brother, he really likes it\" Hermione commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean besides sitting on him?\" Ginny giggled, but then she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it is an advanced spell I found on one of my brother Bill's old school books. I thought it might come in useful some day but until now I've never had the chance to use it properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a spell that only works on males for some reason\" Ginny explained \"it causes the brain to relase a hormone called dopamine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard ot it, isn't dopamine associated with pleasure and addiction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one\" Ginny nodded \"there are acts of course that cause the brain to relase the chemical naturally; I am sure you know what I mean. I gave Ron here a particularly high dose and until I release the spell, it is not going to go away. The spell was designed to help cure addiction by causing a gradual withdrawal of the pleasure response and training the mind to disassociate the act with the pleasure stimulus it causes, but it can also be used to create an addiction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you stimulated the pleasure centre of his brain immediately after sitting on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, and as neither fact is going to change any time soon. I suspect Ron's mind will soon connect the one with the other,  In that case he will actually derive phyiscal plasure from the fact that he is my seat to the point that he will crave it constantly. Ultimately, simply being sat upon by me, or even by any girl could cause his brain to release more dopamine. Wouldn't that be fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would indeed\" Hermione gilggled\" could you show me that spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny nodded and demonstrated the spell for her friend, who picked it up surprisingly fast. She then cast the exact same spell upon Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had cast a spell which stimulated the pleasure centre of his brain. This meant that not only was she sitting on Harry Potter, firmly, but through her magic she was forcing him to love it. He would want her to keep sitting on him, which of course she fully intended to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny, who was doing the exact same thing to her older brother, started to make a number of suggestions to him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we are at home\" she told him \"you will come to my room every day and ask me to sit on you. This I will do, of course. I will gladly sit on you for several hours at a time whilst I attend to whatever it is I am doing, and you will do nothing other than quietly serve as my seat cushion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon responded by uttering \"yes, Ginny\" in a dreamy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's another effect of the spell\" Ginny told Hermione \"whilst they are in this state they are open to suggestion, they will accept whatever you tell them as they are so completely aroused that they can't reason for themselves. They will simply accept what you say without question and they will continue to accept it for as long as they live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This just gets better and better\" Hermione laughted, then she addressed her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, Ginny and I are your best friends, we will always be your best friends. Everything we are doing and will ever do to you is a token of that friendship. You will accept it, you will enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry dreamily offered his comfirmation, Ginny told Ron that everything Hermione was saying was completely true and that he must never disagree with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being your best friends means we can do whatever we want to you. We can sit on you whenever we want, as firmly as we want for as long as we want. We can cast spells upon you, including curses. We can hurt you physically if we choose. We can take you anywhere, we can use you however we wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that covers it\" Hermione laughed \"the boy who lived is our willing plaything,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just such a shame I would get to amuse myself with Ron while I am at Hogwarts\" Ginny sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want I can sit on Ron when I am not sitting on Harry\" Hermione suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Ginny giggled \"Ron, whilst you are at Hogwarts, Hermione may sit on you, and she can also ask other girls to sit on you or to use you in other ways. You will accept this without question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ginny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Hermione and GInny knew that both boys were simply their willing toys, they continued to sit on them as the train continued its journey.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How can a boy even survive if he is flat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw this boy in the street once\" Hermione explained \"I don't know how but somehow his boy had been pressed completely flat, flat like he had been cut out of a sheet of parchment and an image of a boy had been painted there. I thought that was what he was at first, but I kept looking back at him, and no matter which angle I looked at him from, he was looking right back at me.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hermione continued to sit on Harry, more firmly then she than she ever thought she might, applying more pressure to his groin and his back then she even thought was possible for she was not only sititng on him, she was leaning into him, pressing his chest back against the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was flattening him somehow. She hoped so, it was what she was aiming for. Ginny had encouraged her to flatten Harry and she was doing all she could to try and do exactly that, whilst at the same time making sure that the pleasure hormones were pumping through his brain. Whether or not she could actually succeed in flattening the boy, she was going to make sure that Harry loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hormone was having its desired effect; Harry was blissfully unaware of what was actually happening to him as the chemical soup addled his mind. Hermione as has world now, she was everywhere and it felt wonderful. It did not occur to him that she was right now literally putting him through the mangol; sitting so firmly upon him that she was squishing him into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was both surprised and pleased to see that her plan was actually working. Yesterday, if someone had told her that she could sit on a boy so firmly that she could squash him completely flat, she would have laughed and yet here Harry was, getting flattened. Perhaps because she was a witch, her own magic was somehow letting it happen, but for whatever reason it was happening, and it wasn't taking very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few minutes, Hermione had squashed Harry's chest and groin completely fat. When she noticed there was no distance at all between her own body and the seat, she knew it had worked and she got up to admire the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's still nromal arms, legs and head were sticking out of what was now a flat chest and flat thighs. All of Harry that she had sat on and pressed was now flat. She laughed when she saw him, and Ginny applauded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Harry\" Ginny called to him and Harry replied with a \"Hello\" in repsonse. Despite his condition, Harry was clearly still alive and conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll flatten your arms now, Harry\" Hermione commented as she laid Harry's still flattened arms upon his now flattened groin, bending them at the elbow so his hands and wrists were also resting on the seat. Once she was sure both his arms would fit completely under her butt, she sat back down and applied the pressure once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really didn't think it would work\" Harmione admitted \"but now that Harry's body is flat, I'll do the same to his arms, then his legs and finally his head. It's surprisingly easy in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you cast a spell or something?\" Ginny asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just decided that I wanted to flatten him, and here we are. I've never tried it before so I don't know if it is a gift or whether my magic just took over. Perhaps you could try it on Ron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could, it sounds like fun but for now I'll enjoy watching you flattening Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Harry's arms were as flat as his body had become. Hermione got up again, and took of Harry's shoes before shifting his legs back onto the seat, bending his knees as she had with his arms so the full target are would be covered. This wasn't too hard as most of the area above his knees was already flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few minutes Harry, then I will squish your head, Harry\" Hermione smiled, as she kept playing with his mind, making sure he was loving what she was doing to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hermione got up this time, she shook his body a little and his clothes fell from his now-completely-flat body, leaving him completely naked. Hermione smiled, as she folded his flat form into a neat little bundle with his head resting on top. Now, when she sat on him, his face and the rest of his body which was now neatly folded beneath it, disappeared under her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to let him breathe occasionally if we want to keep him around\" Hermione joked as she was now subjecting his head to the same treatment as she had already applied to the rest of his body. Of course she was loving what she was doing to him, and she would allow him the odd breath but no more than one a minute at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was being subjected to the most intense facesitting imaginable. He couldn't see much without his glasses but his world was now one of complete darkness and Hermione. She was truly owning him now as his face was buried, and starting to flatten beneath her. Occasionally she would shift slightly and let him draw a single breath, but only one and then the sheer force of her presence would bear down upon him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 10 more minutes before Harry's head was as flat as his body. Hermione admired her handywork; a flat boy-shaped mass folded into a convenient seat-sized shape on her chair.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Smiling at the sight of what she had done to him, Hermione lifted Harry's flattened form from the seat and sat back down. She even showed him to Ginny, who nodded her approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had been reduced to a completely flat form of a boy that had been folded over a number of times so that it would fit entirely under Hermione's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione didn't want him entirely under her backside now though, she had other plans for Harry now that he was flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined him more closely and noted that the parts of Harry that had been folded over themselves had been pressed so firmly together that they were effectively fused. Harry was now blob-shaped, and he would remain that way unless he was molded into another form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis she attempted, and found that Harry's flat form was extremely pliable; almost like a stick of gum. Harry could be pulled and stretched into any shape she wanted, and yet no matter how much she pulled at him, she could not seem to stretch him beyond endurance; he would not break. She could even undo her actions by pressing him back into his previous shape. Perhaps she could turn him into a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe measured him against the skirt she was already wearing under her robes and pulled Harry to the same length, even adding a little extra room so she could make any necessary adjustments at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was satisfied with his length, Hermione began stretching Harry out to the side so she could wrap him around her own body. She even stood up occasionally, and tested him to see if she had managed to pull him to the correct length. She noticed, as she was doing this that Harry's face was in the perfect position; it would be pressed against her backside, and would in fact be under her butt whenever she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Hermione wanted a skirt that would encircle her body, not a single flat piece so she made Harry a little longer than necessary so she could attach the two ends of her 'skirt' and fuse him into the correct skirt-shape. With a tap of her wand, Harry's body connected to itself, forming a skirt that would fit Hemrione perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few more wand motions, Hermione attached a waistband to the top of her new 'skirt', folded the top of the skirt over the waistband and magically stitched it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that her Harry-skirt was now wearable, Hermone stood, removed her existing skirt and put Harry on in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer was the pefect fit, and he was really comfortable. Hermione was sure that Harry would be a pleasure to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more wave of her wand and Hermione sealed Harry into his current shape.<br>\r\nHe was no longer pliable, he would remain a skirt until she decided to reverse her spell but she had no intention of doing so any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow wearing her new Harry skirt, she resumed her seat, and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure she could now wear Harry has her regular skirt, she might wand to dye him though as anyone who looked too closely might see he had once been a boy, but it wouldn't be too hard to accomplish this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen nobody would know that The Boy Who Lived was nothing more than a young witch's skirt. She could keep him that way for as long as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ginny was delighted when she felt Ron start to flatten, and as Hermone had, once she had succeeded in flattening his groin, she got up, folded Ron's body in on itself and continued to flatten the rest of him. Finally Ron's entire body was flat, and folded on itself, and it was then that Ginny took the last step, sat on her brother's head and started flattening ti as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got up, Ron was the same kind of amorphous blob that Hermione had flattened Harry into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione gave her friend a high five as Ginny gave blob-Ron as shake to dislodge his clothes. Hermione folded these neatly and stored them in Ron's own trunk. She cast a spell to make Ron''s flesh turn black as Ginny started to mold her brother into a new skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long at all, and after a few more spells to fix Ron into his new form, Ginny took off her current skirt and put Ron on in its place. <br>\r\nGinny, now earing Ron as her skirt sat back down and Hermione stored her old shirt inside Ron's trunk since Ginny did not have a trunk of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't think either Harry or Ron's robes will fit me, and they are boys, or at least they were.

Well if you don't get into Hogwarts, you can just go back to the village, and travel home as you planned originally.

Hermione screches after almost half an hour of bouncing and pressing herself down on Harry's small body, triying her hardest to crush the boy flat but there had been absolutely no change. She was starting to get very annoyed and so was Ginny who had offered to help crush him until Hermione pointed out the red head was smaller and lighter than her so if she couldn't do anything the other girl didn't have a chance.<br>\r\nFinally she hoped off the young wizard and was even more annoyed to see he was exactly the same as when she began ''Why isn't this working, I'm doing everything I can think of to flatten you and you are a particularly weak boy already so why won't you crush?'' she asked, her irritation causing a barely visible aura of magic to form around her ''Hermione'' Ginny began but was stoppd by the brunette's death glare ''I know what this is, this is you resisting me, I order you to obey me, you will be crushed and you will do as I command!'' the witch's anger met it's peak with her magic, causing a pulse to fill the room with light as Hermione used accidental magic on the Potter boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does her magic do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. It causes Harry's body to become almost like living parchment, making him paper thin and only retaining total control over his eyes and mouth, all other forms of mobility is restricted by his new form, he can be used like parchemnt and is just as easily rolled or damaged, though running a wand along any tears cause them to join together as though it was never damaged<br>\r\n2. It shrinks him to 4 inches tall,  a good size to be used as a seat cushion for Hermione, as well as making it easier for her (and any others in the future) to hide him on her person if she so choses.</span></div></div>",

After a while Ginny stood up and pulled her older brother up by his hair making him whimper.  \"Aren't you happy I let you go?\" Ginny asked as she pulled her arm back and punched Ron straight in the face breaking his nose before she knees him in the groin.  Ginny let go of her older brother's hair letting him sink to the floor holding his battered crotch as blood pored out of his nose.  Ginny smiled seeing him like this for as the youngest she was often picked on by Ron as he was picked on by Fred and George it felt good to pay him back.  Due to his new position on the floor of the cabin Ron's face was level with her knees so she brings it forward and once again crunches his already broken nose.  Hermione was beside her self with laughter as she watched the Ginny beat up her arrogant male brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Ron was about to pass out due to the pain she had caused him Ginny pulled out Harry's wand and cast one of the spells she had learned from the spell books from Bill and Charlie that made it that Ron would not lose consciousness until she wanted him to so that he would be awake as she inflicted more pain on him.  Satisfied her spell worked Ginny stamped down as hard as she could on one of Ron's hands and grounded it into the floor of the cabin hearing some bones crack before bringing the foot up again and kneeing Ron's chin making him fall backwards into the wood panel under the window.  \"Please stop Ginny,\" Ron begged spiting out a tooth and some blood as he looked horrified up at his sister.

Ron tried to look anywhere but straught up, for he could see up her skirt, to her most intimate area, and this was a sight of his sister he really did not want to see up close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had other ideas though. She used her feet to make sure Ron's head was pointed straight upwards, and then she sat. She sat quickly so that Ron did not have time to react. She settled her crotch into place upon his waiting features and used her brought her full weight to bear upon her victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's face was now entirely hidden beneath his sister's skirt, he could feel her warm bickside pressing down upon him, moulding itself to his face, owning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny smiled, no other seat had been this comfortable for her, with the possible exception of Harry but Hermione was using the Boy Who Lived right now. Now she was in control, the power was hers, he was exactly where he needed to be, where he would stay. He felt so good under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was loving what she was seeing. Ginny was so in control of her brother that she had complete authority over whether or not he could even breathe. She continued to apply more and more pressure to Harry as she watched. She may not be sitting on Harry's face right now but perhaps... later?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon could not breathe, Ginny had cut off his air the moment she sat on him. He could feel her butt flesh covering him, her warmth all aroudn him, her feminine aroma, and he could do nothing. The worst part was that her womanhood had claimed his nose. No boy should get that close to his own sister's most sensitive area, and here she was, smothering him with it. He could do nothing to stop her though; his hands were broken, his body was battered, bruised and sore. He could hardly move without causing himself severe pain and he was entirely at Ginny's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was showing none, she was simply reveling in the moment, loving everything she was now doing to him. Ron had been a constaint thorn in her side, but now the tables had turned and Ginny was going to show Ron exactly what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon continued to smother under his sister, who had relaxed and simply allowed her own body to continue the job of suffocating her brother, but the spell she had cast was very much in effect. Despite the fact that Ron could not breathe at all, despite the fact he was feeling the effects of oxygen deprivation; light headedness, stars in front of his eyes, blurred reality, he could not fall into unconsciousness. His brain was unable to take that final step and fall into darkness. He continued to suffer, airlessly under his sister but he was forced to stay awake and experience every agonising moment. This was sheer torture beyond anything that Ron had ever experienced in his life. </span></div></div>",

She could have read that passage herself but she knew it would have more inpact for her brother, and for Harry who was now smothering under Hermione, if a boy read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what Ginny had already done to him, Ron had no reason to believe that Ginny wouldn't do as she said if he disobeyed her, so he looked through the page, found the passage his sister had mentioned and started reading aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nIt was in the early 20th Century that witches first realised how much power they could weild over their wizarding kin. The ideas was first proposed by a young witch named Constance Avery. Constance had been observing the efforts of muggle women to overthrow the opprssion of muggle men, and she had decided to take the matter one step further. 'Wizarding Men' she reasoned 'should learn to be owned and used for the pleasure of witches, and that should be their rightful place. She was not alone in this idea, a number of her female friends were also intrigued by the idea of dominating the wizards in their lives, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of these women soon started acting out their desires. They would often sit on their husbands for long periods of time, even on their faces. One of those women even developed a spell to keep their male victims conscious whilst their captors sat on their faces and suffocated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the idea grew, more and more women joined the witch supremacy movement as it was called until it seemed that the entire female half of wizarding society was controlling all the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese women caused, as a symbol of their movement, a large stone statue to be created headed with the words 'Magic is Might'. Whilst many in the wizarding world believe this statue to depict a group of witches and wizards sitting on the backs of muggles, this is not what a witch sees. The statue was enchanted by those who construced it so those not in the moment would see a symbol of anti-muggle bigotry but what the statue really depicts is an image of a group of witches sitting on top of wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven today there are still many wiches who hold true to the philosiohy of Constance Avery. Whilst in public they seem to treat men as equals, behind closed doors they are often made to serve as nothing more than seat cushions for the amusement of their wives and daughters.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you have it, Ron\" Ginny nodded as she took the book from him and shiftend back into position on her brother's face, smothering him once more. Ron found his airway cut off again as he was once more covered by Ginny's skirt and backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, Hermione continued to sit on Harry's face, whch remained buried under her backside, under her skirt. Her thin panties were the one thing separating Harry from her butt flesh not that any sign of his face as actually visible. Harry would have passed out by now through lack of air but the spell which hung over him kept him conscous, kept him aware. What he was acutely aware of was Hermione, she was everywhere. She was owning his face, using it, and as she was loving every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incidentally\" she continued, now happily sitting on his face again \"it may interest you to know that I saw mother sitting on father's face the other day. Why do you think she is the one who runs the household? She has forced father into subservience. Clearly she is not going to object ot Hermione and I sitting on Harry, or you either for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of air, whilst not causing Harry to back out since was was unable to do so, was effecting his mind. His thoughts became dreamlike, foggy, misty, disconnected. In this state of unawareness he was more succeptable to suggestion than might normally have been the case.</span></div></div>",

For the next two hours Ginny taught Hermione spells such as stunning, summoning, but also a spell that would fix any damage done to a male.  During the course of the time Ginny would move just enough for Ron to take a breath of air so as not to cause Ron to become brain dead.  \"Not that you would need your brain being a seat or servant for a witch,\" Ginny had joked during one time when Ron took a breath giving her older brother/seat a nice pat on his cheek.  \"Want to give the healing spell a go?\" Ginny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled as she got off Harry's form and picked up his body and began to pull his arms behind his back making Harry wail.  Ginny being kind sat back on Ron's chest yet keeping him pinned under her so he could watch as the famous wizard Harry Potter's body was contorted like a pretzel.  Hermione giggled as she began to twist the arm behind Harry's back and hearing the wail increase in volume Ron tried to look away but Ginny grabbed his head and aimed him towards the action.  Hermione gave Harry a push so he landed on the seat Hermione than placed a foot on his body prevented him from moving before grabbing one of his arms and pulling it so hard it is wrenched from it's socket.  Harry's screaming was really beginning to annoy Hermione know so she takes a pair of underwear from Harry's chest and shoves them into his mouth and casting a spell that would make it impossible for him to spit them out.  With Harry successfully gagged Hermione began to work on his other arm by holding it out at full extension before punching the joint as hard as she could breaking it and making it hung loosely at his side.  With both arms ruined Hermione took a hold of Harry's legs, one in each hand, and pulled them apart as if he was a wishbone.  Even through the gag Harry;s screams were earsplitting as Ron begged both girls to leave him alone not that either paid attention to him after all he was only a wizard.  Hermione than brought her foot down in a hard stomp on Harry's genitals over and over again as tears began to fall from Harry's eyes.  When she was done with that Hermione let go of one of Harry's legs and used her free hand to break the one she was holding at the knee.  Hermione than went after Harry's last remaining leg by bending it backwards so far it was almost up Harry's own ass before she gave a hard jerk to the side breaking it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not satisfied Hermione than laid Harry on the floor before she climbed onto the seat.  Giving Ginny a smile Hermione jumped off and performed an elbow drop to Harry's stomach breaking at least one rib.  As Harry began to cough up blood into his gag Hermione finally decided to cast the spell to heal him.</span></div></div>",

I suspect your brother's (now former) wand will have changed allegiance but if you need a new wand then please let me know by return of owl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival at Hogwarts, you will join the rest of the first year students and you will be sorted with them. As for what you do with your brother at the school, that is entirely your choice as the WSM recognise that he belongs to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee you at Hogwarts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor M McGonagall<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you that Harry and Ron are ours\" Ginny smiled as she opened the package that the second owl had brought and found a full set of school robes, winter coat and new dress robes. \"Fantastic!\" she exclaimed but then she frowned slightly \"this would have cost mother a pretty penny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione pointed to a slip of parchment that had fallen onto  the floor, Ginny picked it up and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nGinny<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are your new school robes. I am sure that by the time you read this, you will have taken possession of Harry Potter, I informed Madame Malkin that he will be paying for your new clothes, the cost is exactly 12 galleons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations again on your brilliant plan, I am so proud of you my darling Hogwarts student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove<br>\r\nMother<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione reached into Harry's pocket and took out 12 gold coins which she placed in a small pouch attached to the delivery owl's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth owls flew out of the window, leaving Hermione and Ginny alone with the boys.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When both were down to their underwear just to tease the boys Hermione and Ginny posed in front of their property laughing as even though both boys were terrified of them they were sporting hard-ons.  \"How about you both thank us for such a wonderful show,\" Hermione said as she lowers her pantie covered ass back on to Harry's face.  \"Now kiss it bitch,\" Hermione ordered and gave Ginny a wide smile as she felt Harry begin to kiss her panties and began to laugh as she moved some her panties aside so he would be kissing her ass.

Ginny moved over to where Harry was resting with his head on the seat, and Hermione moved closer to Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could see the younger, red haired girl smiling as she came over to him, then she stood over him, her back against the wall, her legs on either side of him, her butt just a short distance over his face. Harry could see that she was wearing her panties but nothing else and her long, red hair flowed down her back.<br>\r\nA moment later, she sat down and her pink panties came to rest on his face. Ginny's panties did not entirely cover her butt flesh and Harry could actually feel her physical presence pressing down upon him. Her skin was warm, and firm and yet it still molded itself to his face. She was a strong, athletic girl; she knew that there was no way that Harry could budge her now that she was sitting on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's world was plunged into darkness, and his breathing was once more abruptly cut off; only to return when Ginny chose to allow him any air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew this was not Hermione who was sitting on him this time, her fragrance was still feminine but it was different, and the feel of her body pressing down on him was not the same as it had been with Hermione. That did not matter, Harry knew that a girl was once again sitting on his face and that he was powerless to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny relaxed and allowed her butt to own the boy she was now sitting upon. It wasn't the same as when she had sat on her brother, this was special, this was Harry Potter and she was loving the fact that her butt was so completely owning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short distance away, a similarly unclad Hermione had now claimed Ron's face and was smothering him in the same way that Ginny was suffocating Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any instructions for me?\" Hermione asked \"this one is your brother, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I ask is that you don't kill him\" Ginny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about brain damage, would you mind if I killed a few brain cells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny shrugged \"I don't think he'd notice the difference anyway.\"</span></div></div>",

I don't know your surname though, so you are clearly a mudblood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco had just made a serious blunder. Most normal boys would not offend two girls who had subdued and were sitting on the faces of two other boys, especially if those girls both had wands pointed in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment though, Malfoy's superior attitude had overridden his good judgement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ginny who hit Malfoy squarely in the chest with a curse which caused him to double up in sudden agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising imediately that he had outstayed what little welcome he had, he bolted out of the door and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that word was an insult of some kind\" Hermione mused \"or did you just feel like using the boy for target practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a boy like Malfoy, the latter is usually the case anyway\" Ginny answered \"but that word he used, and I won't repeat it, it is a really disgusting insult directed at muggleborns. If you ever hear anoying using it, especially a boy like that, I'm sure you'll find a creative way to make him regret his actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am sure of it\" Hermione nodded.

Sit on his face as the mudblood and Weasley were sitting on the faces of Harry and that other boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea sounded truly frightening, the colour drained from his face almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought was that he should run away before Parkinson made good on her threat but at that instant the witch pulling the sweet trolley arrived in their doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco looked at the woman, with pleading in his eyes. \"Please, you have to help me\" he begged \"this girl says she is going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sit on your face\" Pansy completed, nodding at the older witch. Her mother had told her that the cart witch was a member of the WSM so she knew that Draco wouldn't get any support from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, girl\" the witch nodded, standing in the doorway and blocking Draco's only means of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco was stunned. How could the woman go along with this insane idea? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent though was getting out of her seat. Draco felt her hands gripping his ankles and pulling sharply. He slipped out of his chair and landed on the ground with a thump. Millicent then dropped on top of him and grabbled hold of his arms. He felt her weight on his groin, pinning him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Millicent was in place, Pansy pushed Draco's head back so it rested against the seat he had been occupying a moment ago, then moved across, She lifted her leg over him, then stood, a moment, one leg on either side of his head, looking towards Millicent and the witch. Draco could now see directly under her skirt, to her most intimate, feminine area. He tried to move his head to the side but Pansy twisted it back into place so he was looking straight up at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Harry and Ron before him, Draco was immediately plunged into total darkness, He felt her weight, her flesh covering his face and a moment later he knew she was also sealing his airway when he failed to draw any breath. Pansy relaxed and simply alowed her young womanhood to smother the boy beneath her. It did not matter that this was a pureblood, the son of Lucius Malfoy; he was a boy, and now he would be her unwilling victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would enjoy every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Draco, Pansy and Millicent did not know was that Hermione and Ginny had cast spells on their seats, forcing them to remain conscious but Draco was under no such protection. If Pansy sat for long enough then he would pass out, or worse. At this point though, he had no idead whether Pansy would ever let him breathe again. With Millicent also holding him down, and controlling his hands there was nothing he could do to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older witch continued to stand by the doorway, enjoying the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With Millicent crushing his body and Pansy seated so firmly on his face,  there was no way he could possibly free himself.

Even then I will wait a while longer, make sure he is gone for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all sounded so clinical, a plan of death. Draco knew that if she did as she said, there really was no hope for him at all. He would smother until he was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if a bit of subterfuge might help his cause, he tried to remain still, hoping to convince the girl that he had already passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't do him any good, Pansy just laughed. \"Silly boy\" she chuckled \"he doesn't realise that in a minute or so his body will start to involuntarily fight for survival, it is a natual response to suffocation, and will happen whether or not he pretends to lie still now. When those struggles cease, that is when I will know he has passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco still did not move, he was still trying to bluff her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed, and a little while longer. Soon, Pansy's prediction did indeed come true. Draco started writing and twisting like mad, trying to push the girls off him. With both Millicent and Pansy sitting on him though, his efforts proved totally futile. His throws died away after around 30 seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy was loving what she was doing to the boy. To have such absolute control over a boy as to suffocate him under your ass was the ultimate act of domination. She felt little pulses of sheer pleasure pulsate through her body as she continued to sit on Darco's face. This was the ultimate way to dispose of a boy, far more intense and powerful than any killing curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco was out cold. The cart witch actually came forward and monitored the boy's vital signs, feeling for a pulse every few seconds. Eventually she reported that his pulse was irregular... fading.... stopped completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy remained seated upon his face for another quarter of an hour to make sure that the boy was truly dead, that he could not be revived by CPR or by magic. When she finally did stand up, she knew that he was gone for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the boy's corpse, his face blue, his eyes blank and lifeless, and she congratulated herself<br>\r\nDraco was gone..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart witch was delighted she transferring sweets from her cat, offering the girls a large selection of everything she had on offer. Pansy and Millicent knew it would take them the rest of the journey to work their way through that pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how shall we get rid of the body?\" Millicent asked.<br>\r\n\"How do you like to get rid of him?\" the witch asked, he's your kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could burn the body perhaps, a controlled fire that leaves no residue?\" Millicent thought that would be the easiest option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we shrink him down to just a few inches\" Pansy added \"I'll swallow him whole along with my sweets.\"</span></div></div>",

There is a lady who comes around with the sweet trolley, it gives people a chance to meet with friends, it offers a build up to the main event and of course it is a comfortable ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why it is comfortable for you\" Hermione nodded, and Ginny smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you serious about helping to keep Harry back a year?\" Ginny asked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. He made you that promise and I inded to help him to keep it, even if it means sitting on him during all of his classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you do that anyway?\" Ginny giggled/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you send me Harry's report cards?\" Ginny asked \"I want to see evidence of Harry's failing gades since I can't be with him directly this year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I get them to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Harrry's owl can deliver them, in fact feel free to write to me, let me know how you and Harry are getting along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked over at Hedwig. \"I keep forgetting about owls delivering letters\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppsose it takes a little getting used to.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What I just did doesn't compare to what Fred and George have done in the past. I might get yelled at, but it won't be that bad.

He won't tell Mother about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" responded Hermione. \"By the way, have you decided what you'll do with Harry's wand? It's not like he'll need it this year since he'll be failing all his classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm still thinking about it. When I cast those 2 spells, this wand felt right to me. That reason alone makes me hesitant to destroy it. But whether to keep it for myself or return to Harry, I don't know yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may make a suggestion, you could return to him for this year only. Then next year, when you get a secondhand wand, you can swap wands with Harry so that you get his wand that works great for you and Harry is stuck with the secondhand wand forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a wonderful idea!

Fred and George are twin boys who are still attending the school, and Percy is in his 5th Year and is a Prefect. Bill and Charlie left some time ago. Bill works for Gringotts, and Charlie works with dragons. I've read their old school books, but this is the first time I have had access to a wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why you might be relunctant to give Harry back his wand\" Hermione commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you are right. The ministry won't let me use a wand until I get to Hogwarts. Here, on the train, surrounded by students I can get away with it but back home I'd have mother and father on my back. It's easier if I wait until I get my own place at the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been reading ahead too, but I think you might have the jump on me, having access to your brothers' books as you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can compare notes if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment after Ron left, an aging witch arrived, wheeling a trolly on which were stacked tons and tons of varieties of sweets. <br>\r\n\"Anything off the trolley, girls?\" she asked, seeming not to have noticed Harry. This was hardly surprising though, Ginny was sitting on Harry in such a way that he would only be visible at all from certain angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take the lot\" Ginny told her, digging into Harry's pockets and pulling out a handful of wizarding coins. Not moving from her seat, Ginny handed over move money than was storred in her family's vault at Gringotts whilst she and Hermione in exchange were given a huge supply of edible treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the witch departed Ginny remarked \"None for you, Harry. You are just a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I paid for them\" Harry protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I paid for them, Harry. You just supplied the coins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means I paid... \" Harry began but shut up when Ginny pointed his own wand at him. From what had happened with Ron, Harry knew that Ginny was more than capable of using that wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ginny and Hermione started tucking into the sweets, Ginny gave her friend some information about them.<br>\r\n\"Be careful with the every flavour beans\" she advised \"they mean every flavour. I had a vomit flavoured one once, I nearly threw up.\"<br>\r\n\"The chocolate frogs aren't bad, but mind they don't get away from you. They can get quite far on their first jump. What you really want are the cards though, they show famous witches and wizards. Everyone collects them.<br>\r\nHermione nodded and made sure the door and window were both closed before opening one of the chocolate frog cards. \"Professor Dumbledore\" she remarked, reading through the detail on the back of the card. Hermione had an idetic memory, she was sure she could read that card verbatim if she needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some time, Ginny and Hermione said very little, they just enjoyed each other's company and the pile of sweets that they were slowly working their way through.</span></div></div>",

You look like the photos of Lucius Malfoy I've seen in the Daily Prophet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. He's my father and my name is Draco Malfoy. You better behave yourself while at Hogwarts. My father is on the Board of Directors after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about standing on your own merits and not hiding behind your father,\" interrupted Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy turned towards Hermione and said, \"And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione Granger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recognize that family name as a Wizarding name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents are Muggles.

I have more important things to do then dealing with you two. Come on Crabbe, Goyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle left the compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny, what was that term he used mean? Mudblood, I think it was?\" asked Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny ended her glare and sighed before answering Hermione. \"It's a nasty word that refers to Muggleborns. Some like Malfoy think that Muggleborns are inferior due to their Muggle blood so they use that term as an insult to Muggleborns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess even in the Wizarding World racism and discrimination exists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you have no idea\" replied Ginny. </span></div></div>",

He is a comfortable seat and I want him to stay that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got anything else we can cast spells on?\" Hermione asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny took Harry's glasses out of her pocket and threw them on the floor. \"That should work for a few spells, levitation for example. For some other spells, we can just cast them into the air I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls took out wands; Hermione held her own whilst Ginny had Harry's wand in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumos and Nox were the first spells they both achieved, lighting the tips of their wands and then extinguishing them. They both managed to levitte Harry's glasses several feet into the air, and let them drop, shattering both lenses in the process. Hermione then used another spell to repair the glasses and make them like new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried several other spells as well, some shrinking and some growing. Hermione used her wand to lock and unlock the door of their carriage, then she locked it again to give them a bit of privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each cast a number of curses into thin air, none of them impacted on a target so they could not see if the effect had been successful or not. GInny disarmed Hermione and then returned her wand to her, and Hermione did the same to GInny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of them, it was Ginny who demonstrated the greater knowledge, casting second, third or even fourth year spells that Hermione had not come across yet, since she only had the first year books whereas Ginny couuld draw upon what she had read in her brothers' old school books. At one point she called out \"Accio Glasses\" and Harry's glasses flew into her hand, she threw them back on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end both girs congratulated each other on their achievements. \"I'll owl you some of Bill and Charlie's school books, then you can study the advanced spells. From what I've seen, you'll fly through them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, that'll be very helpful\" Hermione replied, smiling.</span></div></div>",

I guess I'll need some kind of magical replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send you a wizarding timepiece along with my brothers' books.\" she sighed \"I guess I'll have to get up if we are going to get Harry changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only temporary\" Ginny told Harry as she got up and lifted the boy to his feet \"before you know it you'll be back under me where you belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ginny stood up, Harry immediately felt the change and his first thought was that he did not like it. Ginny had been sitting on him for so long that Harry had started to feel as though he somehow belonged under her. He had felt her weight upon him for so long that the instant she stood up he reached towards her, trying to pull her back down onto him. Ginny saw this and she smiled. Harry was already learning his place. Ginny approved of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Ginny pulled Harry up from the chair, his body did not straighten, in fact his legs maintained their bent, sitting position as though Harry had somehow lost all motion in them. The hours he had spent being used as Ginny's seat cushion had stiffened his limbs to the point where he could no longer seem to control them. Ginny was sure that they might come back to him in time, if she and Hermione stopped sitting on him but she knew that wasn't going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his legs still in their rigormortis-like state, Harry was unable to stand and he collapsed to the floor. Ginny laughed at this, and Hermione congratulated her friend by giving her a high-five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny noticed the a pair of glasses close to where Harry had fallen, and her mind immediately told her of another way in which she could ensure that Harry failed all of his classes. \"I don't think Harry will be needing those glasses any more\" she advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione grinned, then she too got up, lifted her foot over Harry's glasses and then stomped on them repeatedly, each stop ending with her tristing her foot back and forth. When she had done, the glases were a mangled mess. One of the arms had snapped off, the rest of the frame twisted beyond recognition and the lenses were reduced to tiny slithers of shattered glass. Ginny used Harry's wand to sweep up all the glass fragments and dump them out of the window. Hermione knew that the repairing spell she had used earlier would be ineffective against glasses that were that far gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny then opened Harry's trunk and took out a set of his school robes whilst Hermione started to pull off his casual clothes. She lifted off the t-shirt and top, then she removed his belt, unbuttoned and pulled off his trousers. These she folded neatly onto one of the now-vacant seats. Harry was now in his underwear, his face turning red at the knowledge that he was almost naked in the presence of two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better get over your embarrassment, Harry\" Hermione advised him \"you can't dress yourself any more so one of us will be doing it from now on, every single time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween them Hermione and Ginny then started to dress Harry in his Hogwarts robes, starting with his school trousers. These weren't easy to fit as Harry's legs were still stuck in their bent position, but with a bit of lifting and some force they managed in the end. Ginny fitted Harry's belt in place around his waist but did not fasten it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione lifted Harry into a sitting position on the floor as Ginny fitted and fastened his shirt and school tie. The tie was of course uncoloured at this stage, same as Hermione's as Harry had not yet been sorted into one of the Hogwarts houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Hermione and Ginny had fitted Harry's school robes over his shoulders and arms, Ginny packed Harry's other clothes away in his truck and Hermione lifted Harry back onto the seat. Finally his legs no longer looked out-of-shape as he was sitting down once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny walked over to Harry, turned and resumed her own seat, upon Harry. The moment he felt her now-familiar weight upon him again he let out a contented sigh and actually thanked her as Hermione fitted and fastened his school shoes. Harry was now dressed in the clothes of an unsorted Hogwarts student, but still he was nothing more than Ginny Weasley's seat cushion.</span></div></div>",

Hermione quicky agreed, knwing that the two of them were goign to have a great deal of fun over the Christmas break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll write all the time\" Hermione promised \"I'll keep Harry's owl busy deliverign my letter and pictures of Harry and me together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time\" Ginny sighed at last \"I've loved this trip even more than I thought I would, I've made a wonderful best friend and Harry has been the perfect seat cushion, as you will soon discover for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls got up and Ginny once again dragged Harry to his feet, yet his legs remained in their bent position. In order to make Harry at least look like he could stand on his own, Ginny and Hermione each stood on one of his feet, gripped him under the arm and pulled him upwards. Harry cried out in sudden pain but at least their efforts managed to straighten his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Harry''s body now apparing to stand upright, Ginny and Hermione took hold of him and led him from the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stepped onto the platform, they could hear an older male voice in the crowd crying out \"Firs' Years, Firs' Years... this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should go before whoever that is starts asking questions\" Ginny commented \"but first there is the little matter of Harry's wand.\" She took the wand out of her pocket, looked at it for a moment then....</span></div></div>",

I can keep practicing the spells from the books, including the most advanced ones and as I live in a wizarding home, the ministry will think one of my brothers or my parents are simply living their lives naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true\" Hermione nodded \"and since he doesn't wear glasses any more, it would not be safe for Harry to own a wand anyway. We both know he is only a seat now. If you keep practicing, maybe you will have reached OWL standard before you even get to the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the plan\" Ginny grinned \"see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny took one last look at Harry and Hermione together before she walked off the platform, taking the path which led into Hogsmeade village.

The sooner I get you to Hogwarts, the sooner we can get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice calling out 'Firs' years, this way\" became louder, it sounded closer and a large man who looked like he might even be a giant came into view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hagrid\" Harry recognised him of course, he knew that gruff voice even if he couldn't see the man properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was in no mood for reunions though. she didn't want Harry to meed with any old acquaintnces and would much rather keep him entirely to herself. She therefore kept herself and Harry out of the giant's way and followed the rest of the first years who were walking toards a series of small boats on the lake shore. She spotted an empty boat and pulled Harry into it. She pushed Harry down onto one of the seats and immediately sat too, on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Harry had felt squashed under Ginny, that was nothing to what he felt when Hermione sat on him. Hermione was older than Ginny, onder than Harry too and she had been waiting hours for the opportunity to sit on him, she took full advantage ofi it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt himself being crushed firmly into the seat by the girl who was forcing her full weight onto him. Hermionee was every bid the girl that ginny was, and more besides. She sat back against Harry, pressing him so firmly against the side of the boat that Harry was struggling to breathe. Hermione relaxed and luxuriated in the feeling of using Harry as her seat cushion, whilst Harry got the distinct impression that his body was being put through a mangol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy it, Harry\" Hemrione informed him \"this is all you will ever be now, at Hogwarts and in your life beyond.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted Harry to accept his place beneath her, and ideally she wanted this transition to take place before they reached the school. She hoped the journey would not be over too soon, and was pleased to see that the boats started moving off at a fairly leisurely place. Clearly this boat ride was a treat that was not intended to be rushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed and sat even more heavily upon Harry as she started asking him questions about his former life. \"So, this family you live with, what are they like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horrible\" Harry answered \"they treat me like dirt, and their son Dudley is fat and spoilt. He bullies my constantly and they let him get away with it. He threatened to sit on me once, I was terrified.

What reason will you have to stay at the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to stay!\" Harry gasped \"I really don't want to go back to the Dursley's, they'll make my life hell.\" He pleaded with Hermione. \"You said you could keep me away from my cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did.\" she smiled \"but I will have to find some reason for you to stay at Hogwarts. If you can't study magic, perhaps I can find some other use for you. That is what you want, isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It occurs me me that I might have already found a use for you, what am I doing right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are sitting on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, and Ginny was sitting on you on the train as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she got up to change you into her robes, you didn't want her to get up, you tried to pull her back down onto you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted her to keep sitting on you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she has gone away, so what now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are sitting on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I've taken over from her, that is considerate of me isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should keep on sitting on you, just as you wanted Ginny to do earlier, so you now make that request of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled, this was proving easier than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I sat on you at Hogwarts, you would have a purpose. You would be my seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As my seat, you would be mine, you would stay with me always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to stay with me, then you wouldn't ever have to go back to the Dursleys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't ever want to go back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you agree to be my seat from this point forwards\" she pointed her wand at Harry \"you will live under me and be sat upon constantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of Hermione's wand glowed for a moment, then went out.

She was clearly amused. She tilted her head back and smiled contently as she allowed her perfect ass to smother Harry mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke not a word to the boy beneath her butt as he continued to suffocate. Her full weight bore down relentlessly and endlessly on Harry's face, and yet every now and then she could add just a little more pressure, Whenever that hapeened, she added that extra to the crushing force she was using to assault Harry's face. She closed her eyes in contentment, and revelled in the sheer bliss of crushing Harry's face in the airless prison of her perfect butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt the intenese pressure of Ginny's perfect ass, bearing down upon his face so utterly that she seemed to be crushing his face into the floor of the train by her ass alone. Her thighs, were strong, firm and warm. Her flesh was everywhere, enveloping his face, using him as her personal seat cushion. In total darkness, he was entwined in her warm, suffocating embrace and his only hope was that she would somehow release him before he died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Harry's face was turning red but Ginny couldn't see it as his face was hidden under her skirt. She did notice that his nose had come wedged between her but cheeks, and she grinned as she squeezed her but cheeks together and broke his nose. She didn't stop there though, she maintained her grip and squeezed harder, listening to the sound of his nose continuing to shatter and squish in her butt's embrace. By the time she was done, his nose would be nothing but mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his need for air became desperate, Harry's body began to twist and writhe, trying to escape the suffocating hold of the girl sitting on him. His efforts were fuitle though. Ginny was far stronger than him and she could do nothing against her intense, suffocating, feminine force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the motion stopped, Ginny felt sure that he was out cold. She would stay a moment or so longer, to make sure he was definitely unconscious. Before she was done, she checked his pulse and was pleased to see that he was still alive.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before his awareness left him, he felt sure he could hear a girl's laughter from somewhere above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he found himself laid on a soft, cushioned surface; the seat of the train.

Fill your wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" Ginny giggled as she slipped off of Harry for a moment.

She then went to his trunk and took out quill, ink and parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Ginny was writing the letters, Harry was in a state of sheer hell. Hermione was heavier than Ginny and she was sitting so firmly on his face that she was literally crushing his head into the seat. He was buried so deeply under her ass the very thought of breathing was unthinkable. Hermione was relaxing and enjoying the feeling of Harry's face being used as her seat cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wrote the latters, Ginny watched Harry's face getting redder and redder as he continued to smother under her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she walked over to Harry and sat down firmly on his chest. With both of them sitting on him, Harry was powerless to do anything but suffocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until she was sure that Harry would pass out at any moment that she handed one of the letters to Hermione.<br>\r\n\"Sign here\" Hermione informed him \"once you sign, I'll let you breathe. If you refuse then you can go to sleep for a while and we'll go through all of this again when you wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry took the quill and used it to cross out the letter that Ginny had written, he didn't sign and so Hermione didn't move. She maintained her suffocating grip and waited for Harry to go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he awoke, Ginny had written another letter for him, and was still sitting on his chest. Hermione had given him enough air to allow him to come around, but the moment his consciousness returned, she sealed his airway once more under her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny did not hand the latter over immediately, she allowed Harry to smother under Hermione for some time until she was ready to ask him to sign again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione didn't say anything to him this time, she just presented Harry with the form and quill. <br>\r\nThis time Harry was ready to be more cooperative, he signed the form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemrione nodded and Ginny resumed her seat on his groin, and Hermione shifted back onto his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry gulped in several breaths of life-sustaining oxygen, Ginny passed both letters to the owl who flew off to deliver them.</span></div></div>",

Every time she turned around, someone seemed to be telling her how great that boy was, and why? The story went that he managed to defeat the most powerful dark wizard in the world when he was barely a year old. Nonsense!ws <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still a baby at the time, even if he had magical power at that point there was no way his as-yet-unformed mind would have been able to control it. If something about him had somehow stumped Voldemort, then it was not through any conscious act of will, Why, therefore was Harry Potter paraded as the great savour of the wizarding community when he hadn't actually done anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't going to let him get away with it. One day she would catch up with the Boy Who Lived, and when that glorious day arrived, she would make him wish he hadn't. She fully intended to knock that halo off his head and turn it into his slave collar. Harry Potter would not be so great when he had become nothing more than her own personal plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst she was passing through Kings Cross with her mother and her brothers, she did not expect to run into the boy, but it seemed that fate was smiling at her that day. The dark haired boy with glasses who approached her mother looked to be about the right age, and then she caught a hint of that lightning bolt sky under all that untidy mass of hair. She also saw that Harry was quite a scrawny boy, he would be no match for her physically... better and better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Harry didn't know how to get onto the platform, hardly surprising since he had been living with muggles from what the stories about him had said. Mother offered him some advice, and Ginny quickly saw a way in which she could go with him, with her mother's blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should take him through, this time\" she suggested \"if Harry has doubts then the barrier might not work for him, and that'll alert the muggles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, Ginny. See him onto the train, I'll see you back here once he is settled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I take the train, mother? I'll be boarding it with Harry anway. I'll floo back home from Hogsmeade when we get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Ginny. Enjoy the ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny then took Harry's hand and led him through the barrier. Instantly, the scene changed. Harry could see that they were on the afore-mentioned platform 9 3/4 and the train was there waiting for him. Harry also noticed that Ginny had a firm grip, and was showing no intention of releasing his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled Harry onto the train, and carried him forward until they found an empty compartment. Ginny closed the door behind them as Harry pushed his trunk under one of the seats, and sat down.</span></div></div>",

He started shouting and then he felt a mouth skilfully suck his cock and started moaning from the immense pleasure. He threw his potions book away and saw that it was the pretty redhead from earlier, still clothed, his moans only grew, but as he neared his climax she stopped, took her head off and started slowly jerking him off, enough to keep him near cumming but not enough to let him cum. He then heard her say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Harry, do you want to cum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please, I beg you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have to sign an unbreakable betrothal agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll do it, where is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she pulls it out and he signs it.

He was known in the wall wizarding world because he vanquished a dark lord as a baby, he lost his father that night, but his mother was spared by the Voldemort, no one knew why, he lived alone with her ever since.<br>\r\nHis mother, Lily Evans Potter, is a very beautiful woman, quite tall at just over 6 feet tall, dark red hair and emerald eyes, at just 31 years old, she was still young and very fit, practicing a lot of sports, especially karate and weightlifting. Harry admired her a lot, but lately, it started to become a little obsessive, he was starting to lust after her, being dominated by her!<br>\r\nHarry was still discovering his sexuality, but he already knew he was a big masochist, with a foot fetish, he wanted to be under his mother big feet, size 43 EU, to massage and lick them for hours, and his ultimate fantasy would be to be kicked in the balls by her, possibly as hard as her karate legs could! He started masturbating in her shoes a few weeks ago, fantasizing about being caught and punished by her, sometimes with her friends from her karate class. In his dreams, he was always naked, and she would kick his balls barefoot or in pantyhose, sometimes in socks, perhaps another fantasy, he wondered.<br>\r\nHarry was a very powerful wizard, he started to do magic without a wand 2 years ago, with the guidance of his mother, but she didn't know he used his powers to steal some magazines and SM videos in her sex shop, it revolved around foot fetish, trampling, ballbusting videos, a chastity cage that was much too big for him, and so on.<br>\r\nIt was a hot afternoon of August, a few days after Harry turned 10, he was alone in Potter Manor, his mother was gone to her karate class for a few hours, it was good time to relieve himself. Harry enters the living room and switchs the TV on, and put a long ballbusting video, where a man was tied up and kicked non stop, he takes one of his mother running shoe, and sniffs the interior, it was very smelly, she uses them to run every morning. He then puts the sole on his hard dick and started rubbing, the shoe was so much bigger than his 2 inch dick, she could probably crush his balls in a single kick if she wanted!<br>\r\nHe continued masturbating until he climaxed, he was tired and fell asleep naked on the sofa. Two hours later his mother entered still in her karate uniform and flip flops, she took them off and entered the living room, she was shocked to see her son naked covered in cum, she put a sleeping charm on him to not wake him up, and watched the video. To say she was shocked was an understatement, her son was a masochist, and he masturbated with her shoes, probably fantasizing about her kicking him, she was suddenly excited about the idea and started to become wet!<br>\r\nDoes she confronts him and dominates him or \"ignore it\" and bust his balls \"accidently\"?</span></div></div>",

She is a karate black belt, fifth dan, and used some grey rituals to enhance her strength and speed a little above human limits, but she created a spell on the fly, it would make his balls indestructible but even more sensitive, then she used a spell so he would not pass out from the pain.<br>\r\nHarry was on the sofa naked with his legs spread, Lily used a spell to put a rope around his balls, pulling them away like a target, then she prepared an axe kick, and smashed her bony heel into his balls as hard as she could! Harry woke up suddenly with an enormous pain between his legs, he tried to scream but discovered he was silenced. <br>\r\nWhat he saw was beyond his wildest dreams! His tall sexy mother in her karate uniform smashing in balls with her beautiful feet! He looked at her right foot which was still crushing his balls, she then started to twist her foot, like she was trying to put off a cigarette, smashing his orbs. Her sole was rubbing on his penis, despite the pain, he was having the biggest erection in his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little pervert\" she says \"I raise you the best I can, and this is you thank me! Well, if you want your mommyto hurt you so much, you should have asked, because now, we're going to do this every day! You are mommy's slave now, I will kick your balls, trample you and make you lick feet everyday, and since you've been a bad boy, you are not allowed to cum anymore! Ejaculus Terminus!\" she said pointing her wand at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you cannot cum until I lift the spell, but you can still get hard! I can see blue balls in your future for a long time! Now get up, your punishment will start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry managed to get up, he was so short compared to her, below her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread your legs for mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spread his legs and she used magic to tie him up like that, and tu put a gag in his mouth, he was at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made mommy very angry today little boy, so I am going to kick your miserable balls 20 times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could blink, she kicked him very hard with her right foot, her instep crushing his balls with absolute strength, how did hid balls survived he wondered, he was in so much pain and exctasy. She decided to not let him breath and continued kicking him non stop, each kick would have  lifted him 3 feet off the ground if he was not attached. Her kicks were so fast he could only see her legs blurr!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and twenty\" she said with the last kick, she gave him a toe kick, her big toe burying itself in his right balls, her sharp nail making him feel like she just stabbed his balls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all this, his little penis was hard and leaking precum, he would have cum if not for her spell, and he already started having blue balls.</span></div></div>",

Also I will not need an Owl after all you never use Hedwig for any thing important so I do not see why you should not let me use her,\" she said and Harry had to actually agree for the only letters he had ever gotten were from Ron and Hermione outside of Hogwarts and only one letter during the school year from Hagrid.  \"And did you think I would want a toad? A cat maybe but a toad seriously Harry,\" she said shaking her head in disapointment.  snatching the quill from him Hermione wrote in another suggestion for him to get her as a pet before handing it back.

It was just the 1 and I briefly only got a glimpse of it when I was walking with my parents to the different stores, but a phoenix was there. I would like you to write another letter, asking if they still have a phoenix and if so, that you'd like to buy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think I am? If they don't have it, then I have a Plan B for a pet,\" added Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't sure if he wanted the phoenix to be there or to settle on this \"Plan B\". A phoenix would be very expensive, but he had a bad feeling about the vague other option. Harry took out new parchment and drafted this new letter to the pet shop that had a phoenix the past summer.

Harry noticed that Hedwig didn't even acknowledge him as she went straight to Hermione's shoulder, offering up the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hedwig,\" said Hermione as she patted Hedwig, who hooted in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took the letter and as she read, her excitement grew. Gringotts approved all the transfers she requestd and there was no suspicion of line theft on her part. Harry Potter was now penniless while all the fortune, titles, and possessions that he previously had now belonged to Hermione Granger (save for his clothes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione thought about what to do now that their situations had changed forever.</span></div></div>",

As they passed the first door, Harry could hear the voices of girls chatting and giggling amongst themselves, and he recognised Ginny among them. Just what was she telling the other first years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the second year girls' dorm, Harry noticed there was a dog-sized pet basket next to one of the beds. Noticing where he was looking, Hermione nodded. \"My bed, your bed\" she indicated the two. Clearly the dog bed on the floor was meant for Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't fit in there\" Harry complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you will\" Hermione laughed \"I enchanted it for you, you'll fit perfectly my pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nuts, Hemrione\" Harry muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to give me sixty more galleons?\" she asked him \"go lay down in your new bed. Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook his head. He had already lost one bet, he didn't want to risk losing any more money and Herminoe was sounding just a little too smug. He didn't have to put money on the line this time though, it was obvious he was too big to fit in that bed. A clear demonstration would be enough to humiliate her this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe deliberately wandered over to the dog bed and stepped onto it. Surely his own boy-size compared to that tiny bed would be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he stepped onto the bed though, something seemed terribly wrong, the bed was suddenly so much bigger than it had appeared a moment ago. Hermione didn't look any bigger though, why was the bed suddenly so large?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down, Harry\" she instructed, and Harry curled up in his new bed, expecting it to be far too small for him, but in actuality he somehow had plenty of room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a simple expanding charm\" Hermione told him \"your bed will magically grow to the right size whenever you get into it, but the effect is only noticeable from within the bed. The effect not unlike a magical tent that is much bigger on the inside, or a bag that has had an engorgement charm placed upon it so you could fit far more inside than a similar sized normal bag. From here, your bed looks no bigger than normal but you appear to be no smaller than an average sized dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, he should have suspected that magic was involved somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stay, Harry. You will not leave your bed until I let you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hermione got ready for bed herself, and in a few minutes, dressed in her night clothes, she had slipped under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

I may occasionally throw you some scraps from my plate, if I do then you will consider these to be a special treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take care of all of your needs, that includes bathing and toilet visits. The school does not have separate facilities for pets so I will bring you into the girls' toilets when that is required.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will obey each and every command that I give, without question and without complaint. You will accept your status as my pet and that you are mine to do with as I please... forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not talk with anyone but me unless I give you permission to do so, even if they ask you a direct question. You will not ask questions, ever. If nobody is talking to you then you will remain silent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As with any pet, you will stay off the furniture, you will sit on the floor, not on chairs unless I specifically instruct you to sit in a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I give you the command to 'heel' then you will follow behind me wherever I happen to take you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will stay with me at all times, you will not leave the room where I am unless I give you the command to 'stay'. If I temporarily let another girl take care of you then you will remain with her until she returns you to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are forbidden to use magic, this is a direct instruction from the ministry as you just saw. You may not hold a magic wand, ever. You may not brew or take a potion unless I tell you to drink said potion. You may not fly a broomstick. I will take hold of your broom from now on. As your owner, all your possessions are now mine anyway. I will also take care of your former owl, Hedwig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the rules.

When she placed the bowls in front of him, she released him from the silencing spell that she had put on him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, my pet. If you don't eat your breakfast, you'll make me sad. I bought those bowls just for you. If you eat and drink up everything in the bowl, I'll scratch you behind your ear that you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he realized it, at the mention of Hermione's \"reward\", Harry started eating and drinking from the bowls as fast as he could. He did not notice the identical smirks that Hermione and Ginny gave one another. When he finally finished, Harry looked up at a smiling Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's a good animal? Who's a good pet? Yes you are! Yes you are!\" said Hermione as she bent down on ruffled up his hair before scratching his right ear, exactly where he liked it. As Hermione knew it would happen, Harry's leg began to thump in pleasure. When Hermione pulled away from Harry, Harry got a hold of himself and blushed heavily at the actions he just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you keep deluding yourself that you're a human, Harry. Just give up this game and proclaim yourself my pet. It's obvious to Ginny and I that's where you belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did not answer as Hermione and Ginny started to laugh.</span></div></div>",

Teaching him tricks would be a great step in doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now, Hermione,\" said Harry as he was starting to stand up. \"Why don't we all go to the library, your favorite place at Hogwarts?\" As much as Harry disliked studying and hanging out at the library, doing that would be a lot more fun for him than what Hermione and Ginny clearly wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, Harry, but this will be a lot more fun.\" Hermione pointed her wand at Harry and said, \"And I know just the first trick to show you.

Her anger was enough to snap her out of her shyness in front of Harry but it wasn't enough for her. She wanted revenge but she wanted it done in a unique way. She wanted Harry to see himself as inferior to her, Ron's little sister. Part of her was excited at the power she was going to have over the Boy-Who-Lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny decided to start her plan that night in the Common Room. \"Hello, Harry. Want to play Wizard Chess?\" asked Ginny. She noticed that Harry, Hermione, and her brohers were shocked, knowing how she acted over the summer in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Ginny\" replied Harry.

I've secretly been practicing most of my life at home and you've only been flying for one year. I've got more experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying Quidditch was Harry's favorite thing to do.

Whoever could catch the most balls out of 100 (while flying Harry's broom as it was better than the school brooms) won the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they started, Ginny decided to make it into a bet. \"Harry, let's make this interesting. If I win, I keep your broom. And if you win, then you can have my diary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same diary that you protect constantly?\" asked Fred. \"But surely you've written your deepest secrets into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same one. What do you say, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what would I do for the games? I can't play without my broom.\" reason Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you better win. However, if I win, then I'm the better Seeker and I might as well talk to Oliver Wood and take your place. After all, you were a first year when you got on the team. Why can't I?\" asked Ginny. She knew if she won, this would be a huge blow to Harry's ego and confidence. That's why she kept raising the stakes for what would happen if she won; Harry wouldn't be able to back down after that. She also figured it might make Harry nervous and choke during the bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ginny\" replied Harry after a moment. \"If you win, you get my broom and my spot on the Quidditch team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" said Ginny as she shook his hand. \"I'll go first then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were in position, Fred started throwing the golf balls and to everyone's amazement, she caught them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you have to be perfect Harry to force a tiebreaker, otherwise I get your broom\" said Giny in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry then swalowed and got into postion. Fred started throwing the balls and at first, Harry was doing fine. But then Ginny's voice got into his head and he got nervous at what would happen if he lost. He didn't even notice when he missed one, causing everyone to gasp and Ginny to get a huge smile. After all the balls were thrown, Harry said \"I guess that's it. I got them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Harry?\" asked Fred in a surprised voice. \"You missed 10 of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" repled Harry. He was so consumed by his thoughts that he didn't notice himself missing one of them, let alone 10. He looked at Ginny and saw her huge smile. He lowered down to the ground where she was. \"A bet's a bet. You're the better Seeker\" mumbled Harry as he looked down to the ground and handed his broom, one of his favorite possessions, to its new owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, Harry. It's nice to hear you graciously accept your defeat at someone who is better than you at Quidditch\" said Ginny in a condescending voice. Everyone else was stunned at the turn of events and Ginny's new attitude of wanting to beat Harry at stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt ashamed. Playing Quidditch was his favorite thing to do and now he lost that privilege to Ginny in a bet. By lunch the next day, the whole school would know about the bet and that there was a new Gryffindor Seeker. He was starting to feel scared of Ginny. What other things would she prove to him that she was better at? </span></div></div>",

Luckily for him, she didn't speak to him, so nothing happened at breakfast. Although, word got out about the Quidditch bet and people were laughing at him in the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was only the beginning. Harry went to Charms and found himself struggling more than usual with his classwork. He was struggling even doing the stuff he could already do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Harry? Are you sick?\" asked Hermione when they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm fine. I must be having a bad day is all\" said Harry as he tried to get Hermione to let it go even though he was also wondering what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to Transfiguration next and the same thing happened again. Not only couldn't he do what he was supposed to do, he could barely do his first year knowledge stuff. Panicing, Harry decided to talk to Professor McGonagall after class. He assured Ron and Hermione that he didn't need them before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Potter, is something wrong? You're performing worse than you normally do\" aske Professor McGonagall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. For some reason my wand isn't doing what it normally does\" wondered Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. The only thing I can think of is if you lost your wand in a duel.\" replied Profesor McGonagall. \"If that's the case, then your wand rightly belongs to whomever took it from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wands can change masters?!\" esclaimed Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Even a simple Expelliarmus can cause it to change hands if the caster caught it in their hands. Even if the winner gave it back willingly, the wand won't recognize you as the owner unless you defeated that person in a duel and forcefully took your wand back.\" said Professor McGonagall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say I lost a duel\" said Harry in a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who defeated you?\" asked Professor McGonagall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny Weasley. We argued and she cast Expelliarmus on me and took my wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" said a shocked McGonagall. \"I would suggest talking to Miss Weasley and telling her this. If I'm not mistaken, she's using a hand-me-down wand. Perhaps you can use that wand until you can go to Ollivander's again. It may or may not be better than your old wand but at least your old wand will be with its new owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Professor McGonagall\" replied Harry in a sad voice. Another thing of Harry's that he lost to Ginny. When he left, he saw Ginny in the crowd and decided to talk to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny!\" said Harry when he was close. \"Can we talk...privately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Harry\" said Ginny in a confused voice. \"Lead the way to an unused classroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they found an empty room, Harry explained what was going on with his wand and by the end Ginny was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean to tell me that I am the new owner of your wand because of a simple Expelliarmus and me catching it? And that I don't have to use my hand-me-down wand anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right. Professor McGonagall said that I should use your hand-me-down wand until the next time I'm in Diagon Alley and ask Ollivander for a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny stopped laughing at this. \"Oh no, Harry. I don't think so. I think you should keep my old wand\" started Ginny as she put her old wand in his hand and took Harry's old wand in her hand; indeed, Harry's old wand felt perfect for her. \"That way, you can always remember why you don't have your original wand anymore. Think of it as another reminder that I am better than you. After all, you're getting my hand-me-downs. In fact, how about I give you more hand-m-downs from me? You're small, so you can probably fit into my clothes that I don't want anymore\" said a now excited Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had a horrified expression as Ginny grabbed Harry's hand and raced to the Gryffindor Common Room. Ginny's words of her being better than him ringed in his ears. Harry was starting to believe it. He was inferior to Ron's little sister.</span></div></div>",

I must say the wand fits her well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry merely nodded, missing his wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Ginny, what did you want to say about this?\" asked McGonagall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Professor McGonagall, I'm just worried that with my old hand-me-down wand, Harry won't be able to keep up with his 2nd year classes. He might even struggle with his 1st year classes. I understand he barely passed Potions, Herbology, and History as it is with his wand. It might not be a bad idea to put him back as a 1st year.\" said Ginny in a fake concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was shocked while Professor McGonagall actually took a moment to think about this. \"Yes. You have a point. At the earliest, Harry won't be able to get a wand until next summer and that's a school year away. Mr. Potter, I'm going to have to ask you to do some 1st year Transfiguration and Charms. If you do poorly enough, along with you poor grades from your other classes in your 1st year, I'm going to have you replaced you as a 1st year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was still shocked. This had to be Ginny's plan all along. If they were both 1st years, they would share all their classes together and thus he'd be spending more time with her while slowly distancing himself from Ron and Hermione. Ginny wanted to monopoloize as much of his time as she could. But at the same time, he understood he couldn't argue that his magic suffered without his old wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Professor McGonagall. Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes, it was clear that Harry was struggling with 1st year spells and Professor McGonagall told him he was replaced in 1st year and given a new schedule. She also informed him that she would be telling the staff this at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ginny then left her classroom with Ginny in front and Harry behind. Ginny noticed this and said \"From now on, whenever we walk together (and we will walk together for every class and meal now), you are to walk behind me. You don't deserve to walk beside me as an equal. After all, I would never be bumped down a grade\" said Ginny with a smile. she was lovng at the downward spiral that Harry's life was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was silent at this new change. The one thing he had over Ginny, that he was older than her, was effectively nullified by him being placed in her grade. Not only that, but with what Professor McGonagall was implying, Ginny was doing better in her 1st year classes than he would be very soon. It would be confirmed soon that she was better than him at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry continues to walk behind Ginny as she leads him towards the Great Hall for their lunch. Ginny did not walk too briskly, she wanted Harry to keep up after all but at one point he did slow his pace and a slight gap appeared between them. He could now clearly see the back of her robes and the swaying of her body as she walked. Even at this age it appeared her movements were feminine and graceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay close, Harry\" she warned him without even turning her head, apparently aware of the gap that had started to emerge between them \"you don't want to lose sight of me, you could easily get lost in a place like this if I am not here to look after you.\"Apparently now she was telling him that she was a young child who couldn't be trusted to wander off on his own whereas she clearly had no problem with it. Was this another means by which she was asserting her superiority over him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked though, Harry quickly moved to catch up with her. Now he wa so close that if she lost her footing and tripped, she was likely to drop on him. She didn't though, instead she gave him a number of instructions regarding what should happen when they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we sit down to lunch\" she informed him \"you will wait for me to have my share before you take the meal that I offer you. This will be the same for all your meals from now on. Anybody can see you haven't eaten right before you came to Hogwarts, I will take that in hand for you Harry but out of gratitude you will wait for me to finish first. That is fair, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it is, yes\" Harry approved, not seeing anything wrong with her argument so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the Great Hal and Ginny led him to the Gryffindor table, where there was a reasonable sized gap available for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat, Harry\" she advised him \"but don't touch any of the food until I am finished with my meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry dutifully took a seat at the table, as he had done countless times before, making sure there was room beside him for Ginny, as he assumed that she would want to sit next to him. She had been making a special point of keeping him close after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently that wasn't quite what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially she came over to the space that Harry had offered her and started to sit down, then glanced at him sitting next to her, with a wicked gleam in her eye. \"How do I make sure you don't run off whilst I am eating my lunch?\" she mused \"how do I keep you exactly where you are right now... oh of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling now, she moved across so that she was now directly in front of Harry, then she sat. She sat quickly and she sat forcibly, she sat directly upon Harry's waiting lap, and she stayed there. She sat with her back against him, her knees over his and bent so her feet hung loosely over his own but did not touch the floot. Her full weight was focused upon him as she sat and prepared to make a start on her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make for a very comfortable seat cushion, Harry\" she approved \"not only are you beneath me at flying and quidditch, not only are you inferior to me magically, now you are literally under me as I eat my lunch. Now stay nice and still for me as I tuck into my lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry noted that whilst Giny's weight was not extreme, it was probably enough to keep him in place and he suspected that this was indeed her intention. Her butt cheeks bore down firmly upon his lap, claiming him as her own and using him as her own personal chair. He noted that she felt quite warm too, and her nearness made him aware of a gentle feminine fragrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the food had arrived on the table and Ginny helped herself to whatever she fancied. It could certainly be said that nobody ever starved at Hogwarts, but Ginny reconsidered that, she could starve Harry if she wanted. It would be easy, she would just deny him his meals. She didn't want that though, not now anyway. She would keep him healthy, but she would control his diet the same as she was starting to control everything else about him. She would take the best parts of any meals and leave him with just the scraps, it was another way to demonstrate her superiority over him after all. </span></div></div>",

Harry reached over to try to snatch one of Ginny's sandwiches off her plate when he thought she wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mine, Harry\" she told him, slapping him shaprly across the wrist.<br>\r\nIt wasn't a gentle slap either. Clearly this girl had sone strength in her, he felt a ringing pain in his right hand from where she had slapped him.<br>\r\n\"Oww\" he cired \"that hurts\"<br>\r\n\"Good. You will learn not to steal from me Harry, that will be a valuable lesson for you and I am happy to teach it.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll keep my hands to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wan't enough for her though, Harry had tried to take her food once, she wouldn't be satisfied with just his word that he wouldn't try it again. She intended to enjoy her meal, which meant taking her time over it and not having to worry about what Harry might do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be srue of that Harry?\" she asked then \"You have tried it once, I am not going to let you try it again.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do.\"<br>\r\n\"I am going to immobilise your hands until after I have eaten.\"<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny put down her food for a moment, took Harry's right hand in her own, and his left hand in her other one. She considered for a moment, this wouldn't do at all. If she was going to have her lunch then she was going to need to keep her hands free whilst keeping Harry's out of action. She thought for a moment, then she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding both of Harry's hands, she pulled them under the table, at the same time she pulled her legs apart slightly which formed a slight gap between her knees. Into this gap she then lowered Harry's light-fingered hands then closed the gap between her legs, trapping Harry's hands between her knees. Allowing her knees and thighs to take of the strain of constraining Harry's hands, she enveloped them in her fleshy embrace, squeezing against them so that Harry had no hope whatsoever of using his hands until Ginny decided to give them back to him. She then took her own hands away from him and resumed her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've lost your hands to me Harry\" she informed him \"I'll give them back to you after I have eaten but until that time they will remain where they are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt himself utterly immobilsied. Not only had he effectively lost all use of his hands, the girl was still sitting just as firmly upon him and without the use of his hands he was sure there was not a thing he could do to stop her from sitting there as long as she wanted. Ginny was not squeezing them so firmly to cause him any physical pain but he couldn't move his hands at all and he was actualy starting to lose some sensation there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remained like that for some time whilst Ginny slowly finished her meal. She then found a number of leftover items that nobody had touched. Some soggy sandwiches that didn't look all that appetising, some stale looking cakes and various other items she wouldn't normally bother with but which would provide Harry with enough nutrition but not necessarily taste all that pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had arranged his first 'meal' she waited until all the other plates vanished before finally releasing her grip on Harry's hands. \"This is yours\" she told him, handing him the plate but still not getting up from his lap \"finish it quickly but don't give yourself indigestion. I don't want us to be late for our first class together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHary nodded and started on the food she had given him. His hands still felt numb from the time they had spent trapped in Ginny's leggy embrace. It took him a few minutes but eventually he managed to clear his plate.</span></div></div>",

She looked puzzled for a second but then she realised just exactly where the younger girl was sitting and she came over to inquire further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was familiar to Hermione of course, she had known that the girl was Ron's younger sister and had made a conscious effort to get to know here. She had found that the girl had a great deal of magical potention, as well as an agile mind and expert judgement. The two had soon become close friends, and they often discussed a number of topic that Ron and Harry were simply inequipped to understand, matters that only girls would ever really know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Harry you are sitting on?\" she asked as she herself took a seat nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny shrugged. \"It is an easy way to keep tabs on him, I can sit on him and not worry about him wandering off. I can enjoy my meal in peace knowing that he is in all respects beneath me, and besides.... he is comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is?\" Hermione raised an eyebrow \"maybe I should.... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped herself, but Ginny could tell what she was going to say. \"I've got him for now but we can talk about that later if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he mind at all?\" Hermione wasn't yet prepared to do anything to Harry agaisnt his well or convince others to do likewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry for a moment thought of saying something to Hermione, but then he remembered that he was wearing Ginny's underclothes under his robes, she had taken his wand, his broom, his place on the quidditch team and a year from his magical education. He didn't feel all that empowered right now, quite the worse right now. He felt utterly inferior to the younger girl in every conceivable respect and considereing her position and the fact that he didn't trust the hand-me-down wand he had been given, he didn't want to upset her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine\" he commented, feeling that the girl had secured yet another hold on him with that one simple admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny seemed pleased by his response, and Hermione was satisfied that there was no reason for her to try and interfere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you in class then Harry\" Hermone informed him as she stood up and turned to leave the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't\" Ginny giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" Surely Harry would still be taking his lessons wouldn't he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't see him in class. In fact I doubt neither you nor Ron will ever see him in class again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why ever not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny decided to let her friend know, the news would be all over the school after all and it would be fun to see both Hermone and Harry's reactions. \"Harry has been put down a year\" Ginny informed her \"he has to do all his first year classes again I was in McGonagall's office when she informed him. He'll be attending lessons with me from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really' he is a first year again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is so inept with magic that he has to start from scratch. I probably know more than him and I've only just arrived. If he was any more unmagical he'd be a squib.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sighed. \"I had such high hopes for him last year, after all he was the famous Harry Potter. It was an honour to befriend him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What honour?\" Ginny shrugged \"what exactly has he done since he arrived, what exactly has he done since he was born?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He defeated you-know-who when he was just a baby, everyone says so, as do all the books I have read abotu him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he? Nobody knew what happened back then and he was only a baby at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry told me something Dumbledore said, that it was because of his mother's love for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it. He never did a thing, his mother protected him even in death and Harry takes all the credit.\" Ginny made a retching sound. She hated people who took the glory for other people's actions. Their new D.A.D.A. professor was that sort too, and she didn't like him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess if you put it that way\" Hermione conceded \"but what about what happened at school last year, all that business with the stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of it? Ron told me what happened last year. Harry told you about the gringotts break in and other business, you pieced it all together. He was simply in the right place at the right time on a number of occasions. If it wasn't for you and Ron he would never have got through the chess game or the potions test, and in the mirror chamber it was his mother who saved him again. What did he do. A bit of work on a broom and caught a snitch, in this case a key. So what, he knows that I am better at that stuff than he is too. Again though, he takes credit for the actions of others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione could not deny Ginny's logic. For the first time she started to have doubts about her choice of Harry Potter as a friend. \"You didsappoint me Harry\" she adminished him \"you really do. I used to value our friendship but now perhaps I should just leave you... under Ginny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for the best really, for his own good\" Ginny approved \"incidentally, next time you see Ron, feel free to let him know about Harry's true nature and tell him that I'll be taking care of him from now on. Encourage him to leave Harry to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly. I think Ron could do a lot better than Harry Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry groaned, on top of everything else it appeared that he had now lost his two best friends. What else was there left for Ginny to take away from him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I'll see you later\" Hermione said then, with not even a cursory glance at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing\" Ginny asked her friend \"if you ever see Harry getting out of hand, or trying to be better than he is... feel free to restrain him until I arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any form of restraint you have in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However you see fit. Hit him, knock him out, tie hip up, stun him, wthatever works. I heard about what you did to Neville last year, that sounds amusing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really want to do it to him you know, the body bind. It was effective though, and I don't think I'll have any trouble using it on Harry. I'll be hapy to in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after Hermione left, Ginny finally lifted herself from her perch upon Harry's lap and stood next to him. \"Get up Harry\" she instructed him \"our next lesson is double potions and we don't want to get in Snape's bad books. Well, I don't but I have heard that Snape has your name recorded in a black book all of your very own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed as he struggled to his feet, feeling quite unsteady as he rose. Ginny had been sitting on him for more than half an hour and as such his body had actually gotten used to bearing her weight. It would probably take a few minutes for the circulation and control to return to his legs. When Ginny noticed his lack of balance she couldn't help but giggle at what she had done to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she instructed Harry to follow close behind her once more as she walked out of the Great Hall and made her way down to the dungeons for their next lesson. Harry must have looked like he was in a drunken fool as he staggered after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did it have to be Potions? He knew why, his timetable had changed. This morning it had shown that he did not have potions again until Friday, but now he was a first year once more with first year classes and that meant that this afternoon would be taken up with double potions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, he could see Hermione and Ron heading up the main staircase to their next lesson, a class which he would have been taking too if McGonagall hadn't downgraded him. They didn't even give him a backward glance as they spoke together. From what Ginny had advised Hermione to tell Ron, he was fairly sure what the meaning of that conversation would be. He saw another chapter of his life disappearing before his eyes as the two of them faded out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny and Harry descended the staircase that led to the dungeons and to the potions classroom, and Harry couldn't help but notice that the corridor was crowded with first year students. He didn't recognise any of them since he didn't hang around with first years all that much. Some of them gasped when they saw Harry, others gave inquiring looks whist a crowd of girls in Slytherin uniforms laughed out loud then started whispering amongst themselves,  clearly speculating as to why Harry was here with them and coming up with all kinds of wild stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you brought an older boy down here Ginny?\" a blonde girl in Ravenclaw robes asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no harm in revealing the answer, knowing Snape he was bound to gloat about the act as soon as made his start-of-lesson speech, it was the nature of the man. [b]\"Well you see, Luna\" she responded \"it is because Harry Potter here has been downgraded by his own head of house, I was in McGonagall's office when it happened. He is a first year again and he has been told to begin his magical education from scratch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was raucous laughter and jeering from the Slytherins at that point. Ginny had made no attempt to keep her voice quiet when she made her announcement so everybody had heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt like the ground should open up and swallow him right there. Those slytherins looked like the kind of girls to mock him at every available opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded mutely but she didn't deride him as the Slytherins had, not at that point anyway. She felt that if Harry Potter was as incompetent as he sounded, he needed to be moved down a year for his own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape opened the door the the Potions classroom and ushered everyone inside. As he glanced at Harry, a cruel smile played across his lips. \"Ah yes, Potter\" he smirked \"Professor McGonagall told me you were to retake all your first year classes. I knoew from the start that you were an arrogant little upstart who wasn't cut out for magic, just like your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up about my father\" Harry shouted at the man, raising the second-hand wand that Ginny had given him to replace his old one which she herself had now claimed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut tut not even your own wand I see, Potter\" Snape droned on \"I heard about what happened to it, oh right. Miss Weasley is aiming it at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny wasn't trying to defend Harry, she had indeed raised her wand and pointed it at him but that was because she didn't want him to grow any sort of backbone by thinking he could challenge a professor. If he was inferior to her then surely the professors were way out of his league. Besides, if he cursed snape he was likely to cost Gryffindor House any number of points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape's expression turned into a cold smile. [b]\"I was thinking of taking 50 points from Gryffindor for that Potter, but I may be pursuaded otherwise.\" He glanced at Ginny. \"Go ahead and show him what a wand can really do Miss Weasley\" he encouraged her \"and I may only take 10 points. If you use a really inspired curse and keep it on him for over ten minutes then I may forget about docking points completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry groaned. It seemed to him that Snape was likely to become Ginny's greatest ally in her battle for superiority over him. Not only was he likely to turn a blind eye to practically anything she would do to him, he was also apparently encouraging her. Snape's hatred of him had of course been legendary at this school, perhaps there was something about his fall from grace at her own hands which he found amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny seemed more than happy to oblige. She hadn't seriously considered cursing Harry at that point, she had raised her wand mrerely to warn him to lower his own but she wasn't about ignore a gift that was so generously given. Snape had not only given her the freedom to do whatevr she wanted, but if he approved of her actions she might prevent Harry from losing her house any points. All in all this was an opportunity not to be turned down. She only took a moment to decide on an appropriate spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cast a bat-bogey hex on him, in as firm and direct a voice as she could muster.The force that came from her wand was immense and it hit Harry full in the chest. He doubled over instantly as cried out in pain as giant bat-sized objects dropped out of his nose and flew off down the corridor Ginny seemed particularly pleased with the effectiveness of her spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape was extatic, this first year girl was clearly already talented. Furthermore, he had seen her efforts in his lessons and he had so far found no fault with any of the potions that she had brewed. It wasn't like he favoured her, but he had no reason to single her out for disapproval like he had with Harry and some other students In fact, if she continued to apply herself to the task of keeping Harry in his place, then perhaps he might to value her like he did some of this Slytherin students. He did notice that a group of Slytherin grils had applauded when they saw what she did to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class had by now taken their seats, incluiding Ginny who had left Harry where he was with the curse still firmly upon him. She wasn't about to remove it yer. After all, the ten minutes still weren't up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape started going over today's lesson plan, explaining the details of the potion he wanted the students to brew. It wasn't until he had finished that he looked over at Ginny. \"Those ten minutes are up\" he informed her \"no points shall be taken for Gryffindor house for this incident but if you relase Potter then I want him to be supervised by you for the remainder of the lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I also get to punish him for any mistakes he makes, Professor\" she asked then. It was pushing, she knew but if she was to take charge of the boy she wanted to be given the power to discipline him if need be too.</span></div></div>",

I don't want any wish-washy excuses here or I'll end our agreement and put you both in detention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Porfoessor, the kind of things I have in store for Harry are so degrading I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, we have an agreement, but like I say if you take that curse off him he will be your responsibility, it is your job to supervise him. You asign his tasks, and you monitor his work but you have no say over his hosue points since they would apply to you too. You can give him additional jobs though, or put him in detention which you will supervise. I will be monitoring you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Professor, thank you.\" Ginny gushed. This stuation couldn't have turned out any better. Snape had effectively given her the authority to do anything she wanted to do with Harry in his lesson, and nothing could have suited her purposes more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted the curse that she had put on him and called him over to where she was sitting. Knowing that Snape himself had given Ginny control over him, he didn't see any way to wriggle out of her request. Harry walked over and sat next to Harry. His nose still hurt like crazy, but no more bats were coming out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him the weakest knife she could find and pointed to a pile of green shoots that were on the table in front of him. \"I want you to cut these shoots in to inch long pieces whilst I work on the rest of the potion she told him. I know you can't cope with anything more so that will be your sole task for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem to remember this potion from last year\" Harry commented as he started work on the shoots<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and you couldn't do it then either\" Snape informed him with  a cursory glance in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are cutting them too short. No wonder you are so pathetic\" Ginny admonished him, noting that many of them appeared to be far smaller than an inch. She took a sharper knife and cut into another of the roots, her offering was exactly the right size for the potion. \"Use that one as a guide, it will show you what size I want the rest of them to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry continued cutting on the shoots, Ginny measured out and applied the rest of the ingredients to her cauldron in the right measures, at the precisely given times and stirring her concoction precisely as instructed. No wonder she was so much better than Harry, she could follow instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took time for Harry to cut up those shoots, Ginny had purposefully given him the bluntest knife in her possession, so he had to use far more force to cut them up than would be needed if he had been given a sharper knife. The job was slow and laborious, and Harry was starting to get frustrated with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the monotony of the task became too much for him and he turned towards Ginny, fully intending to stab her with the knife in his hand. Ginny reacted in an instant though, she grabbed his wrist and twisted it firmly, causing him to cry out in pain and drop the knife. She then stepped on the object with her right foot and slapped Harry sharply across the face. \"Detention, Harry!\" she told him \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Snape was curious to see what kind of detention Ginny might have in mind and he made a point to watch what she did with him, with look he might find the task amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had by now almost competed her potion. \"Have you got those shoots, Harry\" she asked him \"I need them now, ah yes.\" She took up a half dozen of the cutting that Harry had made with that knife and deposted them into her cauldron, leaving a large pile of them untouched. With a negligent swipe of her hand she knocked them off the table and into a nearby waste bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spent all lesson cutting those\" Harry cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know but I only needed six of them. Didn't I tell you? All that work and you were too thick to know that I only needed half a dozen shoots, and you did this potion last year too. There is no wonder Professor McGonagall put you back a year, is there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape was loving this, the way that Ginny kept putting him down. He couldn't do a better job if he tried. She was right too, she did only need a haf a dozen of those shoots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked down at the last instruction. It told her to turn off the heat and leave the contents of the cauldron to stand for 25 minutes. She sighed as she extinguished the flame and set the timer on her cauldron. This was always the boring part of the job, the waiting game. \"You don't mind if I read through my books whilst I wait on instruction 19 do you, Professor\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that is fine, go ahead Miss Weasley\" Snape replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then one of the other students, a fellow Gryffindor girl called over to her \"Is it true that you sat on Harry's lap during your lunch break, Ginny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is true. I rather enjoyed it, to tell you the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was at the staff table\" Snape confirmed \"I saw her sitting on Potter all the way through her lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit on him now\" the other girl suggested \"it'll mean you don't have to keep an eye on him whilst you are reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true\" Ginny smiled \"Okay Harry, time to go back where you belong. Incidentally, if you make any move to try to stop me or to dislodge me then you will be serving more than one detention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was already sitting next to him, Ginny smily lifted up slightly, edged across to where Harry was and sat back down. He made no move to try and stop her, he didn't dare. Ginny had already given him one detention, and he dreaded to think what she might do to him there. He didn't want to bring any more of them down upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny relaxed, and sat just as firmly upon Harry's lap as she had during their lunch break. Once she was in place she picked up her book and started to read through it.. Harry simply waited silently as he felt the now familiar presence of Ginny sitting on him. He considered the lesson so far, the time he had spent under the effects of a curse so powerful he couldn't image any 11 year old being able to pull it off to that extent, to the fact that he had cut up hundreds of those shoots when he only needed six. Why hadn't he considered that, was he really as worthless as Ginny suggested? Now she was sitting on him once more and some time in the near future he would serve his detention with her. Of all the Potions classes he had ever suffered through, this had to be the worst of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to pass exceptionally slowly for him, it seemed to take an eternity for that timer to count down the required 25 minutes and all that time Ginny remained seated upon him, her book held firmly in her hands whilst she ignored him and continued to read. Eventually though a bell informed her that the 25 minutes had passed and she signalled Snape to tell him that her potion was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor took one look at the potion she had brewed and nodded his approval. Once more her work has as pefect as it always had been. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the class ended, Harry had to admit that the fist impression his fellow first-years had of him ws one of utter defeat and humiliation. He was clearly not bright enough to brew even the simplest potions, even with constant supervision. No wonder he had been put down a year. Some wondered why Ginny was even bothering with him at all. It had been amusing watching her control him the way she did, although many suspected that had been more to do with Snape than anything she had done. Her command of that bat-bogey hex hand been masterful though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you know the date, time and location of Harry's detention, Professor\" she told Snape at that point \"I am sure you will find it particularly entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class started to file out, Ginny got up from his lap once more and led him towards the door. \"Behind me, Harry. You know that by now\" she instructed in a deceptively soft voice, and smiled as Harry walked behind her as she led him out of the dungeons and back towards the Great Hall. A couple of first years who had shared their class wondered if perhaps they had an arrangement that stretched beyond one single Potions lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny led Harry back in to the Great Hall and back towards the Gryffindor table. There were a number of people here already but there were plenty of spaces. It looked like Ron and Hermione hadn't arrived yet but then their class was a little further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Harry\" Ginny informed him \"you remember the procedure from lunch, I take it. Have a seat <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must I?\" Harry sighed, it seemed that Ginny had started taking every possibile opportunity to sit on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you must\" she took out her wand and pointed it directly at him \"Sit, Harry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a nervous glance at that wand and now feeling in no doubt as to the powert it represented. Harry took an empty space at the Gryffindor bench. Ginny then came forward and took her place once more, settling her butt cheeks into place upon his lap. Harry could feel her now familiar weight, her full weight upon him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands, Harry\" she pointed out, taking his hands, in her own, passing them under the table and trapping them within the confines of her inner thighs once more. Harry was now once again trapped in the same position he had been in when Ginny was eating her lunch. Harry suspected that he was going to spend all of his meals in eactly this position, being used as Ginny's seat cushion. He had to admit that being sat upon by her was a lot more pleasant than some of the other things he had done to him lately, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to it Harry\" Ginny informed him \"you are going to be spending a lot of your meals in this position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon and Hermione walked in to the Great Hall together at that point, but neither of them chose to sit next to Harry and Ginny this time. Hermione didn't even give Harry a second glance, and Ron didn't seem to either although he did smile at his sister as though he approved of what she was doing. It seemed clear to Harry that Hermione had been explaining things to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before a large quantity of assorted foodstuffs started to appear on the table and Ginny began to fill her plate. She also kept another plate aside for Harry but she didn't put anything on that yet, not until the best parts of the meal had already been picked at and she could offer him his selection of scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during Ginny's meal (not Harry's as he was in no position to tuck in to anything right now) there was a flapping of wings and the post owls started delivering letters to their eagerly waiting owners. A white Snowy Owl came close to where Ginny was sitting, a letter in her beak. She could sense that Harry was close but she couldn't see him anywhere. Then she noticed that Ginny wasn't sitting directly on the bench, she was sitting on.... and wasn't that his wand now in her own pocket?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owl gave an undignified and derogatory squark and dropped the letter in front of Ginny. \"Hello Hedwig\" Harry greeted his owl \"is that mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedwig turned her back on him, refusing to even look at the boy she had called her owner. Instead she flew up and perched on Ginny's shoulder. When Harry reached up to try to pet her feathers though, the owl hooted and moved onto Ginny's shoulder, as though it had somehow made a decision as to with whom she truly belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you just lost your owl, Harry\" she told him \"maybe she doesn't like what she is seeing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was dumbfounded. Had this girl not only taken his broom, his wand and a year of his magical education. Had she now also taken ownership of his owl? What exactly did Harry have left to call his own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hedwig\" Ginny smiled, patting her beak \"are you my owl now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedwig gave a soft, welcoming hoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked down and the table and at the letter that Hedwig had dropped there. \"Looks like mother's handwriting\" she commented, taking the letter and opening it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is mine\" Harry complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on Harry\" Ginny informed him \"any letters that are sent to you will be delviered to and read by me first. Did you catch that, Hedwig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother soft hoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh incidentally, if you see any other birds with letters addressed to Harry, I would be ever so grateful if you could intercept them and if Harry ever asks you to post any of his letters, I want you to rip them to shreds with your beak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird acknowledged tihs request too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry got the impression that Ginny would be writing to the Post Office and asking them to divert all his owls to her next. His owls indeed, now that Hedwig had betrated him he didn't have an owl any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had now opened and was reading Harry's letter. \"Mother asks about your Harry\" she informed him \"she says she is missing you and asking if you have settled in to school again yet. She doesn't even mention our stolen car.\" She reached into her bag and took out a quill and parchment \"I'll write back on your behalf Harry, isn't that nice of me? I'll tell her all about how useless you are without me, how you always takes credit for other people's actions and I'll even mention the fact that you tried to attack me with my own knife, but that I was able to defend myself easily. I've asked Mom to let you stay at the Burrow during the summer under my supervision. I can't have you leaving my sight, even for a couple months. Besides you've always wanted to move out of the Dursleys', so it works good for you too\" said Ginny in a deceptively sweet voice. She soon finished writing her letter, then she addressed it to her mother and passed it to Hedwig. The bird flew off, back the way it had come. Now it seemed that Ginny had alienated him from the rest of her family, including the woman who had seen him as an extension of her own family, Mrs Weasley. Even though he'd still see them at the Burrow in the summers, it would be a completely different greeting than the one he had this past summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ginny finished her meal, she once more loaded Harry's plate with scraps from the table and waited for dessert. She even freed his hands so he could eat his main course now but she still continued to sit upon him. Once Harry had finished eating though, she put his hands back in their fleshy prision between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same happened with dessert. Ginny had hers first then she took a portion of the least appetising option available and passsed it to Harry. It was only when they had both finished both courses that Ginny finally got up and led him away from the Great Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ginny led Harry back up the main staircase and then onwards towards Gryffindor tower, all the time instructing him to stay clsoe behind her as was his rightful position when they travelled. Harry was used to seeing the red haired girl in front of him when he walked, and his posiition and the status it implied had not gone unnoticed by some of the other students, there were twitters and giggles from many of the other students that they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time they came to the portrait of the Fat Lady, who as usual requested the password to the Gryffindor Common Room. The portrait woman's eyes showed clear sings of sympathy when she looked at Harry though. Gossip as it tended to do, had proceeded them and the news that Harry had been demoted to a First Year was now common knowledge. Even the paintings were aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't waste your sympathy on him\" Ginny admonished \"he is such an incompetent loon he deserved everything he got. In fact I consider him to be so unreliable that I don't think he should be allowed to wander the corridors unaccompanied. If it was in my power I'd instruct you not to let him out of the common room unless he is in my company. For his own protection of course,\" She gave an encouraging litle smile. She didn't for one moment suspect that the Fat Lady might actually consider this, but of course if she did it would further enhance her hold upon Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" the Fat Lady pondered \"if Harry here is as incompetent as you suggest, and of course he has been reconstituted a First Year... I'll consult with one of the portraits in Professor McGonagall's study. It is your Head of House who has the authority to make such a decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was both shocked and delighted, the Fat Lady was really going to look into her proposal. Ginny had already convinced the professor to keep Harry down a year, perhaps it wouldn't take much convincing to include this additional clause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" she smiled, giving the Fat Lady a respectful curtsey as she led Harry into the room which he may soon may never be able to leave of his own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was not completely deserted. Hermione Granger sat a short distance away. She greeted Ginny as she entered. \"I heard what you were saying to the Fat Lady just now\" she commented \"do you think McGonagall will agree to your proposal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might, considering she already agreed to put Harry down a year. Take a seat Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry dutifully wandered over to one of the empty chairs and sat down. He wondered if he was really about to become a prisoner of the Gryffindor Common Room as Ginny had implied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been doing a bit of reading, if you can imagine that\" Hermione commented, holding up her copy of 'Hogwarts: A History' which by now was showing signs of being particularly well read \"and did you know that in the entire history of Hogwarts, not student has ever been forced to repeat a year... well, until Harry here of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Imagine that\" Ginny chuckled, claiming her seat which incidentally was the one that Harry was also occupying. \"did you har that Harry? You made the history books again, but this time for all the right reasons. How you ever got in to Hogwarts is probably the biggest mystery of all time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt the ever-familiar presece of Ginny sitting on him, and of course it came as no surprise to him. This girl seemed to be sitting on his lap at every opportunity and by now the act seemed so commonplace that he started to wonder if that was the real reason that he had been accepted at this school, simply to serve as an object for this girl to sit upon. Hermione noticed that Ginny looked perfectly relaxed and content, as though she wasn't even aware that Harry was under her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that she was comfortably seated upon Harry, Ginny reached into her bag and took out a small unmarked book. Hermione by this time had gone back to browsing through Hogwarts: A History. Pondering the meaning of the book for a moment, she started leafing through the pages but for some reason found them to be completely blank. She took out her wand and tried a few spells she had learned that should enable her to see invisible or concealed writing but none of them seemed to be effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry\" she addressed him \"I want you to keep perfectly still and don't disturb me whilst I work on the myster of this book. I spotted it among my school books the other day but I can't work out exactly what it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was only too happy to remain quiet. Whilst Ginny's mind was on other things he could be free to examine his own thoughts, it was true that Ginny was still sitting on him but other than that it occured to him that she might leave him alone for a few moments. Harry approved of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently she took up quill and ink, found a blank page in one of the books and wrote a single word \"hello\"<br>\r\n\"Some more text started to appear below it \"Hello, who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Ginny\"<br>\r\n\"Hello Ginny, My name is Tom Riddle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Ginny was intrigued, the owner of this book had put his own awareness into it somehow, she could even talk to him, but she didn't know this boy. Who was he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this book?\" she wrote then.<br>\r\n\"It is my diary, in it I stored some of my most treasured memories Would you like to see?\"<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment then wrote a single word... \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny suddently felt a strange sensation, as though she was being pulled into the book although it didn't actually feel like she was moving at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she appeared not to be in the Gryffindor common room at all, she was in the great hall and she could see a line of students at the front of the hall, and before them a stool and a hat. It was the sorting ceremony. One of the professors called the name \"Ridde, Tom\" and a boy came forward and took a sat on the stool. The professor laid the hat on his head and a moment later the hat cried out \"Slytherin!\". There were cheers from the Slytherin table as Tom Riddle took his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene changed, they were still in the Great Hall but a few years later. Tom Riddle was sat somewhere among the crowd of students at the Slytherin table, he had a badge on the front of his robes sporting a single letter 'P'. The meal was over and the headmaster had stood up. \"Now that the meal is over, everyone please make their way to their way to their dormitories. Prefects, if you would be so kind as to escort the First Year students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddle stood up and chanted in a rather sing-song voice \"Fist years, follow me please.\" Along with a female student who was perhaps a year or so older he led the group of first year students out of the Great Hall and down towards the dungeons where the Slytherin Commom Room was located. Ginny got the impression that this was the first time Tom Riddle had done this job. For some reason he didn't yet look comfortable in the role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shown a couple more scenes of Tom's life at Hogwarts, then the images disappeared and she once more was was once more sat on Harry in the Gryffindor Common Room. \"That was weird\" she uttered \"I seemed to be travelling all over the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never left your seat, Ginny\" Hermione informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was all so real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is real, Ginny, this place.. you, me, even Harry whom you have been sitting on the entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny nodded, of course Harry was real, he could feel him beneath her. Even though he was currenlty no more than the lining of her chair. He felt perfectly real to her. Those visions were precisely that, they were just visions. They had no substance, and what of that boy, that boy who was not Harry? Whilst she was with him she didn't think about Harry at all, not one bit. That wouldn't do at all, she liked thinking about Harry, she liked finding new and entertaining ways to degrade and humiliate him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want this diary\" she stated at least \"and I definitely don't trust Tom Riddle. I think he wants to lead me astray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is Tom Riddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TThe owner of this diary, he is the one who I kept seeing in those visions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds ominous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does indeed, you know what? I am going to take this thing to Professor Dumbledore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed though that the headmaster wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss Weasley\" McGonagall greated her \"One of my portaits has advised me that you have asked the Fat Lady not to let Potter out of the common room when you are not accompanying him. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Professor\" Ginny began, thinking fast on her feet \"I noticed that after during Potions class, people were jeering at and tormenting Harry about the fact that he has been put down a year. I don't think it will be long before some people would use this as an excuse to consider more direct forms of bullying, threats of violence perhaps or even firing curses at him. Frankly, Professor I don't think Harry is in any position to defend himself, not even from a first year so I think it best if he were only allowed out of the common room when I am in a position to attend to him, for his owl sake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny didn't mention what form that attention, might take, nor that she was the 'first year' she had in mind that Harry would be unable to defend himself against. She had worded her request in terms that suggested that she was caring about Harry's welfare, appealing to the Professor's natural protective instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Miss Weasley\" Professor McGonagall conceded \"when you put it like that, yes I see you have a point. Very well, I shall instruct the Fat Lady not to let Harry out of the common room under any circumstances, except under your direct supervision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor\" Ginny responded meekly, although internally she gloated. She had just succeeded in putting yet another restriction on the great Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is settled\" Dumbledore began \"what was it you wanted to see me about. Did you just want to discuss this matter regading Harry Potter or was there something else on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was this book, Professor\" Ginny explained \"I found it buried in the school books that I had bought from Flourish and Blotts this year. I don't know how it got there, and I was curious about it. It appeared blank, so I tried what spells I could to make the writing visible. None of them worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, eventually I found a blank page and started writing in it, and this must seem odd. It wrote back to me. I had the strangest conversation with a book of all things, it even identified itself by name. It said it was the diary of someone called Tom Riddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riddle!\" Dumbledore came to attention immediately at the sound of the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" Well soon it started to show me these visions, like pictures, our kind of pictures, the ones that move only I found I was somehow in the picture watching events unfold. I saw this Riddle person being sorted into Slytherin, and later being a prefect, and a few other incidents besides then I was suddenly back where I was in the common room. It was so strange sir, and to be honest I didn't really like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say you were right to bring this book to me, Miss Weasley\" Dumbledore nodded \"May I have it? Why don't you sit down and I'll tell you a story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny handed the book over and took an empty seat at Dumbledore's table. She was happy to stay a while, as that gave Hermione more time with Harry back in the common room, so she could use him as her personal seat cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some time ago\" Dumbledore informed her \"before I was Headmaster, when the school was run by Professor Dippet and I was merely the Transfiguration Professor.... a boy came to this school, a boy I had visted personally at a muggle orphanage, a boy called Tom Marvolo Riddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story didn't seem so bad so far, so this was the boy who owned the diary was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riddle was a keen and attentive student\" Dumbledore went on \"and yes, his growing skilsl and attentiveness to his studies led me to choose him as Prefect for Slytherin Hosue in his fifth year. Little did I know what kind of man Riddle would later become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbledore took a spare piece of parchment and wrote Riddles name upon it, then he waved his wand and the letters reordered themselves to read 'I AM LORD VOLDEMORT' and Ginny gave a gasp of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This belonged to.... You Know Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was one of Voldemort's possessions. You say you found it among your new school books. Did anything unusual happen whilst you were in Flourish and Blotts?\" Dumbledore didn't for a second asume Ginny was responsible for any of this, after all she had brought the book to him of her own free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a busy day of shopping\" she mused \"Mother and Father had taken us to Diagon Alley to get our new school supplies, Harry was with us too. Professor Lockhart was there signing copies of his new book. He spotted Harry and gave him signed copies of all his own books for free. The Malfoys were there too, they were accusing Harry of seeking fame and drawing too much attention to himself. They weren't very pleasant about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" Dumbledore mused \"well I'll talk to Professor Lockhart of course, get his account of what happened that day. One thing you can be sure of though, you needn't worry about this book any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Professor. If I may ask, how come you are able to say You Know Who's name so freely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just a name, Miss Weasley like any other. It may interest you to know that Harry also uses his real name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry calls him.. Vol... Voldemort.\" Ginny spoke that name as though for the first time, she felt sure she shouldn't but if Harry could use it, so could she. After all, there was nothing that boy could do that she couldn't do beter. She made a mental note to call Voldemort by his real name from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" Dumbledore nodded \"now about that book, let's get rid of it shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his wand and for a time ottered a couple of spells that seemed to have no visible effect, then he pointed at the book and a firece jet of flame shot out of it and consumed the diary. The article appeared to emit a terrifying scream is it was reduced to a pile of ashes on Dumbledore's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a highly controlled version of a spell called Fiendfyre\" Dumbledore informed her \"a very dangerous spell when not handled correctly. It feeds on anything it touches. I can assure you that the book has been destroyed. Dumbledore got the impression though that more than a mere book had died that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incidentally, Miss Weasley\" Dumbledore informed her \"by means of gratitude for your prompt and well considered actions, you will of couse be given a Special Award for Services to Hogwarts School, a very rare trophy indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and I hereby award Gryffindor House a hundred points, and you are welcome to a Sherbet Lemon on your way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny recognised the dismissal, but she was pleased to have come and to have aided in the destruction of what was clearly a dangerous magical object. Even though she was still just starting her magical education it seemed she had done far more to assist the magical community than Harry, even though he  had, as she had pointed out, taken the credit for other people's actions. She thanked both Professors for them time and generosity, and taking one of the strange looking sweets she made her way out of the headmaster's office and back down the spiral staircase. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though the conversation with the Headmaster and her Head of House had taken several minutes, Ginny felt no real desire to return to the common room just yer. She knew that Harry would still be there and that Hermione would continue to sit on him until she got back. If her friend was happy to use Harry as her seat cushion then perhaps Ginny might also pursuade her to think of Harry in the same way she did, The thought of Hermione as an ally and willing participant in her agenda for the so-called-famous Harry Potter was a particularly welcome one She also knew that Herminone was someone who could sit and study for hours on end if she so desired. There really wasn't any point in disturbing her just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt as casual pace as she could manage she made her way down to the Great Hall where supplies of Pumpkin Juice were still available for any students who might suddenly feel thirsty, she took one and headed to the Gryffindor table to sup it as slowly as she could Something felt wrong as she sat down though, Harry wasn't under her this time and it felt wrong somehow not to feel his presence down there. She pushed that thought to one corner of her mind though as she recalled that in the Gryffindor Common Room right now, Hermione would still be sitting on him. She allowed that thought to wash over her as she took her time drinking her pumpkin juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, the cup was emptied, and feeling a sudden need Ginny made her way to the Girls' Toilets to attend to it. She soon found an empty cubicle and after taking care of herself she waited a while, still perched upon the seat until some girls outside started asking her if she was alright. She smiled and told them she was fine, but feeling she couldn't wait much longer withotu arousing suspicion, she flushed, washed her hands and left to find some other means of occupying her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe visted the owlery but then she remembered that Hedwig was still delivering her letter, so she left. She told herself that she should take Harry's stash of Owl Treats sometime soon though, since he wasn't going to be needing them any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering if there was something else she could do to ensure that Harry continued to serve as the lining of Hermione's chair for a while, she went down to the library to see if there were any interesting books she could borrow. She perused the shelves for a while, quickly finding a couple of titles that interested her but feeling in no real rush to take them. Instead she looked over some other shelves that contained books that didn't interest her at all, but she still took time to read over the titles as though she was really considering borrowing them. It was amazing how long you could draw out this particular activity. The librarian even came over and asked her if she needed any help at one point. Finally though, like everything else she decided that there was only so much time she could waste she went back to her original choice, and a couple of other books that had taken her eye and carried them over to the counter. She was served far too soon for her own liking, but now running out of ideas for ways to delay her return, she decided to head back to Gryffindor Tower, it was by this time about an hour and a half since she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n During all this time, Hermione had not moved from her seat in the Hogwarts Common Room, she still continued to sit upon Harry just as she had been doing when Ginny had departed and her full weight centred upon him, pressing him firmly and deliberately into the chair itself. Being a year older, Hermione weighed slightly more than Ginny and Harry was acutely aware of this difference. Hermione continued to sit and Harry continued to be sat upon by her. Even though had quickly picked up her book and had started to read, she never lost track of Harry''s position beneath her. She sat with her book and seemed to pay him no attention, but Harry could not ignore the fact that she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry of course knew Hermione and that she was described, quite accurately as the smartest witch of her age. There were things that girl would do with her wand that Harry couldn't even dream of, if it came to any kind of contest of brooms Harry would be effectively naked in front of her.  He also knew that Hermione loved to read and hated to be disturbed. Taking all that into account he had no intention of disturbing her at all and simply accept her presence upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus their situation continued for an hour and a half, Hermione simply sitting and reading, and Harry being sat upon. Hermione clearly had no intention of changing that fact, at least until Ginny returned. She was even enjoying the feeling of using Harry as part of her seat. Even though Ron had also been with him at the time, she wondered what it might have been like if she had sat on him the first time they met, on the train last year, travelling to Hogwarts for the first time. What if, instead of repairing his glasses and leaving she had walked over to Harry and purposefully sat on him. That thought amused her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time though Hermione put those thoughts aside as the portrait door swung open. Was Ginny finally back? She had been gone a long while, but of course Hermione knew that a lot of that would have been for her benefit. She was grateful. Then she heard the voice of the Fat Lady herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Miss Weasley\" The Fat Lady informed her \"it may interest you to know that I have received confirmation from Professor McGonagall herself regarding your request for Mister Harry Potter. He will not be permitted to leave this room unless you are with him, and even if he is with you, then you need only give the word and I will not let him pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make that one word from me or Miss Hermione Granger?\" Ginny countered, feeling that her friend should be offered additional say in such matters \"although it is me still that must accompany him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You must accompany him outside, but either of you may shut the door in his face if that is what you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, thanks. Hello Hermione.\" Ginny came into the room and noticed that her friend was still stiting on Harry, the same as she had been when she left the room. \"Has he behaved?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has been the perfect little seat cushion\" Hermione giggled \"he still is in fact, it is a pleasure to sit on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time you want me to take over\" Hermione informed her \"any time at all, just let me know and I'll happily resume my seat. I can sit on him for hours if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hermione, I appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I guess you want him back now?\" she invited.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ginny looked over at Hermione, who was still seated upon Harry's lap. The girl seemed perfectly content there, and Ginny  wasn't a selfish girl at all. Was there any reason to move her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you keep him where he is for now?\" Ginny responded \"that is if you don't mind sitting on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be happy to\" Hermione smiled as she relaxed, pefectly content to leave him exactly where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny took a separate seat, one that was an angle to the one Hermione occupied, so she could watch and enjoy the sight of Hermione sitting on The Boy Who Lived. Like herself, Hermione was wearing a small skirt beneath her robes, and her legs were close together. From the side it was clear that Harry was under there somewhere, She sat back, moulding her entire body to his and pressing herself firmly into him. Her knees and her thighs also matched the fold of Harry's legs and her feet were not touching the floor. It was a pleasant sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why you like sitting on him\" Hermione giggled \"he does seem well suited to the position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is about all he is good for\" Ginny retorted, she told Hermione about Harry's Potions lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't know you only need six shoots?\" Hermione laughed \"he's even stupider than I thought. He deserved to start over in first year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, and I must say I've never had more fun in a potions lesson, Snape was wonderful. He effectively gave me free reign to do whatever I wanted with Harry. He even encouraged me to hex Harry here for no more than ten minutes in order to prevent Gryffindor house from losing any points due to his incompetence. I jumped at the chance and cast the strongest 'Bat Bogey Hex' I have ever achieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That spell is one of your specialities, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is one I am particularly proud of, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione giggled, but she didn't laugh so much at Ginny's next admision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe that at one point Harry actually tried to stab me with my own knife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did WHAT? Hermione was aghast, She even lifted her knees sightly and leaned back, applying even more pressure to the boy she was sitting on, then she leaned forward slightly and slapped him sharply across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny approved, but continued her recital \"well anyway, by now Snape was so impressed with me he had actually given me the right to discpline Harry in his lessons, so I gave him detention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, has he served it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, I was considering alternatives, but every time I settle on something I seem to think of something else, even worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure you can consider something suitably gross and degrading, you seem to have a talent for it as far as Harry is concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what happened about that book by the way, the one you took to Dumbledore's office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well apparently I was right to take it to him, it contained some horrible evil magic. Dumbledore didn't go in to details but he did tell me that Tom Riddle was Voldemort's name at one time, and the diary belonged to him apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have any problem saying his name then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny shrugged \"I'll probably offend both my parents but to be honest, if Harry here can say the name then I sure as heck can too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but apparently Harry is too stupid to know what it means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbledore says his name too, and he is far smarter than Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point there. So what happened to the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbledore destroyed it, with some kind of magical fire that he said was very dangerous if not controlled, but he controlled it well enough. It burned the book down to ashes in no time but nothing else was harmed. There was even a wailing sound coming from the book at that point, as though something terrible was dying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that is that, no more Tom Riddle, no more strange magical books, it is just us and Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say. Oh Dumbledore gave me what he said was a Special Award for Services to the School and awarded a hundred points to Gryffindor points. It seemed that giving that book to Dumbledore was definitely the right thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Harry has ever won anything for any of these acts he was supposedly responsible for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, not a thing. It seems I am far more deserving of recognition than that wastrel you are sitting on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And rightly so too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One other thing, you remembered me suggesting to the Fat Lady that Harry should not be allowed out unless accompanied by me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently she got in touch with McGonagall who was also in Dumbledore's office when I went up there. I managed to convince her that Harry is not safe to be allowed to wander the school on his own, that he might be subject to ridicule and bullying so he would need someone to watch out for him, namely me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A curious way to put it, you know which girls he most needs protection from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, but anyway McGonagall bought it and Dumbledore made no objection. When I got back I heard the Fat Lady confirming that Harry is now confined to the common room, unless I am acompanying him he can not leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd like it, incidentally it seems that both you and I can at any time tell the Fat Lady to slam the door in his face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I caught a bit of that as you arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls chatted together about various, incidental things then Ginny suddly started to yawn, and Hermione followed soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we start thinking about going to bed\" Ginny suggested \"too bad Harry has to sleep in the boys' dorms though, but at least we can visit him there if we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking the ame\" Hermione agreed \"though he can't leave the common room anyway, so there is no way he can sneak away in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, at least.\"</span></div></div>",

The one next to your own in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall pointed her wand at the staircase at the entrance to the dorms and made a few silent adjustments to the protective spell. \"It is done\" she announced \"now please get to bed, all three of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs McGonagall left, Harry suddenly groaned. \"My trunk is in the boys' dorm\" he advised \"and all my clothes too, what am I going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can worry about that in the morning, Ginny giggled. Right now, you need to go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them together led Harry up the stairs and down the corridor that led to the girls' dorms. Harry did notice that the barrier that normally would have prevented him coming this way made no do so on this occasion and he passed safely through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they came to a door with a sign above it reading \"First Year Girls\", and they both stopped in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in, Harry\" Ginny laughed at him \"this will be your room now too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling, Harry reached towards the handle and slowly opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will we do about Harry's trunk and his clothes?\" Herminoe offered then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny laughed even harder.</span></div></div>",

You might as well make use of it.\" She pointed to the empty bed next to Ginny's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her\" Ginny told him \"get undressed and get in to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In front of all these girls, I'd rather not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are officially a girl now Harry\" Ginny reminded him \"these are girls too, you have nothing to hide from them so strip down to your underwear and get in to bed.\" She then remembered just what underwear Harry was wearing and she started to chuckle at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls\" Ginny suggested carmly \"this girl is feeling a little shy, why dont' we all help her to get undressed and in to bed. Hermione, don't let her leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione dutifully stood in the doorway, blocking the only possible exit from the room. She loved the way that all the first years had started referring to Harry as a girl, she would of course remember to address her in the same manner now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried running for the door, but Hermione pushed him back, for a time he ran around the room in an effort to evade the girls who were now chasing after him, giggling like mad and loving the little game that Ginny had suggested. It didn't take long for them to overpower him, and when they did they dragged him back to the bed which was now to be his and with Ginny also joining the group, they forced him down onto it. A couple of them then straddled him and started removing Harry's clothes. His robe was the first to come off, then his shoes and his socks. At that point they started stipping his top and his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving stipped him of all but his trousers, the girls shifted their positions, those sitting on his legs then moved to his chest and upper body whilst they relieved him of those too. At that point there was a collective gasp of surprise. Harry was wearing a girls' underclothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are yours aren't they Ginny?\" Emily pointed out, pointing to the one article of clothing that Harry was still wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were mine, now they are Harry's\" Ginny pointed out \"she's been wearing them all day, after I burned her old ones. She doesn't need them any more now anyway, she is a girl after all and as such she needs to wear girls' underwear, as is good and proper. Considering her new sleeping arrangements, there is no way she will be able to reach her old clothes anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of girls laughed at this, then went to their own drawers and started to take out old pairs of undergarments that they had outgrown or didn't care for any more. As a group, they then threw them in Harry's direction. \"Now you have a complete set\" Ginny laughed as she colelcted them and stored them neatly in one of Harry's empty drawers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest of my clothes?\" Harry whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll think about that later, for now I think you shoud just get in to bed. It is entirely possible though that from tomorrow you'll have to walk around Hogwarts dressed as the girl that you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry groaned at the thought of that, but feeling tired he slipped into the bed that would now be his own, and before long he fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He also noticed that his sheets wre pulles strangely tight as there were a number of girls sitting on his bed, some of them so close that he could actually feel them against him. He recognised that one of the girls had red hair, that was obviously Ginny and he seemeed to remember a couple of the others from somewhere. He also saw that most of the girls were still wearing their nighties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you girls doing in a boys' dorm?\" He asked them suddenly \"get out of here at once. Where's Ron?\" Apparently, in his half-asleep state he had forgotten some of the more significant events of yesterday, including two important changes of identification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming Ron is still asleep he is where he aught to be, in the second year boys' dorm with the rest of the second year boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't I there with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you recall?\" The girl called Sophie asked him, she was sitting next to Ginny, not far from his chest \"you aren't a second year any more Harry, you are a first year like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are also a Girl, like the rest of us according to the barrier on the staircase\" another girl, Emily informed him \"so this is your dorm and your bed now Harry.  She then thought a moment \"That doesn't seem quite right though. Whoever heard of a girl called Harry before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Short for Hariet?\" Ginny suggested \"that is a perfectly acceptable girl's name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she have a middle initial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hariet Jane Potter, yes it has a nice ring to it that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was named James after my father\" Harry sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would have been named for your father if you were a boy, but instead you were a girl named Hariet Jane, that is your true name, that is what I think we should call you from now on, at least whilst you are in our dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening to me\" Harry moaned, then some of the events of yesterday came flooding back to him and he let out a long groan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind giving me some space so I can get dressed.\" he demanded of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do no such thing\" Sophie flared \"you are a girl too, one of us now, so there is no reason to show the same modesty that we do around boys. I guess you'll have to wear the same clothes you had on yesterday as you don't have any alternatives now but I would advise some clean undewear, I believe there are a few choices in the droor by your bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold of on that for a time, Hariet\" Ginny advised him \"I want to go get cleaned up first. Girls, would you please keep Hariet under his covers until I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you propose we do that?\" Emily offered \"hold him down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, in a way. I'm sure you remember Hermione who brought Hariet her in with me yesterday\" Ginny was amused by the way they were playing with his name \"did you know she kept Hariet here trapped in the common room for over an hour yesterday when I went out of the common room, by sitting on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I'd seen that\"Sophie giggled \"and I suppose we could, I mean I am practically sitting on her already.\" Harry realised that this was the girl that was sitting so close to him that he could feel her presence. She scooted backwards upon his bed until she was sitting directly upon his chest \"Come on Emily\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl didn't need much coaxing, she also moved back so she was sitting on his body, then another until Harry felt that his entire body was covered by the backsides of 11 year old girls. They continued to sit on him and chatted amongst themselves for a while about various topics which only girls ever really understood. They even tried to ask Harry a few questions since he was apparently a girl now, but he just flushed bright red and didn't know how to respond. \"She's not a very experienced girl, this one\" Emily mused \"what do you say girls, should we educate her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were murmers of consent, but to Harry's relief at that point Ginny emerged from the bathroom, wearing a towel but little else. Clearly she had no problem going around almost completely naked in front of Harry any more, since he was apparently also a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A topic for another time\" Sophie mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently Hariet here is a bit green about what it means to be a girl\" Emily pointed out \"we were thinking of educating her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fun\" Ginny smiled \"I'd say she looks a little more red than green right now though. Does anyone want to help me carry Hariet here to the bathroom to make sure she gets washed properly, then we'll get her dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" Emily responded. The oher girls stood up and Emily pulled the sheets off Harry's bed \"Up, now!\" she ordered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed, he didn't feel there was any point in protesting so he sighed and got out of his bed, making his way towards the bathroom. Ginny and Emily followed close behind, although Emily stopped by his drawer to to take out some replacement underwear for use later. Ginny closed the bathrom door after they were all inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Ginny hadn't emptied the bath, feeling that Harry could get washed in her own dirty water. There was still a head of foam in that bath and clearly Ginny had applied a number of scented oils \"so you'll smeell nice all day\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled when she started to remove Harry's underwear, then she gave a start of surprise. \"She's got male genitals\" she gasped \"whoever heard of a girl with a boy's bits? She must be defective, perhaps I should smash them.\" Emily quickly measured him then drove her knee into his groin with as much force as she could muster. Harry sudenly dropped to the ground as pain shot through his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly defective\" Ginny nodded \"perhaps if we remember to assault them regualrly they'll eventually fall off. When she's up to it though, let's get her in the bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes for Harry to stop writhing on the floor but when he did the girls picked him up and dropped him into the water. He wasn't exactly a heavy boy after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them a few minutes to clean him thoroughly, including his hair but when they were satisfied they pulled him back out of the bath and removed the plug to let the water drain away. Ginny handed him a towel. \"Dry yourself off thoroughly then put on your new underwear that Emily here brought for you\" she informed him \"then you can get back into the main room and finish getting dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry towelled himself thoroughly, then feeling that he had no choice in the matter he put on the clean underwear that Emily had given him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl\" Ginny smiled as she took a bottle of femiine deodorant and sprayed him throroughly \"now you are all nice and clean, go and get dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry noticed as he put yesterday's clothes back on that some of them were a little ripe. He didn't mind that though, maybe it would mask the aroma of that deodorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it\" Ginny approved, collecting her bag \"come on Harriet.\"</span></div></div>",

They aren't the only people here, there are a number of others around; both boys and girls. The boys were holding their noses and giving Harry strange looks \"What deodorant are you using Harry\" one of them asked \"you smell like a flower bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's smelt a lot worse believe me\" Hermione giggled from her chair by the fire place. It was the same chair in fact in which she had sat upon Harry for so long the previous evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along Harry\" Ginny instructed him as he led him to the chair next to the one that Hermione was occupying. She encouraged Harry to take a seat then she herself sat down in exactly the same place. By now though Harry was used to being sat upon and it actually felt natural to feel Ginny's warm butt cheeks over him. A couple of first year girls grinned openly, and Hermione gave a smile of approval. A number of boys actually turned away in disgust though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she may not be Hermione but she sure knows how to sit on Hariet\" one of the first year girls noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hariet, who's Hariet?\" Hermione asked, thinking that someone must have mentioned something about last night and she had her suspicions about who it might be \"oh and Ginny has spent more time sitting on Harry than I ever have\" she confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found out earlier that is Harry's true name, since she is really a girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be rediculous\" one of the other boys noted \"everyone knows that Harry here is a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did she sleep in the girls' dorm last night? We all know that boys aren't allowed anywhere near our dorms. Hariet must be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were gasps of shock from the boys\" You slept in the girls' dorm?\" one of them demanded \"whatever for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because McGonagall, realising her true gender barred her from the boys' dorms last night and reclassified her as a girl\" Ginny commented \"now she has no choice but to sleep with the rest of the first year girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all laughed at that, the boys meanwhile turned their backs on him, there were a number of comemnts heard in male voices, \"sissy\" being among the mildest. Harry was sure that by this time tomorrow everybody would know that he slept with the girls,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything we should get out of the male dorms for her\" one of the first year girls asked \"since she can't go there any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny considered, she didn't want Harry to have too many possessions but there were some things he would need. \"Just her clothes and her school supplies will do\" she countered \"she won't need anything else. Oh, leave her underwear where it is as she won't need any of that. I'll burn the rest of those later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give her a hand\" Hermione suggested \"I've a fair idea what she'll need and what she has no further use for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls headed back up to the dorms, leaving Ginny to sit quietly on Harry for a while. It wasn't too long before they returned though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've put Harry's books by her bed\" she explained along with her other school supplies. Her clothes are in her drawers and wardrobe, but since she is already dressed she won't need those today.\" She used the short form Harry as it could also just as easily stand for 'Hariet'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't I need some of my books for today's lessons?\" Harry asked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a Saturday, Harry\" Ginny responded, then spoke to Hermione once more  \"Did you take anything else\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for her, no. She uttered \"oh you know that drawer I had installed in my wardrobe, the hidden one that is magically sealed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you've told me you created one. It is very well hidden since I have no idea where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one, and it does exist. I've stashed that old invisibility cloak in there along with any money that was in her trunk and her Gringotts key. I think it is safe to say she will never see any of those things ever again. Since you now own Hedwig, I'm sure if you encouraged her to send a letter to the bank, advising the goblins that Harry has given you access to Harry's vault and sign it in Harry's name. I'm sure that no questions will be asked if you then turn up at the bank with his key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny smiled at that \"I think that'll be satsfactory\" she approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't like what he was hearing but he could see no way around it. Were these girls really going to gain access to his bank account, all that money that his parents had left him now in Ginny Weasley's hands? What was worse Harry couldn't see any way to prevent them from taking it. His letter delivered by his former owl and his key. There was no way the goblins would possibly refuse them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and there are these\" Hermione added, taking a bag of owl treats out of her bag \"I'm sure your Hedwig will appreciate one next time you see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she will\" Ginny nodded, pocketing the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's little else of relevance except a quidditch book and a broom care kit which I'll pass to you since you taken Harry's place on the team now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, they'll come in handy. There is also this photo album showing a number of pictures of Harry's parents. What do you think I should do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toss it in the fire\" Ginny advised, feeling that Harry didn't need any sentimental links to his past \"that part of Harry's life is over now anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded and throw the photograph album, one of Harry's most treasured possessions in the flames which hungrily rose to devour it. Harry felt crushed, the one link he had to his childhood was now destroyed in flames, the last of the photos turning to soot as he watched helplessly from his confined position under Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he have anything left that he could call his own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Harry screamed at Hermione after her heartless act of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll watch your mouth Harry if you know what's good for you.\" Hermione warned him.</span></div></div>",

Harry then let out a high pitched scream as Hermione rammed her knee into Harry's private area three times before letting go of his hair, causing him to fall to the floor, whimpering in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls were cheering on Hermione but Hermione merely replied \"I'm not done with her yet.

Someone, fetch me some parchment, a quill, and ink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever for?\" asked Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to ruin the surprise now am I?' smirked Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls had smiles in anticipation as Sophie got what Hermione asked her to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Harry recovered from the assault, he stood up; Hermione was right there roughly holding his hair again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, Harry and listen good. Ginny controls your life now. She's taken your broom, your Quidditch spot, your wand, your owl, a year's worth of magical education, your freedom within Hogwarts, your Invisibility Cloak, and your wealth. It would not be wise to disobey her, me, or the girls in your new dorm.  Got that? As the next part of your punishment, you're going to write Gringotts yourself, saying that she is more suited to control your money than you and that Ginny Weasley owns your vault now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Awesome, Hermione\" replied Sophie who was now looking at her in admiration. \"Instead of Ginny writing to Gringotts, you're going to make Harry do it himself, making it even more painful for herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan. Now get to it, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked at all the gils in fear as he tremblingly took the parchment and wrote away all claims to his money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGringotts Bank,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am writing to inform you that my vault, Vault 687, now belongs to a new owner. I have decided to give all my wealth to Miss Ginny Weasley. She is much more suited to own money than myself and I trust it in her hands. I have also given her my key so she can come in at anytime to retrieve money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Harry Potter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then looked at the letter and replied \"Good. Now Ginny, if you will sign underneath Harry's name as well and then I will sign it as a witness, it'll be all set for Hedwig to deliver to Gringotts.\" said Hermione with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny and Hermione then signed their names and the letter was fnished, ready to be given to Hedwig at Breakfast.

This girl was enjoying seeing what Ginny and Hermione were both doing to Harry and she had a bratty older brother that she hated, she was more than happy to take her frustratiions out of Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any spells you are struggling with? Anything you might want a bit of extra training, any curses and hexes you really want to learn? I believe we now have ourselves a target to practice upon, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that spell you used on her in Potions, Ginny? I'd like to see that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny smiled and quickly reapplied the 'bat bogey hex', making her wand movements and her voice distinctive so as to teach those around her how it was performed. The bat shaped object staterd emerging from Harry's nose once more before they flew out of an open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that one\" Sophie approved \"can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny nodded, and cancelled the spell so that Sophie could now attempt it. Apparently she was a quick study as she cast a perfect spell on her first attempt Harry's nose was soon occupied once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else?\" Ginny asked and four more girls stepped forward at that point. Most of them achieved the spell on their first attempt, and those that didn't were successful on the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you show me that Body Bind spell, Hermione?\" one of the first year girls asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly\" Hermione nodded, she showed them all the wand movements involved and spoke the words slowly so they could all catch them. Then she looked at the girl who had first rquested the spell. \"You want to have a go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, he is still under yours\" the girl replied Hermione apologised to her and lifted the spell, but before Harry could recover the other girl had already cast it upon him. She wasn't the only one either, all of the girls managed to successfully cast that spell on the first attempt, it was clear that Hermione was a very good teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks so vulnerable when she is under that particular spell\" Sophe mused \"so, so vulnerable. We could do anything we wanted to her couldn't we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we coud, and of course should\" Ginny approved \"You may notice that Hermione and both enjoy sitting on Hariet here, in fact she makes for a very comfortable seat cushion. I recommend using her in that capacity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like we sat on her in bed eariler\" Sophie responded \"that was a lot of fun.\" She and a number of other first year girls piled on top of Harry at that point, burying him beneath their butt cheeks. Even if Harry was not under the effect of the body bind curse, he couldn't move at that point due to all these girls who were sitting on him. This was reinforced when Ginny then removed the most recent Body Bind curse which one of the younger girls had placed upon him. Harry was no so complety entombed under this group of delighted first year girls that he could not move at all, no matter how much he strained against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the only part of Harry tht was still uncovered was his face. Emily who was the fiurthest forward and straddling his neck, glanced down at his face and shook her head in disapproval. \"I really don't want to look at that thing\" she sighed, then she glanced over at Hermione and a solution appeared to her. \"Sit here, Hermione\" she requested, pointing down at Harry's still visible face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to\" Hermione responded, and she came over to where Harry lay, standing with one foot on either side of his head. \"Hold his head still for me Emily so I can get a decent perch\" she advised, and Emily toook Harry's head in hands and held it in position so he was looking straight up at the girl who  he knew was about to sit down upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Hermione knelt down with her knees either side of him, bringing her butt cheeks close to his face, but before she actually sat she looked over at Ginny. \"Get a camera\" she advised \"I want a momento of this, in fact I want lots of momentos all over the walls of your dorm so he is constantly reminded of what I am about to do to him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnny laughed and raced up to the girls' dorm, then came back a moment later holding a wizarding camera. She took a seat nearby, probably the only girl who wasn't currently sitting on Harry but she didn't mind since she was still taking her own part in this incident. She pointed the camera at Harry and put one finger over the button which would take the photograph. \"I'm ready\" she advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded, she pushed her robes away and straightened the back of her skirt, then she settled into her position, her backside coming in to contact with Harry's face and pressing down upon it.  Ginny took that opportunity to record Harry's situation from every possible angle, she paid particular attention to the front position, lingering on Hermione's groin and her skirt, with her legs close together as she sat firmly upon Harry. She showed the look of satisfaction on Hermione's face and the faces of the other girls who were sitting behind her. She wanted to show every aspect of what was unfolding right now, including how much they were all enjoying what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the moment Hermione sat on his face, Harry found his airway sealed completely. There was no way he could possibly draw a breath with Hermione's butt flesh cutting of both his nose and mouth. To begin with this didn't seem to be an issue, but it was only a few seconds before his need to draw a breath started to become desperate, and Hermione was simply not allowing him any She just continued to sit and smother him beneath her.  The other girls who were siting behind her were particularly heavy too. One eleven year old on her own, such as Ginny sitting on him earlier wasn't all that significant, but as a group their weight multiplied enormously. No wonder he couldn't move at all, and now his head too was also immobile, as though the 'body bind' curse had never been lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you putting her to sleep, Hermione?\" one of first year girls asked, and Harry heard her reply in a clear voice \"yes, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanted to, you could stay there until she died couldn't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed I could, and easily but I won't. We can't have any more fun with her if she's dead. She will go to sleep though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the last words Harry heard before he faded into unconsciousnes.<br>\r\nHermione got up from his face and looked own at him approvingly, he was out cold. Ginny made a point of showing this fact in great detal with her camera, then she put it down. \"I'll make loads of copies of that picture and post it all over the dorm\" she announced \"we'll see Harry smothering from the moment Hermione sits on him to when she emerges having brought him to unconsciousnes. He can watch himself passing out over and over. I'll keep several copies form my self though and store them where Harry will never find them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep one in my concealed drawer with his invisibility cloak\" Hermione responded as she resumed her original seat once more. The other girls continued to sit on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know girls\" Ginny said then, seeing another opportunity to torment him \"Hariet here may be in our dorm now, but we shouldn't ever see heras an equal, she is inferior to all of us in every possible way. Let's keep reiminding her of that whenever we can, sit on her whenever we feel like it, use her as a punching bag or practice target for out wands, anything we want. See her as someone who is there for our entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we will\" Sophie approved, she had no fondness for boys since she hated her older brother so much and she was more than happy to take her frustrations out on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry slept for several minutes, but eventually he did awake and when he did he found that the first year girls were still sitting on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

What if she escapes.\"<br>\r\n\"She can't escape\" Ginny assured her \"not ever. The Fat Lady won't let her through if I'm not with her, McGonagall's orders. If we leave her then she will be trapped in here, as a prisoner of the common room.\"<br>\r\n\"How did you manage that?\" Emily laughed.<br>\r\n\"A bit of fast  talking, and a bit of luck I'd say. I managed to convince McGonagall that it was Hariet's best interests. I'm rather proud of that one.\"<br>\r\nI'd never have even though of something like that, you have a quick mind Ginny.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but Hermione here is the expert in that regard.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that one was all yours, Ginny\" Hermione assured her.<br>\r\n\"That is not exactly what I meant.\"<br>\r\n\"I know. Oh, if we are taking Hariet here with us, would you mind if I took care of her mealtime duties. I haven't tried that yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Ginny smiled \"I'm ure you know the routine\"<br>\r\n\"I do indeed.\"<br>\r\n\"You have a plan for her meals too?\" Sophie asked, intrigued.<br>\r\n\"We do indeed, why don't you watch, you'll probably enjoy it.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I could take part in some way\" Sophie offered, and Emily followed with a determined \"me too!\"<br>\r\n\"It sounds like we have some new recruits, Hermione\" Ginny hinted.<br>\r\n\"It does indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first years finally got off Harry and stood up \"Emily and Sophie each grabbed hold of his arms. \"Do we drag him to the table?\" they asked.<br>\r\n\"Not really, when I am walking around the school I make Harry walk behind me, since he is beneath me and not fit to walk at my side\" Ginny pointed out \"this time let's make him walk behind all of us.<br>\r\n\"Yes let's\" Emily agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore getting into position, Hermione glanced at Harry \"One other spell to show you before we go\" she informed them \"the most important one of all in fact.\" She pointed her wand at Harry and uttered a single word \"obliviate.\" Suddenly a blank look came over Harrys face as the spell took hold, and Hermione kept her wand pointed at him for a couple of seconds, then she lowered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did that do?\" Emily asked \"I saw a dopey look come over here face, well more dopey than usual but that is all.\"<br>\r\n\"That was a memory charm\" Ginny informed her \"Hermione just made her forget all the spells we have been using on her.\"<br>\r\n\"That's right\" Hermione smiled at Ginny \"although she is so pathetic that she won't ever learn anything anyway, it is fun to use that particular spell after we have been practicing magic on him. I'll teach you it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then moved to stand in front of Ginny, with Hermione in front of her, followed by Emily and Sophie took her place at the front. \"Get in to place, Harry\" Ginny instructed him and, feeling particulary wobbly on his feet after everything they had done to him and the extended period of being sat upon by a group of first years and Hermione, Harry took his place standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a line they moved at a steady pace towards the exit of the common room \"Harry is with me so he may leave this time\" Ginny instructed the Fat Lady who nodded at her and kept the door open so they could all pass through.<br>\r\n\"You called her,he!\" Emily gasped.<br>\r\n\"It'd be confusing to the profesors if we called her a she all the time\" Ginny pointed out \"they all think Hariet here is male for some reason, we can keep her true gender when Harriet is with us in the common room, and at all times in the dorm though.\"<br>\r\n\"I see your point\" Sophie conceded \"but of course w all know that she is really female.\"<br>\r\n\"We do indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time they reached the great hall and the girls led Harry to the Gryffindor table. It was by now getting towards the latter part of the breakfast period and most people had already left, although food was still being served. \"Sit, Harry\" Hermione instructed him \"you know I can't sit until you do.\"<br>\r\nSeeing all these girls around him, Harry knew was severely outnumbered , especially since the first years had pointed their wands at him. He sat down at an empty space at the Gryffindor table and Hermione settled into to place upon his lap, using her full weight to treat him as her own personal seat cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time Hermione had sat on him, he hand suffocated under her young womanly backside, smothered unconscious by her so he was now fully aware of the power her behind represented, and he was actually slightly afraid of it, but now it merely resting fimly upon his lap, at the moment he could still breathe. She did grab his hands, pull them under the table and trap them between her thighs though, just as Ginny did when she sat on him at the Gryffindor table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny then took her place at one side of Hermione, with Sophie and Emily on the other side. Sophie was the one nearest to Harry. Ginny smilled at something then beckoned to her. \"You wanted to get involved in this didn't you?\". Sophie nodded at this. \"Why don't we edge a little closer to Hariet here?\"<br>\r\nSophie considered this. \"How close?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n\"So we are squashing her between us.<br>\r\nSophie laughed and dutifully edged nearer and nearer to Harry, Ginny did the same on the other side. They didn't stop when they sat right next to him though, they pulled themseves even more tightly against him, closing the gap between them even further until they were both digging themselves firmly into his sides. Harry was now surrounded by girl flesh and it was bearing down on him from all angles.<br>\r\n\"Can I do something?\" Emily asked \"I want to have some fun too. What else is involved in this mealtime scenario.\"<br>\r\n\"It is fairly simple\" Ginny informed her \"I, or in this case Hermione sits on her and keeps her hands trapped between our thighs so she can't do anything except wait and be sat upon whilst we enjoy our own meal. Only when we are done and the table is cleared do we offer her a plate of the least appetising items on the table, the kind of things we wouldn't dare put in our mouths and continue to sit on her until she has cleared her plate. If there is more than one course we then capture her hands once more and start over.\"<br>\r\n\"I've just thought of something\" Emily giggled \"I might add a ltitle seasoning of my own to that meal of his, she reached for her glass and took a long sip of pumpkin juice.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever you season it with, it shouldn't taste very nice\" Hermione advised.<br>\r\n\"Dont't worry, you won't want to touch the contents of his plate after I have finished with them, you really won't.\"<br>\r\nGinny was intrigueed but she was sure she would discover what Emily was hinting at soon enough, Hermione already had a fair idea and thinking about it brought a smile to her lips. When breakfast appeared though, she attacked it vigourously then took a couple of slices of dry bread, the most stale looking ones she could find, ripped them to shreds, put them on a plate and passed them to Emily. \"I think we are ready for that seasoning now\" she commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily ginned, took the plate and excused herself for a moment. She then headed of towads the girls toilets that were situated near the entrance of the hall.Ginny watched her heading off for a moment, wondering what she was doing, then she burst out laughing.<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes later when Emily returned, still carrying the plate of dried bread, but now it did not seem quite so dry and there was a definite aroma coming from that plate. \"I needed that\" she commented, laying the plate in front of Harry \"one thing about pumpkin juice, it sue does make you go.\"<br>\r\nBy now Sophie also realisd what she had done and she too started laughing. The bread looked far more moist than it had, but there was no liquid on the plate, whatever Emily had added, she had drained off before she returned although the plate showed no signs of being cleaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much longer before all the girls had finished their breakfasts and the food was cleared away. Hermione freed Harry's hands at that point and handed him the plate of moistened bread. \"Chow down, Harry\" she instructed.<br>\r\n\"Harry took one wiff of the plate and shook his head. \"I'm not touching that\" he gasped \"it smells like someone peed on it.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Emily giggled \"they have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily\" Hermione advised her \"why don't you point your wand at Harryand if he doesn't eat everything on that plate I want you to subject him to every curse you ever learned, I'll even show you a few particularly nasty ones you won't have covered yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly\" Emily nodded, taking out her wand and aiming it at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that he really didn't want to be cursed into oblivion right now, Harry sighed and started taking bites out of that soggy bread.It was clearly laced with urine but he tried to push that thought out of his mind as he ate but it wasn't long before he reach for the pumpkin juice. Sophie pushed the drink out of the way \"Not until you have finished eating, Harry\" she instructed \"let's not wash away Emily's efforts whilst you are eating, she prepared that breakfast just for you.\" Grumbling and unable to take the foul taste out of his mouth, he slowly cleared his plate, thinking to himself this had to be the worst meal he had ever eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was given after that, but Hermione only water though. Hermione said he should only ever drink cold water from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Harry had finished his drink, the meal was over so it was time to find something else to occupy their time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay girls\" Hermione said then \"I'd say that concludes breakfast, and I must say Emily that your contribution was a masterstroke. I loved it. Now why don't we adjurn to the common room and continue our wand work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's\" Sophie agreed, grinning at Harry. The girls all got up at hat point and pulled Harry to his feet. Harry found that his groin was aching due to the way it had been compresson on all sides. \"Right Harry\" ginny instructed \"you stand behind Hermione again as you well know, the rest of you, remember that Harry is to be at the back when we return but lets all walk together, show that we are of equal status whilst Harry is beneath all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can go along with that\" Sophe smiled, and as Hermione and Ginny stood together, they stood on either side of them, all in front of Harry with their backsides towards him. In this group they made their way out of the Great Hall and back up the stairs towards the Gryffindor Common Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever lost your footing and fallen on Hariet?\" Emily asked Ginny as they passed down one of the corrirors.<br>\r\n\"Not so far!\" Ginny then she quite deliberately caused herself to slip and fall backwards onto Harry who was right behind her and knocking him to the ground. She sat on him for a few moments and then she stood up, pulling Harry to his feet \"but there is always a fist time\". Harry was understandably quite sore at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued together until they reached the Gryffindor common room. Emily gave the password when the Fat Lady requested it, then rather than just waiting for Harry to follow behind them, Emily and Sophie pushed him through the entrance, and the girls then followed after him. Strangely, there as nobody else around, and certainly no boys. \"I think the boys prefer to run around outside, even in cold weather\" Ginny commented when Shophie raised this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where were we before we stopped for breakfast\" Hermione asked \"I was teaching you spells wasn't I?\"<br>\r\n\"Erm, we were sitting on Hariet\" Emily pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we continue the spell practice for now\" Hermione offered \"we can sit on Hariet at any time.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds reasonable to me\" Sophie smiled<br>\r\n\"In fact, why don't we form out own Girls' Academy\" Hermione suggested \"I can teach all members every spell I know, and Hariet here will be our official target. We'll meet up whenever we feel like it and practice our magic on her, and we can even practice on her when we are not together. There'll be no official records kept at all, no tedious beaurocracy. It'll be just us using our wands on Hariet. Membership is be open to myself and Ginny, Hariet here will be the target for us to practice on, and all other members of Ginny and Harriet's dorm may join. There is no membership fee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count me in\" Sophie giggled<br>\r\n\"Me too\" Emily added <br>\r\nEvery other girl in the room voiced their agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's get started then\" Hermione offered<br>\r\nShe started by going over the body bind curse once more, then moved on to the stunning charm. The girls all loved knocking Harry out with their wands, and Hermione was forced to wake Harry up after every succesful attempt, which became more and more frequent, or Harry would have slept through the entire lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long does this stunning spell normally last?\" Emily asked at one point.<br>\r\n\"It depends on the strength of your spell, it may only be a few minutes but a good stunner can knock a target out for several hours and I see that some of you are getting very proficient at it.\"<br>\r\nAfter stunning, Hermioe showed them how to cast ropes from their wands that would fasten around their taget and bind them securely. It was Sophie who was the last person to cast this one, but Hermione then suggested that Harier should stay tied up for a while so they could see the effects the rest of their spells were having.<br>\r\n\"Unlike earlier when she was under the body bind?\" Emily mused<br>\r\n\"Exactly, there is only so much you can do to a totally immobilised victim.\"<br>\r\n\"You can sit on her\" Ginny remarked.<br>\r\n\"True, but let's stick with the spells for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving shown them ways to immobilse a target, they then moved on to the subject of curses and hexes. The 'Jelly Legs' one was quite amusing, as was the tickling charm.  There were spells that caused Harry's body to be covered in boils, and those that made him cough up everything from slugs to frogs. A curse which made Harry start dancing had an unusual effect as Harry was clearly still tied up and with every twist of his body, the ropes dug into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer was covered in warts, carbuncles, blisters, even bee and wasp stings. One spell caused red spots to appear on his body which started to grow in size until they eventually exploded and each explosion was acocmpanied by a pained scream from Harry. The more the girls praciced, the more the girls enjoyed all the torments they inflicted on him, and the more powerful and practiced their spells became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, girls\" Hermione smiled at last \"I'd say you are all fast becoming extrememly powerful young witches \"be sure to practice those spells whenever you feel like it Hariet will always be here for you to work on. Some of those spells you won't even cover until second year or higher, you'll find several of them in the \"Standard Book of Spells Grade Two\" which you won't see until next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, I think I saw a copy of that among Harriet's\" supplies one of the first years pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doing with a book like that?\" Ginny gasped \"there is no way he can perform any of them, he's not even a second year. In fact I'll go and deprive him of it right now.  Ginny then disappeared up the stairs which led to her dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned, she was grinning broadly and carrying what looked to be a large photograph frame. \"It's developed pefectly\" she grinned \"why don't we all sit down and have a good look. Hermione, why don't you claim Hariet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione knew full well what she meant by 'claim Hariet', she dragged Harry over to one of the nearby chairs, relased the spell that had bound him in ropes and let him fall into it. She then maneovered him into position so he was sitting straight and sat down directly upon the same seat. Harry once more felt his lap being consumed by her backside but again he was relieved that she wasn't sitting on his face again. Then he caught sight of the photograph, which Ginyn had placed on a table so they could all get a good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione turned to one side so Harry could clearly see the photgraph by she still remained just as fully seated upon him.He tried to turn away from what he saw before him but Hermione was not offering him any opportunity to hide behind her. When he tried to turn away or close his eyes Hermione slapped him sharply across the face. \"Watch the photo, Hariet\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photograph showed a group of 11 year old girls sitting on the floor of the common room, Sophie and Emily immediately recognised themselves among the crowd. They weren't sitting on the floor though, they were sitting on something or rather someone, and this someone had a face. It was Harry's face. It could clearly be seen poking out from between. His face appeared to be the only part of him that was not currently being sat upon, but a short way above that face another girl hovered as though preparing to sit. That girl was Hermione. He could see her backside clearly, mere inches above his own face, a face that the girl behind her, Emily was holding firmly in place ready for Hermione to claim it as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaim it she did, Her skirt-covered backide settled upon Harry's features and bore down relentlessly, sealing his airway. Having claimed her seat, the Hermione in the photograph merely sat and waited and Harry knew that this was the same Hermione who was siting on his lap right now. No wonder Ginny had suggested that she 'claim' him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry saw himself suffocating from every conceivable angle as the image moved around to show the image from different points of view. He saw Hermione's legs sticking out from her skirt, her thighs close together and no visible sign of Harry bneath her. but he knew for certain that he was still there. He could see that the Harry in the photo was now really strugglign to breath but that Herminoe was relentless, unmoving, then it semes that all his struggles stopped and he had passed out. This was confirmed when Herminoe stood and everyone could see Harry's clearly unconscious face where she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clip started over and this time Ginny added the sounds. This added a while new dimension to the media as one of the girls asked Hermione to put him to sleep, and she agreed to it. There were moans and groans from Harry as he smothered under here, struggling to draw a breath that was not to be afforded him, and then silence as he passed out. The images brought chills to Harry, and he knew that he would be seeing them over and over again for the rest of his time at Hogwarts. As for the girls, they were all loing it. There was laughs and smiles all round, and many congratulations offered to Hermione for her part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had seen it a few times though, Ginny silenced the photograph and took it back to her dorm.</span></div></div>",

Can I take care of Hariet this time, Ginny?\"<br>\r\n\"We have created a good team, haven't we ginny\" Hermine chuckled \"united in our desire to use Hariet for our own amusement.\"<br>\r\n\"One for all, and all against Hariet\" Emily affirmed, she was a half-blood witch after all, being the child of a muggle father so she had grown up reading a number of muggle stories.\"<br>\r\nGinny, for one didn't understand the reference, but she thought the phrase had a nice cadence to it, and she agreed with the princile. \"Exactly!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay girls\" Hermione nodded, getting up off Harry and gesturing towards Sophie. \"If Ginny doesn't object then she is yours this time, it is her who has the final say in all Hariet related matters.\"<br>\r\n\"It's fine\" Ginny smiled at her friend.<br>\r\n\"Okay, Hariet close behind me, comrades to my sides\" Sophie instructed, building her chosen formation. <br>\r\nHarry was actually pleased not to be behind Hermione this time, their recent photography display had reminded him just what that backside of hers was capable of doing. He got up and stood behind Sophie, a pretty girl, with long, flowing brown hair.She was slightly taller than Ginny, but of a similar build, and she had already sat on him so he knew she weighed about the same too,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the girls led Harry out of the common room and back down to the Great Hall with Ginny instructing the Fat Lady to allow Harry to pass.<br>\r\nBeing reasonably early during the lunch hour, the Great Hall was quite crowded this time, but the girls found a space at the Gryffindor table where all four of them would easily fit. Harry didn't matter of course since he would be under Sophie.<br>\r\n\"Sit, Harry\" she informed him, indicated the precise space where she wanted him to reside \"sit and be sat upon.\"<br>\r\nKnowing what was coming, but resigned to it anyway Harry took the seat in the place she had selected, then she herself came forward and sat down in the exact same location. Again, his lap was covered by a girl, and like the others she sat with her full weight upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie had sat on him before of course, but not on his lap and not with her full weight. Harry felt he was right in his assessment that she weighed about the same as Ginny, but he detected a slightly different yet still feminine perfume and the contours of her butt cheeks were not qutie the same. She was quite clearly using him as her seat cushion though. Like the others she pulled his hands under the table and trapped them between her thighs, but then she got a wicked in her eyes and she started to squeeze her thighs closer together, applying further pressure to his hands. .Harry suddenly felt like his hands were being crushed in a vice \"Aaargh\" he cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie didn't relieve the pressure at all, in fact she squeezed a little tighter making him cry our again. \"Do you think if I squeeze him much more I might break his hands?\" She casually asked the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here, there are too many people about\" Ginny advised her \"and we do want him to eat the meal we give him shortly \"Feel free to grip them as tight as you like, but I'd hold off on breaking bones, at least for the moment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie looked a little disappointed at that, but she felt that Ginny had a point. She didn't apply any attitional pressure to his hands at that point, but she maintained the grip she already had on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny and Hermione than sat on either side of Harry and started edging closet until they held him in a grip of their own \"We'll happily apply a vice of our own though\" Hermione commented, squeezing him to firmly between them that it was as though his waistline was actually shrinking. Emily took a seat next to Ginny. \"Tell me when his meal is ready for seasoning and I'll do my bit\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe menu today was rich and varied, sandwiches, cakes, rolls, fruits and the more stodgy choices of burgers, fried chicken wings or 'fish and chips' among the selection. The girls all piled their plates and enjoyed their meal as they chatted together, and Harry could do nothing except watch as Sophie kept him firmly in his place beneath her. Emily then surprised everyone by suggesting that Harry should be given a selection of the best foods available as her 'special sauce' would itself make it worthy of Harry's palette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at the deliciousness (in concept but surely not in taste) of Emily's suggestion, Ginny told her to \"go right ahead\" so Emily piled Harry's plate will all manner of appetising choices, then after downing her third glass of pumpkin juice she annouced that she would \"be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as everyone elese was finishing, Emily returned with Harry's plate in her hands. The smell of it alone was enough to tell Ginny that the girl had indeed seasoned Harry's meal and as soon as all the rest of their plates magically disappeared Emily laid it on the table in front of Harry and resumed her seat. Sophie took a glass, filled it with water and placed it just out of Harry's reach She then made sure that there were no other drinks in the vicinity before releasing Harry's hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a natural at this, Sophe\" Ginny congratulated her performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but the most entertaining part is yet to come, eat up Hariet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the contents of that plate would normally be quite appealling, Harry was strongly turned off by the smell of urine coming from it. Still, he was sure these girls would force it down him if they had to so he tucked into another of Emily's speciality meals. It was only once he had cleaned his plate that Sophie allowed him access to the glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we are all done\" Sophie announced at last \"what now, girls?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They then stood as one and waited for Harry to stand up on his own. Like before, they all walked as one while Harry followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their way back to the Gryffindor Common Room, they heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. The rumors are tru after all, Potter. You're the bitch to 1st Year Gryffindor Girls and Granger\" sneered Mlfoy as Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malfoy!\" yelled Harry as he raised his secondhand wand, ready to curse Malfoy until Ginny grabbed his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it, Harry. Malfoy is too much for you to handle. I will protect you from bullies as I promised Professor McGonagall\" declared Ginny with the other girls nodding their heads and saying that they would to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is rich. This is too much\" chuckled Malfoy so hard he didn't notice all the girls send stunners at him, the combined force causing him to fly back into Crabbe and Goyle and hitting the floor so hard they lost conviousness. They had no idea that the fight was seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, girls\" said Professor McGonagall, smiling at their easy work of Malfoy and keeping their promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls jumped in surprise, but Ginny recovered. \"Of course, Professor McGonagall. We 1st Year Gryffindor Girls stick up for one another from bullies and that now includes Harry since she's moved in with us\" replied Ginny with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She? Oh I see. You're helping Harry fit in by treating her like a girl. Well as long as you keep any feminity of Ms. Potter within your dorm room and send me pictures of Ms. Potter dressed fully as a girl to have some good laughs, it'll be our little secret. After all, I was a 1st Year Gryffindor girl myself a long time ago\" chuckled McGonagall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" said Ginny. \"Well, we were on our way to the Common Room to tutor Hariet since she's struggling after all in her classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea. If Hariet (chuckled McGonagall) fails 1st year again, I'm afraid I'd have to expel her due to bad grades and snap her wand\" said McGonagall seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expelled? If that were to happen, could she stay here at Hogwarts under my protection? The outside world is too scary for poor, defenseless Hariet Jane\" pouted Ginny as she hugged Harry protectively, thinking that this would help her manipulate McGonagall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by what I'm seeing, Ms. Potter can stay here at Hogwarts until you graduate, whether or not she does as well\" smiled McGonagall. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have some Slytherins to transport to the Hospital Wing. They will lose Slytherin 30 points and a week's worth of detention while Gryffindor gets 100 points\" concluded McGonagall as she turned towards the Slytherins and levitatd them as she headed to the Hospital Wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she left, the girls busted out laughing. \"Oh, that's hilarious. Professor McGonagall just gave us more power over Hariet\" said Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a bit surprised too\" said Ginny. \"But then again, when it comes to Harry, she keeps giving me power. Let's head back to Gryffindor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't believe his ears. If he failed 1st year again, he'd be expelled but still be forced to be under the control of these girls. He wanted to study hard so he could graduate and perhaps gain his freedom after Hogwarts, but he doubted they'd let him. He was sure they' do everything to ensure he'd fail. With that gloomy thought, he pouted as he got in position to follow the girls back to the Gryffindor Common Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they all got inside the Common Room, Hermione turned towards Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are still going to study or are we going to dress up Hariet so we can send pictures to Professor McGonagall like we promised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny paused in thought. Both ideas sounded like fun and they'd have time to do both many times eventually, but what to do first?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as the girls were about to take Harry back to the common room, Oliver Wood came over to where they were sitting, \"Quidditch Practice, Ginny\" he advised her \"let's see how brilliant a seeker you are, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver probably just chose those words to give his new player a bit of encouragement but Ginny was particularly pleased them, she glanced over at Harry's face and saw that he looked crestfallen. That was just the kind of look she was hoping for. Harry felt once more like the world had collapsed form under him. Until a short while ago, he had been the Gryffindor team seeker. Had Wood forgotten already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that as a keen sportsman and captain, Wood only thought about the current team, not those who had gone before, even when they had only just been replaced. Such people were no longer of any relevance to the outcome of the game, so Wood didn't even give Harry a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you all later\" she said, getting up to follow the boy who was now her team captain from the great hall \"Hermione, you are in charge of things until I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, Ginny\" Hermione and the two first years called after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" Woud asked as they departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little private matter between us\" Ginny commented, her mind already on Quidditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you girls say, back to the common room?\" Hermione offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go and watch Ginny practicing for a while\" Emily offered \"it'll be good to see a real seeker in action for a change.\" This comment caused Harry to emit a low Groan which it appeared Emily did not car for. As she got up to follow Ginny and Wood, she gave Harry a disapproving look. \"Lean forward a second, Sophie\" she requested \"so I can give Hariet here a parting gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie, who was still sat comfortably upon Harry leaned forwards slightly, and as she did Emily gave Harry a sharp slap across his right cheek, then sporting a contented smile on her face she stepped out of the Great Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not a gentle slap, Harry felt a stinging pain in his cheek that continued to linger even after Emily had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come back with you, Hermione\" Sophie offered \"and if Hariet here steps out of line again I might even hit her a time or two myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of us do you think should walk in front of Hariet when we go back?\" Hermione asked \"Ordinarily it is the girl who sat on her during the meal, and that would be you. Ginny asked me to take charge though, so I am wondering if she was asking me to take that role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be you\" Sophie commented \"I think Hariet here is afried of your backside after you so effectively smothered her under it earlier. I think she worries that you might sit on her face again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is to say that I won't?\" Hermione responded \"but that settles it. If Hariet is afraid of my arse then let's keep it in plain view of her when we return. She'll walk behind me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me\" Sophie nodded, finally getting up. Hermione did likewise and stood beside the yougner girl, ordering Harry to stand directly behind her this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry mutely nodded, got up and followed the two girls from the hall. Hermione was careful to keep her butt in plain view of Harry all the way back to the common room. If he tried to turn his head, she quickly shifted position so he wouldn't lose sight of her. Eventually Harry realised there was nothing he could do so kept his eyes focussed straight ahead the entire time. As they reached the common room they gave the password and all three of them entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realise\" Hermione commented then, voicing something she didn't want Harry to think about until they got back \"with Ginny away at Quidditch practice , Hariet is trapped in here until she get back. The door will not open for him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a shame?\" Sophie giggled.</span></div></div>",

Now! Upstairs!\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Harry's first instinct was to try and take the the staircase to the boy's dorms where he used to sleep, but as soon as he got a few steps up the staircase there was a loud popping sound, the staircase slipped away and he slid down to the ground.\"It's true, she really can't use the boy's dorms any more\" Sophie laughed out loud \"she really is a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that path is eternally closed to her\" Hermione nodded \"you want that staircase, Harry\" she indicated the other one, the one that led to the girls' rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Harry made his way up that staircase and the girls followed closely behind him. \"She could fall down these stairs just as easily\" Sophie mused \"one swift punch to the face is all it needs.\" She even clenched her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting\" Hermione chuckled \"but let's take her up to the dorms as we suggested. A good idea for another time though, keep it in reserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the top of the stairs and continued down the corridor \"Lead us to your room, Harry\" Sophie suggested \"the first year girls' dorm is where you live now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually', bring him to mine\" Hermione countered \"Second Year Girls, Hariet, it is the room before yours. a place you won't sleep in until at least next year so you are getting a very privileged first look. Call it a rare honour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that any of them would like to join us if they came up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might, Hariet is at least a year below the lot of them, intellectually and magically and they all know it. They might find her quite entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't like the sound of what they were suggesting, but by now he was standing outside the door of the Second Year Girls' dorm, the sign on the entrance clearly said so. \"I don't want to go in there\" he whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione opened the door for him \"Hush, baby girl and get inside\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send her in, Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded, clenched her fist and drove it firmly into Harry's chest. He doubled up and fell into the room. The girls stepped over him, and closed the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Second Year Girls' place\" Hermione greeted him as he writhed back and forth in pain on the floor \"this, you may be aware is my sleeping quarters, and that is my bed. She pointed to one of the beds in the corner of the room. This is a room to which you have not yet earned the privilege of entering as you are not worthy of it, consider yourself extremely grateful to be allowed in here.\" She then addressed Sophie \"Nice punch\" she approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice dorm\" Sophie commented looking around \"I look forward to the day when I can call this place my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep on applying yourself in clases and especially in our Girls' Academy, you wil have more than earned your place\" Hermione informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will, I will\" Sophie promised \"especially our Girls' Academy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta Girl, now let's get Hermione a little closer to my sleeping quarters, show him what must be for him the most sacred part of my dorm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sacred, you mean he worships you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it as about time he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed at that and together they grasped his arms and dragged his still-aching body over towards Hermione's bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the famous wardrobe with the hidden compartment\" Herminoe commented \"All those things that used to belong to Hariet, so near and yet they might as well be on the far side of the moon. The concealment charms on there are so complex they would stump even Dumbledore himself. Hariet, however is an incompetent loon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hearing this Harry suddenly recovered and reached towards the offinding wardrobe, but his hand was suddenly blocked by an invisible barrier of some kind. That first is a very simple shield charm\" Hermione pointed out \"but even that may be too much for Hariet here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls watched as Harry tried to throw himself at the barrier, as though he could somehow break it with the force of his body alone but he just bounced off.  Eventually he remembered that the shield was somehow magical and took out Ginny's old second-hand wand. He pointed it at the barrier and tried a few dissallusionment spells, but they too ended badly. Firstly he making far too many mistakes in both his annunciation and his wand movements, and secondly that old wand didn't seem to want to listen to him, as though it had not accepted him as its master. Nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he sank to his knees in front of the thing and howled in rage. Hermione and Sophie were both laughing their heads off at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shall we do with her now?\" Hermione mused \"as you can see, she can say goodbye to everything she once owned that is now locked away in thee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie considered for a moment.</span></div></div>",

Okay Harriet, get up onto the bed.\" Both girls had their wands out by now and they pointed them at him, Harry took one look at those wands then he sighed and climbed up onto Hermioe's bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down\" she instructed him, above the covers but with your head on the pillow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did as she instructed, and as soon as he was in postion Sophie cast a set of ropes from her wand that bound Harry's hands and feet securely in place, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are getting good at that spell, Hermione complimented her \"I'm impressed\" She then climbed up onto the bed and stradlled Harry's chest, resting her knees firmly upon his arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you going to sit?\" Hermione she asked the younger girl \"you have his whole body there to choose from\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but there is only one part of her that cries out for me right now\" moving up towards the top of the bed and glancing down in to Harry's face \"I'm going to put Hariet to sleep, like you did  earler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it girl\" Hermione encouraged her \"she looks like she needs a good sleep, and a bed is the best place for it even if it is my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie climbed up on to the bed and knelt over his face as she looked across towards his body and Hermione who was already perched on his chest, then she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry however had known what she was doing and had turned his face to one side.Sophie'sresponse to this was not to merely turn his head or hold it in possion. She got off the bed for a moment, looked down at Harry and slapped him firmly across both cheeks. \"Face upwards Hariet\" she instructed \"if you turn away again you'll get more of the same. I am happy to do this over and over until you learn to do it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded and turned his face up towards the ceiling. What choice did he have? If he kept defying her she would probably end up beating him senseless, or at least even more senseless than he already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie climbed on to the bed once more and once again knelt over his face, this time as she sat she was pleased to note that Harry's face was waiting for her and she allowed her butt cheeks to settle into position over him. She also brought her thighs to rest against the side of his head, ensuring he couldn't turn away even if he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and comfortable\" Sophie approved \"you are right, Hermione it would be so easy to just sit here and wait for Hariet to die. She is so weak isn't she, so helpless, so uttterly vulnerable down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it is tempting\" Hermione nodded \"I was even tempted to just sit there and not get up but you must remember we want to keep her around for a while, rather than just make a corpse out of her, for Ginny's sake at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, for Ginny I won't kill her, but I am going to send her to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfectly fine, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry started to feel like he would pass out again before much longer. His airway was blocked once more, he couldn't breathe at all and the girl seemed to have a sadistic desire to want to suffocate him. He got the distinct impression that if it wasn't for Ginny, she really would sit there until he died. He was also sure that being bound with ropes and with Hermione straddling his chest, there would be nothing he could physically do to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls carried on a conversation above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is it a 'Hermione Special' that charm around your wardrobe?\"<br>\r\n\"That? Oh no, a very simple shield charm that even a competent first year could break. The girls in this dorm could probably sneeze on it and it would collapse. I just put it there today to try and frustrate Harriet, it worked as well as I'd hoped.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean it is just?\" Sophie took out her wand and waved it as though casting a spell, she then indicated the precise counterspell that would break it.\"<br>\r\n\"That's the one, effective against nobody except muggles and Hariet, and the more I see of Hariet, the less of a distinction I can see between her and your average muggle. She may be the product of a witch and a wizard, but she was raised with muggles. Clearly it rubbed off.\"<br>\r\n\"How does that work? You were raised by muggles, you are muggleborn but you are the most powerful witch I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, but I am far cleverer than Hariet here, as are you Sophie for that matter. I can see a bright, magical future ahead of you my girl.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you see in front of Hariet?\"<br>\r\n\"A vast abyss, and between us, and I include the whole of our Girls' Academy in this, we will kick him over the edge.\"<br>\r\n\"Gladly\" Sophie smiled<br>\r\nHarry didn't hear any of what they said after that, because it was at that point that he lost consciousness once more.<br>\r\n\"Do you think she's asleep?\" Hermione asked Sophie a few seconds later.<br>\r\n\"I think maybe she is\" Sophie nodded \"I don't sense any activity from her. She lifted herself off Harry's face and looked down at him. \"Sleeping like a baby\" she confirmed.<br>\r\n\"What do you think we should do with her now that she is sleeping?\"<br>\r\n\"Well I think I'll stay here a while and wait for her to come around, so the first thing she sees when she waks up with be my backside hovering close to her, then I'll sit back down and put her out once more.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think Hariet was ever accepted into Hogwarts?\"<br>\r\n\"Because of her parents probably.\"<br>\r\nBut clearly she is not mentally equipped to handle a magical education.\"<br>\r\n\"True, perhaps she came here so that we could take control of her life.\"<br>\r\n\"Which we are doing expertly\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly, we are brilliant witches after all.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you think will happen if Harriet fails another year.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe McGonagall will expel her, I'm not sure. Nobody has ever been put down one year, let alone two.\"<br>\r\n\"But then we'd lose her.\"<br>\r\n\"We'll cross that hurdle if it comes to it, perhaps Ginny can pursuade McGonagall to keep her around, she seems to have the professor's ear right now.\"<br>\r\nShe does seem to keep finding ways to get McGonagall agree with her plans for Hariet\"<br>\r\n\"I know, fun isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Harry was starting to stir, he opened his eyes \"Wha' where am I? Whose bed is this? He looked straight up and saw the clear image of an article of female clothing hovering mere inches from his face, and from the contours it looked like a girl was wearing it. \"Who's skirt is that?\"<br>\r\n\"My skirt\" Sophie commented \"go back to sleep, Hariet\"and Harry saw that skirt drop down onto him, and the pressure of a girl's backside pressing down upon his face.<br>\r\n\"And you are on my bed\" Hermione added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie was loving the rush of power she was feeling by sitting on Harry's face. Whilst he was now technically a first yer student, the same as her, she was a year younger than him and already she had smothered him out once and was in the process of doing so again. ' The Boy Who Lived' iinded, if they had only known his future rather than dwelling on his past they would surely name him 'The Boy Who Smothered.' That seemed to be a more fitting title for him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was suffocating again, the moment Sophie had sat on his face she had sealed is airway once more. An eleven year old girl was putting him to sleep, by sitting on his face and waiting for him to pass out, and this was the second time she was doing it. Harry had never felt so powerless. He was sure that the only reason he was still alive was that she hadn't decided to take his life, but that she could any time she wanted. That thought alone deflated and semblance of an ego he might possibly have possessed, and then short while later her suffocating presence erased his thoughts completely and he slept once more.</span></div></div>",

In fact this is the first time I've been in your room\" Sophie knew what Hermione meant of course, she was just pulling her leg. She tried to conceal a smile when se said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant your own bed of course.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, and I was just playing with you. Yes, I have sometimes, it is a quiet place where I can be with myself and just concentrate on my books.\"<br>\r\n\"And a comfortable place so sit.\"<br>\r\n\"Well yes, especially with Harriet here. That reminds me, maybe I should get off her face while she still has a pulse. Sophie slipped of her perch on Harry's face and moved down to sit upon his thighs, with her legs dangling over the edge of the bed.<br>\r\nHermione opened one of the drawers in her bedside table, one which she had magically expended so it would hold much more than it intended. It appeared to be full of books. She rummaged around for a while, then took out a couple of spell books \"This is the Standard Book of Spells, Grade Two\" she explained \"I've just about covered everything in here, but this is the book you will be working from next year.\" She held up the other \"and this is the my old Grade One which you will still be working through. Which would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I try the Grade Two?\" Sophie asked \"If I can't handle those just now I can always go back to my current spellbook.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Hermione smiled, pleased to see that the girl was eager to expand her education. She had also seen her performing Seond Year level spells in the Girls' Academy training session earler, perhaps that book wouldn't be too much of a struggle for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, if you need to practice your spells, you are sitting on the perfect target\" she reminded her as she sat down upon Harry's chest, again letting her feet dangle over the rest of the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know, and I indend to use her for just that purpose\" Sophie remarked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust then Harry opened his eyes and looked over at Sophie who was now sitting on his upper legs. \"I'm awake again\" he informed her \"are you going to put me back to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now\" she replied \"but if you ask me again then I might. Right now, I'm studying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the book in front of her, the spells seemed a little trickier than the ones that she was currently working on, but were they too much for her or was she capable of learning them?</span></div></div>",

She as a bright girl and a quick study after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one looks interesting she mused, looking at a particularly unpleasant curse would cover a victim's body in painful looking blisters. She practiced the wand movements on the page a few times, and Hermione who could easily see what word she was attempting nodded her head in approval. She attempted the word, but it sounded tricky and she made a slight mispronunciation. Hermione corrected her though, then she glanced down at Harry, upon whom they were both still sitting. \"That's right now put them both together and try it on Hariet here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie cast the spell and Harry's skin was suddenly covered with the blisters that were described in the book. \"That wasn't too bad\" she mused, let's try another. She didn't bother trying to cancel that spell first though before she moved on to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued and Sophie tried more and more spells from the Grade 2 book, all of which were successful after the first few attempts and a little coaching from Hermione. Curse after curse landed on Harry who from his location beneath them was in to position to try to avoid any of them. Hermioe even fired the odd curse at him herself from the book that she was studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Hermione took one a photograph frame out of her drawer, it was the photo of Harry that they had showed him earlier, the one where Hermione had sat on his face until he had passed out. She opened the flap at the back and rested the frame on her bedside table, facing towards Harry. Now he couldn't help but watch the incident playing out before him whenever he looked that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the afternoon wore on, Harry started to feel that his body was no longer his own, he ssemed to be suffering from the combined effects of over a hundred spells, none of which had been cancelled after they were performed. As soon as Sophie or Hermione case something on him, they either did it again so they could further master the spell or moved on to another one. Some of the curses were particularly painful, causing Harry to scream in agony when they were applied. The girls just ignored his protests though and continued as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was pleased with her ward's progress \"You are doing very well my friend\" she complimented her \"there aren't many first years who can handle second year spells, you really are a natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my friend. It must be because I have such a wondeful tutor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last year I actually helped Ron and Hariet here out as well, but I went about it the wrong way. I let them copy my notes in a vein hope that they might one day catch up. They didn't though, and Hariet certainly didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't learn anything by copying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and Hariet here is clearly incapable of learning anyway. I won't give them access to my work again, except on a practical lesson of course. They won't get the opportunity to cheat their way through Hogwarts, neither of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know that Hariet will probably fail again, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but if Hariet is as incompetent as we both know she is, she doesn't deserve to succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Ron\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Ginny will give him a bit of extra tuition, he's her brother after all and family is very important to someone like Ginny. I suspect he'll scrape through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike Hariet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Hariet will fail everything, it is pretty much inevitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventually though they heard footsteps in the corridor and a familiar voice calling out Harry's new name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had completed her first Quidditch practice sesion and returned to the common room, hoping to see Harry there under the control of one or more of the girls. He didn't seem to be down there though, and since there was no way he could have left the common room that left one other possibility. She was surprised to find that the First Years' dorm was apparently deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hariet, Hariet are you up here?\" she called, walking up and down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in here, Gin\" Hermione answered back, and a moment later the door to their room opened and Ginny popped her head inside. <br>\r\n\"Hello Hermione, where's Hariet. Oh of course, you are both sitting on her. You don't mind if I join you.\"<br>\r\n\"By all means\" Herminoe smiled, and Ginny sat between then, dropping heavily onto Harry's unoccupied stomach. She looked down at him for a moment \"She looks a mess\" she giggled \"what have you been doing with her, as though I nee ask.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh we've been practicing our spells, same as always\" Hermione responded. Ginny glanced at the cover of the book that Sophie was working from. \"That's an adanced book\" she noted \"has she managed any of them?\"<br>\r\n\"You can see for yourself\" Hermione smiled, looking down towards Harry for a moment.<br>\r\n\"I see, well with Hermione tutoring you, I am sure you'll get up to her level in no time at all, she really is the best witch in her year, and I know you are pretty smart yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"Unlike Hariet\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Hariet is a lost cause. We all know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you have been doing then, whilst I was on the field, sitting on Hariet and practicing your spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically yes\" Hermione nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I sat on his face for a while\" Sophie declared \"smothered him out too, then let him wake up so I could do it again. That was fun,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it was. I'm glad you enjoyed yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was quidditch practice?\" Hermione asked, changing the subject for a moment and wanting t hear what kind of afternoon Ginny had had out on the pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quidditch was awesome\" Ginny exlaimed \"it really is the best game in the world, too complicated for the likes of Hariet though which is clearly why he was booted from the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a good session?\" Sophe inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic. Wood told me I am the best seeker he has ever seen, he told me that I should even consdier taking it up professionally. He thought Hariet was simply filling the position until a real seeker came along to replace her. He was so disappointed in Hariet and so delighted with me that he even asked Madam Hooch to ban her from the quidditch pitch completely, including the stands so he won't be allowed to even watch a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Hooch agree to this?\" Ginny asked, eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she would want to consult with McGonagall about it, but at one point our Head of House made an appearance in the stands so she could watch the first training session of the year. She even thanked me for taking over from Hariet, she said she had never been so disappointed with a seeker until she saw her in action and that she even regretted appointing her in the first place. She said that after that first Flying lesson when Hariet took off on her broom without the teacher's permission she should have punished her for it, instead of punishing the team by having her play for them. When she heard Wood's suggestion, she immediately approved. Hariet is now not allowed within 20 feet of the stadium, she even cast a shield charm to enforce her instructions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school broom shed is next to the statium isn't it?\" Hermione pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is indeed, and since that is within the no-go area, Hariet can't go there either. I think it is safe to say that she will never fly again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHery fellt utterly crushed, and that was not simply because three girls were sitting on him. Not only was he no longer the Gryffindor Seeker, he was now not even alowed to watch any games and he couldn't even fly one of the school brooms, his most pleasurable leisure activity had been so casually and completely swepped away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily was there to wasn't she?\" Sophie asked \"Didn't she watch your session?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she saw the whole thing, she came back with me, and she had an very proud and satisfied look on her face. Something tells me she enjoyed herself out there in the stands. She kept congratulating me as we walked back, she was still downstairs when I came up, looking for Hariet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go down?\" Hermione offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let'\" Sophie agreed \"I'm sure Hariet here would like to hear her accound of things too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she would\" Hermione nodded \"one moment.\" She cast another memory charm on Harry \"so she won't remember any of the spells we used\". She also cancelled enough of the spells for Hary to at leat be able to walk back down to the common room, although she didn't try to improve his appearance in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got back downstairs, Emily who was sitting in a nearby chair took one look at Harry and burst out laughing. \"Would you look at Hariet\" she chuckled \"she looks like she has been hit by about at least a hundred curses.\" Then she continued \"she has, hasn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" Hermione nodded \"we've been practicing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie and Hermione carried Harry over to the chair next to the one Emily was occupying and dropped him in to it. Ginny immediately sat on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you've just come back from the quidditch pitch\" Hermione asked her \"Ginny has been telling us all about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Ginny is the best seeker I have ever seen, she is magnificent. She must have caught that snitch about once every few seconds, I've never seen anything like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them about what Wood said, and what McGonagall did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, well Wood was in awe of her, called her the best seeker the world has ever seen but that is not the best part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Wood actually asked for Hariet to be banned from the stadium permanently. McGonagall who had come out to watch the game agreed with him. She created a magically enforced exclusion zone around the pitch so Hariet couldn't go there even if she tried What is more the School Brooms Shed is within that area so Hariet couldn't fly even if she wanted to. She will not be allowed to fly a broom anywhere in Hogwarts. I'm so pleased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had all heard the news already of course, but Harry had just had this latest blow confirmed by someone else, he felt sure it was true. His flying days were now over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would like her to spend some time with me this evening, and I would be really greatful if you could leave her in my care once we come back from dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Ginny\" Sophie spoke up for the rest of them \"you only have to ask. Hariet is yours after all, but what should we do in the mean time, girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you both come upstais to my dorm and study with me\" Hermione suggested \"we might not have our target to practice on but I can still teach you loads of spells. I will do all I can to further your magical education.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why your dorm, not ours?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione has a load of books in one of her drawers\" Sophie poined out \"I've seen it, that drawer is even magically enhanced as her books wouldn't be big enough for them otherwise. I honestly think that she collects them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes\" Hermione agreed \"but I do read all of them, and I have learned so many fantastic spells in the process. It'd be far easier for you to come to my dorm than for me to carry my book collection over to yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fair to me\" Emily agreed \"okay, after dinenr, your dorm it is. Ginny can have Hariet here while we work on our magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, girls\" Ginny smiled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point it was around time for them to go down to dinner, after Ginny's request they didn't even feel the need to ask. Ginny automatically took over resonsibility for Harry, who as usual became her seat at the Gryffindor table, and was squashed between Hermione and Sophie. Emily provided her own seasoning to the unwelcome offerings that he was forced to ingest. Percy even caught Ginny's eye at the Gryffindro table and informed her that the Fat Lady had changed the  common room password. He quietly told her what the new password would be and that he would pass it on to a number of other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you hold off on that pelase, Perce?\" Ginny asked her brother \"for at least an hour. It'd be nice to spend some quiet time up there with my friends and the common room is so often crowded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little an authodox\" Percy stated in his usual pompous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Percy, for your own sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay but don't go shouting it off the rooftops. I'll tell people that the Fat Lady is wanting some quiet time and has decided to close her doors until 9pm. at which point I'll hang around otuside the entrance and give the password to any Gryffindors who turn up. 9PM mind, I'd get in trouble if I left it any later than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks brother. I owe you one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy then wandered off down the table and Ginny quietly whispered the new password in her companions' ears.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they returned though, all the girls except Ginny disapeared for their study session, and Ginny and Harry were left alone together. Her agrement with Pecy ment that she would have Harry all to herself down here until 9PM. She checked the clock, she had more than an hour with Harry to heself, far more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Harry\" she told him then, using the shortened form of his original nam and aiming her wand in his direction \"The first thing you are going to do is strip off all of your clothes except for the underwear you are wearing which was so generously donated by one of the first-year girls. Every article of clothing you remove, you are to throw in the fire. You will either do it straight away or after I have hit you with a dozen of my most memorable curses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing what she would do with that wand, Harry started stripping off his clothes one at a time, and as she requested the tossed each item into the fire which cheerily burned them down to ashes. In time he was standing in front of her in only the feminine underclothes he had been given.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Harry\" Ginny complimented him, then she cast her body-bind curse on him and he dropepd to the floor, face upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it is time for you to see me properly\" Ginny informed his now motionless, but entirely conscious form \"this is the girl that runs your life, enjoy the view.\" She then stood over him and started to remove her own clothes. She didn't throw them in the fire though, she instead tossed them onto an empty chair. Her robe, her top, her skirt, her shoes and socks, eveen her underwear. She did not stop until she was standing completely naked over him. \"I am a girl, Harry\" she told him \"and this is what a girl looks like. Enjoy the view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was looking upwards as an effect of the body-bind spell but he could still see perfectly well and Ginny knew this. She moved forward to stand over his face for a time so he could get an even clearer look at her but she didn't sit ther just yet. Instead she waited a few seconds then stepped back and straddled his chhest, pinning his arms beneath her knees. Then she released her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause it was so close and so concenient, Ginny then raised her hand and started slapping Harry hard across the face several times with her right hand. She revelled in the sound of the impact, grinning broadly each time her hand made contact. She continued to slap him for several minues and by that time his face was bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picked up her wand and pointed it at him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me that I am beautiful, tell me that I am a Goddess, your Goddess and the very image of perfect girlhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't want to argue with that wand. \"You are strikingly beautiful Ginny, You are my Goddes and the very defintion of the perfect girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said, Harry. Now tell me that you loved seeing my standing over your face, tell me that you long for the day that I bring my naked crotch down on to your face and smother you beneath it for as long as I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I adored seeing you standing over my face Ginny, I can't wait for the day when you smother me under your naked crotch for as long as you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me that you both need and yearn to suffocated under there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to eufffocate under your naked crotch Ginny, I truly yearn for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is your grreatest desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my greatest desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was right that Hermione sat on your face earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione was right to sit on my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophie also did the right thing, sitting on your face. You deserved to smother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophie was also right to sit on my face.  I deserved to smother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am pleased to hear it, but that time has not yet arrived. Tell me you are disappointed and saddened by that news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am heartbroken not to be smothered under your crotch right now Ginny. It is the most disappointing news I have ever heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, poor little girl. Tell me that you are a girl Harry and that is why you are sleeping with girls..\" Ginny was loving playing with his mind in this way, what mind she felt he still possessed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a girl, it is tright that I sleep with my fellow girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needed to be a first year again, because you are a complete imcompetent as far as magic is concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed to becoem a first year once more, I am incompetent when it comes to magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was right that you lost your place on the quidditch time, all access to the stadium, your money, your wand and your broom to me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was right that my place on the quidditch team, my former money my former wand and my broom to you. It was right that I was banned from the stadium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Harry spoke, the easier it was to agree to Ginny's statements. They were just words after all, weren't they? He didn't suspect that Giny might have used some magical power of suggestion when asked him to repeat what she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am stronger than you, greater than you in every respect and you are forever mine to do with as I see fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are stronger than me, Ginny. You are greater than me in every respect and I am yours forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly right, Harry.

It didn't take long for her to get dressed, she didn't want to miss much of the conversation she was sure would shortly be taking place in the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived to the sound of general laughter as all four of them behild the sight of Harry sat perfectly still in that chair, and still wearing Ginny's clothing. \"They do suit her don't they?\" Emily grinned at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they might\" Ginny responded, and they all laughed even harder as Hermione lifted the 'body bind' spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the portrait door opened, indicating that their private time with Harry had come to and end.</span></div></div>",

She was back in no more than a moment, and handed the camera over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall took a picture of Harry sat n that chair and then addressed the girls again. Could you pelase give me a copy of that when it comes out?\" she requested \"I could do with a good laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Professor\" Ginny responded, politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Miss Weasley, just the girl I wanted to see. I have a proposition for you but perhaps it woudl be best if we discussed it in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, professor\" Ginny answered carefully \"outside our upstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since I am we are all alone here, perhaps upstairs. If the rest of you could please ask anyone else who arrives not to come up to the girls' dorm until we are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Professor\" Emily answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall led Ginny upstairs and along the corridor to the girl's dorm. They both went inside and sat on the nearest bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I would like to say, Miss Weasley\" she began \"that I am very pleased with the way you are managing the Harry situation. I am convinced you truly have his best interests at heart. I have noticed in the Great Hall that you also make sure that he is well fed at meal times, you seem to be taking care of him at every level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of that, I am prepared to make a recommendation to the ministry, if you are prepared to take on the additional responsibility it implies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of recommendation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to put it bluntly. I never approved of Harry living with the Dursleys all those years. You do know that they forced him to sleep in a cupboard under their staircase and the way they treated or more commonly, ignored him was quite frankly inhuman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have heard about that.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What I would like to do, and I am sure Dumbledore would agree with me is that I submit a recomendation to the ministry asking them to accept you as Harry's sole adoptive parent, if they accept the proposal then you would be legally responsible for him , taking on all the rights and responsibilites of his own mother. Do you think you can handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so, professor. I know it is a lot to take on, but I feel I am up to the task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then I shall send an owl to the ministry this very evening. They will want more than one nomination though, can you think of anybody else who might be supportive of your case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could write a letter to Gringotts\" Ginny suggested \"the goblins there would have recently received a letter fthat Harry himself wrote to them in which he signed his bank vault over to me. He apparently trusts me to handle all his fanances, that might help to convince the ministry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did?\" McGonagall raised an eyebrow \"well if he can't be trusted with a wand then he probablly can't be trusted with his own money either so that may have been for the best, and it will support your case. I'll send them an owl too. Thank you Miss Weasley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Professor, I feel honoured to be offered this privelege.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ministry will have to decide in your case, but it shouldn't take long. I believe the next meeting of the adoption panel will be on Monday, and if we move quickly we can have the preliminaries sorted by then. Assuming they approve your choice as adoptive parent, they'll then send you some forms to sign. They'll need to be signed by both yourself and Hariet as well as both Mr and Mrs Dursley. There will even be a space for you to registrer any official change of name for Hariet. Once that form is completed, signed and back in Ministry hands you will be Hariet's adoptive mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there'll be any difficulty in obtaining a signature from the Dursley's\" Ginny noted \"they hate Harry and of course they see him as a wizard,which doesn't sit right with them at all. They'll be happy to rid their home of all traces of magical influene. I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That they will\" McGonagall agreed \"and to move this process along, if you do get that form you can hand it to me when you have got the rest of it filled in. I'l go to Privet Drive andl obtain the Dursleys' signatures personally, then I can pass it back to the ministry for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would advise you not to tell the others until you hear back from the ministry\" she advised \"they may not vote in your favour, but then again they might. I know a few people on the assessment panel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, professor and thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall then stepped out of the room and headed back downstairs, Ginny waited a few moments before she went down. Inside she was ecstatic. If she could pull this off, and from what Mcgonagall had hinted, she might then Harry would truly be her own, her power over him would be absolute.</span></div></div>",

She hasn't scuppered your plans with Hariet.\"<br>\r\n\"Far from it\" Ginny replied \"in fact my hold on Hariet may soon be even more complete than it is already. I'm not really meant to discuss it yet though.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh right\" Hermione responded, feeling delighted that Ginny may be handed even more power but a little sorry not to be hearing all the details. The two of them kept very few secrets from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst she was thinking about whether or not she really should speak with Hermione about it, she decided to ask Hermione about something else whilst she was thinking things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is Hariet doing now?\" she asked \"are Sophie and Emily looking after her?\"<br>\r\n\"When I left Hariet was laid out on one of the sofas downstairs, still dressed in your clothes. Emily and Sophie were both seated upon her and chatting amongst themselves. I suspect they are still there.\"<br>\r\n\"That is nice to hear\" Ginny smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered her friend then she reached a decision \"Why don't we go and sit on your bed for a time\" she offered \"I know Hariet isn't laid on it or anything but outside of my own family I trust you more than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is nice to hear\" Hermione smiled as they walked own the corridor \"but if McGonagall asked you not to tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n\"I have to tell somebody\" Giny gushed \"this news is just too incredible to keep to mself, and if McGonagall and I can pull it off...\" She grinned broadly. <br>\r\n\"\"Alright then\" Hermione nodded, opening the door to the Second Year Girls' dorm and leading Ginny inside. She walked over to her bed and sat down upon it.<br>\r\n\"This mustn't go any futher\" Giinny advised, cclosing the door behind them and joining Hemrione on the bed.\"<br>\r\n\"It won't\" Herminoe promised \"so what is this terribly secretive news  of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"McGonagall is going to write to the ministry, recoomending that I adopt Hariet.\"<br>\r\n\"Adopt, you mean you would become her legal guardian\" Hermione gasped.<br>\r\n\"Yes, if it works. I'll have responsibility for her in the same way that her own mother would have been, and I would be solely responsible for her. She would not be under the Durslley' thumbs any more, she would be under mine and I will have so much fun keeping her there.\"<br>\r\nShe'd move to The Burrow too wouldn't she?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but if mother has read that letter I sent her, she would have already washed her hands of her, and she would quickly convince father to do likewise. Hariet would be mine to do with as I pleased, I would get all that I hoped for and Hariet would lose everything.\"<br>\r\n\"No wonder you are so excited, I sure hope it comes off. What happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well McGonagall is going to write to the ministry tonight giving her own recommendation, and she would advise Gringotts to do likewise as I am now in control of Hariet's former money. There is apparently a meeting of the Assessment Panel on Monday, if they approve then they'll owl me the forms. Once those are signed by myself, Harriet and the Dursleys, it'll all be arranged. I'll officially be Hariet's adoptive mother. We can even legally change Hareit's name using the same form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hariet is called Hariet now after all, we may as well get that signed off but we are overlooking one minor detail.\" Hermione shook her head.<br>\r\n\"It all sounds a farily straightforward process. McGonagall herself will even go to Privet Drive to ask the Dursleys to sign Hariet over, then she'll post the letter back to the ministry.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure  she will, but you say you have requested that Gringotts also need to give their recommendation.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, they probably will too since I now own and control Hariet's vault.\"<br>\r\n\"You don't yet. We haven't posted Hariet's letter to them. We are waiting for Hedwig to get back, remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny swore. <br>\r\n\"That letter will have to be in their hands before they get their letter from McGonagall, won't it.\"<br>\r\n\"I would say so, yes. Perhaps one of the school owls will deliver it for you. Maybe you should head off to the owlery, or you could ask McGonall to hold off a while on sending her letter to Gringotts, assuming she hasn't posted it already.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were a number of people sitting around at this point, but they were not among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that there was no way for Harry to have passed through the portrait hole without her, Ginny knew that they had to be upstair somewhere, so she made her way up the staircase leading to the girls' dormitories. She checked her own dorm first, but that place was deserted so she headed for Hermione's dorm, feeling pretty certain that they would be in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the girls were sitting on Hermione's bed and Harry was where she was sure he would be, laid out beneath them. Hermione was on his chest, Sophie covering his groin and Emily on his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering where you all were\" she rebuked them.<br>\r\n\"The common room was geting a bit crowded\" Hermione informed her \"so we brought Hariet up her for a bit of quiet time. Would you like to join us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny condiered for a moment, she was about to move over to Hermione's bed an sit on the only part of Harry that was still uncovered, his face. Then she thought of something else they could do with him, something they hadn't tried yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, why don't we try this?\" She suggested \"why don't we all take off our shoes and socks and take it in turns to climb on to the bed and walk over Hariets body from her feet to her worthless face. We've sat on her loads, but I don't think any of us has deliberately stood on her yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun\" Emily approved \"you want her dressed for this or unclothed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we strip her completely naked, underwear and all \" Hermione suggested \"that way we can really see where we are standing\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione's right\" Ginny nodded \"undress her girls, take it all off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got up off the bed and started pulling Ginny's clothes from his body. It wasn't long before he was completely starkes. Hermione and Sophie then pulled him back on to the bed, then with a smile Ginny cast ropes from her wand that bound Harry's hands and feet securely. They laid him out on the bed with his face on Herminone's pillow and his feet at the base. His genitals were clearly visible, and got lots of disapproving looks from the girls. \"We'll have to do something about that monstrosity sometime\" Emily declared \"Hariet is a girl now after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all took off their shoes and socks, eager to get started. \"Who goes first?\" Sophie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go last\" Hermione pointed out \"I'm the only second year after all, and I am therefore the oldest. She can have me to look forward to.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll let one of you go first\" Ginny declared \"I want to see one of you trampling on her before I get my go, I'll go second.\"<br>\r\n\"How about you first and me third?\" Sophie asked Emily \"I'd also like to watch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had decided on their order, Emily moved forward and climbed onto the bed, standing with her feet on Harry's ankles. She then slowly walked forwards, making sure her full weight rested on Harry the entire time that she standed on him. When came close to his balls, she stomped on them three times with her right foot calling out die, die, die\" Each stomp elicted a sharp jolt and a scream of pain from Harry that was very satisfying to her ears. She then proceeded to walk over to his chest towards his face, standing with both feet on his head for several seconds before getting off and gesturing for Ginny to have her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny thanked her and stepped up on to Harry. She stood on his ankles, just as Emily had, but instead of just walking up to his face she moved up and down his body, she walked up to his face, stood there for a time and then turned around and walked back. Every time she came to his legs she delivered a firm kick to his crotch that caused Harry even more pain. Eventually though she felt she was starting to monopolise her position, so after moving to stand on his face once more she finally got off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie was up next and after she had climbed up onto Harry she walked back and forth over Harry as though doing a little dance on him. She paid particular attenton to his groin, chest and face and smiled when she stood with one foot over each of his nut sacks and just waited there for a time. Harry's pain when she stood there was constant and inescapable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Hermione got up on top of him and Harry could feel that she was the heaviest of them all. She also seemed to be able to find the most sensitive areas on which to rest her feet. His balls got a great deal of attention from her, but other areas too She managed to fivd a paricularly sensitive part of his armpits and she even managed to bend his ears quite noticably. She appeared to be able to find every pressure point on his body and she lingered there with exquistite ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all fo them had had their turns standing and walking on him, Harry's body ached all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though Hermione told them that she was getting tired and thinking about going to bed.<br>\r\n\"I suppose we'd better go ourselves\" Sophie nodded \"you think we should dress Hariet again before we take her bacl to our dorm?\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever for?\" Ginny asked \"It's not like there will by anyone other than girls up here, and I am sure that by now most of them are aware of Hariet's status. Just take her back is she is, the onlookers will probably enjoy the view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that the clothes that Harry was wearing were left untouched, and the trio of first years led him back naked to their dormitory. The ropes holding his hands were still in place but his feet had been freed so he could at least walk. There were a few girls moving around the corridor at this point, seeking their beds. A number of them leaughed when they saw Harry, some didn't say a thing. Nobody objected though, apart from Harry who was not enjoying the attention at all. His view point was not considered though.</span></div></div>",

One of the girls then had an inspiration, she took an old hairbrush out of her drawer, it was oval shaped, with long bristles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lift her waist up a bit, Sophie\" she requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie took hold of Harrys hips and lifted him slightly, raising him from the bed. This leaves a slight gap between him and the sheet and the girl slips her hair brush beneath him so it is directly below his groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny nodded and smiled \"Lay down Harry\" she told him \"but straight down, don't move away from your earlier position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed and dropped back into place. He could feel the hair brush now touching his most sensitive area but from what Ginny had told him, she would not care to see him moving in to a less uncomfortable position. He waited a few minutes, acutely aware of the presence of that brush whilst Ginny slipped out of her clothes and slipped into her nightie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got in to bed and laid on top of Harry. He could feel her body weight on top of him, all of him but her weight made that brush start to dig in to his flesh. Now though, with Ginny on top of him, he couldn't do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of girls slipped Ginny's duvet back into position and the girl settled in to place, relaxing on her Harry bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls\" she advised them all then \"if Hariet makes a noise, knocks me off him or carries ou any other action that wakes you up for any reason, I want you all to start practicing your most pwerful hexes upon her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry of coruse did not want them to do anything of the sort, he felt completely trapped by her words, his groin more sore than he had ever known because of that hair brush but not daring to do anything about it. If he did anything other than lay still and allow Ginny to sleep on him, he was sure that he would soon feel far, far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time Ginny fell asleep after a few minutes, but Harry laid awake, her weight constantly upon him and the soreness he felt a constant ache that he could do nothing about.

The girls, out of a respect for Ginny had not fired curses that would cause Harry to throw up or eject frogs or other animals from his mouth, but he was suffering from all kinds of ailments and every limb of his body ached profusely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat ironically now, he was making even more yelping noises than he did when he had woken Ginny in the first place.\"Shut up now, Harry\" Ginny instructed him, slapping him hard across the face \"I need to get back to sleep,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed and laid down, but he could not remain quiet for long, the curses he was being forced to endure were not allowing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was about to slap him again, but Emily solved Harry's problem by using a body-bind curse on him, which in no way lessened his pain but he could no longer move or make any noise. At least Ginny could be comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was... she laid back down, and it wasn't long before she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\nIt was not clear whether Harry was able to sleep any more, but he looked decided uncomfortable the next morning when Ginny awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As his senses returned to him he noticed that Ginny was no longer laying on top of him, apparently she had woken up already and he even heard her voice nearby clearly call out \"yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door opened and Hermione walked in, carrying a piece of parchment in her arms. She looked over at Ginny's bed an noticed that Harry was laid upon it,unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Hariet is sill asleep on your bed?\" She mused<br>\r\n\"Perhaps\" Ginny responded \"She was my bed last night, I slept on her and Emily put a body-bind on her so she would stay nice an still for me. Apparently she was being a bit noisy at one point. She woke us up with her complaining.\"<br>\r\n\"She looks like she has had more than one spell cast on her last night.\"<br>\r\n\"We didn't appreciate being woken up, we explained that to her.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you did. Do you want to keep them on her now or should we clear her up a bit now or leave her like that?\"<br>\r\nGinny sighed \"It's a new day, and I guess before long we'll want to take her down to breakfast so we might was well clear her up. Finite Incantatem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of the cast quantities of spells that had been cast on Harry cleared up immediately and he found he was able to move once more. He still moaned though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Hariet\" Ginny smiled \"did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n\"I think you know I didn't.\" Harry looked over at her and noticed that Ginny was stood nearby, fully dressed and all the other girls in the room appeared to be dressed now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept like a log, once I got back to sleep. My bed has never been so comfortable. It must have been that lovely comfortable mattress I used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that you've got with you Hermione?\" Sophie asked, eying the piece parchment she had with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this?\" Hermione walked over to Ginny's bed and sat down directly upon Harry's back \"it is an order form for Flourish and Blotts. I thought we might all appreciate copies of the entire Standard Book of Spells Series, all of them, books one to seven. I've got their catalog too so if anyone knows of any more books we can add to the list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Books for all of us, that won't be cheap. I presume you mean everybody except Harriet\"<br>\r\n\"Off course, they wouldn't do her any good anyway. I mean copies for the entire Girls' Academy, and I know the perfect source of money to draw upon for them too.\"<br>\r\n\"As do I\" Ginny nodded, coming over to sit with Ginny \"I'll happily sign the Gringotts slip advising them to take the funds from Vault 687.\"<br>\r\nHermione handed her the slip which she had already filled out, and Ginny signed the authorisation. \"That's a great idea, Hermione\" she approved \"we'll all be top-notch witches in no time at all, and Harriet will know all about it. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure will\" Sophie nodded \"I'll be more than happy to demonstrate them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine Hedwig will be back today\" Harry commented \"once we have the order completed ,we can send her off with it. Does anyone want any other books?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of girls added various other suggestions at that point, and they were all written on the order. Once it was completed and signed though, Ginny suggested that it was time for Harry to get up and dressed. She and Hermione dragged him to the bathroom to be washed, then returned a few minutes later and instructed Harry to get dressed in the girls' clothes he wore yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should have her own clothes\" Ginny sighed \"I don't want to keep lending her mine. She took a spare piece of parchment and a measuring tape, then she started to take Harry's measurements for waist, leg and various others and wrote them down. \"I'm also going to send Hedwig off to Madam Malkin's with a request for a complete wardrobe for Harry, all girls' clothes of course as Harry is now a girl, and that includes Hogwarts robes in our style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of any clothes she has already?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consign them to the fire in the common room, ideally with Harriet watching. That includes any and all clothes she might have in her trunk which is still in the boys' dorm, or in any of the cupboards in there. Don't let any of the other boys try to stop you either, not that they can. We all already know far more magic than they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it done!\" Emily approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Harry was dressed, Ginny felt tit was time to head down to the common room</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ginny, Hermione, Sophie and Emily made their way down to the common room they found it almost totally deserted, an older girl sat alone in one of the chairs by the fireplace. The girl had dark hair and was wearing a green dress. She was clearly a senior student, sixth or seventh year it appeared and she was reasonably tall and of average build and she had the full figure of a young woman rather than a child. She smiled at Ginny and the other girls as they arrived then she gave Harry a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ginny ushered Harry into the chair next to her own, she spoke up \"You' are going to sit on him again, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course\" Ginny responded, she didn't really know this other girl but her remark clearly showed that seeing her sitting on Harry was not a new experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he a comfortable seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe so\" Sophie nodded \"we like to use her for that purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is staying in the girls' dorms now, the protection that stops boys from coming in to our dorms has been reversed in Harriet's case, by McGonagall herself. She can sleep in our room but not with the boys, so she must be a girl. She even  dresses as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've noticed. Well I would really like to see how comfortable this girl is that you seem to enjoy sitting upon. May I?\" She didn't ask Harry, but looked directly at Ginny as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine by me\" Ginny smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the girl got up from her own seat and moved over to sit on Harry. \"Nice and comfy\" she approved, then she relaxed, allowing her full weight to press Harry firmly into the seat. \"I'm Lauren by the way\" she informed them at that point \"and I am a seventh year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny introduced herself and the other girls that were with her. When she mentioned Hermione, Lauren smiled at her \"I hear you are well on the way to becoming the smartest witch at Hogwarts\" she complimented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it.\" Hermione took the seat that Lauren had previously occupied at that point, and Ginny took the one on the other side. Sophie and Emily both seat nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was acutely aware of Lauren's weight, she wasn't overweight by any means but she was much older than Ginny, Hermione or their first-year friends and her weight was certainly appropriate for her height and age. Harry felt like the girl was crushing him but with the other girls, especially Ginny nearby he didn't dare try to move her and he felt fairly sure that he wouldn't be able to budge her anyway. Even if he could, he didn't want to think of what she might do to him. As a seventh year she would be nearing the end of her Hogwarts education so she would probably know all sorts of unpleasant spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what have you girls been learning lately?\" Lauren asked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie and Ginny then pointed out some of the spells they had been working on lately, and Lauren's face assumed a slightly shocked yet at the same time approving expression. \"Those are second year spells\" she pointed out \"are you sure you can handle them, they aren't too tough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we did just fine\" She demonstrated by casting a jinx upon Harry from the 'Grade 2' book, then lifting it a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is good to see you are paying attention to your studies, there aren't many first years who can handle that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione has placed an order for the entire Standard Book series, Grades one to seven\" Sophie enthused \"for all of us first year girls and for herself. We are going to be the most powerful young witches in the school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you, I like to see a girl get ahead in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any particularly interesting spells from the later books that you can recommend?\" Hermione asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren considered for a moment \"Have you ever come across non-verbal magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that like the time before we come to school, when we perform our first spells without even knowing what we are doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that is just accidental magic, not structured, not remotely predictable and not even a conscious effort. No I am talking about casting spells with your wand, purposefully but without actually speaking the words It is quite complicated, but it is possible to cast any spell this way with a bit of practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds useful\" Ginny approved \"but if that is the case, why do we need to speak the words at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it is the easiest way to cast a spell, you have to communicate your intention to your wand, and the best way to do that is to speak the words as you wave you wand in the prescribed manner. There are other ways to do it though, when you learn the technique you can learn to project the thought of the words on to your wand, It is a little complicated, but it is possible. Have you ever seen any older witches or wizards seeming to do magic without saying a word?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother uses her wand when cooking\" Ginny nodded \"she sometimes just stirs the pan and somehow the food in question just seemed to appear. I've often wondered how she does it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can show you\" Lauren advised her \"but it won't be easy. The spell is in the sixth book in the series so you are talking NEWT level. If you can master it though, you can use the strategy to perform any spell at all in the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to give it a go, wouldn't you girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several responses of approval. \"When can we begin?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straight away if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we were going to go down to breakfast\" Sophie pointed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, Lauren was a seventh year. She wasn't sure if even together they would be able to force Harry away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" she nodded \"Hariet wil not have breakfast today, she willl stay here and continue to serve as Lauren's seat cushion until we get back. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ginny\" Lauren smiled \"that is exactly how she will remain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny, Sophie, Hermione and Emily made their way out through the portrait hole, and as they did so Ginny glanced back towards Harry who was still buried under older girl. In a way it seemed unusual not to be taking Harry with them, but he was under Lauren's ministrations now, so at least he was still being firmly kept in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took their seats together at the Gryffindor table and chatted quietly together as they heartily tackled their breakfasts. At one point there was a flutter of wings and a number of owls made their way in to the Great Hall. Hedwig came over to Ginny and perched on her shoulder, dropping a letter into her lap as she landed. [b]\"Thanks Hedwig\" Ginny greeted her, handing her an owl treat \"stay a moment please, I will have a couple more letters for you in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owl remained where it was as Ginny took the letter and read through it. It was from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nGinny<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for telling me the truth about the boy who is known as Harry Potter. Never again will I waste any of my time on energy on that wastrel. How dare he try to attack you? If it were not for your request that you will take him in hand I would never allow him to set foot in our home ever again, as it is though I shall accept his presence but not even acknowledge him and I will advise the rest of our family to do likewise. Understand that if he comes to our home then he will be your responsibility and you may do with him as you please, we will not interfere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep in touch, and I hope to hear from you again soon. I look forward to more letters from Hedwig, especially if she has chosen you as her new owner. Owls can be quite fussy about who they will accept, clearly I am not the only one who's eyes have been opened with regard to Harry's true nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove<br>\r\nMother<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny read through the letter then passed it around the other girls. \"I think we should read this to Harry when we get back to the common room\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What otther letters were you going to send Hedwig off with?\" Emily asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The orders for the book and robe shops in Diagon Alley of course\" Ginny replied \"Hermione, do you have that book order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione handed the book request over and Ginny also wrote a request to Madam Malkin's for a complete new wardrobe of girls' clothes for Harry. She passed these on to Hedwig and sent the bird on its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh incidentally, Ginny\" Hermione quieried then \"when did you want Harry to serve that detention you gave him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The detention of course\" Ginny nodded \"well there is no point in delaying it any longer than necessary. We may as well make it today, after lunch perhaps if Lauren is going to be instructing us in silent spellcasting this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should tell snape\" Emily advised, pointing out that their Potions Master wanted to be present so he could observe and offer his judgement over Harry's punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Emily, tell him it'll be at 1pm in the trophy room unless he has any objections. He is a professor after all, so he might be busy then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily made her way over to the staff table for a moment to speak with Snape who was at his usual seat, then returned a few moments later. \"Snape says he'll be there\" she confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the girls had all finished their breakfast and started talking amongst themselves about what to do next</span></div></div>",

In fact we have formed our own Girls' Academy\"<br>\r\n\"I am sure you have\" Lauren laughed \"would this academy of yours accept some teaching from a guest instructor?\"<br>\r\n\"That would be very kind of you, thanks\" Ginny responded for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, my first lesson will be on the use of non-verbal magic. Now as the name implies, non-verbal magic is spells that are cast with the wand but not spoken. Virtually any spell that can be cast by speaking the words can also be cast silently, but there is a technique to it which I shall teach you.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a lot of fun\" Sophie laughed \"we can curse Hariet and she wouldn't even know about it until the spell is coming towards her.\"<br>\r\n\"That is one of the greatest benefits of the technique\" Lauren nodded \"it is very difficult to counter a spell when you have no warning that it is coming.\"<br>\r\n\"So why are we taught to use magic with words if they are not needed, and even put the caster at a disadvantage?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n\"Because it is tough to learn how, and the words are still needed even if they aren't spoken. For a first year to master this skill is a rare gift indeed, but I have every faith that at least some of you will pick it up without any trouble and once some of you know, you can teach the rest, especially if you have created a society amongst yourselves for that very purpose.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Hermione can manage it at least\" Ginny nodded \"I've yet to see a spell that could beat her.\"<br>\r\n\"I have high hopes for Sophie too\" Hermione nodded \"she has enormous potential.\"<br>\r\n\"So what is involved in this spell casting without words?\" Ginny asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, first of all a wand you will notice is a bit of wood with a magical core. It contains magical potential which can be channeled by the spell caster. IT does not however have ears. It is not the spoken word itself that unleashes the spell, but the intent of the word, and true magic comes from within, not from the mouth.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Hermione mused \"I have always known at least some of what you are saying, but how do you give the word to the wand if you do not speak it?\"<br>\r\n\"It is a form of mental projection. You think the word at the same time you wave your wand and imagine the spell. You also increase your awareness of the wand you are holding and the word simply passes over. It can be quite a bit to get your head around but once you manage it you can apply the technique to any magic that can be performed with a wand. A true adept can even pass on the wand motions in the same way, merely point the wand at the target and bring the magic to bare with their own force of will. You will notice that some adult wizards don't spend time waving their wands or speaking the words when they cast their spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which spell should we practice with?\" Ginny asked her \"what is the best one to use.\"<br>\r\n\"Something simple to begin with I'd say, a spell you can cast without even trying. I take it you all know Lumos, and Nox?\"<br>\r\nThe girls all nodded at that.<br>\r\nThis is how it is done \"Lauren informed them \"waving her wand but keeping silent. The wand tip glowed from the Lumos spell even though she never spoke. A moment later she silently extinguished it with Nox.<br>\r\n\"Right\" I want you to think of yourselves casting that spell, think the word Lumos and how it is pronounced, imagine yourselves saying the word but don't speak it.\"<br>\r\nThey all did this without any effort.<br>\r\n\"Now think of the wand in your hand, be aware of its presence, of its length and of the power it holds. See it as a powerful magical object in your possession. If you master that then your wand will even feel a little different<br>\r\n\"That too, wasn't hard after a little practice. Hermione noticed that her wand seemed to pulse under the strength of its magic.<br>\r\n\"Now tries these two at once\" think of the spell, and be aware of your wand too.<br>\r\nThis was the tricky part. Hermione managed it quite quickly. The others took a little longer. Emily was having a little trouble focusing on two ideas at once.<br>\r\n\"This is not easy at all\" she commented<br>\r\n\"I said it was a little tricky\" Lauren replied \"but once you master that part, the rest is relatively straightforward.<br>\r\nShe tried a little longer, thinking she almost had it for a moment before the thoughts came apart in her mind.<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Lauren suggested they try applying it to the real spell. \"Now keep all this in your mind and wave your wand is though you are casting the Lumos spell.\"<br>\r\nHermione was the first to successfully cast the spell in this way, the tip of her wand glowing bright white. As an encore she attempted to apply the same technique to the reversal spell 'Nox' and the light went out.<br>\r\nSophie was the next to successfully cast Lumos, and a few moments later she also managed the second spell.<br>\r\nEmily was struggling with it all and Ginny wasn't pleased.<br>\r\n\"See yourself casting the spell, Ginny\" Hermione informed her \"but concentrate on your wand as you are doing it. Be aware of both the spell and your wand, open your mind and let the thoughts come together.\"<br>\r\nA few moments later Ginny too cast both spells successfully but Emily was still struggling.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll get it with practice\" Lauren assured her \"just keep at it.\"<br>\r\n\"Emily nodded, a little sadly but she was sure her friends would help her with it all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stood up then grabbed hold of Harry and threw him to the floor.<br>\r\n\"Have fun girls\" she advised them as she resumed her own seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry collapsed on the floor and Hermione cast her first non-verbal spell on him, she bound him securely in ropes that she produced from her wand.<br>\r\nFor the next hour or more the girls attempted their none-verbal spells. At first many of them had limited success but over time they grew more and more accomplished and Harry was soon being hit regularly by curses that he couldn't identify before they reached their mark. How on earth could he defend himself from these girls when he did not know what they were doing.<br>\r\nAt one point Sophie cast a non-verbal memory charm on Harry, erasing his memory of the instruction that Lauren had given them. He then had no idea how it was that they were able to keep cursing him without speaking the spell aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione seemed to be particularly skilled, it appeared that every non-verbal spell she tried was hitting its target. Sophie too was getting particularly accomplished, and Ginny's attempts whilst a little hit and miss seemed to be hitting far more than missing by the end of the session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne spell of Hermione's was particularly effective, it was a combination of three spells at once which was a devilishly tricky bit of magic at the best of times. She had combined a It was a combination of a tickling charm, a spell to induce heat into the target object and a curse that caused large red blisters and this spell was aimed not at Harry's head or chest, but between his legs.  Harry screamed in agony as the spell reached its mark, his cries echoing off the walls of the common room. Hermione looked immensely pleased with herself when she saw how effective her spell was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's greatest accomplishment was her signature spell, the Bat Bogey Hex which she cast again and again in an attempt to perfect her non-verbal variation. Her dedication to the task paid off as she was soon able to cast that spell with as much skill and force non-verbally as she could in its spoken form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie became so proficient at non-verbal spellcasting that, remembering what Lauren had told her about bringing the gesture and the words together in her mind so all she had to do was point and shoot, she managed to achieve what none of the rest of them had managed and was eventually firing her curses at Harry simply boy aiming her wand at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is incredible, Sophie\" Lauren congratulated her \"even I haven't mastered non-verbal spells at that level yet, and you are still a first year student. You have a bright future ahead of you my girl, a very bright future indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione beamed at her and then gave a look of mock regret. \"So much for my being the brightest witch of my age\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still are\" Sophie responded \"I am a year beneath you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that supposed to make me feel better?\" Hermione sulked, then she laughed out loud, embracing the younger girl in a fierce hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the girls had all decided to bring their practice to a conclusion, Harry was looking like the world had collapsed on him. Ginny cast one last non-verbal spell \"finite\" which cleared up most but not all of the scarring on his body. \"I guess we'd better start thinking about lunch\" Hermione suggested at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I see no problem with taking her there on a regular basis though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had wandered off for a while as they were talking, but she soon returned with the invisibility cloak, She handed it to Lauren who stood up, pulling Harry up with her, and covered him with his own cloak, reaching out and grasping his arm after she had done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does one find this room?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n\"Follow me, I'll take you to the space\" Lauren responded \"once there we need to walk back and forth past the place where the door is hidden three times, thinking intently about what we most want. She then gave a lengthy explanation of the room she felt would be ideally suited for Harry's purposes, then Hermione cast a memory charm on him so he would not remember the description or the instructions that Lauren had given. Lauren smiled at that.<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect\" Ginny grinned \"I can't wait to see it. Shall we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was they encountered nobody else as they were taking Harry to the location of this strange room, down one flight of stairs and across a corridor. When they got the the spot, Lauren reminded them to think about the room and they all walked back and forth until suddenly a door appeared before them. Harry was forced to walk as Lauren had not released her grip on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ginny who took hold of the door handle and opened the door, she nodded as they all stepped inside. The last girl to enter, Hermione in this case shut the door behind them which immediately disappeared, leaving an blank, solid wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the door?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door will be there again when we need it, but none of us wants to leave right now. If you want the door to return, it will come back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie silently asked for the door to return, merely for her own reassurance. Once she was sure it was there she didn't need it any more and it vanished again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room that they had created had mats laid out covering most of the floor, and a selection of comfortable looking chairs and a sofa against one wall. In one corner there stood a large metal cage, with a secure lock on the front. Although the cage was not locked, it was empty and it was certainly large enough to contain a Harry if they chose to shut him in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such a great room\" Lauren smiled \"it adapts to whatever the inhabitants needs are, so if we suddenly think of something else we want, it instantly appears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useful\" Sophie nodded \"but won't these things appear for Harry too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, one of the requirements I have made for this room is that it will only adapt to the demands of girls, it will ignore Harry completely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Harry is a girl\" Emily pointed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that, but somehow the room isn't aware of it. It will not listen to Harry, since we have not asked it do make an exception in his case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even better\" Ginny laughed \"so does that mean it won't bring the door back for him, even if he desperately wants to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if he is alone in here then he will remain here, the room will ignore him, he will be trapped inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now Harry is here with us, what shall we do?\" Ginny asked \"shall we play with her a bit or should we get some lunch and come back later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here now, if anyone is to get lunch then the rest of us can stay here with Hariet\" Ginny advised<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More wand work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could\" Hermione mused \"but we have been doing that a lot lately, perhaps this calls for a more physical punishment, and I think it would leave a more lasting impresion if it was carried out by those with whom she shared her dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I offer the job to you and Sophie\" Ginny offered \"if need be then Hermione and I will join in of course, but I am sure you can handle her on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am positive\" Emily grineed.<br>\r\n\"Me too\" Sophie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, indulge yourselves\" Ginny invited \"and by the way, feel free to break as many bones as you like but for my sake, try to keep her alive.\"<br>\r\nGinny got off his lap and moved to the next sat but she took out her wand and made a point of showing it to Harry.\" Incidentally, Hariet\" she warned \"if you make any move against either of my friends here, then Hermione or I will cast a Full Body Bind on you and at that point I will instruct the two of them to beat you to within an an inch of your life.\" Hermione also took out her wand at that point, ready to cast her spell upon Harry at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what was about to happen, but having seen two wands poited at him, feeling defenceless against the inevitable. Harry realsed he could do nothing to prevent these girls from carrying out Ginny's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie and Emily then both pulled Harry out of his chair, and whilst Sophie punched Harry squarely in the face, Emily drove her own fist into his chest. Harry felt the wind knocked out of him and he fell to the ground, then the two eleven year old girls dropped on him and started reigning blows to his head, his chest, and anywhere else they felt like hitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsmack smack smack smack smack smack smack slap smack slap, they hit hom over and over and over again. Sometimes they slapped their target spot, sometimes they closed their fist but on each occasion they put their full force behind their strikes. Sophie seemed content just to hit him randomly, but Emily had a nick for finding the same spot over and over again. Her fist impacted, drew back then reigned down on him agian, and every blow was more painful than the last, his body feeling like it was being split apart more and more by her constant barrage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sophie decided to take a break from hitting him, she started kicking him over and over, as hard as she could. When she did she paid particualr attention to his groin, and to attacking his chest and face. Each received a barrage of striles from both her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily also decdied to change tack at one point, instead of merely hitting him, she stomped upon evey part of him her foto could find. She particularly liked stepping on his chest and his face but if she found another suitable target she would attack that too. She heard cracking sounds from a number of the blows she had delivered to his chest, that clearly indicated that she had broken some of his ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first fiew minutes, Harry couldn't fight back even if he wanted too. His body cried out in agony and yet these girls kept up their assult for at least half an hour.Many of his bones were soon just as damaged as his ribs, icluding those in his arms and his legs, in fact if it wasn't for the fact that magical healing mighe eventually restore him, he would no doubt have lost the use of all of his limbs permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Sophie suggested that they should probably stop there as they were in serious danger of actually killing him.  Harry was in a sorry state at that point, slipping in and out of consciousness and in more agony than he had ever felt in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at him and nodded, but she delivered one final kick between his legs first. What do you say, Ginny?\" she asked then \"should we take Hariet here to the Hospital Wing or should we just leave her like this for a while?\"</span></div></div>",

During your stay at my house, Mom fed you a lot of food and I think you may have put on a bit much. You can afford to skip breakfast for a while\" said Ginny. Her real reasoning for having Harry skip breakfast was that Harry wouldn't have much energy to do well in his morning classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't breakfast supposed to be the most important meal of the day? Without breakfast, I'll not perform my best in class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:\"Please. You wouldn't do better in class if you had any breakfast. A failure like you wouldn't improve by getting some breakfast to start the day.\" said Ginny in a condescending voice. \"I laid out clothes for you on my bed\" said Ginny as she pointed to her bed where a girl's outfit was. The real difference between his old uniform and this uniform was instead of trousers, he had to wear a skirt and there was a pair of his new panties, this time it was light blue with flowers on it. Also on the bedd was pink nail polish and lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no no! I'm not wearing that!\" yelled Harry as he attempted to run out of the room, leaving him wide open for Ginny's body bind curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny spent the next thirty minutes painting Harry's fingernails and toenails pink, putting on pink lipstick, and getting her into her new uniform. After Ginny was done, she picked up her perfume that had a flowery scent and heavily sprayed Harry's outer robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!

Any more word of protest and you won't eat at lunchtime either, understood\" finished Ginny with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ginny\", said Harry in a defeated voice. He felt insecure as he felt his masculinity slip away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. It's time for History. Since all your stuff is still in your old room, I guess you'll have to share my books but in exchange you are in charge of carrying them\" ordered Ginny as she gave her supplies to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had no energy to protest further and took the supplies in his hands as he followed Ginny out of the 1st Year Girls Dorms.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ginny Weasley, 1st year Gryffindor of Hogwarts, was reevaluating her opinion of Harry Potter her first night at Hogwarts. Growing up, she had the image of Harry Potter as being this strong willed, super powered wizard who could defeat anyone in an instant, save for Dumbledore. After all, he defeated Voldemort when he was a baby, right? As a little girl, she wanted to be Harry's equal and marry him someday. Even though they were 10 years apart, she was closest to her oldest brother Bill. After he graduated from Hogwarts, he gave her all his school books from all 7 years to her to study and use at Hogwarts. Although the Defense books would likely change with the different DADA professors and she didn't have a wand to study, she read all her books so many times, she dreamt herself having a wand and practicing the movements she read in her books and making the potions as were instructed. She also dreamt of herself dueling equaling with the super-powered Harry from her dreams and him being so impressed, he would fall in love with her. To the shock of her family, she used Voldemort's name because she figured Harry would as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first met him, he had to ask her mom how to get onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. She herself had known that for years and been dreaming of going for years, yet Harry took his going to Hogwarts for granted by not being fully prepared. She dismissed this at the time, but then she learned from Hermione when she met her at Diagon Alley that Harry adopted Ron's laziness by not applying himself in school; her heart broke at that moment. Her dream Harry did not exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she thought back to why he suddenly appeared at her house during the summer. Her three brothers had to rescue him in the middle of the night from his house because he was locked up and nearly starved by his own relatives. How could the Boy-Who-Lived be so easily bulled by his own Muggle relatives? If he was that defenseless, could he even defend himself against wizards and witches? Again, after talking to Hermione who learned it from Harry's own mouth, the only reason he defeated Quirrell was because of his mother's protection, which was also how he survived Voldemort as a baby. She sobbed her heart out that night in bed that Harry Potter was no super wizard, just some mediocre at best wizard who got lucky. Despite that, it did not end her ambitions of being the top of her year, Prefect, Head Girl, and the most powerful witch in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of that day in Diagon Alley, she did not have to get secondhand stuff to the shock of her family. She stayed in contact with Bill, who she loved very much (and Bill loved her very much too), he even sent enough money for Ginny to get new school supplies (even an owl) and the new DADA books (although she could tell they were rubbish so she vowed to continue learning from Bill's DADA books as well). At Flourish and Blotts, she saw Lucius Malfoy grab one of her Lockhart books and throw it back in her basket. That night, she saw what appeared to be a diary in that particular Lockhart book.  Not trusting it due to Malfoy, she sent it with a note to Dumbledore using her new owl, which she named Billie since it is the female version of Bill, her favorite brother. She got a reply back saying it was a dark diary that once belonged to Tom Marvolo Riddle, the teenage Voldemort, and that it was destroyed. She was also told that her future house would get 100 points at the beginning of the school year and a Special Services Award for preventing a great tragedy happening via the diary.  She glowed with happiness at stopping Malfoy and Voldemort indirectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then thought back to the morning and how Harry and Ron stole her father\u2019s car to Hogwarts after not being able to get on the train. They were so stupid that they didn\u2019t use Harry\u2019s owl to send for help like she would have done. They were also spotted by Muggles and got the car wrecked; talk about losers. Growing up with Ron, she expected it from him and did not look down on him, but Harry was different since she used to have him on a pedestal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so disappointed in Harry that she decided that she was going to make him feel inferior to her. If she couldn\u2019t have Harry Potter as her equal and husband, then she\u2019d control him so dominantly that he may as well be her slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need to finish my homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want me off, then get me off yourself\u201d challenged Ginny. \u201cAnd why isn\u2019t this done already? And what you have done so far is so poorly written and researched. You\u2019re better off starting from scratch.\u201d And to demonstrate her point, she picked up Harry\u2019s parchments and tossed them into the fireplace right beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGinny!\u201d yelled Harry as he tried to get her off him but with no luck. \u201cDo you realize how long it took me to get that much done? And how long it\u2019ll take me to redo it all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should have already been done, Harry\u201d scolded Ginny. \u201cTell you what. If you can get me off you, I\u2019ll let you use some of my books that Bill gave me. He gave me all 7 years of his schoolbooks when he graduated as well as extra advanced books these past couple years that would work well as resources which I have brought with me. What do you say?\u201d smiled Ginny back at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said get off!\u201d yelled Harry, ignoring Ginny\u2019s offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d yelled Ginny as she leaned her head back so fast, she butted heads with Harry\u2019s forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! That hurts\u201d said Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not done yet\u201d said Ginny. She then grabbed both of Harry\u2019s arms and then pulled them forward so fast, that she heard Harry\u2019s shoulders pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! My shoulders!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny then for good measure rammed her elbow right into his stomach three times. She heard Harry moan as his head fell forward on her shoulder. She smiled at the pain he was in. She then shifted her body a bit so that her hands were on Harry\u2019s face. She leaned forward as if to kiss him but right before their lips met, she hacked a bit and spit some phlegm right into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwallow\u201d Ginny ordered. Harry looked at her in fear and did as he was told. Ginny laughed at her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Ginny.

Fine, that\u2019s all for tonight\u201d said Ginny as she shrugged her shoulders and got off Harry. \u201cGood night\u201d said Ginny in a sing-song voice as she went back to her dorm in a happy mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was so exhausted after Ginny\u2019s beat down that he just passed out for the night, with none of his summer homework done. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ron was by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a right mess, Harry\" Hermione commented, noting the unkept state of his robes and the fact that he had picked up a few bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did this to you?\" Ron asked, not even noticing that Harry had already named his attacker. Things always did trickle rather slowly into Ron's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny apparently\" Hermione on the other hand never missed a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny?\" Ron shook his head \"don't be daft Harry Gnny would never hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny had it\" Harry repeated \"last night she sat on me and beat me up/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sat on you?\" Hermione responded, half shocked and half amused at the same time \"are you comfortable, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfortable? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a simple queston Harry, but I can discover the answer easily enough. You don't mind do you, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind what?\" Harry had still not grasped her meaning but Hermione just turned around and sat in the chair that Harry was already occupying, settling her full weight onto him in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Harry. You are very comfortable\" Hermione smiled as she remained seated upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerrroofff, you fat lump!\" Harry cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't appreciate your tone, Harry. Hermione imformed him, putting even more pressure on his body by grinding down upon his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to push her off but he was having less luck shifting Hermione than he was when he tried to budge Ginny the previous evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, get her off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon shook his head and backed away. \"First you talk crap about my sister, then you insult Hermione\" he pointed out \"we're though. Hermione, he's all yours.\" Ron then walked over to the portrait hole, which opened to let him leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Ron\" Hermione nodded as Ron left. Once he was gone, Hermione continued \"so now you are all mine Hermione, or perhaps I will need to share you with Ginny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You believe me then, about Ginny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron's sister is a strong willed and capable girl. From the way you spoke to me after you told me you wouldn't mind having me sit on you, I wouldn't blame her for putting you in your place either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is nice of you to say, but they are just words. Perhaps after I have spoken with Ginny I'll decide whether or not to forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could take a while, I mean if you don't meet her at breakfast, we don't share classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Harry, she is still upstairs, she hasn't come down yet. I heard her moving about as I was passing her dorm room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can go up there and straighten this out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? Harry, you can't go up to our dorms and you know it. The staircase won't let you. There is nothing stopping me though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you go upstairs, I'll wander off for my breakfast. I don't want to be anywhere near Ginny when she comes down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Harry. You wil stay here, it isn't like I'll be gone for long. If I find out you were lying about her, I am sure we will both want to have words with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to just wait here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Harry, I don't\" Hermione replied as she took out her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That would be hilarious.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then got cleaned up for her first day of school and went to the Gryffindor Common Room. She smiled when she saw him in the exact same position as she left him. There were no written parchments so that told her he got no homework done. She smiled as she crept up to him and said \u201cWake up, you lazy bum!\u201d as she punched him in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat punch sent Harry back into the chair as he was breathing hard after getting the wind knocked out of him. He froze when he saw an angry Ginny about to hit him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m up! I\u2019m up!\u201d yelled Harry. Ginny already had her fist out so she punched Harry\u2019s right cheek for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet upstairs and cleaned up, you lazy bum. Breakfast will be starting soon and I don\u2019t want to miss getting my schedule.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry scrambled out of the chair and went upstairs to get cleaned up. When he got to his dorm, Ron was finishing getting cleaned up. \u201cWhere were you last night? And what happened to your face?\u201d Harry\u2019s right cheek looked a little red and a little blood was coming out of his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew that Ron would never believe that Ginny did it so he lied. \u201cI was just relaxing by the fire last night before I accidentally fell asleep. I guess I fell straight onto the table and I hurt myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch\u201d said Ron as he winced a bit. \u201cGet cleaned up and we can wait for Hermione and Ginny and we\u2019ll all go to breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGinny\u2019s already up. She saw me downstairs and woke me up actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice of her\u201d replied Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d trailed off Harry. He then headed towards the bathroom and got cleaned up. He rubbed his cheek as it still stung but he at least stopped the bleeding. What was going on with Ginny lately? She was a sweet girl when he saw her over the summer. Shaking his head, Harry got cleaned up and then dressed as he made it downstairs where he saw Ron, Hermione, and Ginny with all their books while his stuff was spread along the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Harry\u201d said a cheery Ginny. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that your stuff is here. Did you get all your homework done?\u201d she asked while putting Harry on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap! I fell asleep without getting it done!\u201d panicked Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t get it done? Come on, Harry. Even Ron got his done\u201d said Ginny in an exasperated voice that hid her condescending meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the Dursleys didn\u2019t\u201d started Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame others for this Harry. You spent a whole month at my and Ron\u2019s house. You had plenty of time to get it done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGinny\u2019s right, Harry. You have no one to blame but yourself\u201d said Hermione in a disappointed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he can do it at breakfast or something\u201d replied Ron. \u201cLet\u2019s go eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d said Ginny and Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry then gathered his books and was about to head out with them when Ginny interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry, can you please carry my books for me? Carrying all these books while at the same time trying to mesmerize my way to the Great Hall is a lot of work\u201d said Ginny as she then gave a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry figured that Ginny was actually ordering him to do it but hid it in the form of a sweet, innocent girl asking for his help. Not wanting a repeat of the night before, he merely said \u201cSure\u201d as Ginny then dumped all her books in his hands which were a lot of weight when combined with his books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Harry\u201d said Ginny as she then pecked the cheek she punched earlier to keep up her appearance. \u201cDon\u2019t fall to behind me okay? I don\u2019t want you falling and hurting yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yeah, right. You don\u2019t want me damaging your books by mistake is what you really mean\u2019 thought Harry as he struggled with the weight and walked behind Ginny as he was walking at a slower pace than her. Ginny, however, also saw it as Harry\u2019s rightful place to follow her and enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to breakfast, people greeted Harry but he was so busy trying not to drop Ginny\u2019s books, he didn\u2019t listen to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you holding up there, Harry? I could take a couple to relieve you if you want\u201d suggested Ginny in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no that\u2019s fine\u201d replied Harry. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so. Thank you so much\u201d said Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry, you are such a gentleman, you know that? Helping out Ginny on her first day like this. I\u2019m so proud of you\u201d said Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Hermione, but it\u2019s no big deal\u201d Harry said. Ron didn\u2019t say a word as he was daydreaming about breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they made it to the Great Hall.</span></div></div>",

Unbeknownst to them, all the professors heard them yelling and began whispering to each other, debating with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny, however, didn\u2019t want him to get either done so while she was eating, she kicked him hard on the leg whenever he started to write or eat; the left knee for eating, the right knee for writing. Every time she kicked, he either said \u201cOuch\u201d or tried to muffle his screams, which was then followed by a harder kick. Harry figured there would be bruising on his knees, if not scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, Harry?\u201d asked Ginny in fake concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew she was playing a game but also that he wouldn\u2019t rat her out so he replied \u201cI think I have a stomachache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA stomachache, Harry? Maybe you should go to the Hospital Wing? Madam Pomfrey can cure it in no time\u201d suggested Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Hospital Wing sounds like\u201d started Harry as Ginny interrupted with two of her hardest kicks which hurt so bad that he felt tears form in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like not a place I need to go to, Hermione\u201d finished Harry in a strained voice. \u201dTrust me. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure about this, Harry\u201d said a reluctant Hermione.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d repeated Harry and the subject was dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that, Neville came by to say hi before he sat with Dean and Seamus farther down the table. Ginny continued to kick Harry whenever he tried to eat or get homework done and he eventually stopped doing anything. That in turn just made Ginny kick him harder, which left no doubt anymore that there would be bruising and scarring on his legs after this. At a later time during breakfast, Professor McGonagall came by and gave everyone their schedules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see. We have Defense and Transfiguration today before Lunch followed by Charms. Tomorrow we have Herbology and Double History and the following day is Double Potions and Defense\u201d said Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about Hermione? I have Double Potions, Lunch, and Transfiguration today\u201d said Harry, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, so do I\u201d said Ginny. \u201cYou must have gotten the wrong schedule by mistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go ask Professor McGonagall\u201d said Harry as he got up slowly, his legs killing him. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny decided to come with him because they were done eating and bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor McGonagall, there is a mistake with my schedule\u201d started Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no mistake, Mr. Potter\u201d said a very angry Professor McGonagall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me put it a way that even you can understand, Potter\u201d replied Snape with a sneer. \u201cWe heard you from over here that you got none of your summer homework done. This level of pure laziness is unprecedented. Sure there have been many students in the past with unfinished essays, even 1 or 2 not done at all. But never has there been an instance where a student has done NONE of the essays, Potter. If it were up to me, I\u2019d have you expelled for this level of insubordination, but alas that\u2019s not the case. In exchange for you remaining at Hogwarts after not doing any of your summer homework, you have to redo your 1st year again. Maybe next time you\u2019ll rethink before skipping your homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious\u201d said Harry in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, Mr. Potter. I am very disappointed in you. Your belongings have already been moved to the 1st Year Boys dorm. Good day, Mr. Potter.\u201d said Professor McGonagall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny were speechless at the turn of events as they headed back to their table. Ginny was laughing inside her head; she had no idea that her actions last night would get Harry put down in her year! That would mean she\u2019d be spending a lot more time with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon patted his shoulder and said \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, mate. We\u2019ll still be best friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think so, Ron? Sure at first, you\u2019ll try to keep things the same, but over time, you\u2019re going to drift apart because you\u2019ll be limited on how much time you spend with Harry\u201d said Ginny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! We\u2019ll still be best friends, right Harry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Ron\u201d sad Harry. \u201cWhat about you, Hermione?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Harry. I\u2019ll try but Ginny has a point that eventually we could drift apart\u201d reasoned Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo add insult to injury, at that next moment, a Howler from Mrs. Weasley came at that moment blaming him and Ron for the car being spotted by Muggles and getting Mr. Weasley in trouble with the Ministry. Most everyone in the Hall was laughing at Ron and Harry at that point and it was time to head for the first class of the year.</span></div></div>",

Maybe someday\u201d she said in a flirty voice. She even reached for Harry\u2019s hand and gave it a gentle squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s it! I don\u2019t want to hear you two be flirty. Good bye\u201d said Ron as he stormed off. Harry had a feeling that he just lost a best friend in Ron at that moment. All because of Hermione\u2019s incorrect assumptions and Ginny\u2019s acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you two at lunch\u201d said Hermione as she was unsure of how to react to Ron\u2019s comments. She then followed Ron to DADA. As soon as she left, Ginny let go of Harry\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Harry. We don\u2019t want to be late for Professor Snape now do we?\u201d asked Ginny with a smile. \u201cIf you want, I can lead you to the dungeons with you telling me the directions so you can stare at me\u201d said Ginny in a teasing voice. She then took the lead and headed into the general direction of the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry merely grumbled to himself as he followed Ginny with all their books and telling her where to go. Occasionally, she would shake her ass a bit and ask Harry loudly with people around what he thought of it. Knowing he was trapped, he merely said it was fine which caused her to smile and people to laugh. By the end of lunch, the rumor mill would be that Harry was so in love with Ginny that he couldn\u2019t refuse her requests; others would insist that they were also dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they made it to Snape\u2019s classroom and Ginny loudly exclaimed that Harry was the perfect gentleman as she kissed his cheek again, which caused the girls to giggle. She even said that his infatuation with her must have been the real reason he didn\u2019t do his homework; he must have been too busy daydreaming about her and wanted to be in her year to spend more time with her; this just caused the girls to say \u201cAh! That\u2019s so sweet!\u201d as they settled in their seats, with Ginny sitting besides Harry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry then thought angrily about a two-faced girl that was gaining control of his life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harry was sat at the table, his plate empty, reaching over to add a few rashers of bacon from the serving plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one member of the family who was not yet sat at the table, but she was on her way. The young, red haired girl, Ginny came arrived, initially thinking this would be just another family breakfast. \"Has anyone seen my sweater?\" she asked her mother as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw that they had a guest, and smiling to herself she raised her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mrs Weasley answered her daughter's question, Harry suddenly felt himself gripped by pwerful magic which held him firmly to the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... ?\" he asked as Ginny waved her wand and Harry's chair scooted back about a foot. The bacon was now out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in wizarding robles, with her long red hair flowing down her back, Ginny walked forward to stand in front of Harry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry now noticed the girl for the first time, even from the back she was beauiful,with a wonderfully proportioned, feminine body.

In one of the compartments sat Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and a scruffy looking man that Hermione had identified as Professor R. J. Lupin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden though, the train started to slow down, and eventually it stopped. Ron asked what was going on, but Hermione and Harry shook their heads for they didn't have a clue. As for Lupin, he was clearly asleep and was in no position to offer a response. From the sudden increase in background noise and far off voices, it appeared that this group weren't the only ones who were asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the lights went out, plunging the train into darkness.<br>\r\nIn the confusion, their compartment door entered and footsteps came closer. Then harry suddenly felt a weight on top of him, somebody was sitting on him; he assumed it was unintentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here, I am here\" he informed the unknown someone.<br>\r\n\"Yes Harry, I know\" a familiar voice responded, then giggled. It was a female voice.<br>\r\n\"Ginny? Get off me!\"<br>\r\n\"No Harry, this is far too good an opportunity to just pass up\" she remained seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow, a sudden chill, ice spreading across the windows. There was a presence, an ominous and threatening presence nearby. The compartment door opened again, something dark and hooded entered and started to make a sucking noise, as though sucking the air, or something worse out of the vicinity. Harry felt voices, a woman's voice, a male, a scream, darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had fainted, with Ginny still sitting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came around, the sleeping man was awake. Professor Lupin was handing everyone chocolate and encouraging them to eat, saying they would feel better for it. Then he said he was needed elsewhere, and he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny now had the compartment to themselves. Harry and Ginny were still sharing the same seat, with him underneath.<br>\r\nThe light had returned by now, and they could clearly see one another. Harry could see Ginny's red hair and her back which was pressed against him. He could feel her sitting on him, sitting firmly with no intention of moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are weak, aren't you Harry\" Ginny commented, not moving from her position \"you actually passed out.\"<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help it, the cold, the voices.\"<br>\r\n\"I heard no voices, Harry. That must be in your head\" Ginny replied, cruelly \"Dementors are unpleasant, sure but nobody has ever passed out like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was twisting the facts, making it sound like Harry was worthless and by the way she was speaking to him, Harry started to wonder the same thing himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They both were sitting full weight on their seats and they knew that the two boys were theirs for the duration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were not talking about the boys though, they were talking about the summer and of shool work and Hermione was finding that Ginny was becoming a very powerful witch, with a mind that was almost as agile as her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the compartment door opened and Professor Lupin appeared once more. He took a look at the two girls who were now clearly sitting upon the boys in the carriage, and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember when Lily used to sit on me like that\" he mused \"such a kind, thoughtful girl; so few people ever knew that she had a dominant side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily?\" Ginny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry's mother. She used to sit on me in the same way that you are sitting on Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy it?\" Hermione queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at fist, but in time I learned to accept my place, under her. Now she is gone, I would give anything to spend just five more minutes as her seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as Harry will learn to accept his place under me\" Ginny nodded.T<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupin reached into one of his pockets, took out a photograph and handed it to Ginny. The picture showed a red haired girl who looked to be a third or fourth year student at the time. She was dressed in her Hogwarts robes and she was sitting on a boy who was clearly a younger version of the man who had given her the picture. The girl was smiling, and waving at Ginny. She was clearly enjoying sitting on the younger Lupin and she even go the impression that she didn't mind Ginny sitting on Harry either. Harry's own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which class is it you will be teaching, Professor?\" Hermione asked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defence Against the Dark Arts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are better than our last Defence teacher, he was useless.\" That was certainly a U-turn from the start of last year when Hermione thought Gilderoy Lockhart was the best thing since sliced bread. She had come to realise though how inept he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll enjoy my classes\" Lupin advised them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have my picture back now please?\" Lupin asked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you it back in exchange for a new picture, one of me and Harry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two new pictures\" Hermione corrected \"you do have a camera don't you professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupin nodded, opened his case and took out a wizarding camera. He then took pictures of Ginny and Hermione, clearly showing them sitting on their boy seats.  He handed these over to the girls and Ginny in return handed Lupin back his image of Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can have something to entertain me during my lessons\" Ginny sighed \"since I won't have the real Harry to sit upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be with Harry\" Hermione added \"but I doubt the professor will let me sit on him when we are in his class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a little unauthodox\" Lupin pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been studying, over the holidays Harry?\" Hermione asked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint response, barely legible from the way Ginny was pressed against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you have been\" Hermione added \"you don't want to be put back a year through lack of effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he is\" Ginny giggled \"that way he will be sharing his classes with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you may have heard, last year the end of year exams were cancelled due to the Chamber of Secrets issue being resolved so everyone moved on to the next year without being tested, save for the O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s students. Harry may have failed if the exams were in place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gong by the logic, you may have not passed the first year due to the possession of the teenager Voldemort causing problems for you. Yes, Professor Dumbledore told me the major things that have happened at Hogwarts the past 2 years and my predecessors those years. I'll test Harry and give my results to his head of house, Professor McGonagall, who by the way was head of house when I and the rest of my school friends were in school. But, I'll only do it if I test you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. While you have a point that I would've had a disadvantage had the exams occurred because of the effects of my possession, but I have more than made it up through self-study over the holidays. I'll take your test as well. By the way, did Professor McGonagall know about you and Lily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until our fifth year, when Lily and I were prefects and she caught us once when we were supposed to be patrolling the hallways at night. She didn't have a problem with it as long as it didn't affect our Prefect duties again. None of you are Prefects, so the only thing she might be worried about is Quidditch. She loves Quidditch and wants Gryffindor to win the Cup again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great at Quidditch, I practice in secret at home. I could maybe show Professor McGonagall that I'm a better Seeker. Well, that's for another time. Let's do the testing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Professor McGonagall tested Ginny and she passed his tests with flying colors. He even tested her on some material that she would learn in the first few months as a second year and she knew those spells too. He could definitely see that there was a lot of potential with Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then tested Harry as Ginny got off him so he could perform the tests. Harry failed miserably. Between Professor Lockhart's poor teaching and Harry's lazy study habits, he didn't remember much from his second year lessons. He even tested Harry on the same tests he gave Ginny for first year material and he barely passed those. If he had gotten just five more questions wrong, he would have failed those tests as well. He told Ginny and Hermione the results of his tests and they were shocked at Harry's performance. They didn't think he was this bad, but apparently he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the welcoming feast, I'll give Professor McGonagall my results. As I recall, she needs to speak with Hermione anyway due to her huge classload, so it should be a good time for her to give you her decision then as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, thanks a lot!\" said Ginny as she resumed her place on Harry.      </span></div></div>",

Even the second year material is above his level. I see however that your own talents are ahead of where most students would be at your level, so if you were to tutor Harry in your spare time then I could be persuaded to allow Harry to attend your lessons, for appearances sake of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand completely, professor. Would you mind if I made a suggestion though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you say. Harry won't understand the second year material, and so he isn't going to learn anything yet he will be taking up a seat in the class that could be occupied by another student.\" Lupin had said that McGonagall hadn't minded Lily sitting on him when they were both students at the school as long as it didn't interfere with their other duties, she was sure she could persuade McGonagall to turn the other cheek again, especially if she broached the subject in the right way. \"Instead of Harry taking up an extra seat and getting bored, perhaps I could be allowed to sit on him. Bored students typically disrupt lessons, and he won't really be there to learn. If he is my seat though, then I could make sure he doesn't cause trouble, then tutor him in first year spells afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a rather unusual request, Miss Weasley but I can understand your logic\" McGonagall mused \"Professor Lupin told me that he saw you sitting on Potter on the train, and now you wish to continue. I once caught Potter's mother sitting on the then-student Remus Lupin and yet they both excelled in their studies. Very well, Miss Weasley, you may sit on Harry during your lessons but I want to see clear evidence that he is learning his first year material or I may reconsider. If he doesn't pass his first year tests at the end of the school year then his place at the school will be withdrawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't anyong going to ask my opinion?\" Harry asked \"I am a boy, not a chair and I also have quidditch practice three evenings a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Harry, you are both\" Ginny responded \"you were my seat on the train and now you will continue to serve in that capacity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will no longer be concerned with quidditch practice sessions or matches, Potter\" McGonagall supplied \"you clearly can't afford to neglect your studies so your place on the Gryffindor team is hereby withdrawn. I shall inform Wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you also point out that I have been practicing in my spare time and that I would like to be considered for the team?\" Ginny added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unlike Potter, your school work is more than acceptable. Won't quidditch prevent you from tutoring Harry though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am sure Hermione can help with that role too. She can help train up Harry whilst I am busy on the pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Okay, if Miss Granger agrees then I will put your name forward. In the two years Potter has spent on the team, we have not won the cup. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure I can turn things around, Professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. I believe we are finished here Miss Weasley, If you would kindly take Harry with you to the Great Hall, I'll go and collect our new batch of first years who are no doubt eager to be sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny thanked the professor, then smiling she joined Hermione as they escorted Harry to the Great Hall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did McGonagall say?\" Hermione asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny explained everything, that Harry was having to relearn first year spells but that he would be attending classes with Ginny, who would sit on him during her lessons then tutor him afterwards. She also pointed out that Harry had been dropped from the quidditch team but that she would be considered if Hermione would agree to help tutor Harry when she was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'll help\" Hermione nodded, and Ginny smiled .Her place on the team was all but assured now. Wood would ask her to attend a try-out session of course but she was sure she would pass with flying colours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh incidentally Harry\" Ginny added \"when I do get on the team, I will of course need a broom.

A moment later she settled into place, sitting just as firmly upon her older brother as she did on Harry when she was on the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny!\" Ron gasped \"I'm your brother, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Sitting on you, of course\" Ginny replied as she continued to sit, bringing her full weight to bear upon him,<br>\r\n\"Hermione\" Ginny added \"you asked if Harry was comfortable, now you can discover just how comfortable he is. Will you please use him as your seat.\"<br>\r\n\"Certainly\" Hermione smiled, climbing over the bench and standing in front of the table, she stood far enough forward to allow enough room for Harry to claim the seat behind her \"take a seat Harry\" she instructed.<br>\r\nWhen Harry hesitated, Ginny pointed her wand at him. \"Sit or be cursed, Harry\" she advised. She knew that she was far more skilled in magic than he was, that had been proven. If she chose to use magic on him, he would be utterly defenceless.<br>\r\nHarry knew this too. He came forward and sat on the bench directly behind Hermione.<br>\r\n\"You can sit now, Hermione\" Ginny instructed<br>\r\nHermione did, sitting just as fully upon Harry as Ginny was sitting on Ron.<br>\r\nBoth girls sat on their seats in such a way that they blocked Harry's view of the front of the hall. Harry would not be able to watch the sorting.<br>\r\nHarry could certainly feel Hermione sitting on him, a girl who until recently had been his best friend was now simply using him as the lining of her seat. She was older than Ginny, and heavier. If Harry had felt that he had been trapped under Ginny, then he was truly Hermione's prisoner now.<br>\r\n\"I actually think he is a more comfortable seat than Ron\" Hermione commented.<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Ginny sighed \"I'll let you know in a couple of hours.\" She was sure that the sorting, feast and the rest would take at least that long and she was not going to move until everything was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorting wss now starting. A line of first year students had formed before the stool at the front of the Great Hall and just as it had always done, the sorting hat burst into song, describing its inception, the four founders and the four houses. The song was a new one, even if the the sentiment was the same. The hat loved to find new and inventive ways to say exactly the same thing each year, that was its crowning achievement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first students then came forward and were sorted. The hat placed them...<br>\r\nRavenclaw<br>\r\nHufflepuff<br>\r\nSlytherin<br>\r\nHufflepuff<br>\r\nGryffindor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis first new Gryffindor was a boy, Ginny and Hermione applauded of course as the boy took his place somewhere further down the table.<br>\r\n\"I wonder how many new girls we'll get\" Ginny mused \"I wonder what the first year girls will make of Harry, and the fact that he probably knows less about magic than they do.\"<br>\r\n\"It'll be interesting to find out\" Hermione nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hat continued to call out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlytherin<br>\r\nRavenclaw<br>\r\nRavenclaw<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen next name....Dawson, Gemma<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny looked towards the front as the girl's name was announced. A with long, dark hair and pale blue eyes came forward and took the seat. The hat was placed on her head, and a few moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGryffindor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny and Hermione applauded loudly as Gemma Ellis came over to the Gryffindor table and took a seat opposite Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Gryffindor\" Ginny greeted her \"I'm Ginny, this is Hermione.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you two sitting on boys?\" Gemma asked in a surprised voice.<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Hermione replied \"Ginny is sitting on her brother, Ron. My seat is called Harry Potter\"<br>\r\n\"Harry Potter? Really? The most famous boy in the wizarding world, and you are sitting on him.\"<br>\r\n\"He is overrated\" Ginny pointed out \"he is not that special, or powerful. He is pretty pathetic really.\"<br>\r\n\"How so? He can't be that bad, he defeated You Know Who.\"<br>\r\n\"No, he was beaten by some protective magic that Harry's mother had left him. Harry ddin't do a thing, how could he? He was just a baby.\"<br>\r\n\"I thought he most have some powerful magic or something.\"<br>\r\n\"Powerful Magic? Harry?\" Hermione laughed \"He's got as much magic as a stick. Professor McGonagall tested him when we arrived, he failed spectacularly. He hasn't even mastered first year spells that he should have learned two years ago. You could already be more powerful than him.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? Well I have been reading ahead, tried one or two spells from my books, had some good results too.\"<br>\r\n\"There you go, you are possibly stronger than Harry already\" Hermione smiled, feeling that she had met a kindred spirit; a student who had the sense to actually read their books.<br>\r\n\"I actually used to think Harry Potter was a hero, he's a fraud isn't he?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but he is a lovely, comfortable seat\" Hermione nodded<br>\r\n\"I'm sure\" Gemma giggled \"I suddenly have this overwhelming urge to practice some of these spells I've learned on a real target.\"<br>\r\n\"Not here\" Ginny advised \"it is far too crowded, we can meet up in the common room later and you can pit your talents against the famous Harry Potter.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sorting over the feast began and the girls started telling the two older girls about themselves as everyone but Harry and Ron ate.  After Hermione and Ginny ate as much as they wanted they allowed the two boys to eat the scraps off their plate causing the first years to laugh.  \"Man I can't believe anyone could ever consider Harry a hero,\" one of the girls said as the group agrees with her.  <br>\r\nGinny and Hermione looked around to see if anyone was paying attention before offering any of the first years a chance to use their seats causing the rest of the feast every couple of minutes the girls would switch to a new person using the two boys as their seats.  Not a single one of them, even Hermione,who usually paid almost attention, to the years announcements.  The boys were finally allowed up as the feast ended and Percy called the first years to him.  Ginny and Hermione took the boys' hands and lead them from the Great Hall and back to the common room.  Arriving before Percy and the first years Ginny and Hermione send Harry and Ron to bed and the boys so broken by this time after almost a full day of being the seats of the two girls went without protest.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it turned out, Ginny's first lesson would be Defence Against the Dark Arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would finally get to see if this Lupin was any better than her professor last year and of course Lupin would not object to her sitting on Harry since he had already seen her doing so and in fact he himself had also been a schoolgirl's seat during his time as a student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mr Potter\" the professor pretended to have just heard about Ginny's plans \"Professor McGonagall informs me that you shall be attending your classes as Miss Weasley's seat cushion.\" There was a giggle from near the front of the room, A blonde haired girl had clearly been entertained by the professor's remark. \"Why don't you bring Harry up here to the front, so the whole class can see you sitting on him?\" the professor suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny led Harry to a chair near the front of the classroom and forced him down into it. Harry could see that the blonde girl who had giggled was occupying the next seat along. With the professor nodding his approval, Ginny immediately took her place, settling into place once more upon the boy who was getting used to feeling her weight pressing down upon him. \"Hello Luna\" Ginny greeted the blonde girl. \"Hello Ginny, Hello Ginny's seat\" came the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was now being forcibly pressed into the seat by the red-haired girl who was sitting on him. She wasn't exactly heavy but she knew how to make her presence felt by her seat and it didn't even require any effort on her part. To Harry it felt like she was everywhere, owning him. He could not concentrate, could think of nothing other than the girl under whom he was now residing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lesson began, a number of things became evident to Ginny:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, she was pleased to see that this professor really did know his subject and she found the class to be both instructive and informative. As this was a lesson in which she was using her wand, it was an easy matter for her to point her wand back at her Harry-seat occasionally and cast memory charms. She knew that as he was buried under her, there was no way he could concentrate on the lesson but she also did not want him to accidentally learn any real magic. She fully intended to keep him ignorant of magic for the rest of his life. She was sure that between them, she and Hermione could find ways to fake his test results whenever they were needed.G<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing Ginny noticed was that whenever the professor looked her way, and he looked often, there was a lustful expression on his face, and she smiled softly to herself. She knew why the professor was looking at her that way too. She had seen the pictures in which he had been sat upon by a red haired girl; Harry's mother, and she too had red hair. The professor longed to be a girl's seat once more. Well, Ginny could certainly arrange that, but the middle of a lesson was perhaps not the proper time. Maybe.. later?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed this 'later' would not be happening for some time, as the lesson continued well over an hour and Ginny continued to sit on Harry for the entire class. Luna and GInny continued to talk together while they worked. \"I wonder why the professor keeps looking this way\" Luna mused \"do you think he wants to take Harry's place or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guarentee it\" Ginny answered, which actually surprised Luna but Ginny whispered a few things in her ear about what she had learned about Professor Lupin and Harry's mother,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is Harry in our lesson at all, isn't he a third year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was. Lupin and McGonagall tested him though, he failed and he was put back to first year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First year? He is that incompetent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently so. I told McGonagall I would tutor him on condition that I be allowed to sit on him during all of my classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains it then, will you tutor him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. All I've got to do is get him through his end of year exams. I'm sure we can put our heads together and find a way to accomplish that whilst keeping Harry clueless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure. Would you mind if I sat on Harry later? I've gotten rather tired of everyone picking on me. I've got this overwhelming desire to sit on boys now, one boy in particular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that can be arranged\" Ginny giggled \"perhaps you'd like to join us after the lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the class eventually drawn to a close, Ginny and Luna had performed the best of all the students and had earned themselves ten points each from the professor. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ginny was enjoying sitting on Harry and didn't want to move, and Luna had agreed to stay with her friend for she too had plans for Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ginny was preparing to leave, with Harry and Luna, the professor spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you stay a while, Miss Weasley\" he asked her \"you may leave if you wish Miss Lovegood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny, and Luny now had an idea of what the professor might ask, but Ginny decided to play dumb for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I in trouble, sir?\" she asked, feigning a timid voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you just earned all those house points, of course not. Actually, I have a rather special favour to ask of you... only?\" He glanced over at Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny told me about you, and Harry's mother professor\" Luna pointed out \"may I see the picture please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it wasn't quite a secret even in my day\" Lupin conceded, handing over the picture of Lily Potter sitting on his younger self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna noticed something else about the picture \"It was taken in this classroom wasn't it, professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just a few spaces away from where you and Ginny are sitting now. Here in fact.\" Lupin took a seat at the precise location as was shown in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are asking me to re-enact that picture with you, professor. You want me to sit on you as Lily did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, would you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I could, for a little while, I do have another class to get to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell professor Snape you are both excused from his lesson. I don't have any more classes until after lunch  I won't deprive either of you of your lunch break but we have an hour or more until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you are saying, can be arranged of course\" Ginny nodded \"but if you don't mind me saying, you were a student when that picture was taken but now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the front desk of my drawer, you will find a tankard containing a quantity of de-ageing potion. I was a few months younger than Lily at that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please take over with Harry?\" Ginny asked Luna. The blonde nodded and as Ginny got up and walked over to the professor's desk, Luna moved over and sat on Harry. She was pleased to see that the Boy Who Lived was just as comfortable as she had hoped he would be, and she settled into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had found the tankard, she took it over to the waiting professor who started drinking from it. \"I won't sit on you until you are younger than I am\" she advised, and the professor nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, the potion had taken effect. Lupin was now a young teen boy, slightly younger than Ginny. Before she sat she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there anything else Lily would do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she always used to relieve me of my wand.\" A quick Expellarmus sent Lupins wand rolling along the floor, out of his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny then turned around and sat down in the seat that her de-aged professor was now occupying. She looked across at Luna, but she had picked up a copy of The Quibbler and was reading it upside-down whilst still sitting upon Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGInny sat on Lupin in exactly the same way that she had sat on Harry just a short time ago. The professor could feel her presence upon him and he was reminded with the authority and assurance with which Lily had sat upon him all those years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was content.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Ginny and Luna continued to sit, keeping both Lupin and Harry buried firmly under their feminine backsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna bore down upon Harry with such force that Harry felt that he would be either be squished completely flat or that she would press him into the seat so that he and the chair would become fused together - posibly permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout her time at Hogwarts, Luna had been mocked, teased and bullied by the other students and whilst she seemed not to take any of their jibes personally, she was not as accepting as she had appeared on the outside and now she had found a boy she could use as payback for all the slights and insults that had been directed her way. Harry was her seat now and Luna was using every ounce of her being to show Harry just exactly what that meant. She wondered which of them would break first; the chair or the boy and she didn't seem to mind either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could feel himself being condensed, compressed, crushed under more pressure than he had ever experienced in his life, squished seemingly beyond endurance as Luna continued to own him - utterly. To any observer it would simply appear that the girl was sitting on his lap, but Luna know precisely what she was doing to Harry and she wholeheartedly approved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luna continued to sit on him, Harry noticed a couple of things about her. Firstly, she was warm. At times, it felt to Harry as though he was trapped in a greenhouse as her body heat radiated down to him. He started to sweat, and this in turn brought on a gradual thirst which grew steadily more pronounced as the minutes passed. If Luna was aware of this though, she showed no sign of caring. She simply continued to sit and Harry knew that he had no choice other than to suffer in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing Harry noticed was that Luna remained perfectly still while she sat. When Ginny had sat on him, he had felt an occasional slight movement from her as she adjusted her position but Luna had remained as still as a statue from the moment she had sat on him. She seemingly paid no attention to her either as she apparently ignored him and continued to study the magazine that she was reading upside-down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far away, Ginny was sitting on Professor Lupin, who had been reduced in age to a boy who was now both younger and smaller than she was. and she was loving it. Her ultimate plan for Harry was of course to dominate him so completely that he would be utterly submissive to her - a slave, effectively. Her professor however was clearly already much closer to that state already, perhaps even there now. She was sure that Harry's mother had not simply sat on him on a whim, and here he was now willingly submitting himself to a girl, even de-ageing himself so he would be even more completely at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would show him none. Lupin may technically be her professor, but as far as she was concerned, the leadership role was now reversed. He was her seat now, and she would use him as such, just as Lily had used him when he was a student at the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was a beautiful girl with long, deep red hair that hung loosely down her back. Both she and Luna were dressed in their Hogwarts uniforms which consisted of dark robes worn over skirts and tops. Ginny's pale thigh emerged from that skirt, close together and her knees bent over the front of Lupin's knees, hanging loosely but deliberately not touching the floor as she wanted to keep her full weight focussed upon the man-boy beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat, Ginny laid her hand gently in her own lap, and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could sit on you all day\" she spoke softly \"you'd like that wouldn't you Remus?\" She had somehow learned her professor's first name, but she did not reveal where she had picked up that bit of information. She didn't see any reason to reveal that to him. She had dropped the 'professor' since she was the one who was in charge now. She had intentionally used his first name, as Lupin was a young boy now, and younger boys should not be addressed in the same way as adults. She was using every advantage to show that Lupin's position was now well and truly beneath her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Lupin replied. From her position Ginny also felt a rising bulge in his trousers which clearly showed hat he was agreeing with her in more ways than one. All the better. The movement in his trousers was not that profound, as Lupin was a young boy now but it was enough to tell Ginny what she needed to know. She responded by pressing down even more firmly upon her 'seat, squashing the bulge back into place as she felt it had served its purpose now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny felt seriously empowered at this point, not merely because she had found a professor who was so submissive that he turned himself into her willing seat cushion. Lupin wanted to stay under her, and she started to think long-term about how she could use him to her advantage. He professor knew magic, more than any of her previous DADA professors had, he had demonstrated this in his lessons. In exchange for the promise of sitting on him she could force him to give her more lessons, even advanced classes so she could progress further in the subject than the other students. She could force him to give Gryffindor house points whenever she wanted... oh the possibilities. She could become more powerful than any witch at the school and she could guarantee Gryffindor won the house cup every year. The only question was how long that potion would last. Would it wear off eventually? She was sure she could get him to make more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know much about the potion Remus took?\" Ginny asked Luna, who was still sitting fully upon Harry. Luna was a Ravenclaw, and a bookworm. Perhaps she had come across the potion in a book somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Luna nodded, lowering The Qubbler a moment to speak with her friend. \"A dose lasts for about 90 minutes but there is a spell you can cast with your wand which will make the effect become permanent and no amount of ageing or de-ageing potion, spells or other magic will ever work again. He will remain forever as he is now, a man trapped inside the body of a boy, younger than both of us<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny smiled at keeping Lupin as a young boy that she could easily dominate. As a man, she knew she could help him to relive his childhood submissiveness but as a boy he would be putty in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know this spell?\" Ginny asked, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Would you like me to use it on him?\"</span></div></div>",

Lupin didn't look any different but from her position, seated on top of him. Ginny knew that something significant had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, he will continue to age as normal, at least inside\" Luna explained \"but from this moment on he will never appear any older than he does now, and no amount of ageing potions or spills will ever change that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what fun!\" Ginny exclaimed as she settled back into place upon her 'seat'. \"as the years pass, and he doesn't appear to age, he will feel my presence upon him more and more significantly. By my final year, he will be getting seriously squished, and I'll love every moment of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll probably enjoy that\"  Luna laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He already does\" Ginny nodded \"feeling the professor's approval pressing against her butt cheek \"which of course puts me in a wonderful position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to hold him to those conditions then?

In return, you will benefit from the promises I draw from Lupin as much as I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what shall we make him do for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters, if Lupin wants to continue to serve under me, which I am sure he does then he will provide both you and I will extra tuition.

Perhaps she could dominate him in other ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was though, Ginny wasn't given the chance. Professor Sprout wouldn't allow Harry into the greenhouses, stating that the plants were too dangerous for someone as inept as Harry and that he would have to take his classes with the first years. She wasn't being cruel, she pointed out that she was sorry that she had to take that line but that she had to take that line for Harry's own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had pointed out that this would mess with Harry's schedule, as he took his other classes with her but Professor Sprout pointed out that first and second years took Herbology and Potions at the same times and that it would be easiest if Harry took Potions and Herbology with the first years without too much disruption to his timetable. She wrote a note for Harry to give to Professor Snape explaining her recommendation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Harry wandered up the the castle and then down the stairs to the dungeons with the letter from Professor Sprout in his hand. He knocked on the door, which was opened by Professor Snape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Potter\" Snape remarked with a sneer, feeling sure that an opportunity to belittle Harry Potter was close at hand.<br>\r\n\"Professor Sprout has suggested I take classes with the first years, Sir\" Harry felt compelled to explain, handing over the note.<br>\r\nSnape only had to glance at the note before smiling broadly. \"I told you that you would never amount to anything, Potter\" he gloated \"I believe there is a spare seat next to Miss Dawson.\"<br>\r\nHarry nodded and went over to join Gemma Dawson.<br>\r\n\"So you are my plaything during Potions\" Gemma told him \"this lesson just got a whole lot more enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape then gave the class instructions on what potion they were to be making today, it was one of the first Potions was ever asked to make when he came to the school, and should be a walk over even for a first year student to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to do as the instructions told him, but he kept making mistakes, although not all of these were his fault. Gemma was sabotaging his potion as well when his back was turned, adding an extra root to the cauldron when he wasn't looking and stirring his cauldron in the wrong direction. She on the other hand was producing a perfect potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape wasn't pleased by Harry's efforts, he could see that he was failing badly. \"Potter, you will now drink the potion you just made\" he informed him when Harry had finally given up and extinguished his cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, and knowing that Snape would likely force him if he refused, he took a scoop of the mixture in his caudron, drank it and was promptly sick. Unfortunately he threw up over Snape's boots and the professor wasn't pleased. \"Detention, Potter\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then forced Harry to clean up his mess whilst Gemma watched and laughed. She took a sip of her own potion and it clearly had the desired effect as it was brewed perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is right you came back to the first year class\" Snape added \"as a first year girl is clearly far more skilled than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never was good at Potions\" Harry admitted \"I have more skill with my wand.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harry cast some spells towards her but she easily dodges to cast a simple spell and blast the wand out of Harry's hand.  Harry quickly goes after it but as he picks it up it feels wrong in his hands.  Thinking nothing of it he cast a spell he remembered from second year but the spell did not take form and only a pitiful display of yellow sparks shoot out of his wand.<br>\r\nGemma laughs as she toys with Harry casting the weakest spell she had but still making Harry's wand fly into a corner after each of her spells Harry's wand works less and less until not even sparks come out of it.  Seeing his wand was useless Harry runs forward to try to punch the younger girl.  Once again Gemma doges the blow and gives Harry an upper cut knocking him to the floor.  Feeling dazed Harry tries to get up but Gemma places a foot on his chest holding him down.  \"Now using muggle tactics during a wizard duel what a poor excuse of a wizard you are,\" Gemma said as the whole class of first years see the famous Harry Potter easily beaten by a girl in a duel who had not even been to any magic using classes yet.<br>\r\n\"Fifty points for Ms. Gemma but minus 10 points to Harry,\" Snape said clapping Harry's defeat with the rest of the class.

Anyway my first potion was perfectly brewed by comparison. Harry admitted he wasn't any good at the lesson, as though anyone needed reminding. He suggested that he was better at wand work.\"<br>\r\n\"So Snape tested him with his wand?\" Hermione nodded.<br>\r\n\"More than that, he said that Harry and I should duel.

Carry on, Gemma\"<br>\r\n\"When magic failed me, he tried to attack me phyiscally but I knocked him to the floor and stepped on his chest. Harry knows now that he is no match for me, and I am only a first year. \"<br>\r\n\"Good for you, girl\" Ginny approved.<br>\r\n\"That wasn't the end of the lesson though, we had another potion to brew but Snape had enough of Harry at that point.

Ginny had the pair bow to each other before they began; after the pair bowed they began to circle each other Harry had the mistaken thought that he could win this due to both his greater reach and what he thought was greater strength.

Hermione, Ginny and Gemma were among them. They were close but he could not tell what were they doing. Were they standing, or sitting down? Were they still in the common room or somewhere else? Harry could feel that he was laying down, face upwards on a soft carpet, but where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was also occupied, there was a presence upon it, the feeling of flesh pressing down upon him, his nose covered by what seemed to be a pair of panties. On either side of his head, what he could only assume were thighs squeezed against him, holding him upright and what could only be a girl's backside bore down relentlessly on his upturned face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nose was still broken, and as the girl's ass continued to own his face, the pressure on his broken nose alone was causing him a great deal of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother realisation suddenly struck him, he couldn't breathe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie smiled to herself. Shortly after knocking her boy unconscious with her final punch, she had dragged him out of the chair that the two of them had been occupying and pulled him onto the floor. Shortly after receiving high fives from the other girls, Hermione waved her wand, stopping Harry's bleading and clearing up any blood that remained, but not in any way healing his injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hermione\" Cassie approved, she did not relish the fact of staining her panties after all.  She knelt over Harry's sleeping face, holding her shirt out in all directions. She gripped his head between his thighs, and then she sat. Her skirt dropped into place around her, forming a tent that hid the boy's face from view and ensured that when Harry awoke, he would see nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Cassie as a not particularly tall, or heavy, she could still apply considerable pressure to her seat. When Harry awoke, he would not be able to budge her, she would make sure of that. As Harry's need to breathe became more desperate though, he started moving his legs frantically, trying to escape the young girl's prison but her perfect ass remained planted firmly upon his face, his struggles were futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did notice though that Harry had woken up, and with movements so slight she did not seem to be moving at all, she allowed Harry to draw a couple of breaths before she sealed his airway once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's awake\" Cassie remarked \"I should let the boy appreciate his priviliged position under me rather than just putting him back to sleep straight away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny laughed and took another picture. She was loving what Cassie was doing to her boy, perhaps when her own time came she could sit on his face for a while as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some time Cassie continued to sit on Harry's face, allowing him air very rarely. Air was a privilege, it was given at her whim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew that by now that it was Cassie who was smothering him, owning him with her perfect ass, and he did not know how long he continued to suffocate in pitch darkness beneath her.</span></div></div>",

Though she did not know of magic or how famous Harry Potter was a couple of days ago she had to admit she was loving Hogwarts.  This was mostly due to the fact that even in her normal school she was small for her age at only four feet and 2 inch tall and was picked on constantly even by younger male students it was nice to dominate not only an older male student but also a famous one who had evidently defeated a powerful dark wizard on multiple occasions.  Her parents were actually doctors so Cassie knew how much oxygen a person needed to stay conscious as well as how long they could go without getting brain damaged, she used both those facts to make sure Harry was just getting enough oxygen to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there the other girls were discussing how easy it had been to have Harry from his \"normal\" self to being the seat of the smallest witch at Hogwarts they begun to wonder if it was due to his background, Hermione and Ginny sharing with everyone about how he was treated at home, or if it was due to something else such as his gender.  Hermione purposed a test to see if it was due to gender by seeing if they could get another seat for another of their group, the rest agreed right away wanting the type of power Cassie had, for if they gained control of more males they could all get a personal seat or whatever they desired.  The group of the girls began to envision the whole house as female ruled full of male slaves/toys this was great due to the unbalanced natures of gender in the house for each year there were almost twice as many males as there were females so the girls could have multiple toys<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout this whole discussion Cassie began experimenting how long Harry could go without air enjoying his struggles, but finding that after a while they were distracting so she cast a leg locker curse on him while using her own legs to hold down his arms.  Cassie decided to do a real test to see how long Harry could go without any oxygen without passing out so seeing the clock she lifted up her ass from Harry's face a little giving him a free airway for about a minute before sitting back down with as much force as she could muster lodging Harry's broken nose right in the crack of her pantie covered ass.  Cassie than watches the clock until she feels Harry lose consciousness again.  Cassie smiled as she notes that Harry passes out after about four minutes nodding to herself she stands up to let him breath.  Turing around to look at the sleeping boy Cassie pulls out her wand and cast a spell that would make Harry as light as a feather before she bends down and picks him up placing his large form against her hip in a toddler carry before she heads to her dorm room.

Normally, after a boy had climbed two or three steps, the magical protection would kick in, the staircase would collapse into a slide and the naughty boy would fall back to the bottom. The staircase did not change though, and after Cassie had climbed 4 or 5 steps, with Harry held to her hip, she felt more and more confident that they would get to the top. Harry had no clue what was happening to him of course, he was out cold, having been smothered unconscious under Cassie's perfect ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared the top of the stairs, Cassie started speaking to Harry again, even though he knew that he was in no condition to respond. \"Well boy, it seems you will be staying with us girls from now on.\" The thought appealed to her. With Harry in her dorm, she could amuse herself at his expense in an environment where only girls were allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Harry still a boy? She wondered, should she still call him boy? Hogwarts had not invoked its restriction against boys entering the girls dorms, they were at the top of the stairs now, stepping onto the landing. One more step and there would be nothing to stop her from taking Harry into any of the rooms on this corridor. If Hogwarts no longer classified Harry as a boy, then perhaps he wasn't a boy any more. Was he some kind of hybrid; neither boy or girl, was he now a girl with a boy's body? What should she do about his balls? Should she let him keep them or should she destroy them? Only boys had balls and Harry was clearly no longer a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had stripped Harry of his magic, had she also disabused him of his masculinity. It certainly seemed that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made that final step, she was now on the girl's landing. They were on a corridor with pale pink flowery wallpaper. At intervals along the walls, wooden doors led into the different year groups' dorm rooms. The first door on the left said \"First Year Girls.\" Cassie opened it and led Harry inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a number of four poster beds in the room, each with curtains to provide extra privacy if required. Close to each bed was a chair, a chest of drawers and a wardrobe. The girl's trunks were also on the floor next their beds but Harry's trunk was not among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decorations in this room, as with the corridor were pink and feminine, there was a vase of flowers on the window ledge at the far end of the room, and a separate doorway over to the side led to a room where there was a bath/shower, a sink and a toilet. It appeared that the girls' dorms at least were en suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing, boy\" Cassie still used that name, even if only for convenience \"from now on you are forbidden to leave this room unless in the presence of and with the permission of a girl. You will be sleeping here from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry slept on.</span></div></div>",

As she laid Harry on the free bed Cassie decided to check to see if somehow she and the rest of the girls had magically changed Harry from being a boy or some other reason that allowed Harry to enter the girls' dorm tower.  She sees nothing different about Harry he still had balls, for the moment, and he was still a little bit endowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Cassie considered crushing Harry's worthless testicles but she realizes that the other girls might want to have fun with them so it was best to wait to find out if the others agreed with her before she completely emasculated Harry.  Cassie had to admit Harry did look kind of cute \"asleep\" on the bed as his body began to curl up and he started to suck his thumb like a baby, huh, maybe that was why the castle let him into the dorms for he may be a boy but he was not considered either a baby that needed to be watched or just a toy to be played with by his betters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cassie had been thinking this she had begun to walk around the room and not paying attention stubs her toe on a trunk.  Looking up she sees the trunk is at the foot of the bed she had placed Harry on which had not been there earlier.  Bending down Cassie opened the trunk to see it has different compartments in one there was baby clothes, another had very girlish outfits, and in a third it looked empty but large enough to stash Harry in side.  Thinking of that  it seemed as if the castle had given another sign of it approval for Harry to be there and gave a way the girls could go home taking Harry with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Harry still out Cassie decides to...</span></div></div>",

It would serve as a soft bed for Harry whenever she wanted it to. <br>\r\nShe was also a bit annoyed by the fact that she had stubbed her toe, and though she couldn't punish the trunk for such an action, she could easily force Harry to take the blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Harry did not deserve to sleep in a real bed ever again, maybe he could sleep in that trunk instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that the trunk also contained girls' clothes and baby clothes, but not boys clothes told her clearly that Harry would no longer require the clothes he was currently wearing. With him asleep on the bed, it was easy to start removing all the various articles of clothing he was wearing. As she was removing his trousers she checked his pocket, she found a number of coins; both wizarding and muggle, and his Gringotts key. She kept all of these for herself, Harry would not need them any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took about 3 minutes to strip him completely naked, then she deliberately ripped all his clothes to shreds, used her wand to levitate them to a spot about 4 feet from the ground, then with another wave of her wand, his shredded clothing burst into fire. It was a controlled fire though, it did not burn anything other than his clothing, and it left no ashes in its wake. By the time the flames died away, Harry's old clothes were no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell which made Harry as light as a feather was still in effect, so it was easy for Cassie to lift Harry off his bed and deposit his sleeping form in that empty compartment of his new trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then closed the lid of the trunk, turned the key in the lock, and then removed the key and stored it in her pocket along with her new money and Gringotts key. With a wave of her wand, she also made the key hole disappear.

Now as the second tallest boy in his year, only shorter than Dean Thomas, this first year girl was only chest high to him, but as soon as she was close enough her fist shot out connecting with his jaw and made him see stars for a moment.  As he was shook off the punch Lucy's hand shot out again and grabbed the wand from his front pocket.  \"Knock it off,\" Ron said as he made a grab for the wand only for Lucy to deftly step out of the way.  After a few more failed attempts to collect his wand from the first year girl Ron looks beseeching at Hermione, \"Mione make her give my wand back,\" Ron said with a slight whine in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is the big bad third year \"boy\" getting bullied by the little first year,\" Lucy said putting emphases on the word boy.  Getting really angry now Ron charges at Lucy who does a quick side step before kicking him right in his ass sending him to the floor at the feet of the smiling girls.  Ron looked up but even Hermione and Ginny seemed to like what Lucy was doing so he knew he would get no help there.  As he was climbing back to his feet Lucy jumped onto his back forcing him to the floor and despite their size difference Ron was unable to throw the small girl off.  \"Have you learned your lesson yet boy?\" Lucy asked as she began to bounce up and down on Ron's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off you little bitch,\" Ron said as he managed to raise himself a few inches off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty, naughty such language will get you punished,\" Lucy said as she grabs one of Ron's arms and pulls it harshly behind his back making the older boy fall face first into the floor.  Lucy began to exert pressure on the arm stretching it to its limit until she hears a small \"crack\" followed by Ron's muffled scream.  \"Do you give up boy?\" Lucy said letting go the now useless arm and placing her small delicate hands on his other one.  Ron answer was muffled by the floor so Lucy grabbed his hair and forced if off the floor.  \"What was that boy?\" Lucy said mockingly as the girls laughed as seeing another boy learn that they were nothing compared to any female even one years younger than him.  Ginny began to wonder if another first year girl could take down a seventh year boy such as her brother but was brought back by Ron's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I give up, please let me up,\" Ron said which lead to another round of laughter from the assembled girls as Lucy made a show of dusting her hands off as she got off Ron's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to show there is no hard feelings I ill give you your wand back,\" Lucy said making the other girls give her a confused look only to smile when she winked at them.  \"But I will return to beating the shit out your weak ass unless you take the wand in your hands and snap it right in half,\" Lucy said making Ron's face fall at the thought of losing yet another wand this time by his own hands.

This first year girl may have bested him physically but surely he was a wizard in more than just name, he had completed two full years at Hogwarts whereas this girl was surely just starting her magical education. Now she had foolishly decided to give him back his wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPayback time!<br>\r\nOr so he thought....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he had failed to take into account was that he had spent the bulk of those two years slacking off when he should have been studying, and this girl was more skilled with her wand than he had supposed, for reasons that would become clear in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon started off by trying to stun the girl, but Lucy had half expected him to try using magic and she quickly erected a shield with her own wand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disgusting lump of putrid troll dung!\" She cried out \"how dare you try to attack your betters! When I am done, you will be begging me to let you snap your wand so you can join the ranks of the forgotten squibs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy did not treat what followed as a duel in any sense of the word. A dual was fought on equal terms, with each side offering the other mutual respect. The boy had attacked her without warning, he did not deserve a dual. This would be a lesson, and one she was going to make sure the boy learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit him with a bat bogey hex that was so powerful that it even impressed Ginny. The bats that started flying out of Ron's nose were so large that they could have been mistaken for blackbirds. Ron screamed every time a new bat erupted, and there were soon so many flying about that one of the girls had to open a window before the room filled up with them.Ron's nose seemed to grow to five times its usual size as the bats forced their way through, and it was bleeding profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other spells as well. Lucy not only hit Ron with powerful and painful curses, she also played with him in fun and creative ways. A tickling charm which should have been no more than a minor irritation was aimed deliberately at his crotch. Any spell which causes irritation down there would always be noticeable and within seconds, Ron fell to the floor, writhing on the ground to try to relieve what amounted to a severe discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was able, he did try to cast spells of his own, but half of the time he couldn't even pronounce the words. Lucy laughed openly was he kept mangling the language, then educated him further by hitting him with the exact same curses he was trying on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's skin broke out in boils, blisters, burns and bruises. His eyes clouded over with conjunctivitis, she hit him with a leg locker curse and followed that up moments later with a spell that made him dance on the spot. The effect of Ron trying to dance with his feet stuck together made Lucy laugh all the harder. The cretin kept falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon became clear to all the girls that Ron was not only out of his depth, he was being held under the water by a girl who was not only superior to him, she was actually toying with him. Ron was nothing more than the play thing of a first year girl's extremely capable wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione in particular was impressed by how skilled a witch Lucy already was. \"Some of those spells are way beyond first year, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" she nodded \"my father is an auror and he has always told me that I should know how to look after myself. I first demonstrated magical ability at the age of three, so my family all knew I would be coming to Hogwarts. A year later, father bought be a toy wand and a large pile of books from Flourish and Blotts. It goes without saying that he encouraged me to study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're not Hermione's long lost sister?\" Ginny quipped, but Hermione just smiled. She was pleased to have found a kindred spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon lay whimpering on the ground, suffering from the effects of close to a hundred different spells whilst he had not managed to make a single one hit the first year girl who had clearly bested him. No, it was not that he was bested, he was not even defeated. Ron had been completely outclassed. </span></div></div>",

Lucy burst out laughing at the sight of him, and one of the girls gave her a high-five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's next, boy? Should I hang you from the ceiling of the common room and invite all the girls to play pinyata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Pinyata?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a game, where you hang a container of sweets from the ceiling, and a group of children try to break it apart with sticks \" she pointed out \"of course, our sticks have other uses, so I doubt any of you will need to actually club you with them, the magical effects will be more than sufficient, and highly entertaining for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon trembled in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or are you finally going to break your own wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked down at his wand, his trusty wand that marked him as a wizard. Without that wand, what was he? Lucy only called him boy, and he was sure the other girls would confirm that. Did he even have a name any more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at the one ray of hope he thought he might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny, please! Surely you aren't going to let her do this to your own brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my brother, boy\" Ginny replied \"you're nothing but Lucy's plaything, and play time will resume any time she feels like it.  I suggest you do what she says, It's up to you though, this pinyata game sounds like a lot of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid, Ginny. Of course you are my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny glanced at Lucy, who nodded in response. Ron was Lucy's plaything now so Ginny silently requested her approval before chastising the boy she had once called brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny then raised her wand, but Lucy shook her head. She pulled Ron to his feet, and pulled his hands behind his back. She pointed down at Ron's crotch and Ginny giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to her feet, walked over to her former brother and swung her knee... hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot once, not twice bur three times. Her knee connected with his balls each time, and Ron screamed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ginny went back to her seat, Lucy let go of Ron and he collapsed on the floor, writing in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now boy\" she told him \"if you still are a boy at this point, You will destroy your wand or we will play pinyata. I know Ginny will be a very enthusiastic participant in that game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny laughed and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSobbing, still laid on the floor, Ron took his wand in both hands and snapped it in half. The crack his wand made as it died resounded in his head, clearly signifying the end of his magical existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" he asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite yet\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What more do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take out the unicorn hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon sighed and did this, looking at the remaining magical element of his now-former wand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, now eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it, boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon put the unicorn hair in his mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chew, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now swallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-gulp-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your mouth, let me see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move your tongue, so I can see nothing his hiding in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon did, and Lucy could clearly see that he had indeed swallowed the magical element of his dead wand. Without the unicorn hair, it was noting more than a broken wooden tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give those to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon did so, and Lucy casually tossed them on the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are lying to you, and can not be trusted. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" Ron replied, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is important. You are weak, and incapable of using magic. I can protect you from them, so you must tell me. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So people don't make false connections, I am going to do something about your hair.\" Lucy remarked then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.\" Lucy pointed her own wand at Ron's hair spoke a couple of words under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colour slowly drained out of Ron's hair, over the course of about a minute, it changed from red to white. This wasn't the grey hair you might associate with the elderly, but rather the white of an albino. Another spell made sure that his now-white hair would make his hair repel any dye that might be applied. Ron would be stuck with white hair for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better\" Ginny approved.</span></div></div>",

She was in every way a stunning young woman, and right now she was using his face as her smother toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione relaxed an silently allowed her vagina and her butt to continue the task of smother the air out of her boy-victim's lungs.

Part of her actually wanted what she had warned Fred that she would do to him, although the thought of keeping this boy as her living slave had appealed to her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred started to think that Hermione might actually be serious. Was she about to do this, was she really going to kill most of his brain cells with her sublime ass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vagina and her ass sealed his airway shut once more, and this time Hermione sat even more firmly upon the boy as she had when she had given him the warning smother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had ignored the warning now, this was the real thing. She would not smother the boy to death, although she knew she could do so easily. She would bring him to the brink of death though, she would utterly destroy his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sat, and as she sat she forced Fred to smother beneath her. It would not take long before he started to struggle again, she knew that. She knew that his struggles would be just as futile as they were last time. She had him, she knew that and this time she would keep him under there for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she knew she would Fred started to writhe beneath her, but to no avail. Hermione was unmoving and unmovable. She remained seated and as she sat she waited patiently for his struggles to slow, to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they did. Fred's movements became slower and slower until eventually there was nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make sure that the boy was truly unconscious, she made a fist and drove it into Fred's chest. There was no repsonse, no outcry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione still waited, still continued to suffocate him. She was not done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne minute,,, two minutes... Hermione knew the timing would be crucial. Too soon and Fred may not suffer any lasting effects, too late and she would kill all of his brain cells. She didn't want that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked his pulse at regular intervals. She knew she could perform CPR if necessary, she hoped it wouldn't be needed. There was always the chance it wouldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt his pulse fading, it would stop any moment now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she arose and looked down at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were blank and unresponsive, almost dead. There was no sign of comprehension on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt for a pulse, checked his breathing. Both were fine. Fred was alive, but his vacant face seemed to suggest that whatever he was, perhaps it wasn't Fred any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around him, his eyes did not follow them. If they moved at all, it was a vague, he didn't appear to even be looking anywhere. Whatever movement was left in his eyes was entirely unccoordinated - as though he no longer knew how to control the muscles which directed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted him to his feet but he collapsed immediately. He did not even know how to stand, he had lost all control over his movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever any sound came from him it was gutteral, a single tone, meaningless. He could not only not contol his eyes and could not stand. He could not speak either. He was completely unaware of himself or his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alive, for sure but in all other respects he was gone. Whatever Fred had been, was no longer present in that husk of a form. He was no longer even a sentient being, for while he was conscious, there was no intelligence behind those eyes, no self awareness left within him. Whatever had made him a thinking, acting boy was no longer there. His essence, his soul as some call it had been extinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione snatched the boy's wand, snapped it in half and threw it in the fire. It would be of no use to him any more.</span></div></div>",

She did not need an unfettered George snooping where he had no business looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option was far more appetising, She would present George with the same two options, and then she would either have a willing plaything or another mindless nobody. Either way, George would no longer be a problem and she had to admit that she did love the feel of a boy smothering under her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was so worked up, he was almost waiting for her to make her move; and move she did. <br>\r\nThe boy didn't even notice the Expelliarmus that sent his wand flying across the room, Her second spell sent ropes shooting out of her wand, these ropes wrapped themselves around her target, binding him securely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she came forward and appled pressure to to his chest with his right hand that George finally realised that something strange was going on. \"What are you doing, Hermione?\" he asked her as his trussed-up body fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione came forward and squatted over George's face, her knees either side of his shoulders. She did not need to pin George's arms down as she had done with Fred, his arms were bound tightly to his sides. That was better in a way, she could focus all of her presence upon the boy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claiming my seat\" Hermione explained as she allowed her butt and her young womanhood to claim his mouth and nose respectively. \"My second seat actually\" she added, bringing her full weight to bear upon his face \"Fred was the first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo realisations hit George at that point. Firstly, with Hermione sitting so fully upon his face, he could not breathe at all. Secondly, it was Hermione who had done that to his brother, and now was the same thing about to happen to him. The colour drained from his face is the truth of his perilous situation struck home. He wanted to ask her 'why' but with no air able to enter or leave his mouth, no sound could escape his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione relaxed again and sat even more firmly upon the face beneath her skirt. She would not turn him into a vegetable just yet, the ultimatum would come soon enough, but if he didn't then surrender himself to her, he would indeed share his brother's fate. He would get one chance, and one alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little while to smother George to almost unconsciousness, but when she knew he was about to pass out, she lifted herself off his face only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your only choice, George\" she advised him as the boy gasped in desperately needed gulps of air with Hermione's butt still dangerously close to his face \"either surrender yourself to me and give your life entirely to my service, or continue to smother until you have no more of a mind than Fred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be highly pleasurable for her to destroy George's awareness as she had done with Fred. She had done it once before, she could do it again. She would recognise the signs, The would know when the moment came, she would wait for it and not stop smothering the boy until it happened.

From now on, all the boys are ours to do with as we please. This state of affairs will continue forever. The boys will all surrender their wands to us. They are no longer entitled to learn magic. We will use regular confundus charms to make sure the boys forget any magic they might have accidentally learned. Those of us who do not yet know the charm, will be shown by those girls who are competent with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all know that Sarah's boy is no longer the Head Boy and not a prefect. He will not be replaced. From today, Gryffindor will be given two female prefects, and I believe the role of Head Boy should be discontinued completely. As for the other houses, they are free to do as they wish of course but I do think it would be enjoyable for their girls if we encouraged them to follow our example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about when new girls and boys are sorted into Gryffindor?\" one of the girls asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls will join us of course\" Hermione added \"we will encourage them to each take their own picks from the new boys, and to ensure that no boy remains unclaimed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who are claimed will remain the property of the girl who owns them\" Hermione added \"we can gift our boys to each other, but we may not take a boy who is already taken. We can invite other girls to use our boys, on our own terms of course. The boy remains under control of the girl who owns him though, even if she shares him with many other girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys' dormitory will be stripped of all of its beds\" she continued \"boys are not entitled to sleep in beds any more. Their trunks and all their possessions will pass into the ownership of whichever girl he belongs to. His Gringotts key will also pass to her, and a letter will be sent to the bank, advising the goblins of the change of ownership of his account.\" The moment she said this, a number of girls felt that another key had magically entered their pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys will have new trunks\" Hermione added \"just as Cassie's boy has already. These will also have compartments large enough for the boy to fit inside. This is where they sleep, they key will be ours. Each trunk will bear the boy's own name. We can lock our boys inside whenever we want, and let them out at our convenience. Each boy, as he passes into our ownership will lose the right to a name of his own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the fat lady\" Hermione added, talking directly to the painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you approve of the new order in Gryffindor tower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\" the woman nodded \"I have always believed that men were inferior to women, you saw that brainless oaf outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, it was a highly entertaining scene. We do have a favour to ask of you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't bring real boys into my painting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, but I do think it is time that Gryffindor tower should have a new password don't you? One that is known only to the girls. After each year's sorting, this password shall be passed to the new girls at the table by the head girl, with strict instructions that no boy should ever hear it. If you hear a Gryffindor girl arriving with a boy in tow, you will let her whisper the password in your ear so she doesn't reveal it to the boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will work\" the Fat Lady added \"I thought you would suggest I let them in anyway, but there are ways for a witch to look like someone she is not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I've read about Polyjuice Poton,\" Hermione did not mention she had brewed the stuff last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On no account should a boy ever be allowed to enter or leave the tower without a girl\" Hermione added \"we will bring them in and take them out as we see fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can live with that\" the Fat Lady nodded. \"what about this new password?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The new password will be... \" Hermione smiled \"boys are chairs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, fat lady. That is all I ask of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to clear this all with Professor McGonagall of course\" the fat lady added \"I'll visit her painting in her office before I return to my own.

It seemed after being around magic for so long the castle had developed a form a semi-sentient and sensing that all the boys in one dorm had be depraved of magic by the girls it had acted by demolishing the male's dorm.  Hermione the only one who knew the truth behind this turn to the group of prostate males gather before he and the rest of the girls in the house.  \"Well it seems that Hogwarts also agrees that you boys are no longer worthy of being here this house is now female only and you are only for are amusement,\" Hermione said and to emphasis this she pointed out the House flag as it changed from a Lion to a Lioness with a cowering lion behind her.  The girls applauded as some of the boys began to cry such a seventh years who were just days into their last year losing their wands.  Every single female feels something appear in their pocket as they pull out a key, seeing the key the only male reacted was Ron as he was the only one who knew what it was to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith key in hand each of the girls took the boy they had claimed with Hermione lifting Fred and placing as if he was a baby to her side as she walked to her dorm.  At the foot of her bed there were two new trunks one was the magic truck Hogwarts had provided as a place to keep her boy while the other one used to belong to Fred.  Fred began to struggle as Hermione used one hand to open the boy trunk and placed him inside locking it.  With her boy in his trunk she began to go through his old possessions finding two items of interest.  The first being a fake wand which if the girls gave to the boys would let them keep it a secret, at least until they talked to the girls in the other houses, while the other was a warn old piece of parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing why the parchment was save Hermione pulled Fred out to ask about it.  At first Fred refused to answer but some time as Hermione's seat made him change his mind.  He revealed to her that it was a magic map of Hogwarts and showed her how to use it.  As she began to look at awe as the map came into being she saw to her delight all the boys' names of the house were clearly make meaning she could make sure that he was with their owner at all times.  One name gave her pause however and she went to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the first year dorm room Hermione spotted the trunk that had used to belong to Ron and went over to it.  After getting permission from Lucy she reached in and pulled out Scabbers looking again at the map to see that on it the rat had the name Peter Pettigrew as she recongized that name from her reading she kept a good grip on the rat and went right to Professor McGonagall to show her the rat and map.  The next day the headline of the Daily Prophet read Serious Black Innocent Dumbledore Under Question for Lying to Court and showed a picture of Hermione holding the rat and it transforming into Peter Pettigrew.  It seemed that Dumbledore had thirteen years ago had told the Wizard Courts that Sirius Black had been the Potter's Secret Keeper but it had actually been Peter who had lead to the death of the Potters.  With Peter alive and now under arrest Black was free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbeldore made a deal he would quietly retire, leaving Professor McGonagall as Head Mistress to a very different Hogwarts where girls held sway and boys were their toys, and in exchange he would tell all he knew of how Voldemort had survived.  Shortly afterwords the items keeping Voldemort alive were found and destroyed one after another until the dark wizard himself was found and placed under a complete lock down with the highest level spells and even a secret keeper who had their memory wiped to tie up all lose ends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione Granger was being herald of the hero of the Wizarding World for stopping Voldemort before another war could happen.  With Voldemort out of the way there was no eruptions to the school and Hermione passed top of the class, girls only of course.  She soon joined the Ministry of Magic and in record time became the youngest Minister of Magic ever.  With unprecedented support from her all female Cabinet she was able to pass some pretty wide spread laws such as freeing all House Elves in England while also enslaving all males to take their place.  Hermione also became Head Mistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft, and made some changes here as well such as males students were allowed but could only take beginning magic classes taught by first year girls, they would take these classes all seven years at Hogwarts.  As for Harry Potter he just became a forgotten footnote of history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this true mama?\" a girl asked her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is my sweet it is all thanks to Hermione, who you are named for that the peace that we know came to be,\" Cassie told her five year old daughter looking with pride as her daughter used her older brothers as a seat and footrest even thought they were fifteen and eighteen year old she had been sure to show them the place in the world and love seeing her daughter carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the books mama?\" Hermione asked bouncing up and down making her eighteen year old seat gasp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seemed that after he retired Dumbledore got drunk one night and ended up talking to a muggle woman and told her of his plan to defeat Voldemort the woman liked it so much she wrote the books based on what would have happened if his plan had actually happened,\" Cassie said grinding her ass into her toy-husband's face as if Harry Potter could have become anything more than just her plaything. </span></div></div>",

They'll give you the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Parvati smiled \"actually this doorway is by no means inviolate, to get through is relatively straightforward if you have a good mind and can think laterally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like a Ravenclaw\" Cassie grins as the boy walked past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. as you approach, it asks you a riddle. If you can answer correctly then the doorway opens. For a smart girl like yourself it is almost as easy to break into the Ravenclaw common room as it is to pay a visit to the Hufflepuffs. It is only our common room and that of the slytherins that require a password to gain entry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't the fact that I am wearing Gryffindor colours count against me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got in didn't i?\" Parvati pointed out \"Whilst the fat lady might not approve if someone wearing non-gryffindor colours approached, I don't think any of the other three entrances would even notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Parvati, you've been a great help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time. Anyway, I'll go and talk with the girls in our common room, find out what this big secret is all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah approached the entrance, she clearly heard a voice asking her a question....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are standing in a room, with an all South view. A bear walks past the window. What colour is the bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bear is white, it is a polar bear\" Sarah answered the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door before her opened and Sarah stepped into the Ravenclaw common room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah entered a room that was decorated in the Ravenclaw colours of blue and silver. Hung up on one wall was a large banner showing the representation of an eagle. There were blue armchairs dotted around the room and a number of these were occupied by girls, there were no boys in the room. In the corner, a couple of girls were busily engaged in a game of wizard chess. In one of the armchairs a blond haired girl was reading a magazine upside-down, and next to her was an Indian girl who Sarah assumed must be Parvati's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, one of the senior girls looked her way. \"Another Gryffindor girl enters our midst\" she commented \"who has the eagle caught in its talons this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Sarah, and I was hoping to speak with someone called Penelope, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penelope Clearwater, Ravenclaw Prefect\" Penelope pointed at the badge on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to talk with you about your boyfriend, Percy Weasley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this stage, that is debatable\" Penelope sniffed \"what has that pompous ass said this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've had a falling out, I take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's putting it mildly. I asked him a perfectly straightfoward question, and his response was \"You're a girl, you wouldn't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If any boy said that to me, I'd break him in half\" Sarah scowled \"prefect or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you're a bloodthirsty one aren't you\" Penelope giggled \"you want to break Percy? You're still a first year. I don't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me. I know of two other Gryffindor first years who have already educated older boys. Those boys are now safely locked away in their trunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a trunk? Your house-mates have been busy.\" Penelope laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now it is my turn. Will you give me Percy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's all yours, but first I think we should have a little, talk. Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, even though Percy is a seventh year, Percy is not the most competent of wizards. Not many people know this but one of the reasons he is attracted to positions of authority is because he feels that powerful people will protect him should the need arise. To this day he has never cast a successful patronus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see any reason to explain this to anyone else. If people see Percy as a powerful senior wizard and school prefect, then that will only escalate my status in their eyes when I make him my own personal toy and plaything. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point there\" Penelope nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy formally known as Harry was also once thought of as some great savior who took down a powerful dark wizard but really he is just a worthless time waster. When apparently-mighty boys fall, it can make such a satisfying noise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is one of the boys locked in that trunk, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the other is a ginger haired boy he used to hang around with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry and Ron, as they used to be called, now Percy? Are you going after Fred and George next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll leave them for Ginny and Hermione\" Sarah suggested \"they don't have any boy toys of their own yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, best not to be greedy after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can you tell me about Percy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a petty boot-licker. I grew sick of wiping the boot polish off his tongue whenever he came into contact with one of his idols.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon he will be tasting my boot polish\" Sarah asserted \"he'll probably choke on it, but I don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I saw his boggart once\" Penelope added \"it was an image of himself, only weak and powerless. Perhaps you could reintroduce that poor boggart, it must be pining for him by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see if I an arrange it\" Sarah chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A favour, by means of thanks for your handling of my former boyfriend... If Percy ever takes any house points away from you then talk to me, I will give you them right back and maybe a little extra by means of compensation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Penelope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and if he gives you detention, don't worry. I know Percy. He'll want to handle your detention himself, it is a measure of the authority he likes to throw around. I'm sure you can take advantage of such a situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me\" Sarah nodded \"if Percy wants to be alone with me then I'll teach him the gravity of his mistake. By the time I am done with him, he will never want to give me or any other girl detention ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope gave her a number of additional bits of information that Sarah felt sure she could use against him whenever she wanted, even if it wasn't part of the means by which she would break him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sarah smiled seeing a way to prove her superiority right away as well as make him giver her a detention so she could get him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you FUCKING RETARDED?\" she asked seeing a look of anger wash over her face.  \"Seriously I could have answered that when I was five, are you in the gifted program, is that what that silly little badge is for to let others know that you might need help?\" Sarah continued actually seeing Percy turn red in anger and begin to shake with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST TELL ME THE ANSWER,\" Percy said through gritted teath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer is man, oh and if you are looking for Penelope she said you guys are finished,\" Sarah said as the door hearing the answer begins to open which she shuts with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT ENOUGH YOU A GETTING DETENTION RIGHT NOW, FOLLOW ME,\" Percy said still gritting his teeth as he leads her back to Gryffindor Tower to find an empty room to hold detention in.

Percy immediately doubled over as he felt the wind being knocked out of him followed by a sudden sharp pain in the chest. She had not hit him with anything like her full strength, she had not even broken any of his ribs, although she could have done so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU?\" Percy half screamed and half gapsed \"I AM A PREFECT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some prefect\" Sarah scoffed \"you can't even stand up to a first year girl.

He stopped just out of reach of her hands thinking that with his larger size he could still strike if he wanted to, unfortunately, he completely forgot about her dangling feet.  With a smile of pure innocence on her face Sarah swung out her foot connecting solidly with Percy's groin.  Percy's eyes cross as he lets out a moan dropping to his knees with his hand help protectively over his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his second big mistake as it now put his face right at prefect level for Sarah's next kick.  Her small foot shot out and connected with the underside of his chin knocking him back into the second row of desk, actually sending him literally through the first row entirely.  Still smiling Sara hoped off the desk and strutted over to Percy who appeared to be knocked out.  \"Oh did I hurt you?\" Sarah said in a mock baby voice.  A moment latter she gave a shout of alarm as one of Percy's hands shot out and grabbed her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you won yet you little bitch,\" Percy said using Sarah's body to help him stand up trying to put as much force as he could onto the young girl who barely seem to notice and was now just looking at her nails as he struggled to stand.  When Percy placed a hand on her shoulder Sarah grabbed said hand squeezing his fingers together painfully as she effortlessly flips Percy back to the ground still holding his hand.  Placing a foot on his body Sarah begins to hyper-extend Percy's arm until they hear a loud \"Crack\" and Percy lets out a scream the the Bloody Baron would have approved of.  Letting go of his now useless arm and letting it flop onto Percy's heaving chest, Sarah easily flips Percy over so he was laying on his stomach.  Smiling she plops down hard on his back facing his legs grabbing one of them.  Sarah than harshly pulls the leg close to her as Percy whines, possible begging her to stop but due to his snobs and screams she could not tell, and not as if she would if he had bagged either for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing one of her feet on the back of his knee she gave a almighty tug hearing the whimpering Head Boy's knee shatter before letting it go as mangled at an odd angle.  \"Just to let you know I am not a mean person let me show you some magic I know,\" Sarah said and pointing her wand at Percy and performing a complicated spell she fix Percy's body fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know such a spell as a first year even I don't know how to do that?\" Percy wheezed rubbing his now healed arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that is simple I am a girl and you are nothing but a silly little boy,\" Sarah said thinking about the extra spell box she had talked her mother into getting her at Florits and Blots called \"1001 Spell Every Witch Should Know: That Wizards Can Never Learn\" it turned out to be a spell book that only females could see and made the most complicated spells easy to do so to prove to any male the truth of female superiority.  \"Here let me show you another spell I know,\" Sarah said and cast a spell that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah twirled her want in a way that Percy did not recognise, and spoke words that were unfamiliar to him. She then aimed her wand at him and a pale light struck the boy in the chest. That light showed Sarah that her spell had worked, now was the time to demonstrate its effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell itself had taken steps to disguise itself from male eyes and ears. The words Percy heard were not the ones that Sarah spoke, and would seem to chang each time the spell was cast. The motion of her wand seemed like an unidentifiable blur. The spell was a clever one, it would not show its effect until it was needed, but Sarah planned to show Percy those effects almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the spell had been cast, Sarah quickly slipped out of her panties before she seized Percy and pushed him back towards the teacher's desk. Before the boy realised what she was doing, she was bending his head back onto the desk, She then slipped her right foot over his body standing it on the floor on the other side of him. She also pushed her skirt out of the way with one hand, offering her a perfect view of her most intimate areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that spell, and what are you doing?\" Percy gasped as she pulled her butt cheeks apart and lowered it towards his waiting face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sitting on you of course\" she explained. She smiled as she felt that she had aimed her descent perfectly. His nose entered her pussy, wihich dutifully sealed him inside her, totally sealing that airway within her young womanhood. His mouth slipped between her butt cheeks, and once Sarah knew he was where she wanted him, she released her butt, allowing her ass to grip his face just as her vagina imprisoned his nose. There was no way that boy was ever going to get any air under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for that spell\" she added, focusing her full weight onto his face and forcibly crushing the boy beneath her \"you might want to consider that without it you would die under there. You may have noticed that you can't breathe at all. Your face is mine to use, and to crush, and I will continue to do so for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had lifted her feet off the floor, and every ounce of her being was sitting entirely upon the boy's face. That was part of the reason why she had chosen to sit on him on the teacher's desk. If she had sat on him on the floor then some of her weight would have been resting on the floor or upon him. This way she could focus solely upon his face. She had removed her panties so his face would be held inside, not merely under her, and that would provide an even stronger seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy started to struggle when he first tried to draw a breath, but couldn't. It was all to well her saying he wouldn't die, she was showing no sign of wanting to get up any time soon. He also was feeling a great soreness in his neck and upper back from the unnatural position in which his face was bent backwards on to the able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis struggles were futile of course, but Sarah allowed him to keep trying for a few minutes anyway. \"I imagine that back of yours is straining quite a bit\" she correctly surmised \"I suspect it'd take just a simple knock for your back to give way, for your spine to snap. To emphaise her point she punched him in the chest again. The loud crack she heard, told her she was right. Percy's arms and legs stopped moving and dropped uselessly to the floor. She had indeed broken his back, he was effectively paralyzed from the neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said\" she reminded him \"if I hadn't have cast that spell you would have smothered to death already. I wonder if you can work out why you haven't. Then again, I don't hold out any hope for you. You are a boy, and boys are dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell worked by creating the air that he needed to breathe directly within his lungs when he couldn't get it from outside. In the same way, the gases he would normally breathe out were magically vanished. He did not need to breathe, but his inbuilt natural responses would mean that his lungs would work normally when a supply of air was available from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was perfect for Sarah though, she didn't need to move at all, she could keep his face buried under her without having to concern herself with moving occasionally and letting him draw the odd life-sustaining breath, because he did not need to breathe at all in order to stay alive, and conscious. She could sit there for hours, days if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did in fact sit on him for an incredibly long time Percy did not know how long, he had lost track of time while his face continued to be submerged in this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know more spells than you, I am smarter and stronger than you\" Sarah mused at one point \"and the rest of the boys are no better. I really don't think Gryffindor needs a boy prefect, boys are totally unsuited for the role. I'd say that Gryffindor's second prefect position should be taken by another girl. Yes, two girl prefects would do a much better job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badge on Percy's chest which showed a large letter P turned bright pink at her words. Sarah smiled, yanked the badge from the boy's chest and affixed it to her own. \"My first act as Prefect is to award 100 points to Gryffindor house for the wonderful job the girls are doing, taking all the weak and pathetic boys for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, near the entrance hall, a large amount of sand dropped into the Gryffindor hourglass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for your being Head Boy\" she added \"if you are their standard bearer then the boys must be even more pathetic than I thought. I think it is time we eliminated the position of Head Boy, don't you?\" She pulled that badge off his chest too and threw it up in the air. The badge vanished in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now you are just like all the other boys\" she informed him \"only you will be my personal seat, and plaything - forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah relaxed and continued to crush her boy's face under her ass and pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though she diceded to get up. She lifted the still-conscious boy to his feet and attached a collar and leash to his neck a a sign of her ownership of him.</span></div></div>",

Sarah also knew it would be more fun I Percy was not paralyzed so she once again healed her toy and even allowed him stand up. Sarah fingered the leash liking it more as Percy tried to regain some of his dignity, \"fat chance of that,\" she thought by standing at his full height which was a at least a good foot and a half taller than she was, but with his collar it was plain to see who was the one in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling sweetly she harshly tugs the leash forcing Percy to fall to his hands and knees.  Seeing him like this Sarah gets a wonderful idea and with a flick of her wand makes his clothing vanish apart from a speedo she magicked on him for her pleasure.  Sarah than hoped onto his back almost forcing him to the floor before she taps on the collar which transforms instantly into a bit one would used on a horse.  Sarah leans down and lifts the bit into Percy's mouth which she gets him to open by grinding her knees painfully into his sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bit secured in the former Head Boy's mouth Sarah made him walk around like the beast he was guided by the bit in his mouth.  When he did not move fast enough she would use the leash and whip his body until he speed up to the speed she wanted.  After Sarah had Percy going at a good trot she harshly pulled back on the bit forcing him to stop.  \"You know this is quite fun you would have thought that as a Seventh Year you would not have been so easily tamed by a first year but here we are,\" Sarah said making Percy begin walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a hour of riding Percy around the room Sarah got off the abused boy who immediately collapses due to exhaustion.  \"You know there is just one thing missing,\" Sarah said with a smile as she lowers the speedo covering Percy's ass and began to trace a design of the female symbol with a small male symbol inside its circle.  After tracing the design Sarah cast the spell branding Percy with the symbol so he would always know his ass belonged to a member or the Superior Sex.</span></div></div>",

There were shouts of protest from a number of boys who blamed Percy for allowing a first year girl to treat him with such indignity Some of those boys were greeted with knees to the groin or slaps in the face as Sarah passed them.

They all wanded to hear what kinds of fun she had been having with her boy over the last few hours, how she had tamed him so completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have taken his Prefect badge\" Hermione commented, nothing seemed to slip past her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My badge now\" Sarah nodded \"the first thing I did when I pinned it on my chest was to award Gryffindor 100 points. She didn't know if her attempt to give her house more points was successful or not though, but apparently it had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wondered where those extra points came from\" spoke a second year girl who had arrived just a few minutes ago \"I saw the Gryffindor total rising significantly as I was passing the hourglasses an hour or so ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, she really was Prefect now. Only prefects and professors had the pwoer to award house points after all. She was sure that the girls would all be interested in her story, but she decided to make herself comfortable while she told it by forcing her boy onto an empty chair and sitting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gave the girls an account of the ways in which she had been controlling her boy during her apparent detention, and when she described the spell she had cast which meant Percy didn't have to breathe any more, then how she had sat on his face for over 3 hours without moving, Hermione applauded her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd like to try that one on a boy myself\" she mused \"I'd make him spend an entire day with his face buried under my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we all would\" Cassie giggled \"it sounds like a lot of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His manner was so rude that unlike other males who had seen Percy walked like a dog by a first year who offered Sarah scorn as soon as Cormac saw Sarah using Percy as her seat he let out a deep belly laugh.  In fact the only thing he had going for him was his body which was quite muscular and if stories were true, though Hermione could not confirm them for she could find no one who would have admitted to going out with him, was that Cormac was hung like a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this boy need to be brought down Hermione sufficiently ruffled herself and marched towards his hulking form.  Placing her hands on her hips she looked into his face and scowled.  \"Now why would you laugh at someone who has found happiness?\" Hermione asked while mentally adding \"and her new pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh chill out doll-face nothing but a laugh to see a seventh year sissy taken down by some first year slut, if he was any real man he would have her begging for mercy not being her seat,\" Cormac said not overly impressed with what he saw before him as he placed a meating hand on Hermione's shoulder.  Sarah almost got off of her seat only for Ginny to place a calming hand on her giving a quick shake of the head and a wink letting her know Hermione could handle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think a real man would not have been taken down by a silly little girl?\" Hermione asked letting an edge slip into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right doll-face now a real man takes control of his bitch,\" Cormac said as he runs his hand down Hermione's back and gives her ass a pinch.  In what appeared to be a blur Cormac was on the ground his hand stretch behind his back as Hermione applied pressure to his fingers whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a real man takes what he wants for a lowly little female, well I guess you are not one as this female could beat the shit out of you with out any magic,\" Hermione said and to emphasis her point she places a foot on Cormac's back forcing his upper body into the floor while still holding his arm locked in a finger hold.  Hermione than let go of Cormac's fingers and with a slight kick pushes the hulking boy away making the girls in the audience, and even some boys, cheer as he goes skidding across the floor.  Completely red face in a mixture of shame and anger Cormac...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cormac clearly had some physical strength, but nothing else to support it. He showed little sign of intelligence, coordination or strategy.It was often the case with overly muscular boys, that ll that body mass seemed to compress the brain. The boy had strength but little in the way of mental ability. Hermione was of course not only the smartest witch of her age, but she was more than capable of holding her end of a fight. The outcome would be inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would make the matter even more certain was that Hemrione; ever the bookworm, had read the same book as Sarah, she knew of a multitude of spells that girls knew that boys would never learn, including a spell to heal any injury that she might inflict upon the boy before her. With that in mind, she could do whatever she wanted to him, heal him then do it again at her leisure. She knew that it would only be a matter of time before Cormac was putty in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac, it appeared was not capable of thinking rationally. The girl had attacked him, and from his point of view that gave him all the justification he needed to put the girl in her place. He believed himself physically stronger than any girl, and with his limited mental capacity, that was all the justification he needed to assume that he could assault this particular girl and put her in her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take some time before the boy would finally realise the depth of his miscalculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Hermione had attacked her, he simply saw red, and without even trying to think of a strategy he charged her as a bull charges a red cloth, thinking his muscles would speak for themselves. Hermione of course suspected that he would come, he was a muscle bound idiot and his complete lack of tactics confirmed everything she knew about him. She was ready, As he tried to drive his fist into her face, she simply grabbed his arm and give it a sharp twist, breaking his wrist as she drove her own fist into his chest, not only once but repeatedly, eventually driving him back several feet but not before she had broken a couple of ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac was right handed, and he suddenly found it harder to make a first with that hand. He switched to his left, but he had far less control there. Hermione had not counted on Cormac not being ambidextrous, but she knew that many people favoured one hand over the other, and she suspected he would come at her with his preferred choice first. When he came at her with his left hand, he found it more difficult to aim at his target and simply relied on his physical strength. That proved a mistake, the boy's swings with his left arm often fell short of his mark, and even those that were aimed at her, Hermione could easily deflect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you even land one punch on me?\" she taunted him \"if you could, I might consider that you were worthy of some respect, if not then you are clearly as weak as all the other boys and deserving of the same fate. Hermione knew of course that a muscular idiot like Cormac need only be deprived of his physical advantage and he would belong to her. She knew that she was more than capable of owning the boy, and that soon her would be hers to use as she chose. The fun partwas of course the breaking of the boy and Hermione was more than happy to entertain herself at the boy's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer challenge was more than enough to provoke fire in the boy's none-existent mind, Cormac continued to come at her, and every time he did, she drove her fists into his face, his body, and every part of him that was available. Sometimes she knocked him back with a single punch, on other occasions he received several blows before he was knocked out of the range of her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was enjoying herself enormously. She knew that a boy like Cormac, who valued his physical strength above his magical ability would continue to try the same attack over and over again, not matter how futle. He would only revert to his wand if he had no other option, that was fine though. She knew she was a match for him in magic as well as fighting ability. She was not only a strong girl, she had a mind, she could watch the boy's strategy and have a counter move in place even before he attacked her.  It wasn't much longer before a sold blow broke the boy's left arm, meaning he had to rely on his already-broken right wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last assaults were completely ineffective. With his wrist broken, he couldn't even form a proper fist, and every time he came close, Hermione simply responded with another barrage of punches. Hermione had hardly moved at all, Cormac just kept coming at her, and she was enjoying beating him down. It wasn't until she had broken both his arms and shattered almost all of his, causing so much damage to his chest that she could crush his heart or lungs with a single well-aimed punch that Cormac realised that his frontal assault was totally ineffective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Hermione had not broken his legs yet. Perhaps she was allowing him to keep his legs in tact, knowing that he would use them to keep coming to her and receive a beating. Why use them if she didn't have to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly you are no match for me, boy\" she told him, finally \"now either accept that you are inferior to me and that I own you, or prepare to be beaten to within an inch of your life.\"</span></div></div>",

However, he surprised her by using a spell she was not expecting one that completely healed his body.  Hermione was initially shocked that he would know such an advanced spell but after a moment she came to realized that since he saw his physical powers as the highest zenith of his abilities he would of course know a spell which healed him so he could go back to fighting.  With a smirk on his face he put his wand away and went back to his attack changing his strategy a little by using both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that helps me from having to heal your worthless ass,\" Hermione said actually impressed with his plan, and decided a little victory.  Snarling Cormac performs an obvious fake but she pretends to fall for hit allowing her right in the stomach.  She even plays along by taking a couple of steps back and sees him smile as if he had proved a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac feeling good about his hit makes another one but his mouth falls open as Hermione seeing it coming braces her stomach.  Hermione barely felt the blow while Cormac cried out his hand breaking again as he felt like he had just punched a steel beam.  As Hermione proved she could actually take his punches Cormac falls to his knees nursing his twice broken hand.  Hermione smiling sweetly performs a spin bringing up her leg and kicks Cormac square in the head knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  Ladies we have a winner,\" Cassie said acting like the referee at a lice fight even going over to hold Hermione's arm in the air as the other girls burst out in laughter at another boy brought down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whilst Cormac was out cold, Hermione took out her wand, and waited. She had proved, twice now that he could not match her in a physical fight, and yet he had already performed one spell during their combat when he healed himself.  She knew that in order to show Cormac that we was totally inferior to her in every way, she would have to best him with magic, as well as her fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had little doubt of what the outcome of such a dual would be, she was known as the brightest witch of her age, she had mastered every spell she had ever come across, including a number that she knew no boy would ever learn for she too had read that book of spells that witches could perform but wizards would never understand; the one Sarah had mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cormac awoke, he saw Hermione, wand in hand, standing a few feet away from him. \"Well, boy\" she told him as he rose to his feet \"we now both know that I can beat the living crap out of you any time I want. Whatever physical strength you thought you had is no match for me at all. Now you will either accept yourself as my inferior and accept my total authority over you, or will you try to assert yourself in some other fashion? A battle of wands perhaps? At this stage, I would say that magic is your last hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac sighed, he knew magic. He had healed himself the first time Hermione had knocked him down, he had a wand in his pocket. He took it out, and nodded. He was a boy, he had to be better than any girl. He would surely not only defeat this girl, he would destroy her towering reputation at the same time, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not count on Hermione's encyclopedic knowledge of magic, nor did he have any idea that she knew spells that he could not possibly understand. Hermione had also studied ahead, she knew spells beyond her years and had even looked into some NEWT level magic. She could, for example, cast spells without speaking them aloud. This was a skill most people would not even read about until they came to their NEWTs, and it gave her a significant advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cormac tried to fire curses at her, he spoke the words of the spells as he cast them. Hermione's extremely agile mind  therefore knew every spell he was attempting before he completed it, and could easily counter everything he did. He could not land even a single spell upon her, she responded with counter curses and specific shields without speaking a single word. Cormac did not even know what spells she was casting, all he saw was bursts of energy spouting from her wand occasionally. As time passed he started to become more and more frustrated, his movements frenzied. He started to lose his concentration, his own spell attempts started to fail on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione, of course was simply playing with him. She had not cast a single curse, yet. She didn't have to. She was happily watching him, forcing him to wear himself down until eventually his shoulders slumped in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she went on the offensive, still not uttering a word, she unleashed a barrage of truly unpleasant curses in succession, which tied her victim in knots, literally. Her wand twisted his body into the most unnatural shapes, caused sores, and blisters to burst all over his body, she caused such painful aches and itches all over him that he nearly scratched off his own skin in an attempt to alleviate the suffering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well boy\" she commented at that point \"it is clear to me that your skill in magic is even weaker than your fighting ability. At least you were able to land a punch, for all the good it did you. I think it is time I took care of your wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she cast her 'expelliarmus\" she spoke the word aloud, the first spell she had spoken aloud since their contest started, and why not? She wanted the boy to see exactly what she was doing, and she knew that with that string of curses still ravaging his male body, there was not a thing he could do to counter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy,s wand few towards her. She took hold of it for a moment before she snapped it in half and threw it in the fire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did, however, want to do things a little differently so showing off some of her hidden strength she lifted and carried Cormac over to where he friends were, all of which except for Ginny were using their boys as seats.  Smiling she approached her chair and draped Cormac over it so his face was at the seat and his lower body would be behind her head.  Smiling Hermione sat down hard onto Cormac's face as she banged her head backwards into his unprotected crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis action caused her new seat to move so with a sigh of frustration she took out her wand and cast a spell that would bind his body to the chair yet would allow her as the caster to move his body and have it stay where she left it.  She informed the others about this so Cormac could hear what had been done to him and proved it by grabbing Cormac's head and forcing it between her perfect thighs and into her crotch before letting it go.  It seemed as though Cormac wanted to have his face burring in her panties for he did not move it though in truth he was trying to break the spell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Cormac where he was meant to be Hermione went back to talking about random stuff with Ginny and their new friends, every once and a while squeezing her thighs around Cormac's head.  The topic of the conversation instantly went to helping Ginny find her own boy and asking the fiery red-head who she would want.  \"Well I did have a crush on Harry but as we have already crushed him and Cassie has claimed him I think it would be rude and male like to try to take him.  Also I like the idea of his supposed strength and seeing him submit so easily, even faster than Ron and Percy,\" Ginny said nodding to her two older brothers under their first year Mistress, \"well it made me change my mind.\"  It was than that Hermione remembered she had not cast the un-breathable hex on Cormac and quickly cast it which she saw was a good thing as he was turning blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if not Harry who would you love to be the guide of into a males true purpose of life?\" Cassie asked grinding her perfect ass into Harry and for the first time actually using his birth name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is a good question for I have had my eyes one two boys.  There is Oliver Wood who is another Seventh Year boy and heads the Quidditch team, but the only thing is unlike Percy he is actually quite nice and kind to everyone except when he is playing Quidditch,\" Ginny said kicking Percy's leg in frustration making him whimper and Sarah just laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is the other one?\" Hermione asked as she grinded her head into Cormac's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after the trip on the Hogwarts Express two days ago I sort of like Prof. Lupin,\" Ginny confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow a student controlling a teach would be showing female strength more than a First Year owning the previous Seventh Year Head Boy,' Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that he may knows spells even I don't,\" Hermione said ever the logical one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he is still a male and as we have all proven males are nothing compared to any female,\" Lucy pointed out as she stamped hard on her boy's foot making Ron whimper just like his older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will go after....</span></div></div>",

Smiling sweetly she easily scores not one but five goals in a row.  \"Wow that was impressive,\" Oliver said wiping the sweat out of his eyes.  \"Now lets see if you block as well as you score.\"  Oliver than tried as hard as he could to but no matter how hard he tried he could not get the ball past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of solid failure Oliver finally called it quits and went to get the snitch.  \"Now here is the real test after all if you take Harry's place you should be good at catching the snitch,\" Oliver said releasing the little ball.  In less time that Harry would have taken Ginny not only caught the snitch but let it go gave it head start and caught it again. \"Impressive,\" Oliver said as she caught the snitch for a third time in ten minutes.  \"Only one last thing thing to try,\" Oliver said tossing her a Beater's bat before he let the Beater Ball out of confinement.  The ball went zooming right at Ginny she smiled as almost with out aiming she stuck the ball sending it right back to Oliver.  Given not time to dodge the ball knocked Oliver right off the his broom sending the Seventh Year plummeting.  Not wanting to Oliver to get killed Ginny pulls out her wand and stops his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding as softly as a feather Ginny went to check on Oliver to see that he was out of it due to the blow.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whilst Wood was still out cold, Ginny laid her broom gently on his back, along his body so the tail end was level with his knees. She used her wand to perform a leg locker curse but she did not bind him to the wand. She felt her demonstration would be far more effective if she did not attach him to the broom, but instead forced him to feel a constant fear of falling to his death.She could dominate him far more completely if Wood thought she might release him and let him die at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted both her broom and Wood's body into the air, keeping the one held tightly against the other, she stood with her legs on either side of her broom, as she would whenever she mounted it, with the broom just inches from her perfect ass. Before she took off, she wrapped her legs around both Oliver and the broom, and gripped him tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rose into the air, she used her thighs to grip the boy firmly and keep him pressed into her broom, and yet Ginny as so skilled as a flyer she could control her broom just as well with her passenger as she could without one. She rose high into the air, with Wood still gripped tightly to the underside of her broom, face downward so the boy would have a perfect view of the ground below as she continued to ride her Wood-broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up after Ginny had completed around 20 laps of the pitch, and his first reaction was to scream in total fear as he saw the ground race by around 100 feet below him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny, what are ypi doing?\" Wood demanded of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bringing you along for a ride. How can you be a quidditch captain and not enjoy a ride on a broomstick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fall\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will if I release you, yes. You have fallen once already, next time I might not catch you. We'd better make sure I've got a good strong grip, just to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny held Wood firmly between her thighs, and squeezed... hard. Oliver feared that one of his ribs might give way from the pressure, but she wasn't squeezing him quite that hard, yet..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaagh, Ginny. You're crushing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather I let go? She relaxed her grip to emphasise her words, but still held him firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I'll just have to maintain my grip then.\" She reapplied the pressure as she continued to fly around the pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me down, please. You are scaring me to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you wanted me to keep you here. If I drop you at this height, I am fairly sure the fall will kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't drop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then. I believe now would be a wonderful time for us to discuss my position on the team, especially since we now know your life is now in my hands, or rather my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, You are on the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the new seeker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny considered whether she should also push for the captain's position at this point, but she thought that the three female chasers might take offensive if a new girl joined the team and took the captain position without consulting them first. She didn't really care whether or not she put Fred and George's noses out of joint, that would happen later anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Oliver. Now that I am on the team, I'll make your position a little more comfortable... for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny relaxed her grip on the boy a little, but still held him firm by gripping her ankles together. The extra space the position offered though, allowed her to rotate both the boy and the broom whilst she was still riding. The boy was now laid on top of the broom, with GInny's ass directly above him. She quickly sat, pressing the boy into the broom with her ass and resumed her tight grip around his body with her thighs whilst she continued to circle the pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least now, Oliver felt the reassurance of the broom beneath him whilst he remained held firm in GInny's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGInny grinned as she continued to ride, Oliver was a delightful extension to her broom and a perfectly comfortable seat cushion at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tightening her legs on boy and broom Ginny started to go through a couple of loops on the broom with each rotation making her slide up and down on Wood's body her breast basically beating him up a little.  After the fifth loop Ginny straightened out and went back to a normal riding posture.  Looking down she saw that her boobs had given Wood a black eye during her maneuvers as well as making his nose bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny why are you doing this you are already on the team let me go,\" Oliver said trying to order the second year girl who had made him a seat cushion on her broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer to why I am doing this is actually quite simple I needed a boy of my own as my friend had theirs I wanted one with some power behind him and the Captain of the house's Qudditch team was who I picked so while I let you remain Captain and come up with your silly little plays, off the pitch you are mine to do with as I will,\" Ginny said and to prove she was in control made the broom hoover as she unwrapped her legs and got to her feet on top of the broom and boy, one foot resting on Wood's crotch the other on his face.  Ginny than began to control the broom like a muggle skateboard with shifts in her stance to get it flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny rode the broom like this for almost half a hour before she stopped it on a dime and sat back down on Wood's body.  Ginny was amazed as she sat back down to feel that Wood had gotten hard from that mode of broom control.  \"So I see my little cappie likes it when I take control,\" Ginny said pinching Wood's cheek before harshly slapping him and raising a bruise.  Wood blushed and could not admit that he was being turned on by this when Ginny grabbed his face and made him look in her eyes, \"When I ask you a question you need to respond boy or you will be punished don't make me ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ginny I liked it,\" Wood said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(SMACK) \"You do no have the right to use my name it is either Mistress or Miss Seeker to you,\" Ginny said laying down the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress,\" Wood said blushing at having to call a girl five years his junior Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" Ginny said adjusting her body to bring the broom into land.

Fred was securely attached to Katie Bell's broom whilst Angelina Johnson was riding her other twin brother, George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ginny\" Katie greeted her, not even offering a backward glance at Wood, who had slipped off his broom, and was waiting quietly on the ground, awaiting Ginny's next instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had heard rumours that the girls had taken over the common room\" Angelina explained \"we found such ideas entertaining but we've not been in the common room yet.

Angelina nodded and slapped George sharply across the face. \"Respect your betters\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGInny wasn't satisfied with just as slap though. \"Whilst you are having your chaser practice, make sure this one gets struck in the face with a bludger\" she advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Fred exclained, earning him a slap from Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of them\" Ginny instructed \"two bludgers each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Ginny\" Angelina and Kaire nodded in unison.

The three of them had a fun time flying around the pitch as Ginny taught the two older girls some maneuvers that scared the absolute shit out of her former older brothers while Angelina and Katie gave her some pointers as how to control Oliver better due to their size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some fun just flying around the three girls started to actually practice with Ginny heading towards the goal post and Angelina and Katie trying to score one beater ball was set lose.  As the girls had the Beaters attached to their brooms there was no one to bat them away, but the girls had an easy solution for that for the one who was not trying to score would be on look out and warn the others if a ball was headed their way.  When a ball got close to any of the girls they would shift their body's so that the boy they were using as a seat cushion would be on the other side of the broom an let the take the hit, usually accompanied by a lot of whining.  Ginny had the same strategy when she would block a shot switching Wood to be under her broom and letting his body block the Chaser's goals, who after the first time seeing it would throw the ball with as much force as they could muster and began to aim as well hitting either Wood's face or crotch with every goal attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a hour and a half practice the girls decided to call it a night and head down to the team's locker room as the three boys were all bruised and bloodied from their time being seats and guards for their former teammates.  When they reached the ground the girls lifted their brooms over their shoulder not even bothering to remove the boy and walked to the locker room each saying how much fun that practice was compared to normal.  When they got into the locker room the girls propped the boy brooms on the bench as they began to take off their sweaty clothing in preparation for a nice shower when they are rudely interrupted by one of their broom, \"Okay you had your fun not get us off these fucking things.\"  It did not matter who had said it as it earned each of them a nice hard punch to the face from their girls and with a giggle Ginny gagged Wood with her sweaty panties and liking the idea Angelina and Katie followed suit to Fred and George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the boys bound to the broom and gagged with their panties the girls went to the showers to further discuss the practice. As Angelina and Katie have not had such a good practice in such a long time which was both fun and filled with good teamwork it was soon decided that Ginny would be the Captain in all but name while Wood would still keep the badge it was already obvious that Ginny was the one in control.  \"Though it would be nice if we could find some new members of the right sex so we could actually use are cushions during an actual game,\" Katie commented as the three walked out of the shower drying off their hair.

They didn't have to go far either, the shed was only a short distance away from the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My first act as unofficial captain will to give all the girls on the team new brooms\" Ginny explained \"we'll all be riding firebolts for out next practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind me saying this, but you can't afford to buy us all firebolts\" Angelina pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be paying for them, Cassie will. I am sure you all know her boy, the one with the lightning bolt scar. Well she looks after his Gringotts vault now, and there is a fortune in galleons in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie will do that for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she will\" Ginny nodded \"she is happy to spend her boy's money on things that us girls need or want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much, I'd love to ride a firebolt.

With this in mind, for her very next act she was going to force her boy to give her pleasure. She dragged him back towards the chair she had been occupying when he came into the room and commanded him to kneel down in front of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, as Hermione had beaten him three times; twice physically, and then in a test of magic, he dared not disobey her. He felt sure that any defiance would result in him getting his ass handed to him again. At this point, he no longer had a wand, he was utterly defenseless and he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cormac knelt, as Hermione had instructed, she slpped out of her panties and took a seat in the chair, keeping her legs open so Cormac could see her naked crotch right in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come forward, boy\" she told him, come forward and plant your face in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Cormac was compelled to obey, he edged forward until her felt his face rubbing against the girl's womanhood, Hermione turned his head so he was looking directly forward and his mouth was pressed against her young womanhood, then she pulled his face in tight, she wrapped her thighs around his head, crossed her knees and squeezed his face in tight against her, so tight that Cormac found his face pressed deep into her pussy, gripped so tightly that he had no hope of movement at all, and no possibility of any air passing into or out of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione held him like that for some time, deliberately suffocating him. She knew the spell that would enable the boy to survive without air, but she wasn't about to cast it yet. She was going to wait until the boy was on the absolute brink of passing out before she finally decided to keep him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only at the moment when Cormac genuinely felt that he was on the brink of death that Hermione cast the spell and the boy, whilst still unable to breathe, was finally able to keep on going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cormac could realise that he had apparently been given a reprieve of sorts, Hermione spoke to him. \"Boy, how long do you think you can carry on without air? I strongly recommend that you get to work with your tongue, you are not going anywhere until I am satisfied with your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made no indication of what her criteria for satisfaction would be, how long he would have to keep servicing her until she was happy. That was a matter for her to decide, but she was knew that the boy's service of her womanhood was going to have to be extensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac, thinking his life depended on him doing as Hermione asked, extended his tongue and started licking her her womanhood. this elicited a soft gasp from Hemrione but nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the best you can do, boy?\" she asked him \"I guess your face will be staying there forever then. Either get your tongue in nice and deep and make me oh so happy, or start coming to terms with your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac started to extend his tongue in moved it in deeper, tasting of her, Every time his tongue touched her most sensitive spot, she sighed contentedly. \"Better boy, keep going, lap it all up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac tried to go in deeper, but was limited by the range of his tongue. Hermione assisted there by casting a spell which made his tongue grow to several times its normal size, and now the boy was able to go in deeper. He sucked and slurped at the inner reaches of her crotch, and Hermione was feeling flashes of electricity pass through her at his every ministration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she was starting to experience her first orgasm, she let out a loud cry as her vagina convulsed and sprayed its contents onto the face that was pressed firmly against its entrance. She would not be satisfied with just one though, she soon experienced another, then another and each was accompanied by a jet of spray hitting the boy's face. The more frequently the boy brought her to orgasm, the faster and harder they came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not the orgasms themselves that were causing Hemrione such great satisfaction, it was the fact that she was forcing the boy to service her on her own terms. Once Cormac realised that his only option was to do exactly as Hermione willed him to do, and to service her whims, she knew she would have him. His will would be broken and he would be hers to command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter over an hour of forcing the boy to continually eat her out, she noticed his posture drop into a submissive position. His shoulders slumped, his body lay limp and low as he continued to lick at her. He continued to lick at her just as vigorously as ever but Hermione could see that he had no fight left in him, the boy was hers, now and forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally restored his tongue to its original size, and told the boy he could stop, his tongue was so sore that he could harly move it. It was actually painful for him to commit the simple act of pulling his tongue back into his own mouth. His body remained just as slumped and submissive however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then released the boy from the grip of her thighs and stood up. Putting her panties back on, she looked down at the boy who as still kneeling on the floor at her feet, smiling as she saw that his face was literally drenched in her juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another wave of her wand, those pussy juices soaked themselves into his skin, they would never wash off. With her pussy, she had now literally left her mark upon him, permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After she healed him she cast a spell that bound his legs together as well as locking his arms to his body while still allowing him to move his head.  Smiling sweetly down at him Hermione bends down taking off her shoes and socks lets her toes stretch.  Still smiling she steps onto Cormac's large form and begins to pace back and forth on his body all the while humming the tune of \"These Boots are Made for Walking\" taking great pleasure as she stomped hard on his nose, breaking it, and standing there for a moment letting his face take her full weight before she would walk back down his body stomping the whole way.  She would turn around at his crotch stepping harshly on it and doing a little pirouette in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione paced back and forth on Cormac's body for a good twenty minutes even though after ten he passed out due to the pain when something strange happened.  On one of her breaks where she just stood on Cormac's face the portrait opened and in walked Neville Longbottom seeing her he smiled and walked over to the girls.  Even when he got close enough to see three first years using Harry, Ron, and Percy as their seats while Hermione walked on an unconscious and bruised Cormac he still approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hermione,\" Neville said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Neville need some help with an assignment?\" Hermione responded like she normally wound and not as if she was trampling someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I just wanted to say \"hi\" but as I saw what you were doing over here I... well wanted to,\" Neville said seeming to lose his nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What tell on us?\" Cassie said almost getting off Harry to beat the shit out of Neville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!? No I wanted to join in,\" Neville said sinking to his knees and bending over kisses Hermione's feet as she stood on Cormac's face.  All the girls apart form Hermione gaped at Neville submitting without a fight.  Hermione could only smile as she patted Neville's head as he smiles up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Neville just might be the best thing I have heard in the longest time as well as the smartest thing I have heard a boy say,\" Hermione said stepping off Cormac onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Neville said still kneeling at her feet.  Seeing Neville prostrate himself so willingly to her and looking over at Cormac who she knew would fight her for a long time it is an easy choice as she takes out her wand and cast a spell that shrinks Cormac to around six inches before stomping him one final time and grinding him to pulp.  Hermione than uses Neville's shirt to clean the gore off her foot before having the eager Neville...</span></div></div>",

He was also so submissive towards her that the thought of being buried under her prefect ass actually excited him. After the death of his parents, Neville had been living with his grandmother. The old woman had taught him that boys are naturally subservient to girls and this was a lesson that Neville had taken to heart. He really wanted to be dominated by Hermione whom he considered to be the strongest and smartest girl in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use me, Hermione. Please let me serve as your seat cushion, I know that my proper place is under you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another brilliant suggestion\" Hemrione laughed \"you know your proper place, for that you shall be rewarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mistress Hermione.\"<br>\r\nH<br>\r\n\"Mistress Hermione\" she purred \"I like that, you will address me as Mistress from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led Neville to the nearest chair and Neville took his place on it. \"I am ready mistress. you can sit on me whenever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can, here i come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sat quickly, pressing her ass and all of her weight forcibly onto the boy who had so willingly volunteered to become her seat cushion. Neville felt her butt pressing down on him, crushing him under her full weight and he smiled. Hermione had the most perfect body of any girl he had ever known, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a geat honour for a boy to be used as my seat cushion\" Hermione pointed out, putting even more pressure on the boy \"you should feel proud to serve under me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very proud, mistress\" Neville nodded \"I am deeply humbled to be accepted for the role.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good\" Hermione approved \"you are full of great answers today. Now as for your reward, I have decided to let you keep your name for now. These other girls have striped their boys of their names, they did not submit willingly as you did, they tried to fight. For their defiance they have lost everything. Whilst you continue to serve me willingly, you will b allowed to keep your name. Isn't that generous of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extremely generous, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled, she felt sure that Neville would prove to the the perfect, obedient slave boy.</span></div></div>",

Didn't you, Neville?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep losing him don't you? You lost him on the first day, on the train to Hogwarts.

You'd like that wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione raised her wand hand and gave it a little flick. Trevor, the toad rose into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of two problems at once\" Hermione pointed out \"I'll get rid of a pet you can't take care of, and I'll feed you at the same time. You'd like that, wouldn't you Neville?\"She pressed herself down upon him with so much force that Neville was sure his groin would collapse under the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,,,, mistress...\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should cook it first though, it wouldn't be very nice to serve your meal raw.. You want it cooked thoroughly don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione waved her wand, and Trevor, still in mid air, suddenly burst into flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, of course an expert when it came to enchanted fires. The flames did not spread. After a minute or so they died away and a now-lifeless, baked toad now hung in the air. As an added twist, she also magically removed all of its bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing out loud, Hermione used her wand to pull the toad through the air and instructed Neville to take it in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank me for providing you with your meal, Neville\" Hermione instructed \"I want to see you eat all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, mistress, and yes\" Neville intoned, obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as her seat-boy started biting chunks out of his now-former pet, chewed and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you enjoying your meal?\" she asked at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress\" Neville dutifully responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a little under 10 minutes, Neville had finished his meal.

With each passing second he got smaller and smaller, until he was just a tiny boy of no more than 4 inches in height, laying upon the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was tempted to sit on him again, boy was she tempted but she resisted temptation for she knew that he would soon be in a place infinitely more satisfying - at least for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second spell was effectively a full body bind. Harry's shrunken boy went as stiff as a board, completely immobile, his mouth sealed shut. Grinning to herself though, she adjusted the spell slightly, allowing him to move his eyes. She felt he should be able to freely watch what was happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was almost ready now, finally she cast the spell which allowed her boy to remain alive without breathing. That would be of vital importance to him where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she nodded. She was satisfied that Harry was ready for his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie lifted up her skirt and parted her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's clothes had not shrunk, only the boy himself. What now lay on the seat was a shrunken boy covered by full sized clothing. As Cassie lifted him off the seat, she pulled him away from those former clothes. He was utterly naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking her boy up and holding him in her right hand, she started lifting him towards the entrance of her young womanhood.<br>\r\nHarry could see the entrance in front of him, getting closer by the second. He was sure that at any moment he would make contact but he also knew there was not a thing he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was utterly terrified. Even in his frozen state, sweat started appearing all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie laughed harder as she pressed Harry's head against her vagina, and started to push.<br>\r\nHer vagina lips parted, allowing her shrunken passenger to pass through, his head disappeared.<br>\r\nCassie continued to push him inside. His shoulders were the next to disappear, and her young pussy then started to swallow his chest, his groin.<br>\r\nSeconds later only his legs were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie continued to push. His legs disappeared inside her, his knees, his ankles, finally his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was gone, entirely submerged within Cassie's womanhood. With one final shove she forced him deep inside, then removed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pussy lips closed behind her, sealing her boy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie re-fitted her panties and allowed her skirt to drop back into place. Now there was no trace at all of Harry, he was trapped inside her vagina, and Cassie knew he would stay there until she decided to let him out, if she ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Harry, the situation was an absolute nightmare.<br>\r\nHe felt himself being held, and slowly forced into an entirely tight and slick passage. There was wetness all around him, sticky wetness and heat. The inside of her passage was so warm, so very warm. The moment his head passed through the opening, it also became utterly dark. There was no air, none at all. Harry couldn't breathe, he did not know that it was no longer necessary. He felt sure that his nightmare would be over shortly, that she would either release him soon, or he would suffocate and die in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, found himself floating in a wet, slick, moist prison of inner girlhood that gripped him tightly, he felt it squeezing him. Her juices were everywhere, they got everywhere, his hair was soon a damp, sodden mess. Her liquids got up his nose, they entered his mouth whenever he moved his lips, and every time he tasted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was utterly dark as the entrance sealed behind him, cutting him off from the outside world. He was now trapped inside this girl, he knew that and whilst he expected to die at any moment, death never came. He remained trapped inside the nightmare, trapped inside the feminine confines of the smallest girl in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Harry was exactly where she wanted him, Cassie resumed her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only regret was that she did not now have a boy to sit upon, but knowing where her boy now was, perhaps that wasn't so bad.</span></div></div>",

She could put a collar on him later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On reflection, I think I'll go with breaking his balls\" she announced \"nobody else who sleeps in our dorm room has testicles, I don't see why my boy should be any different. Besides: I'd love to really mess with whatever remains of his self esteem by turning him into a boy without any boy parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had been in bed, Cassie was dressed in a thin nightie, and her bare feet were uncovered. This was fine, as far as she was concerned. She didn't need shoes in order to break this boy's nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to hold him up as she swing her knee upwards, impacting forcibly with his ball sack. This first impact did not do any lasting damage but when she dropped the boy, he curled into a heap, clutching at his groin in pain. She pulled his arms out of the way, and looked down on him, a predatory look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his malehood exposed once more she delivered several kicks to that region, then bent her knee and droppepd it heavily onto his testicles. Harry cried out several times, He now felt severe pain between his legs and tears started to form in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie paid no heed to the boy's discomfort, she just kept on assaulting his genitals. Sometimes she kicked or stomped on them. At other points she held him up with one hand whilst driving her knee into that area several times in a row. His balls were receiving a severe battering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she decided that the time had come to move from merely assaulting his manhood to actually destroying it utterly. She forced Harry to lay on the floor with his balls exposed, then she deliberately placed the heel of her right foot directly on his left testicle, and stood there. She even placed her left on top of her right, so that one ball was now being crushed under her full weight. She ground her heel back and forth as she stood on him, until eventually she heard a faint pop, and the testicle burst under the pressure, A moment later she had squished it completely flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then knelt down before him, took his remaining ball in her other hand and squeezed hard. It wasn't long before that second ball was just as flat and mangled as the first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no functioning balls any more, Harry was effectively castrated at that point, but the first year girl did not stop there. She went to work on the penis itself, kicking it, stomping on it, punching it, crushing it underfoot. She turned herself loose on the last vestiges of his maleness, assaulting it mercilessly. Before long it was mangled and crushed beyond recognition. Harry did not have a penis any more, he had a worthless, pulpy mush between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grabbed hold of that unidentifiable mush, twisting and pulling firmly until it came apart from his body. Harry started to bleed from what was now an open wound between his legs, but a wave of Cassie's wand dried up the blood and healed the damaged flesh. His body made another adjustment as well, enabling him to pee out of his ass now that he no longer had the usual male exit passage Where is penis had once been there was nothing, no sign that a penis had ever resided there. He had bare flesh at the front, and his ass at the back. From an anatomical stand point, he could no longer be called a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced the 'boy' onto his back at that point and straddled his chest. \"I am going to give you a rare treat, boy\" she told him \"a midnight snack, you must be hungry by now. You will now eat this thing I am holding in my hands, eat it all, don't leave any traces behind.\" She waved her wand over his dick for a moment before she offered it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Cassie saying, did she want Harry to eat his own dick? When he hesitated, she slapped him across the face. \"I've dried up the blood in your former penis, it won't be a messy meal but that is not to say you won't bleed if you hesitate any longer\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed, and nodded. He took the mass of his former penis from the girl and started to eat. He knew by now that the girl was more than capable of making good on all of her threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 10 minutes before Harry had swallowed all traces of his former penis, and Cassie was finally satisfied. </span></div></div>",

As an added security measure she took out her wand and magically sealed that door. There was no way Harry was going to leave that room until she was ready for him to depart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she knew that Harry was trapped in that room with her, she went over to the bath, inserted the plug,  turned on the hot and cold taps, put her hand under the water to check that it was flowing at the temperature she wanted. She touched the hot tap with her wand, and a feminine bubble bath started to mix with the water. She then turned her attention to the boy himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy should not be wearing his clothes whilst he bathed, so she started to strip him. As she removed each article of clothing, she dumped them in the corner of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was whilst she was undressing him that Harry finally woke up. Seeing himself half naked, in a bathroom with Cassie, he suddenly freaked and ran to the door. When he tried the lock though, he found it wouldn't budge. The door remained unmovable. He was trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let him continue his futile efforts to move that door for a few minutes, to allow the comprehension to slowly dawn upon him then she pulled him back to the middle of the room and started to work on his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can undress myself\" he remarked, trying to push her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment earned him another hard slap across the face. \"Stay still, boy, you know your place is wherever I want it to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed as Cassie now lowered his trousers and his boxers, revealing his male genitalia which was apparently standing to attention once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cock knows where you belong, even if you forgot for a moment\" she explained, then instructed him to sit on the toilet whilst she removed his trousers, boxers and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Harry was completely naked and Cassie dumped the last of his clothes in the pile in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in the bath, boy.\" Harry nodded, and slipped into the bath. Cassie looked at the water level and saw that the bath had reached the desired point. She turned off the taps. She hid her wand in a place where, with Harry's poor eye sight, he would never find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie then started stripping off her own clothes, making a neater pile of them than what she had done with Harry's. It only took her a couple of minutes for her to strip naked, then she too climbed into the bath, and sat on Harry's chest, trapping his arms under her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to seeing me naked boy\" she told him \"you are mine, and I will happily use you whether I am dressed or not.\" She took up soap and a cloth and started to bathe him whilst she continued to sit on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took around 15 minutes to thoroughly bathe both herself and the boy, and wash their hair. When Cassie was satisfied, she pulled Harry out of the water, removed the plug from the bath and handed Harry a towel. She used a different towel to dry herself off. </span></div></div>",

From the stories he was hearing from the older students, it was sounding like would be missing out on a lot of fun. But unfortunately for him, the Dursleys didn't sign his persmission slip. So after he bid Ron and Hermione goodbye on the first Hogsmeade trip of the school year, he decided to head to the Gryffindor Common Room. At first, he thought he was alone, but then he saw there was one other person there: Ginny Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny turned towards Harry and asked \"What are you doing here, Harry? Shouldn't you be at Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go. The Dursleys didn't sign my permision slip\" said Harry in a depressed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I knew that there was a permission slip, but I can't imagine many guardians not signing it. You must feel pretty pathetic, on't you Harry, being the only 3rd year to have to miss their first Hogsmeade opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the way Ginny said what she said made Harry feel worse. It was as if she wsa making fun of him and looking down on him. But surely not, righht? This is Ron's sister after all, the one who has a crush on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you have nothing better to do, sit with me and keep me company.\" Ginny gave him a stare that told him it was an order, not a request. For some rerason, Harry was intimidated by Ginny's stare and sat in the seat beside her, right on top of her papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhack! That was the sound Ginny made when she bonked Harry on the head with her Potions text book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say you could sit beside me! I need this room to put my books and papers. Sit on the floor at my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, Ginny. Of course\" said Harry as he sat on the ground by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why the Dursleys didn't sign your permission slip, Harry. You don't listen, you just do what you want. But don't you worry. I'll help you Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't know what to think. On one hand, Ginny was sounding like she was looking down on him. But on the other hand, maybe Ginny's right; he ignored her stuff on the couch and sat there without thinking and he's always getting in trouble at school. Maybe Ginny can help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Potions could be frighteningly complicated. It was vitally important not only to know which ingredients to use and in what quantities but also she had to pay attention to how they were prepared, even how many times to stir the cauldron and in which direction. Her current assignment was to research the swelling solution and she for some reason couldn't quite remember al lhe steps needed to produce it. Fortunately she had this boy close at hand who surely would have learned the solution earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Swelling Solution Harry\" she called to him \"after you add the bat spleen, is it four stirs anticlockwise or 5 stirs clockwise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Harry pondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was already irritated, and now Harry was being unhelpful. That simply would not do at all. If Harry was going to ignore her then  she would just have to take her frustration out on him. She swung her leg back then drove it firmly into his chest. There was a highly satisfying cracking sound as it hit. It was so satisfying in fact that she did it again, and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww, Ginny. That hurts!\" he cried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does Harry and it'll go on hurting until you don't have any ribs left if you don't answer my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Swelling Solution, is it four stirs anticlockwise or five clockwise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recall, and what was that about cat skins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember? You mean you don't know. Snape is right, you really are thick!\" Her leg swung again as she drove it into his chest, HARD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aargggh\" Harry collapsed on the floor, his arms trying and failing to soothe his battered chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's try another subject\" she offered \"what can you tell me about the skurge charm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The w.what Charm\" Harry gasped, still convulsing in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, Harry! Are you a wizard or a muggle? Have you learned anything at this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't I say you are so unmagical you are a pathetic heap who would be better off with a fallen twig rather than a wand which you are clearly incapable of understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a bit harsh, Ginny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it is the truth. I'll take you to McGonagall and we'll show her how little you know. Maybe she'll put you down a year, or even make you start your Hogwarts education from scratch. I'll encourage her to think along those lines,You may be a year older than me, but if you go all the way back to the start then you will live out the rest of your days knowing that I will always be stronger and more powerful than you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it could come to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it might, if McGonagall feels you need to go back that far. Personally I would rather you were a second year though, you could keep me company in all of my classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think McGonagall will be here, she might be in Hogsmeade with the other students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she isn't in the school, then I will write to her and tell her that there is an important matter that needs her immediate attention, and you will be staying with me until she returns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess\" Harry sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

There was no way that he could be put back into his second year or even his first year, was there? Ginny had to be playing a prank, Harry tried to assure himself. She did have Fred and George as two of her brothers after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the scared part of his brain was rapidly trying to remember anything useful he learned over his Hogwarts school career that would prevent him not only being put down a year, but everything. Ron and Hermione would abandon him, McGonagall would kick him off the Qidditch team, Snape would make his life even more miserable, and the school would turn on him even harder than they did the year before when they thought he was the Heir of Slytherin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind was panicking, he started forgetting the things he learned at Hogwarts, starting with the third year material.  After a while, his mind startin blocking out the second year knowledge he had accumulated. Soon enough, the pair had reached Professor McGonagall's office and all his knowledge of second year spells was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny asked \"Are ou ready, Harry? This could be your last moments as a third year for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry responded, \"Please, Ginny. Don't let me go through with this. I'm not feeling very well. I think I need some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny slapped Harry on his cheek and said \"No way, Harry. If you're this nervous, then that only provves you aren't ready for third year. Can't you just imagine it, Harry? You, going from the going from a famous hero to th laughingstock of the school, forever. Everything that was fun for you at school will become a nightmare as your friends will abandon you and you can say goodbye to playing Quidditch. That's enough daydreaming for now. Let's face the moment of truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny knocked on the door and after a moment heard Professor McGonagall say \"Enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny opened the door andgrabbed Harry's hand and pulled him into the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Weasley, Mister Potter. What do you need to see me for on a weekend? Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor McGonagall, I'm concerned about Harry, here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concerned? What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asking him for some help on some homework but he couldn't help me since he didn't know it. I was asking him some other second year stuff that I had already learned, but he didn't know any of the answers. I'm concerned that he may not be ready for 3rd year, Professor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall was stunned. \"This is certainly a huge concern, Ginny. Mr. Potter's marks have been borderline average for a while now and considering the dangers he's faced because ofYou'Know-Who the last two years and the number of his old followers tht would love to kill him, like Black, it would be a mistake to have him leave Hogwarts with an insufficient education. Very well then. Mr. Potter, I will test you first on some third year material you have covered already and then second year material. Depending on how you fare, I will end the testing there or test you on first year material. Again, depending on your results will determine if you remain a third year, return to second year, or return to first year. Am I understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, Professor.\" said Harry. Haring Professor McGonagall repeat what Ginny had said made it that much more real. He was still having trouble remembering anything he learned from second year and thrd year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next ninety minutes, it was clear to both Ginny and Professor McGonagall how far Harry had regressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pathetic, Mr. Potter! Utterly pathetic. Half this material I know you were capable of performing in the past and now you can't remember anything? If this some twisted idea of a prank, it's not funny. Miss Weasley was correct. Your education has been very subpar. At the minimum, you  are demoted back to second year. With any luck, you'll avoid being sent back to first year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry just stared at Professor McGonagall in shock while Ginny was smiling very largely inside her mind. She could not believe that Harry was cracking thi much under pressure. Seeing his downfall with her own eyeswas making her very happy. Soon, he would be under her control. It was for his own good, after all, since he was so weak and incompetent.     </span></div></div>",

I have no choice but to send you back to the first year, you will start your education from scratch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her desk drawer and pulled out a first year timetable. \"Starting from right now, this is your schedule\"[/b] she explained \"I will be be informing all the professors that you have been reinstated as a first year student, I am sure that will amuse Professor Snape. From Monday you will be taking first year classes and will not progress until you have shown that you have learned enough of the first year material.\"[/b] She had never known any student to be put back two years before, and certainly not one that never professed beyond the first. Would Potter be the first? He might if he didn't start taking in some of what the professors had been trying to drum into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was actually laughing at this stage, from being a year above her, a boy who was older than her was now a year below her. That was just too rare, he would be starting at the very bottom. It might have been nice, to have had him in second year with her so they could share lessons and she could keep her hold on him during his classes but perhaps they could find a way around that. Perhaps she could find a couple of allies to keep an eye on him during his classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew that the most famous boy i nthe school was as thick as a muggle\" she remarked \"we should keep an eye on him, professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep me informed as to his progress Miss Weasley\" the professor advised her \"I know you are now above him in your classes but I am sure you can find a way to keep an eye on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny nodded, The professor was asking her to stay close to Harry, this could work to her plans after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is settled, can I take him back to the common rooom?\" Ginny asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall nodded, and Ginny took Harry by the hand and led him from the professor's office. Once they were in the corridor, she instructed Harry to walk behind her as they made their way back to the common room. \"You really are thick, Harry\" she informed him as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to the common room, they found a couple of first year girls sitting together on one of the sofas. One girl had  shoulder-length brown hair and brown eyes, the other had short blonde with blue eyes. They both were wearing skirts and tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I join you?\" Ginny asked, and when the girls both nodded, Ginny tool a seat nearby and instructed Harry to take a seat next to her. She held off on dominating him any  more until she had spoken with the two younger girls, both of whom would be his class mates from now on. Ginny considered that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I''m Ginny, this is Harry\" she informed the younger pair. <br>\r\n\"We had heard of Harry\" the blonde commented \"I am Lisa, this is Hannah.\" She indicated the other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going on the Hogsmeade trip?\" the brown haired girl, Hannah asked Harry? She knew who the boy was, and she thought he was a third year student. Until a few minutes ago, he had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to point out that he had no permission slip then Ginny chipped in. \"The Hogsmeade trip is only for third year students and above\" she pointed out \"I am a second year, and Harry...\" she gilggled \"Harry is a first year student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't he a little old to be a first year?\" Lisa asked \"he hasn't been in any of our classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will be from now on\" Ginny informed her \"McGonagall just dropped him down in to the first year due to his gross incompetence. It seems he has been through two years at the school and never learned anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dunce!\" Hannah exclaimed \"the boy who lived is as thick as a brick.\" She gave Harry a glare of contept. \"How can you live with yoursellf, dummy?\"[/b] she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing the official line that painted Harry as something as a legend in the wizarding world, it seemed that Hannah now regarded the older boy as utterly insignificant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of prat gets put down from third year to first?\" Lisa asked \"if I was McGonagall I'd have dumped you completely, snapped your wand in half and I would have had a load of fun doing it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\" Harry complained \"I feel bad enough as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we don't mind at all\" Hannah informed him \"you are utterly useless and now clearly you have been put in your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that he has found his proper place, why don't we three girls keep him there?\" Ginny asked them, clear now about their feelings about him and not minding in the least .In fact, finding this pair might have been a stroke of luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?? Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Harry has been put in to the first year again, I think he needs to stay there. If he was in my year then I could keep him under my thumb of course but has been dropped all the way down to the bottom. What are your feelings about kicking a boy when he is down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the boy is called Harry, then I can kick good and hard\" Hannah giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well give him some good hard kicks from me, keep him distracted so he doesn't learn anything. McGonagall said he won't advance if he doesn't learn the first year material, keep his mind off his studies, and generally amuse yourselves at his expense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do that, it sounds like fun\" Hannah smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'd be happy to\" Lisa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be so grateful\" Ginny smiled \"he is my responsibility of course, McGonagall asked me to look after him, but it would be good to have a couple of friends helping me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\" Hannah nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what friends do\" Lisa added, </span></div></div>",

He looked over at the girls. Hannah and Lisa had stood but they had effectively not moved from their positions. They both had their backs to him. Hannah was standing in front of where his chest now lay, and Lisa was in front of his legs. From his position he could see the backs of their legs and their skirts. Their knees were straight but Harry knew that if they bent their knees and sat back down that they would be sitting upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in place, Harry?\" Hannah asked him, not even bothering to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here\" Harry replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, Hannah sat back down, sitting firmly and heavily on the boy who was now beneath her.

I could keep slapping it until there is no flesh remaining, you can do nothing to stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had to admit that she had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" Ginny said then \"why don't you two girls tell me a little bit about yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lisa Jennings\" the blonde remarked \"and I'm half-blood, I have a yougner sister called Allison.

Do either of you play?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've not tried it\" Hanna confessed \"Lisa plays a little but if you are so passionate than then perhaps you should take Harry's place on the team, Ginny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth considering\" Ginny mused \"I am sure the team won't want Harry any more when they learn he got his worthless behind kicked back to first year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And his worthless body sat upon by a group of girls\" Hannah nodded \"I think we can convince the team to drop Harry and choose you instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you two gettign along in your studies?\" Ginny asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairly well, I am getting good grades in most of my subjects\" Lisa responded \"but Hannah hear is a real brain box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've learned every spell in the Standard Book Grade One\" Hannah explained \"and a number of other subjects as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've only been hear a month, and you have covered the grade one book already?\" Ginny was impressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just seem to have a knack for picking things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, but I have a little help. My brother Bill has been through the school already, he now works for Gringotts. He gave me all his own books and I have been studying hard. I'd say I know more than Harry, but I think the same can be said of either of you, even the baby who was born yesterday knows more than Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know more than the average third year boy, Hannah corrected \"a standard Harry could only ever dream about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better\" Ginny approved \"if you are smart as you say, I can show you some really advanced magic, both of you. We can practice in our dorms where Harrry could never go. We will be the most powerful witches at the school, with the possible exception of my friend Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that\" Hannah nodded \"is this Hermione really smart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is safe to say she is the smartest girl here\" she nodded \"she is brilliant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Harry know here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they have been friends for a couple of years now. I think it is safe to say that friendship has run its coruse though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think they will be friends any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After Harry has been put back in first year? I know Hermione, she won't appreciate al lthe years of effort she wasted trying to help him with his studies. I think the friendship will end the moment she lays eyes upon him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Harry doesn't deserve friends any more\" Lisa commented \"he belongs to you now Ginny, there is no place in his tiny world or his even smaller mind for friends any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" Ginny agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry was laid out on his back on a sofa in the Gryffindor common room and three girls were sitting on top of him. His trouses rested on the floor as did his shoes which one of the girls had removed. The way the girls were sitting, Harry would not be visible at all if his head and his feet did not stick out at either end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could feel the full weight of the three girls bearing down upon him, pressing him into the sofa beneath. He could feel the warmth of their bodies, the textture of their flesh where it came in to contact with his own. Harry's hands which lay against his sides were now trapped under the girls  One hand was held firmly in place by their knees, The other was held secure by the fact that the presence of their backsides upon him left him no room to move it. They were not resting their backs against the sofa but they were sat far enough back that there was no way he could free it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The brown haired girl, Hannah was sitting on his chest and whenever he tried to lift his head he felt his chin brush against her thigh.When this happened she leaned into him for a moment, squashing his throat until he settled back down. Sometimes though she would simply slap him sharply across the face. The effect was the same either way; Harry would soon lower his head back to the sofa beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl sitting on his feet was called Lisa Jennings. He had heard a little bit about her from the conversation the girls were having above him but thankfully she wasn't doing anything other than sitting on him right now; perhaps because his face was closer to Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was sitting on his groin, her full weight pressing down upon his thighs. He had soon discovered the effect of having his trousers removed before they sat on him. Trousers in themselves are made of thick fabric which would have provided a kind of barrier between him and the girls who were sitting on him. Without trousers the feeling of their presence; especially Ginny's upon him increased tenfold. The fabric of his boxers, their skirts and underclothes was much thinner. He could feel every contour of their young bodies as they bore down upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, the girls were talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Harry's trunk will have to be moved out of the third year boys' dorm\" Lisa commented \"he isn't a third year any more, he is a first year like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame he can't get up our staircase\" Hannah sighed \"he could move in with us but I guess we'll have to let him sleep with the first year boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could ask McGonagall\" Ginny offered \"if we point out that a boy who has been dropped from third year to first, clearly can't take care of himself then she might let us keep him close. I don't see why we can't store his possessions in our dorms though, we are in a better position than him to determine what he will need and what he should wear every day. I'm surprised Harry even knows enough to dress himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything of his that he really won't need any more?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His broom\" Ginny responded \"when I take his place on the team, he won't be needing it any more. Don't damage it though, I'll make good use of it during my matches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about his wand?\" Hannah asked \"if we don't want him to learn any magic, does he even need his wand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dooubt that Harry is capable of learning any real magic\" Ginny pointed out \"but he will need the appearance of a wand, at least for his classes.\" Then an idea came to her \"I'll see if I can find Ron's wand that he used last year, the one that was damaged when he crashed the car into the whomping willow. I'm sure we can magically fasten it together so it won't appear like it is about to fall apart, it would still be broken though. If we find that then I'll let the two of you decide which one gets to destroy his existing wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A broken wand won't work properly will it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" Ginny smiled \"and of course that wand did not choose Harry. He would have better luck with a spare twig than with that wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds ideal\" Lisa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has a vault at Gringotts too\" Ginny pointed out \"he was left a small fortune by his parents, it is all in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you would find a much better use for that money\" Hannah suggested, she picked up his trousers and started feeling through his pockets. \"I've found his wand she pointed out, then after a moment more \"and this looks like his vault key. What is his vault number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"687\" Ginny nodded \"can I have those please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah handed over the key and the wand, Ginny pocketed both of them. <br>\r\n\"Harry will write to Gringotts later, explain to them that he is giving me his vault.\" Ginny commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not!\" Harry exclaimed, but then Hannah slapped him again, \"Yes, you will Harry\" she pointed out.\"<br>\r\n\"Aaargh!\" <br>\r\n\"Say it Harry, or I'll break your nose\" she warned.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. Ginny can have my vault.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Harry\" Ginny actually smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really is thick\" Hannah mused \"he really doesn't realise that he is in no position to disagree with anything we tell him. He is a weedy boy, and no match for us physically. He does not have his wand, so he can't use magic not that he ever could. We are sitting on him so he is trapped beneath us while we use him as our seat cushion. He is utterly at our mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where he belongs\" Ginny agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now all three girls had been sitting on him for over an hour, Harry started to feel as though he had lived his entire live under them. None of them showed any sign of wanting to change their position or his any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time passed slowly for Harry, if it seemed to pass at all. He remained precisely where he was, trapped under the skirts of three girls who were sitting upon him He could move his head, and his feet, but no more. The rest of him was immobilised by the presence of Ginny and her two companions. Even if he tried to move his head, he soon found it forced back into place by the pressure of a thigh or a slap in the face from the brown haired girl sitting on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued to sit on him, not moving from their positions.<br>\r\nThey sat, and chatted, and sat, and chatted, and sat, and sat, and Harry was their seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had no meaning for him, he could not say how long he remained there, under these three girls It was over an hour since they had first sat on him that he had reluctantly agreed to give his bank vault to Ginny, and it was a long time after that when the door to the common room opened and a girl of Harry's own age entered; a girl that Harry knew, a girl with bushy brown hair and like Ginny and her companions she was also wearing a skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hermione\" he greeted her, feeling sure that she would recognise him soon enough and would discover his position whether he alerted her to it or not.<br>\r\nHermione looked and saw Harry's face looking back at her, what she didn't expect to see was that his face appeared to ermege from the side of a younger girl's skirt; a girl who was clearly sitting on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione would have asked the girl what she was going, only she could see that Ginny and a blonde girl were also sitting on him, and sitting on him so completely that only his face and his feet were uncovered. A pair of trousers lay on the floor discarded, Hermione recognised them as belonging to Harry. Why had he removed them and why were these three; Ginny included sitting on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Harry\" she responded then made a remark that Harry would not have expected, coming from her. \"Why didn't you tell me you wanted to be sat upon\" she  queried \"I could have attended to it on any number of occasions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer her, Harry\" Ginny instructed, curious as to how he would reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not but you went along with it\" Lisa chipped it \"we asked you to take off your trousers and lay on the sofa so we could sit on you. This you did, you even informed us that you were ready once you were in place and now you are trying to say you didn't volunteer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got you there, Harry\" Hermione nodded \"so whose idea was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was mine\" Hannah confessed \"and it was such a good idea that I felt these other two might like to join me. They did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What made you think of sitting on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed appropriate, it still does; especially after what McGonagall apparently did to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she do? Did she take house points, give him detention for something?\" McGonagall had done both of those things before, it would not surprise her if she did that again. What did surprise her was what Ginny told her next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"McGonagall put him back in first year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was there, I saw it happen. Harry had come into the common room because he couldn't go to Hogsmeade, he didn't have a permission slip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't surprise me, I don't imagine the Dursleys would have given him permission for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I asked him for some help with my homework, only he couldn't do it. I was surprised, since Harry is, or rather was in the year above me. I took him to McGonagall and asked her to test him, he failed miserably. He didn't know a thing, not even first year stuff. She put him back in first year and gave him a new timetable. She told him he won't advance until he can show he has learned something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression that Hermione gave him then was as though he was a piece of dirt that had lodged itself to her shoe, and needed to be brushed aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are totally useless Harry\" she informed him \"all that time I wasted on you, all those study sessions in the library and you didn't learn a damn thing.\" She walked over to where his head emerged from under Hannah's skirt. \"This is your reward for my misguided friendship\" she remarked, then snacked him across the face, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been slapping him there a time or two myself\" Hannah admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl!\" Hermione approved \"hit him again please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was only too happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was left in no doubt that his friendship with Hermione Granger had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there room on him for me?\" she asked the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled and gestured towards Harry's upturned face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding her approval, Hermione turned around so her back was towards him, then as she began to sit she pushed the bick of her skirt aside, it dropped over the back of his head as she descended, her skirt formed a tend which surrounded Harry's now completely hidden face upon which Hermione was now sitting. Harry was now in total darkness, his head buried under the skrit and the backside of the girl who until moments ago had been one of his best friends. He soon found that he was also struggling to breathe as Hermione's butt cheeks effectively sealed off his airway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her position, Hermione then addressed the two younger girls who were sitting on Harry's chest and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is  Hermione Granger\" she informed them, and they in turn gave her their names. They also told her something of themselves, their achievements and interests. Hermione was delighted when Hannah told her when she had already learned most of what her books had to offer her. \"You are the kind of friend I should have made\" she informed her. <br>\r\n\"We can start now if you like?\" Hannah suggested, quickly finding that she was liking Hermione.<br>\r\n\"That we can, my friend\" Hermione nodded shaking Hanah warmly by the hand, then without getting up from her 'seat' she shook Lisa's hand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have agreed to keep Harry occupied during his classes\" Ginny informed her \"as he has fallen all the way to first year, I won't be there to take care of it myself.\"<br>\r\nHermione nodded her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her, Harry was smothering. He could not breathe at all, and his need to breathe increased with each passing moment. With four girls sitting on him now though, he was helpless, he could not move at all, he could not shift the girl whose backside was now suffocating him. He could only hope that she would let him go eventually, but this did not seem like it was going to happen. Harry started to see stars, strange shapes, before his eyes and then blackness as his consciousness slipped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Hermione had only intended to make him pass out. She stood up and looked down at his sleeping face, she was smiling her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is he?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just passed out\" Hermione explained, a few slaps will wake him but let him sleep for a bit. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"</span></div></div>",

He won' need one.\"<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we remind him of where he is?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n\"We can put him back there whenever we want\" Hannah countered.<br>\r\n\"So we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera, by now had finished his task and Hermione waved her wand at it four times, instructing it to make four copies of the image it had just produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the four pictures emerged, Hermione handed three of them to the girls who were still sitting on Harry, the fourth she kept for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah studied the picture, an image in which she, Lisa and Ginny were sitting fully upon the boy who was unmistakably Harry Potter. The girls seemed to be chatting amongst themselves but the Harry in the immage, though his face and eyes moved a little, was held firmly in place by the girls who sat continually upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah burst out laughing but Lisa suggested \"How about a nice picture of Harry's face being covered again?\"<br>\r\n\"Should I be the one to cover it?\" Hermione asked.<br>\r\n\"I'll sit there\" Ginny informed her \"you can take my place on his groin.\"<br>\r\n\"That makes sense\" Hermione approved \"you are in charge of him after all.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't sit on his face until it starts filming\" Hermione advised \"it would be best to see Harry being sat upon in the picture.\"<br>\r\n\"Right\" Ginny approved, as she stood up from her seat on his groin and Hermione took her place. With a wave of her wand she set the camera to start recording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Ginny\" she informed her red-haired friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny walked slowly over to Harry's face then turned so her back was towards him. Like Hermione had dune, she pushed her skirt out behind her as she sat, enveloping Harry's face in a tent of darkness.<br>\r\n... and airlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like when Hermione had sat on his face, Harry couldn't breathe. He once again found himself smothering under a girl, this time Ginny.<br>\r\nGinny was smiling as she savoured the experience of smothering Harry with her young backside. The girls even chatted quietly amongst themselves as they waited.<br>\r\nEventually, there came no twitch of motion from Harry and Ginny stood. She looked down at Harry's face and saw that he was out cold. She felt his pulse and quickly discovered that his hear was still beating, He was alive but asleep, as he had been after Hermione had sat on him. <br>\r\nGinny felt so proud of herself, she felt she could burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He as aslepp, she explained to the others and to the camera just before Hermione stopped filming. She stood and once again instructed the camera to produce four copies. Ginny resumed her seat upon Harry's groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So was this just for fun\" Hannah asked \"or did you have another idea behind these pictures.\"<br>\r\n\"This one is for fun alone\" Hermione remarked \"Harry is not going to pass out if Ginny gets up and leaves halfway though.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think we should stop sitting on Harry in that other picture either.\" Ginny remarked.<br>\r\n\"If one of us leaves to visit another picture, the other two of us will still be sitting on him.\" Hermione pointed out.<br>\r\n\"Why would we do that, our images I mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, magical pictures visit one another, and we can use these to pass messages to each other. We can remain in almost constant contact no matter where w are.\"<br>\r\nGinny nodded \"that is really a good idea\" she explained \"I don't want Harry to have the picture after all, this should be a private conversation between the four of us.\"<br>\r\n\"My thoughts exactly\" Hermione nodded \"I only made four copies, anyway I'll just go and put the camera away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whilst you are there, can you please take all of Harry's things out of the boys' third floor dorm, including all of his clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"Where should I put them?\"<br>\r\n\"Bring them to the second year girls' dorm, I have magically enhanced my chest of draweresto hold more stuff than is usaul. The bottom drawer is empty, all Harry's things can go in there. They'll fit.\"<br>\r\n\"Won't he need them? He can't come into the girls' dorms, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, this way we stay in charge of everything he owns, talking about that. Harry has agreed to give me his vault.\"<br>\r\n\"Harry doesn't need all that money anyway, you'd make much better use of it.\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione headed upstairs, this time heading for the boys' dorms. A little while later she emerged carrying Hary's trunk. The trunk was heavy, clearly it was full of his things but Hermione had cased his spell so it would at least appear light enough for her to carry it up and down the stairs without too much effort. She disappeared up the stairs towards the girls' dorms, carrying it behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hermione emerged again she was not carrying the camera or Harry's trunk, she appeared completely unburdened.<br>\r\n\"Everything that is or was Harry's is now in your drawer\" Hermione explained \"I've even used a locking charm on it, one which requres a password to open. She whispered the password in Ginny's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of those things, his broom and his invisibility cloak for example have transferred into my possession now\" Ginny explained \"he can keep his clothes and his books, not that he will know what to do with those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione laughed, then she took a piece of parchment out of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a letter to Gringotts, officially transferring vault 687 into your ownership, Harry just needs to sign it. I take it you have the key already?\"<br>\r\n\"It is in my pocket\" Ginny nodded \"and Harry will sign that form when we are going down to dinner.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Harry started to wake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since she had first heard about him from her father, Luna Lovegood had been curious about Harry Potter.<br>\r\nHarry was reputed to have defeated You Know Who as a baby, at no more than a year old he had somehow managed to overcome a killing curse and cause it to rebound onto its caster. There were rumours that he must be a very powerful wizard, since You Know Who was the most powerful dark wizard of all time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna didn't care for any of that dark magic herself, but she recognised that the Lord of the Death Eaters had talent, that his skills in magic were formidable; matched only by the skills of Professor Dumbledore so people said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna wasn't entirely sure how Harry had defeated the Dark Lord, but surely some kind of powerful magic must have been involved, and probably intuitive since very few babies would know enough to even grasp the fundamentals of their talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe therefore was sure that when Harry came to Hogwarts, he would be skilled too. Once he learned to master his own abilities, surely he would be formidable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her first year, Luna had watched Harry, trying to find any signs of his abilities. She had not managed to trail him two much since he was a Gryffindor and she was in Ravenclaw house. They didn't even share classes for Harry was in the year above her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing about Harry though was that he was immediately identifiable. That unkempt dark hair, his glasses and that lightning bolt scar made him stand out in a crowd. She identified im almost immediately, and she did notice that he was almost always in the company of his two best friends. She knew who the boy was almost immediately, since his younger sister was in her hear and Ginny had mentioned him a few times. It was Ginny who had also pointed out that the girl was called Hermione and that she was exceptionally intelligent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events of the previous year had been dominated by the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, and that almost the entire school seemed to think that Harry was responsible. She laughed at the thought that it had been Harry who had been killing muggleborns. Weren't his aunt and uncle both muggles? She didn't know about his family dynamic but if he was raised by muggles then why would he be antagonistic towards them? The idea was pushed from nonsense to absurdity when she discovered that Hermione was also muggleborn. Why would she be one of his best friends if Harry saw muggles as the enemy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever had been spreading those rumours about Harry, clearly wasn't thinking too clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna felt truly sorry for all the victims who had been petrified, including Harry's friend Hermione. Shortly after that though, just as it seemed that the school would have to be closed, the whole mystery was solved somehow and Harry was apparently the one responsible for finding the answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confirmed Luna's suspicions that Harry must be some great wizard, or did it? <br>\r\nThe school, including Dumbledore was being evasive about what had actually happened in the Chamber of Secrets. She heard the name Tom Riddle being mentioned a few times as the one who was the Heir of Slytherin, apparently a former student at the school. Luna had heard that name somewhere before, she recalled she was in the trophy room at the time. She went down there and found a special award that had been given to one Tom Marvolo Riddle. It didn;t take much lateral thinking to see what an anagram of that name would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was who the heir was.<br>\r\nSo why was he still around, causing mischief?<br>\r\nWhat had really happened on the night Harry's parents died? If He Who Must Not Be Named was still hanging around, then how could he have died?<br>\r\nThe revelation of this mystery immediately threw up a bigger one, and one that was far more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Harry really as powerful as people claimed?<br>\r\nThen, it transpired that the exams at the end of that year were canceled. Harry's skills were still untested.<br>\r\nThat was unacceptable. Luna felt a strong desire to see for herself just how great the so called Boy Who Lived really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resolved that when she return to the school, she would confront Harry and discover the truth of this question once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Start of Term feast would be no good. The place would be too crowded, she would be better getting Harry alone somewhere. <br>\r\nBesides, as she looked towards the Gryffindor table during the sorting ceremony, Harry did not seem to be among his housemates.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For someone who's so smart, this is a really dumb idea you've got going on.\" And to prove his point, Harry grabbed Hermione's parchment tht she had her house elves notes on it and started ripping it up and then threw the pieces on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry then looked at Hermione and saw that she had tears in her eyes and immediately regretted his actions. But it was too late; he crossed the line and he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Hermioine. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your apologies, Harry. I don't want to hear them. For 3 years, we have been friends and I never betrayed you, inlike this school and unlike Ron. It would have so easy, given the dangerous life you lead due to You-Know-Who wanting you dead, but I didn't care because you were my friend. I would have expected this outburst from Ron, but never you. Since you obviously think so poorly of my dreams, this is goodbye. Good luck surviving the Tournament, graduating Hogwarts without my help, and surviving You-Know-Who\", said Hermione in a voice devoid of emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione said a \"Reparo\" to fix her parchment and then gathered her stuff to leave the library, no longer in the mood to do research. Harry just sat there speechless until Hermione turned to leave him forever, and then Harry grabbed Hermione's hand in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Hermione! Don't leave me. I'm sorry, so very sorry. I can't stand losing my other best friend.\" At this point, Harry got onto his knees while Hermione still had her face turned away from Harry. \"Is there any way I can ever make it up to you? Please, I'm begging you. I'll do whatever you want me to do, just please don't walk out of my life forever.\"  </span></div></div>",

Finally, she spoke to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really want to make it up to me for how you just acted in regards to S.P.E.W. and my dream, then you must essentially agree to be my house elf. You must agree to obey every order I give you. Keep in mind, that if you agree to this, you will not be freed by clothes as normal house elves are. You will only be freed when I say so and I have determined that this new arrangement will last until my dream for the end of house elf slavery comes to pass. If it does not ever come to pass within my lifetime, then you will remain my house elf for the rest of your life. Now that you have heard all this, what will you choose? Will you agree to be my house elf or is this the last I ever speak to you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry just stared at Hermione as he digested her words, but he replied very quickly nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione, without you, I would have died a long time ago. I owe you my life and so, I'd rather be your slave than for you to be out of my life forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this, Hermione turned her head to look at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then. As your first order, you re going to carry all of my books and follow me back to your bedroom. There are some general guidelines I need to discuss with you about our new relationship and I'd rather do that in a more private setting. And remember, walk behind me at all times\", stated Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok, Hermione\", said Harry as he stood up and took Hermione's books as she then led him out of the library. Harry's mind was trying to imagine what life will be like as Hermione's slave but he all he was thinking about was that Hermione would likely make him study all the time and do S.P.E.W. stuff. Surely Hermione wouldn't become cruel like Lucius Malfoy was to Dobby, would she? Harry couldn't imagine Hermione like that, which made it easier for him to agree to be her slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione, on the other hand, suspected that Harry would think that she would be nice as his new mistress. But Hermione was not going to show Harry any mercy. Harry hurt Hermione very deeply and she was not going to forgive him that easily. She knew she would have to be careful with how she treated Harry when they were in public, but when they were in private, she was planning on making sure he knew exactly what his new position was. And who knows what might happen? Harry might become so used to being a slave that he would hate the idea of being free, just like everyone keeps telling her that house elves would hate to be free.    </span></div></div>",

She led him through the entrance to the common room and to the staircase that led to the boys' dorms. For some reason the common room was empty as they passed through and Hermione used this opportunity to voice some of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls can entrt the boys dorms whenever they wish\" she remarked \"but the boys are not allowed to visit those of the girls, clearly this shows which of us is the most trustworthy.\" Would that rule still apply to Harry though \"As my personal house elf Hary, perhaps I can bring you into my room though\" she commented \"if you can then you will not be allowed to ascend the staircase to the girls dorms, enter or leave my dormitory without my permission.\" She did not want Harry to think he had any kind of freedom here, he would never be free again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ascended the boys' staircase and entered the fourth year's dorm. Again, Hermione was pleased to see that they were alone.She led Harry to his own bed and instructed him to strip down to his underwear, leaving his clothes on the floor. In just a few minutes, Harry was dressed only in his boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I think I should demonstrate the control I have over you/\" she mused \"do you remember when I hit Malfoy last year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to slap you in the face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please don't.\" he begged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up Harry and ask me to slap you hard across the face, ask politely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stood \"Please will you slap me in the face, Hermione\" he requested, then added the single word \"hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means\" she nodded, then struck Harry a heavy blow across the cheek with her right hand, Harry suddenly felt a stinging pain in his cheek where she had slapped him, he felt tears welling up in his eyes. Hermione just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stand in front of the bed with your legs slightly apart so I can drive my knee into your groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had no choice He stood before her, his legs slightly apart as she requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands o nhis shoulders, and using this contact to gudie her knee towards its target, Hermione drove her knee upwards She then swung back and drove her knee home four more times before she let him fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry collapsed to the ground, writhing in agony. \"A few more of those and you won't be a boy any more\" she laughed \"and you can expect more, I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had no reason to doubt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would have not have allowed yourself to be hurt like that if you did not have to obey my every word\" Hermione informed him \"I told you exactly what I was going to do but you allowed me to do it anyway, you had no choice. You are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could not fault her logic, he would not have willingly allowed himself to be abused by a girl normally, but he had done exactly what Hermione had told him, knowign what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[b]\"Lay on your bed, Harry\" she instructed \"on top of your covers, your head on the pillow. You will then stay in that poisition and not move until I tell you to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could not resist, he crawled onto the bed and laid on his bed, face upwarts, the back of his head resting on the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded then she too moved over to his bed, dropping firmly on to his chest. She sat on him, allowing her full weight to bear down upon him as she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and comfortable\" she approved \"by sitting on you I am showing you that your new place in life is indeed beneath me as your body is right now. I will continue to sit here while I explain a few things to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really your house elf?\" Harry asked, hardly believing that a boy could assume that role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Hermione nodded \"the agreement you made is magically binding, You have become my house elf, and will remain as such forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it could come to an end if the elves are ever freed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Harry! Do you really think that is going to happen? I could never get the backing of any of the magical community, they all want house elves to carry on as they are, and the elves feel the same way. Now that I have you I think I can quietly walk away from my SPEW work. I think we both know the elves will never be free, and that means you won't be either. Incidentally you are forbidden to compain on behalf of SPEW or to support any action which may lead to elf freedom. The other elves are no longer your concern, that includes Dobby. I know that particular elf has taken a shine to you, You will never speak to Dobby or any other elf ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Harry knew that he could not disobey her instructions, although how he knew this he did not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may not speak dis favourably of your new position, you will accept that you are and always will be my elf. As my owner, you can not harm me in any way, you will not speak against me, you will not disagree with anything I tell you, you will obey all my instructions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I make any suggestions to the professors or to other students on your behalf then you will support my decision. You will back me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not perform any magical act without my express permission. I determine what spells you can perform and who you can perform them upon. Now and again I may even use momory charms to make you forget certain spells. If I tell you that you can not perform a spell or brew a potion then you will not be able to carry it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time Harry, you will come to accept that this is your position in life, it is all you will ever be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" Hemione nodded \"now to business.\"</span></div></div>",

What juices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh harry, are you that naive? It should be perfectly obvious what juices. Watch while I undress.\" She slipped out of her robes whilst she was still sitting on him, then she removed her tie, her top and then her bra. She dropped these on the floor beside the bed, and now her chest was completely bare, her breasts exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll move off you while I take off the rest of my clothes\" she informed him \"keep watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes followed her as she slipped off the bed and continued to remove her clothes; her shoes and socks, her skirt, her panties. Once she was done she had a full pile of her clothes on the floor, she was completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione drew the curtains around Harry's bed and then sat upon him once more, this time on his upper chest, just below his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry now realised that he could no longer ignore the fact that Hermione was a girl, she was stunningly beautiful with a strong, feminine figure, and a true young woman's anatomy. As she lifted up slightly, his eyes were drawin to her young womanhood. Hermione saw the track of his eyes, and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may not have seen a pussy before Harry, but soon you will know mine intimately. You asked what juices? Here is the answer to your question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious, Harry. I am going to make you worship it. Extend your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's tongue emerged from his mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I will move forward onto your face, to give your tongue access to my pussy. You will work your tongue in deep, and you will continue to do so until I tell you to stop. It does not matter what emerges, it does not matter if you find yourself suffocating, you will continue to work your tongue inside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hermione\" Harry did not like what he was hearing, but he was her elf now, he had do carry out her instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione moved forward and settled herself onto Harry's face, deliberately forcing her pussy lips over his waiting tongue and feeling it enter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry immediately went to work, licking and slurping deep inside her and Hermione felt sudden ripples of sheer pleasure cascade throughout her body as Harry worked upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few seconds for her to reach her first orgasm. She lifted up as it hit, allowing her juices to spill out onto Harry's face. She settled back into place then, allowing her elf to continue his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had orgasm after orgasm whilst Harry continued to work his tongue inside her, and each time her fluids spilled onto her boy-elf. Sometimes she allowed Harry to breathe, at other times she settled herself into place over his nose and mouth, cutting of his airway for long periods of time. Even as he smothered, Harry continued to work on her with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did not know how long she continued to force him to pleasure her, he did know his tongue was sore through the constant exertion, it ached so much that it became painful for him to move it at all. He continued to lap at her but his work became an agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Hermione smothered him, it actually caused him relief. He knew he could not breathe, he started to hope that he was nearing the end - literally, and that he might slip away into a place where he would no longer feel the continued humiliation she was inflicting upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the power of a pussy\" Hermione told him on one such occasion \"a source of pleasure and of life, but a frustrated pussy can be a deadly weapon, if the woman so desires. If I smothered you for long enough, as I am smothering you now. If I waited. That would rob me of my house elf of course, but if that is my whim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that wasn't her desire though. She spent more and more time hovering over his face at the end, rather than sitting on it, saying she didn't want to wipe off her handiwork with her own butt cheeks.  The time come at last when Hermione told him that he could put his tongue away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe edged back onto his chest, and looked down at Harry's face. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was completely covered, she did not think it was possible for Harry to be any more lathered with her juices. His hair was a sodden mess, his dark locks sodden with a creamy white substance that made him look like he had gone prematurely gray. Every area of his face was soaked, her juices had entered his nostrils, and even covered his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was indeed anointed.</span></div></div>",

While the rest of his house celebrated his new status of one of the four Champions every other Hogwart's house turned on him; Harry could of taken than no problem if not for the fact that his other best friend decided that Harry had got his name in and in a fit of jealousy turned his back on Harry.  As Harry was really not one for the spotlight if he could help it he began to follow Hermione around as the pair spent most of their free time in the library.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was actually alright with this as she decided to help Harry get through the Triwizard's Tournament in one piece, what she could not stand, however, was Harry's bad mood after the first week as he missed Ron.  Getting tired of it Hermione decided she needed to help him get over the loss of Ron as well as establishing a new status quo for their friendship.  As during this time Harry seemed more like a lost puppy that followed her around and seemed to look to her to make all the real decisions of what the pair did.  As Hermione came to like Harry looking to her leadership in almost all matters she decided to roll with it as she would work in the library her homework covering most of the table, leaving just a small edge for Harry to do his own work, she would send Harry to get books for her smiling as he hurried to obey her request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time in jest Hermione asked him for what she knew to be one of the heaviest tomes in the library which was also located at the top bookcase on the complete other side of the room.  She had actually planned ahead with this order as she made sure to take a table as far away as she could from the bookcase the tome was located and was \"researching wand maintenance\" and was using Harry's wand thus forcing Harry to use only his physical strength to retrieve the book.  After spending the last week or so in the library during any free time and being ask to get her books Harry now had a pretty good understanding of where most books were so he did not even go ask the librarian for help in getting the book for Hermione.  As soon as he hurried off Hermione looked her watched, glad that any type of time piece even digital were the exception to the spell that rendered muggle tech inoperable, she started the stop watch function to see how long it took Harry to bring the heavy tome back.  As Harry appeared Hermione had to turn her laugh into a cough as Harry was walking nearly doubled over the large tome in his straining hands bare inches from the floor as he struggled to the table.  Knowing Hermione would not want the book to touch the floor Harry tried to find a clear spot to place the heavy book but the only spot left, that was not already piled high with books on the table was his own work space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry grunted as he tried to lift the tome onto free spot but was only able to lift it onto his chair before he nearly collapsed with fatigue.  As soon as he put the book down Hermione stopped her timer and saw it had taken Harry nearly twenty minutes to collect the book.  As Harry sat on the floor regaining his strength Hermione smiled to herself as she pushes back from the table and saunters over to the book.  Smiling down at Harry she pats his head as if he was a dog that had performed a trick before she reaches down and using just one hand hoist the book to her chest and carries it the long way around the table and places it before her chair.  Looking over at Harry she smiles again at him taking in his bulging eyes at how easily she had moved the book, evidently forgetting that her bag is constantly bursting with books so while she may not look it Hermione is rather strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry just gazed at her in a new light form his spot on the ground as she pretends not to notice taking slight notes from the tome she had Harry get for her.  After ten minutes Hermione reckoned Harry had regained enough of his strength to be useful again so she turns to him and states, \"Harry could you be a dear and....</span></div></div>",

Hermione than pushed her chair back in and went back to the heavy tome and her \"note taking\" which if Harry had been able to see it would make him think twice on how he currently felt about Hermione.  For her \"notes\" were her further plans to make sure Harry would come to accept his place under her thumb.  folding the note and sticking it down the front of her bra, so it would not accidentally fall out of any of her actual homework, she began to close her books in preparation for putting them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry still feeling happy at his attempt to give Hermione a foot massage finally stood up to see her start to pack up the books.  Seeing the large amount of tomes, charts and other library materials spread across the table, a thought on how he could increase his strength came right to him.  \"Hey Hermione why don't I put all this away for you it might help me get stronger so I can give you a better message in the future,\" Harry said a looking hopefully at Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great Harry and as you are doing that I will save us a spot at the supper table,\" Hermione said giving him a smile which Harry took as a sign of thanks to him but was in fact a sign to herself that her plan had already begun.  As if to feed into his misconceptions Hermione leaned over the table giving Harry a look down her full blouse as she turns his head and gives him a slight peck on the cheek.  Harry blushes and accident knocks some of the material off the table as truth be told he had never really been kissed before.  Harry quickly bent to pick up the supplies making it look as if he was bowing to her but Hermione just ignored him as she picked up her back pack and left the library.  However, she did not head down to the Great Hall but rather watched Harry put away all the library materials away making sure he put them back on the right shelves rather than just hand them to the librarian.  Seeing he was putting them away himself Hermione left for the Great Hall twirling Harry's wand, which he had never even asked for back, as she took out her plans and crossed out the top line.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harry arrived at the Great Hall, almost an hour later than Hermione had, he took a few minutes to find her sitting at the end of Gryffindor table finishing off her desert.  Knowing how the food at Hogwarts worked where a course change made the previous course's food vanish Harry gave a small groan of annoyance that he had missed dinner..  Seeing Harry Hermione waved him over and to his utter delight held out a plate of food for him.  Harry could have almost hugged his only friend, but as he ran to her he missed a small wet spot on the floor that Hermione had created which caused Harry to slide into her making her \"accidentally\" drop the food for him. \"Oh I am so sorry Harry,\" Hermione said as they both looked at the spilled food which was made up of all of Harry's favorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not your fault Hermione I was just too distracted to pay attention to what was right in front of me,\" Harry said looking longingly at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know what we can do Harry,\" Hermione said as she told Harry her plan to...</span></div></div>",

For a moment Harry thought she would lead him back to the Common Room, as food was not allowed in the library, but instead she lead him outside and towards the Owlery.  \"I don't think any one would will bother us here,\" Hermione said using a cleaning spell on a pair of benches of owl droppings as she sat down crossing her legs as Harry took out the food.  As soon as he opened the napkin Hedwig thinking it was a treat came down and settled on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hedwig,\" Harry said patting his snowy white owl's head as she bent down and pecked up a piece of turkey in the napkin.  \"Hey wait that is my dinner,\" Harry complained making Hermione giggle as the Hedwig eat the scrap of turkey.  Harry tired to move his had away only for more owls to fly down after the food.  Harry tried to fight them off as he wrapped the napkin back up but before he could put it back in his pocket a large tawny school owl flew by knocking it out of his hands where it fell to the floor busting open and spilling the food to the Owlery floor where it was quickly attacked by the group of owls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere seconds ever scrap of food that Hermione had saved for him was down the owls gullets meaning Harry would have to go hungry for it was past the dinning hour at Hogwarts.  Looking down at the food Hermione turned a sympathetic look to Harry, though inside she was laughing her ass off at the turn of events, \"Maybe we can find out where the kitchens are so you can get some food from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Fred and George should know where it is as I have never seen it on the map,\" Harry said warming to the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point lets go ask them,\" Hermione said taking Harry's hand again and leading them in search of the twins.  Hermione had Harry stay behind for Ron had been hanging out with his older brothers since Harry had become one of the Champions so she would have better luck that if Harry was around.  Harry patted his grumbling stomach in an empty classroom as he waited for about twenty minutes before Hermione turned up and lead him to the Hogwart's Kitchens.  Once they got inside they were both shocked to find that all the workers were House Elves.

Lifting himself off the stone floor he crawled forward on his hands and knees until he was under her feet as she used his back as her foot stool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry winced as she dug the heels of her boots into his back before she untied them and took them off.  For over an hour Hermione sat in the comfiest chair before the fire using Harry's wand to work on her nails as she used its owner as her living footrest.  Finally deciding to call it a night she lifted her feet of Harry who fell to the floor in exhaustion.  \"Come now boy you still need to take my books up to my room,\" Hermione said prodding Harry with her bare feet.  Struggling back to his hands and knees the exhausted Harry crawled over to Hermione's bag and put it on his back before raising wobbling to his feet.  Hermione started up the girls dormitory's stairwell holding her breath to see if he guess as right.  Harry placed a foot on the bottom most step and almost fell backwards due to his load before he held on to the right backpack strap in a death grip and used his left hand to hold himself off the wall.</span></div></div>",

Hermione had happy thoughts of her day with Harry tomorrow at the village as her House Elf that without even thinking about it began to undress before Harry.  Harry for his part blushed but neither left the room, as he did not have permission to do so yet, or even make a sound as he turned away.  As he did turn his eyes fell upon her wardrobe and found himself walking towards it.  Opening the door he pulled out one of his Governess's dressing gowns, unknown to him that he picked her favorite one, before walking back towards her eyes still diverted.  It seems his feet knew when to stop as he held up the gown just as Hermione was turning around letting him put it on her.  \"Thank you my pet,\" Hermione said giving Harry a peck on his cheek again as she stepped away in he night gown.  \"Now before you go I want to give you this,\" Hermione said as she used her wand to create a small bronze bell and a matching cuff.  \"When I ring this bell there will be no actual noise but if you wear the cuff like a good boy you should be able to feel it and know that I need you.  Now be a good boy and get your sleep we have a full day ahead of us tomorrow,\" Hermione said turning him to the door and sending him on his way with a slight swat to his bottom.  Harry muttered a quick thank you as he slipped the cuff on his right wrist so that he could hide it under his muggle watch.  Hermione smiled to herself as she pulled the covers up to her chin and fell almost instantly to sleep having pleasant dreams of Harry waiting on her hand and foot in the uniform of a normal house elf not the toga type that the Hogwarts ones used but one that resembled a cloth speedo.  Unknown to Hermione, Harry had the same exact dream and was just as happy of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Harry felt a slight buzz on his left wrist and knew that his Governess was summoning him.  He quickly got dressed and head to her the cuff guiding him to her.  Hermione was in the comfy chair before the fire again the bell no where to be seen as Harry approached straightening his robes, something that was causing some snickers behind him for it was a Saturday and a Hogsmede trip yet Harry without even thinking had put on his new dress robes which now looked like a butler's uniform.  Hermione greeted him as he helped her up and so as to not raise suspicion took him by the arm and lead him out.  \"You look very smart today boy,\" Hermione commented as she continued out of the castle leading Harry by her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Governess I thought I should make myself more presentable to you,\" Harry said with a slight bow of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was very good if only you could have a more fitting uniform,\" she muttered thinking of Harry in House Elf attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think a cloth speedo would work at school my Governess,\" Harry said surprising Hermione for a moment .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right you are my pet but I can dream,\" Hermione said playfully patting his arm as they entered the village as Hermione lead them towards....</span></div></div>",

Harry blushing uses his hands to cover his body completely forgetting that Hermione barely seemed to think of him as a sexual object based on her treatment last night of ignoring him as he helped her get changed last night.  Hermione let him worry for a moment before she cast her second spell that turned his pair of boxer-briefs into a look-a-like of the cloth speedo some House Elves wore.  For some reason this change actually makes Harry breath easier as it reminded him of his happy dream from last night.  \"Ah now that looks better on you,\" Hermione said as she walks slowly around Harry inspecting slim body that despite being fourteen years old lacked any trace of muscles yet at the same time devoid of sighs of fat.  \"Yes quite nice,\" Hermione muttered to herself as she pinched and poked Harry's body who just stood still and let Hermione do what she wished to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to bother you Governess but beside the new outfit why are we here?\" Harry asked rather timidly not wanting to over step his bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you are right my pet I got distracted by the vision great dream from last night,\" Hermione said showing she was not upset with him as she patted Harry on his head.  \"I brought us here so that you may better serve me without anyone getting in out way and I just thought you should wear the proper attire,\" Hermione said before pointed her wand at Harry again and casting on another spell on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did that do?\" Harry asked as he looked down but saw no change that the spell seemed to do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is a spell I had found on the scroll form yesterday, it makes it so that only you and me see you as you are now everyone else will see you in normal clothing,\" Hermione said as she used her wand to clean a high backed chair and sat down looking for all the world like an Empress on a throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,' was all Harry said not recalling the scroll at all due to its magic that made him behave like a loyal House Elf.  \"So what can I do for you know?\" Harry asked letting the thought out of his mind as he bowed to his Governess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this place is hardly right for one such as myself so why not get busy and get cleaning,\" Hermione said as she created cleaning supplies for Harry to use.  Harry stood up from his bow and without even thinking of using magic, not that he had his wand at the moment, went and grabbed the dust broom.  Harry began to work his way up and down the room sweeping a clean path until the entire floor was for the first time in how long dust free.  As he worked Hermione went back to using Harry's wand on her nails shooting covert glances at him and admiring his slim body as he worked.  As she worked on her nails Hermione suddenly became aware of at how Harry's wand felt warm in her hand as if it belonged there.  As a test she pointed Harry's wand at the broken bookcase and cast a repair spell.  To her utter surprise the spell worked just as good if not better than a spell from her own wand as the bookcase was instantly fixed but also cleaned making it look like it belonged in a royal palace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hermione cast the spell on the bookcase Harry stopped working using the opportunity to wipe the sweat that had collected on his brow.

After reaching it Harry bent down to pick it up and brought it back to his Goddess.  As Harry dropped his wand into her hand she felt a jolt and knew from her reading that the wand now accepted her as its rightful owner.  Smiling up at Harry, Hermione waved the wand before her eyes.  \"That was a good job fetching, good but not great for as it is a game of fetch you must act like a real dog and chase after it on your hands and knees and then retrieve it with your mouth,\" Hermione said before tossing it out again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned on his heel sinking to his hands and knees and went after the \"stick\" as Hermione watched amazed as he did seem to act as if he was a dog with his tongue hanging out and wiggling his bottom as if he had a tail making he wonder how far she could now affect his mind.  Harry soon found the thrown wand and took it into his mouth before trotting back with such swagger it was like he had just defeat You-Know-Who.  When he reached her Harry opened his mouth and dropped the wand right beside Hermione who decided to test what Harry would do if he came across a situation which a dog was unable to handle would he revert to his normal human reactions or act like a dog.  With great aim Hermione tossed the \"stick\" onto the top of the repaired book shelf.  Harry trotted after it but and even stood up but when he was unable to reach it he just turned back to her and made a slight whining sound deep in his throat.  \"Well that answered that question his will is so submerged by my orders he will follow them no matter what,\" Hermione said to herself before she cast a summoning charm on the wand.  When the wand flew into her hand she began to lightly tap it against her other hand as Harry trotted back over to her head hung low as if in apology for failing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came close Harry put his head in her lap and whined up at her but let out a happy \"yip\" as Hermione rather than saying anything bad just scratched him behind his ears again before she....</span></div></div>",

Either way she knew there was one last stop before removing Harry's humanity for now at least and that was the last bit of clothing.  \"Mutt why are you in clothing only humans can wear clothing,\" Hermione said in a mocked outraged voice making Harry cower and whine up at her as she used a wand to strip Harry of the Elf speedo leaving him fully naked before her.

Whilst she liked the idea of everyone else seeing Harry as a dog, she didn't need to see him that way herself. In fact, it would be far more entertaining for her to see Harry in his present form, behaving like a dog whilst the rest of the school saw him in that fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe therefore adjusted her spell and created an illusion of dog-hood around Harry. The rest of the school would see him as a mangy, small, matted, potentially flea-ridden stray whilst she would know him as he is now. It was a complciated spell, and required a lot of work but of course Hermione could turn her hand to any spell and had invented many of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could even modify the spell if she wished, dropping the illusion for people she chose to allow to see Harry as she saw him, and not as the image of a dog that she had created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, under that illusion, Harry would never need to wear clothes.

Instead she let him have some air, so she would not have to think about allowing him to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was exactly where she wanted him, and she had no intention of moving any time soon. Instead, she picked up a book and started reading, seemingly paying Harry no notice whatsoever, yet still loving his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had no idea what Hermione was doing. She just remained with her butt planted firmly on his face. He had no clue that she was paying him no notice, and was now reading a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when Hermione picked up a book, she could read for hours without moving a muscle. That was exactly what happened now. She was in no hurry, so she relaxed and enjoyed Harry's presence under her backside as she read through her book at her leisurely pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did indeed take her a very long time to read through it, and Harry was trapped under her butt the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hermione considered dressing her boy in house elf clothing, but this thought was overruled by another idea.<br>\r\nThere was a bookstore in Hogsmeade, and now that Harry was her elf, she could instruct him to buy her lots of new books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going shopping, boy\" she told him, keeping a firm grip on his arm as he led her in the direction of the bookstore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, governess\" Harry nodded, feeling a shopping trip was a perfectly sensible suggestion for a Hogsmeade visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got inside, Hermione handed Harry a large basket. \"Keep hold of this, boy, Don't let go, don't drop it, don't put it down and don't let any of the contents fall out. Stay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione led Harry around the bookstore, browsing the booksheves, picking up book after book and dropping them into Harry's basket. A number of the books were quite large, many of them almost as big as Hogwarts: A History for Hermione loved to read and in her eyes, the bigger the book, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dropped more and more books into the basket, it got heavier and after a while, Harry was struggling to carry it but he had to do as she asked. As it filled, Harry was struggling to stay on his feet, and his arms were hurting with the strain of carrying the basket.  As Hermione knew that she would be spending Harry's money, she was going out of her way to buy as many books as she could, and Harry suspected she was buying half the shop. That's what his arms were telling him, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the strain of the weight he was carrying was so great that Harry, now crouching, could barely keep the basket off the ground, Hermione wasn't quite done though, She led Harry up to one last shelf, where she seemed to be deciding which of two particularly-large books she wanted. She stood there for over a quarter of an hour, pondering the decision and smiling as she saw Harry seriously struggling under the colossal weight of the books she had already chosen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she reached a decision and dropped both books into the basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was too much for Harry, who collapsed in a heap, falling against Hermione who dropped on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stupid boy! She exclaimed, slapping him hard across the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, to make up for your incompetence, you will carry both me and the basket over to the counter.\"<br>\r\nHermione seated herself on Harry's back as he slowly managed to force his arms and legs into a kneeling position. When Harry was ready, she picked up the basket of books and rested it against Harry's shoulders, adding its weight to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now walk to the counter\" she told him \"don't let me fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry walked, but it was a strain, carrying both the basket of books and Hermione who remained seated on his back, She ignored the strange looks, the commotion and even the laughter of the other shoppers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the counter, Hermione who was clearly much stronger than Harry, easily lifted the basket onto the counter so the assistant could ring it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited, still seated on Harry as the shop assistant worked. \"Are you sure you can afford all these?\" the assistant asked as that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can\" Hemrione explained \"he'll be paying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe asssistant grunted, and continued, eventually reading out the final bill which came to several hundred galleons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll authrorise the payment from his Gringotts vault\" Hermione pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Vault number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"687\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione filled in most of the authorisation form whilst she remained seated on Harry's back, but the form needed Harry's signature . It was only at that point that Hermione got off Harry's back and pulled him to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign the form, boy\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry signed the form, the assistant accepted the payment and handed Hermione the bags, containing the books Harry had now paid for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carry the bags, boy\" she told him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, and took hold of the heavy load once more as he and Hermione left the shop together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked out, Hermione gave him some further instructions. \"You won't be reading any of these books, boy. From now on, you are forbidden from reading any book, or any text anywhere. Anything you do read, you will forget immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One exception though, you can still sign your name, but only when and where I tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those two simple instructions, Hermione had effectively stifled Harry's education. Not only would he be incapable of reading anything, he could not now follow written instructions. If the professor wrote down instructions in a lesson, or advised students to read from a book or do homework, all these tasks would be beyond Harry's ability. As he could still sign his name though, he could still give permission for Hermione to make payments from his vault. She confirmed this with one additional instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may not withdraw funds from Gringotts vault 687, nor can you make payments from that vault without my express permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled, knowing that with this last instruction she had taken over Harry's entire fortune.</span></div></div>",

Of course, Hemrione forced Harry to keep carrying them, and order him to walk in front so could enjoy watching him struggle with his load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Hermione had bought her new books, she was desperate to start reading but the middle of a crowded street wasn't the right place. Eventually though, they came across a wooden bench that was unoccupied and Hermione ordered Harry to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll sit down and read for a while\" Hermione pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that wooden bench isn't very comfortable, is it boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how I can improve it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, governess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Lay on the bench, boy. on your back with your head at one end and your feet at the other..

Hermione paid him no atttention at all, yet keeping all of her weight on him. She sat firmly, so firmly that Harry was struggling to breathe  The weight of the bags on his legs was nothing compared to the presence of Hermione on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight remained constant, but when a girl sits on you for a long time, as Hermione was sitting on Harry, it feels like with each passing moment she is getting heavier and heavier. A dull ache started in his ribs, and spread thoughout his chest until it felt like a throbbing pain By now it felt like a young female elephant was sitting on him, and Harry was struggling to expand his lungs and take in much-needed air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Hermione knew how much Harry was suffering, she didn't seem to care, and did nothing to relieve his pain. She simply continued to sit on him, and read. her book. Harry didn't notice, but Hermione was smiling quite often. Maybe she knew more then she was letting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Hermione forgotten about changing Harry's clothes. By now, her book seemed to have erased that thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed slowly, if it passed at all and for over an hour Hermione continued to sit on Harry and read her book.</span></div></div>",

As this was a Hogsmeade weekend, Ginny was dressed not in her school robes, but rather in a muggle-style dress and her long red hair hung loosely down her back. Ginny was a beautiful girl with a strong physique and a firm yet feminine body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Hermione. I'm not interrupting am I?\" she asked, noticing that Hermione had a book in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" Hermione smiled back, closing her book and putting it back in her bag which was still resting on Harry's legs. Even though she loved to read, Hermione always had time to speak with Ginny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering where Harry was, have you seen him anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually I know exactly where Harry is at this very moment.\" Hermione giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny did, and noticed that there was something or rather someone between Hermione and the bench, someone Harry-shaped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny stifled a giggle herself, with some difficulty. \"Does Harry mind that you are sitting on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's instruction that Harry be quiet had silenced him, he found himself unable to answer Ginny's question, unable even to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, I asked you a question\" Ginny repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he is ignoring you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's bring rude\" Ginny pointed out \"answer me Harry, or you are going to make me cross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry said nothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny did something she never thought she would do to Harry Potter; she swung her arm and struck him across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a light slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a reasounding crack as Ginny slapped him HARD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt a sudden pain spread across his face from the point where Ginny had slapped him, as though his face was suddenly engulfed in flames. The intense pain was too much for Harry, and despite Hermione's instruction to be quiet, he let out an agonizing scream. Harry's cheek was turning red and throbbing with pain. The sting of the slap hurt so much that it brought tears to Harry's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed\" Hermione smiled, and Ginny actually smiled back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are not mute after all, Harry\" she pointed out \"will you answer my question or do you want me to slap you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he wants another slap\" Hermione advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want another slap, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nod your head, Harry\" Hermione instructed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded and Ginny slapped him again, even harder than before. This time a trickle of blood startled to flow down Harry's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I would object to seeing you sitting on Harry Potter, but I am thinking maybe you have the right idea\" Ginny mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join me\" Hermione suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Ginny pondered.</span></div></div>",

Ginny lifted that bag with ease; the bag that Harry couldn't move at all but which Ginny, like Hermione had no problem handling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow holding the bag, Ginny turned so that her back was to Harry, and then she sat down heavily, dropping firmly onto the area of Harry's legs that the bag had occupied a moment before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now sitting on Harry's legs and Hermione on his chest With Hermione's legs dangling loosely over the edge of the seat, Harry's arm was also trapped in a prison of girl-flesh.

As she was no longer guiding him by his arm Harry took his now normal space three steps behind his Governess head down to make sure he followed her steps exactly.  \"Ah here we go this looks like a good place to go to next,\" Hermione said as she lead Harry into a supply store to buy quills and parchment as these were not that expensive she used her own money but still made Harry carry the good and when she was at the register she had him get on his hands and knees for her to sit on him as she worked out the price and order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done Hermione decided that since she could not have Harry in the traditional House Elf uniform she could at least pick out some clothing for him of her own taste so she lead him to a clothing shop with more extreme taste and larger supply than the one in DIagon Ally.  Smiling Hermione entered in to find the right outfits for Harry to wear as he served her trailing her fingers along the material of the clothing not worrying about either the price or the size as they could be altered to better fit her new human toy.  For once Hermione had Harry just stand in place as she begins to collect outfits that she thinks will look good on him treating him like a living mannequin as she used a clothing store's special magic that allows people to see what they would like in the clothes they picked out.

As she tries to decide she did what she normally did when trying to make a hard decision, she paced which without meaning to took her into part of the shop that was more fetish wear and to her shock she found an bunch of outfits that resembled House Elf uniforms.  Great now she had three outfits choices, but that was easy to deal with it as she decided no matter what she got Harry to wear she would also go with the House Elf outfits.

Now Hermione would be the one to ask about anything a person wanted to find out about but as she was still down at the Ball Ginny began to look at the collections of books left for anyone's use in the Common Room.  Finding one that looked promising.  As she began to look through it Ginny began to smile as it talked about wand ownership and transfer of power.

Secondhand wands were often donated by the surviving family of the deceased. Unless they were \"conquered\" before they died, then the full ownership dies with them. The wand wouldn't work as well with another owner. This gave Ginny the idea that she should maybe get Harry a secondhand wand for him to use. The book then explained the legend of the Elder Wand, the existence of which many doubted, which changed hands many times, after the previous owners kept getting killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny put the book down and decided to write a letter addressed to a store in Diagon Alley that sold secondhand wands. She asked for a wand since she had a \"friend\" that needed a replacement wand. Since she knew that Harry's wand was made of holly and had a phoenix feather, she also asked that the wand not be made of holly and not have phoenix feathers. This would only make the wand that much harder for Harry to use. She then went to Harry's room and got out his money and pulled out ten galleons (which was more than enough) and told the owner to keep the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny then headed to the owlery to deliver her letter, leaving Harry alone in the closet.  </span></div></div>",

As she walked over she saw that evidently Harry had woken up and been found for in the middle of a circle of the girls Harry was laying on his back his eyes wide open as they stepped and ran their bare feet all over him.  She would have thought he would have cried out for help from other people of the house before she saw that he had something stuffed down his throat.

That was not what he paid attention to. A wonder; a beauty more brilliant than any other in the world; Fleur Delacoeur. She stood in the nude, turned away from him as she stood under the waterfall. Her awe-inspiring posterior was near-hypnotic, and Harry had already cum. Her beautiful blonde wet shining hair draped over her perfect, unblemished back. Her long pale legs. Harry had already cummed five times, and then she turned around. Her wonderful face; he came. Her DD - perfectly sized - brilliant, impeccable bosom; he came; he came; he came. Her flat, toned midriff; he came. Her vagina, godlike, more brilliant, wonderful, awe inspiring, seductive, arousing, spectacular than any Greek goddess's. He came, came, came, came, came. Her long legs that could wrap around his body with no trouble. He came, and fell to his knees, desperately ripping off his clothes, infatuated with; and devoted to; the goddess before him.

Sporting his Gryffindor robes, he stepped out on to the pitch, his firebolt in his hand, ready to  The pitch looked deserted, unlike last year when the stands had been full of students cheering for his team, and their rivals. Despite everything that happened though, including an invasion by a group of dementoris, the Gryffindor team had emerged victorious in the end, and Wood had achieved his dream of claiming the cup in his final year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point though, it had been too long in his mind since he had taken to the air, and he felt a strong desire to get up in to the clouds once more. He had watched the World Cup during the summer ,which he had visited with his favourite Weasley family, and now quidditch and flying were in his blood once more. He had caught the bug and now he would take it out for a little exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was however, no the only person to come out on to the quidditch pitch that day. A girl dressed in Ravenclaw colours sat in the stands, not far away and she did not seem pleased to see Harry there. It was because of Harry that Ravenclaw had been denied the cup, they had lost when they should have trounced Gryffindor. She sighed, how much she had longed to hold that cup and Presumptuous Potter hand kept it from her grasp. She had wanted to annihilate Harry on this pitch last year, and he had instead defeated her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he was though, just a few paces from where she sat. Alone, with only his wand for company. If there was any time to take revenge for what happened last year, this seemed like the perfect opportunity, he looked so vulnerable just now, so very vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith determination in her stride, she stepped out on to the quidditch pitch and faced her rival. \"Well, well Harry\" she mused \"fancy seeing you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came for some practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came to gloat\" she retorted \"it was not enough for you to win last year, a win you stole from me I will add. You now come out on to the pitch to gloat and throw your pathetic victory in my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Cho. That is not true at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true Harry, I can see for myself and this, this is my response.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Response? Cho?\"</span></div></div>",

The more she thought of this idea, the more it amused her. She took out her wand and pointed it directly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cho?\" Harry called to her again \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't wait. Cho quickly cast ropes from her wand which wrapped around Harry, and the broom he was holding, the way he was holding it, the broom secured itself against his back... better and better. She kept adding rope until Harry's arms, leegs and chest were all so securely fastened to his own broom that he couldn't move at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" she exclaimed, admiring her handiwork \"I'd better make sure those ropes are nice and tight though. You wouldn't want to fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall? I am on the ground, Cho?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made some pretect of testing the ropes which were clearly tight and held the boy securely in place, then grinning she pushed against his back with some force and he fell, his face hitting the grass of the pitch. \"Oops\" she offered an insincere apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you are on the ground, Harry\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry now lay with his stomach on the ground, his broom still fastened to his back. Cho at that point stepped over him and stood over his chest, facing towards his head, legs on either side of his fallen body. She raised her right hand and in a clear and confident voice stated \"UP\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe broom rose a foot or so into the air, pulling Harry up with it. She felt his back touching her inner thighs, and decided that Harry felt rather good there. Grasping the top end of Harry's broom, just above where his shoulders were she bend her knees and seated herself upon the lower part, just as though Harry was not bound to it, which of course he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling openly now, she took to the skies, riding her Harry-broom and letting it lift her up into the clouds. Harry, whose face was pointed downwards saw the ground falling away from him at incredible speed, and soon he was floating high above, with only the ropes that held him to his own broom preventing him from falling. He had no idea where the broom would take him, no control whatsoever. Cho was in charge now, not him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love flying, don't you Harry?\" she called down to him as she squezed his chest between her thighs \"the freedom, the control. What's that, don't you have either of those things...well I guess they are all mine then. My flight, my broom and right now even My Harry. I can do anything I want with you, even this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Harry felt the ground approach at high speed as Cho allowed her broom to drop out of the clouds and down towards the ground. Was this it? Was she going to dash him against the ground, he surely could not survive such an impact. He felt terrified, his life flashed before his eyes which he was almost certain was about to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't though, at the last minute Cho pulled up and rose back in to the clouds. It was the very last minute too, Harry had almost collided with the earth, another moment and he would have hit, and right now he would feel much safer in the air, even if he was tied to his own broom with Cho riding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is called the Wronski Feint, Harry\" Cho informed him \"it is a dangerous move performed by professional seekers, not pathetic little wannabees like you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From some hidden place she took hold of a small, golden ball; a snitch, and released it. The snitch soon took off of its own accord, zipping around the pitch. Cho watched it for a time then she too zoomed after it, taking her Harry-broom along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose, she fell, she zig-zagged, she sped up, slowed down, all the controls of an expert flyer at her fingertips and she used them expertly. At tmes she even stopped suddenly in the middle of a fast run then took off in the opposite direction. She paid no attention to Harry's condition right now, she was a seeker once more, in search of her small golden prize and Harry was simply along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she broom flew in whichever direction Cho pointed it, stopped, started, shuddered and however else she instructed, Harry felt like he was being thrown in all directions. The broom was responding to her, not to him and she really knew how to use it. He began to feel physically sick, so much so that he even threw up a number of times, but of cause his head was angled downwards so the contents of his intestines took the most natural path to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry however was far from the ground, he was up in the air, with Cho riding both the broom itself, and him by extension. As she flew, her thighs gripped him tightly round the middle, too tight He wouldn't be surprised if he ended this little endeavour of hers with several broken ribs The speed she was traveling actually magnified the pressure that she exerted on him, and the g-forces were no small matter either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Cho did manage to catch the snitch, but not after it felt like she had been making the attempt for at least half an hour.</span></div></div>",

Harry felt himself being lifted off the ground.  She looked at Harry and how ragged he looked and realize she couldn't afford to be seen with him.  She cast a spell that turned Harry invisible.  Then to be sure he didn't say anything she stunned him.

He inhaled and looked at the Cho. She was beatiful as always and she was wearing her uniform but Harry could see that there wasn't anything beneath her robes. He could see her cleavage very clearly. Harry tried not to look at it but he failed and started at her cleavage lustfully. He wanted to worship those perfect breasts but he suddenly heard a cough. The source of it was Cho.

On the way to Gryffindor Tower, she saw Cedric Diggory approach Harry and decided to eavesdrop on their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If they discuss anything about the next task, then I can sabotage Harry's chances of doing well' thought Parvati. She overheard Cedric not only tell Harry about taking a bath with the egg and even told Harry about the location of the prefects' bathroom and the password. Parvati smiled at the bonus she got about hearing that; relaxing in the prefects' bathroom would be pretty sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the trio go into the Common Room but waited a few minutes before she went up to the Fat Lady and her friend Vi.After she had waited, she entered the Common Room and saw that Harry was alone. She could tell that the trio were arguing and from the looks of it, Hermione and Ron both went up to bed and Harry had decided to hang in the Common Room alone for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're not going to bed yet\" said Parvati, making Harry jump a bit since he didn't know he wasn't alone. He turned around and when he saw Parvati, he gulped at her, with slight fear in his eyes as he remembered the poor date they shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Hermione and Ron were arguing and I didn't want to get in the midle so I'm giving Ron a chance to fall aslep before I go up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't have that fear, coward. Hermione and I may not be as close as you three are, but you and Ron were horrible dates to me and my sister so I'm on her side.\" Parvati had made a mental note to become better friends with Hermione. With Ron's attitude tonight and Harry's wishy-washy attitude in just being a bystander in that argument, she felt that she could drive a wedge between their friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, Parvati. I know I was a horrible date and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it, Harry. I don't want to hear your excuses. You had your chance to make the night enjoyable for me and you failed. For that you will pay.\" said Parvati. She then walked up to Harry and punched him straight on the face and sent him to the ground. Harry could barely register as Parvati then walked to him and started kicking him inn his ribs, hoping that that would cause bruising. She ten picked him up by the robes and saw that Harry was disoriented. She then scowled at this dress robes and used the Severing Charm to tear his robes and clothes underneath to shreds. By the time she was done with them, they fell off of his body in rags, leaving him in his underwear, socks, and shoes. She picked up the various pieces of his robes and clothes and tossed  them in the fireplace. At that point, Harry became aware of what Parvati was doing and approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parvati, why'd you do that?\" asked Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I wanted to\" said Parvati as she turned and glared at Harry, causing him to step back in fear. She then saw the nearest couch and pushed him into it. Harry gasped his breath right before Parvati sat right on top him, trapping him underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are going to be very different from now on, Harry. What I just did to you is a small taste to what you'll face starting tomorrow. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Parvati.\" said Harry. He was merely agreeing to her, hoping that she would stop and then calm herself in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you better get to bed\" said Parvati as she stood up and faced Harry. \"But before that, Obliviate!\" The only memories she erased was his conversation with Cedric and the fact that she had cast that spell.. 'No way are you going to have any idea of how to be ready for the Second Task' thought Parvati with a smirk. \"Good night\" said Parvati as she went to the Fourth Girls' Dorm Room. Harry waited ntil she left beefore he went up to his own dorm room and was glad to see that everyone ese was asleep. He got into his bed and was hoping that Parvati woud calm down tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

He had come to this room to be alone, to ponder quietly to himself over how on earth he had been entered into the Triwizard Tournament had how he had managed to tie for second place. He didn't even dare to ponder the next question... what was he going to do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had not closed the door behind him though, he had left it slightly ajar.<br>\r\nThe door opened, and Gabrielle entered the room, smiling when she saw Harry sitting alone and knowing instinctively that her opportunity had come and what she should do to him first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabrielle wore casual clothes, for as she was only 8 years of age she had not yet earned her place at Beauxbatons. Today she was dressed in a pale blue top and navy coloured short skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into the room and quietly closed the door behind her. Perhaps in a moment she could use Harry's own wand to cast a locking spell, or force Harry to do so. She really did not want anybody to disturb her at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently she stepped over towards Harry who still didn't seem to have noticed her, even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was right next to him, so close that she was surprised he hadn't noticed her, she dropped into place, sitting fully open the seat that Harry was already occupying, Her skirt-covered backside pressed down firmly upon him, her knees bent over the edge of the chair but her feet did not touch the floor. Her full weight bore down upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww, Gerroff!\" Harry called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me\" she challenged in response. Gabrielle could see how weedy a boy Harry was, he probably wouldn't have enough strength to shoo off a fly who had landed on his lap, and she was far more significant than a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry struggled and tried to move her, but Gabrielle had claimed him as he seat and she was not going to be budged. She focused her mind and her body on sitting on him and holding him down, and no matter how much Harry struggled, he couldn't move her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't, can you?\" she taunted him \"the famous Harry Potter is now my seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry slimped in defeat, he knew she was right. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked her \"you sound a bit like that French girl, Fleur\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Gabrielle, her sister\" she answered him \"her EIGHT year old sister.\"<br>\r\nShe drew attention to her age as she spoke, making it clear that Harry had been subdued by a girl almost half his age and all she had done was sit on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only eight, you feel heavier than that\" Harry remarked without thinking.<br>\r\nGabrielle immediately swung her arm back and slapped him across the top of his head. \"I am not fat\" she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blow knocked his glasses off his head, and the dropped on to the floor. Gabrielle let them stay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did however reach into Harry's pocket and took out his wand, then to Harry's surprise she cast a locking spell on the door. \"Now we definitely won't be disturbed\" she approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You locked it? Who taught you the spell?\" Harry was still stunned that tihs girl was only 8 years old, surely too young to learn magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been watching my sister\" Gabrielle informed him \"I know a few spells and now I have a wand to work them with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is my wand\"<br>\r\n\"It was your wand, now I have it.\"<br>\r\n\"Give it back.\"<br>\r\n\"Take it!\" Gabrielle put Harry's wand in her own pocket.

It didn't matter to her. <i>It's not like he needs to be manly...</i> She was surprised that he'd made no move to stop her. <i>If only he were a little more resistant to pain</i>, she cackled in her mind, lowering his trousers below his groin. But he was breathing heavily, his eyes pained; his was barely seeing what was in front of him. Her foot had hit him hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" She breathed in false surprise. Her hands had paused in their work; her knuckles were brushing over his pants, \"What's this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blinked rapidly. The throb in his balls was pulsing, sending sparks of pain up his spine. Most of his thoughts were centred on that awful pain, but they were just beginning to clear. Slowly, he looked down, seeing Rita's tanned fingers around the hem of his trousers. <i>What the...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita glanced up at him; her eyes narrowed, and she hurried, \"I think there might be swelling,\" She said, and quickly hooked her fingers under his elastic muggle underpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were cold on his skin, and Harry, finally realising what was happening, began to struggle, shuffling his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita yanked down, and pulled her hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA levitating camera flashed, blinding Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Said Rita, smiling wickidly. She was looking down at Harry, his trousers and underpants around his ankles, his nearly hairless crotch exposed. She tutted, \"I can't believe you began to get an erection from a woman kicking you in the testicles!\" She hunched down a little, peering closer, \"Not that it's easy to tell. And I can't believe how underdeveloped the Boy Who Lived's penis is, readers would like to know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stared up at her, frozen, stupified. Belatedly, he tried to cover himself, \"I, er-\" He shuffled on his bum, turning over, and moved to pull his trousers up. Red hot humiliation flowed through his veins. His cheeks were so red he could've been a berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Harry,\" Rita sang, easily turning him back over. She waved her wand; it's tip lit green. Harry tried to speak, but no words came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's not the time for an interview - not yet,\" Rita grinned, leering over him predatorily. She tapped the floating camera, and it flew back into her garish handbag, \"Now's the time for you to listen,\" Then she sat back down as though nothing had happened. With another wish of her wand, she turned Harry's seat back up too, \"Take a seat - but leave your pants down,\" Her smile was sharp, her green eyes laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, circumspectly, Harry did as he was told, trying to make himself as small as possible. He crossed his legs awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita waggled her finger and pointed, \"No no Harry dear, none of that. You open your legs nice and wide,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sat frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Or I send that photo of you - from face to meagre cock - straight to the Daily Prophet,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry grimaced; his hands shook. His throat was parched, and his heart hammered in his chest. Even so, painfully slowly, he opened his legs, revealing his flaccid cock and balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Harry,\" Rita took the time to examine his genetalia properly. She saw that his penis was indeed quite small - not microscopic, not anywhere near - but short and thin enough to be at least an inch below average. His testes were bigger, actually rather large. She though that, perhaps, with him being young, he might grow larger. Her tongue flicked across her lips, <i>probably not.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we're going to have an interview, and it's going to go splendidly, and then we're going to talk about how you can be a good interviewee in the future,\" She held her wand aloft again, \"Now, I'm going to un-silence you, and you're not going to shout. You're not going to question me - you're going to keep those little legs wide open, so I can see your little penis, and you're going to think very carefully about your answers... Remember what sells papers - what people want to hear... And see. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Harry nodded, his cheeks burning. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He looks down to his hands to see breasts, and suddenly realizes the figure he saw was his reflection in a mirror. After he panics for a bit, he looks at himself in the mirror, blushing red as he does. She(as Harry will now be referred to as) had bright red hair, going to her waist, and the same emerald green eyes she had as a boy. She was a couple of inches shorter, and her skin was more white. Her body was thinner, much like a girls was. Her breasts, she thought blushing, were about a c cup if she knew correctly. As she was looking herself in the mirror, a figure came behind her and puled her into a hug. Harry could not help a moan from escaping her mouth as one dainty hand came to cup her right breast, fondling it and playing with her nipple. The other hand reached down to her vagina, fingering it and sending waves of pleasure running through Harry's new body. Harry could feel soft and perky breasts pressing against her back as the owner the the hands entwined their legs together. Harry's moaning increased as the person began to nibble on her earlobe. This went on for a bit until Harry could no longer hold it and came for the first time as a female. It was amazing, was what Harry thought as she came. \"Do you like your new and better body now Rose?

Suddenly, Daphne takes out her wand and waves it, banishing all but the stalking on her legs. Idly, Rose also believes she conjured stalking onto her own legs, as she can feel soft and silky smooth leather overtake her legs up to her thighs.

Rose starts to once again suck Daphne's dick while fingering the futa's pussy. Daphne, while moaning from the pleasure she was feeling, began to lap up Rose's pussy, while fingering the girl's ass, causing the boy-turned-girl to moan more while sucking Daphne's fully erect dick. They start to go at each other with more intensity, before they finally come into each others mouths. As they recovered from their respective climaxes, they swallowed the loads that came into their mouthes, Daphne doing so with a content smirk on her face while licking the delicious cum on it, while  Rose just swallowed it completely, not missing any of it. She begins to glow after swallowing all of Daphne's cum, causing her to moan a bit, before the glow dies out. Daphne smiles at her lover, saying :That was the end result of a magical ritual fully binding you to me. It is down by climaxing into the recipients mouth, before the cum fully binds the magical core of the swallowed to the comer, making it so they would forever be link. Now our cores and minds are linked, and we are seen as lovers in the eyes of Magic itself.\" Daphne explains to Rose. She then begins to move over to the girl, with another lustful expression on her face. \"There is one more ritual for use to do. Once done, our powers and bodies will fully mature in such a way we will be much greater than before.\" Daphne explains as she leers over Rose.</span></div></div>",

She asks, \"Daphne, while I am able to understand not including in the beginning, why did you not call me when the kinky stuff started!?\" She then starts to berate Daphne for going on without out, causing Daphne to look sheepish. Rose only looked on in amusement at what was happening. Tracy then stripped to her stalking, showcasing her c cup breasts to the world, along with her silky brown hair and smooth white skin. She then started to suck off Daphne, causing the futa to moan in pleasure. Rose was aroused at watching the two go at it, and began fingering herself, bringing herself to  a high. Coincidentally, all three came at the same time, with the ritual finishing with Tracy also bound to Daphne.

She knew that at least one person from Hufflepuff, a boy called Cedric had entered his name and whilst she didn't know Cedric that well he was an older boy after all, she hoped that her own house might be given the glory of being chosen to compete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that when Cedric Diggory's name was announced, Susan applauded lously, delighted that the Hogwarts champion would be a Hufflepuff. She heard the names of the champions from the other two schools being announced but they didn't matter. Cedric was both a Hogwarts Student and a member of her own house, he would have her full support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCedric and the other two champions were sent out of the hall, clearly to receive further instructions and Susan felt sure that the goblet had now finished its task and she could get down to the serious business of cheering for her house champion,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblet wasn't done yet though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spat another name out into the astonished waiting hand of the headmaster, who read out the name Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an earth was going on? What had that Potter boy done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry Potter... Susan didn't know him all that well, she hadn't been all that bothered about him before. She knew he was famous and why but she had tended to leave him alone. Harry Potter had his own firends, he didn't need random girls from other houses bothering him everywhere he went. She had no connection to Potter, he was outside of her sphere of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry Potter was in her own year, he was too young to compete and yet somehow he had tricked the goblet into entering him into the tournament alongside whoever else would be chosen to represent Hogwarts, and that other prerson was the boy from her house. Cedric deserved to be in the contest, he was of the right age and he had entered himself. Whatever Harry Potter had done, he did not belong there, and by taking part he was interfering in her house's race for glory and making a mockery of the whole tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat upstart boy needed to be brought down a peg or two, and she decided that she would be the one to do it. She would show him the consequences of his actions, dominate him, keep his mind on her and distract him from the tournament. She would keep him under her thumb, take away any hope he had of ever getting anywhere in the competition, leaving the door open for her fellow Hufflepuff to claim the prize?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even after the tournament ended, she could make sure Harry Potter regretted his decision for the rest of his life.</span></div></div>",

Then all of a sudden, he heard his name called from the last table he expected to call out his name in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry! Harry!

To Harry's great surprise, the rest of the Hufflepuffs were smiling at him. Considering his options with how his best friends were mad at him, Harry went over to the Hufflepuff table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Harry didn't know was that when the champions were still in the room, Susan was able to convince the rest of her table to act nice to Harry for now and in return, she promised that she would get revenge on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harry sat down next to the girl that called him, he saw a girl next to her that he also recognized by appearance, but not name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" replied Harry. \"I was so afraid that everyone would believe that I entered the tournament in the first place. Umm, I'm sorry, but what are your names again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed and said \"Really, Harry? Are you really that inattentive to the other other people in our year that you don't know all our names?

Almost everyone in the room was ignoring him, and those that did happen to look towards him had angry or disapproving expressions on their faces.

Elves are bound to their owners Harry, they don't have the freedom to wander off on their own and they can only perform magic with their owner's permission. As excuses go, that is the weakest one I ever heard. Clearly you perfoemed that spell, Harry. You live with muggles so nobody else in your hosue coud have done it. Being ignorant of the ways of wizarding society you come up with a stupid alabi that holds less water than a broken glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must think I'm stupid, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan slapped him again, then she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A year later, you cast a spell upon your muggle aunt. Don't deny it, she was seen by the muggles. Ministry witches and wizards had to reverse the spell and mindwipe a vast number of bewildered muggles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that onvenient, Harry. I know you don't get along with the muggles you live with, clearly you decided to teach one of them a magical lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all fits, Harry. You think you are above the rules don't you, that they somehow don't matter to you. You haven't paid attention to age rules before, so why should you care about this one. Given your record, it is obvious that you put your own name in that goblet, you hoped to compete against far more capable witches and wizards in a series of tests that quite frankly you ill equipped to overcome. You don't stand a chance, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shuddered, this was one fact that he could not deny. If the triwizard tournament was as dangeous as it seemed, and the age restriction clearly showed that it was then he wa completely out of his depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked at Harry trembling beside her and she smiled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of them suggested to that prefect boy that it was time the password was changed, he then left for a few minutes to talk with The Fat Lady, she then advised the other students that you should not be told the new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is she?\" Harry wondered, he suddenly got an idea in his head but it sounde absured, she wouldn't to that.

All he could do was watch as Susan filled her plate with assorted delicious items and chatted with Hanneh who wa sitting beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did pass him some dry bread and a couple of slices of chese though. \"From the look of you, this is the size of your usual meal\" she pointed out \"a full feast is clearly way beyond your appetitie.\" She glossed over the fact that Harry had been eating his fill at the Gryffindor table for over three years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate, the girls continued to discuss Harry's situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think any of those Gryffindors will relent and allow Harry back into their common room?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah shook her head. \"They sounded serious about excluding him\" she replied \"not that it matters anyway. I know the new password which means we both know him. If he does manage to get inside then we can easily go in after him. Considering how the rest of Gryffindor now feel about him, I don't think he'd want to go back there anyway. I don't think it'd be safe for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we should bring him into our common room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could. I know the others won't bother him. I'm sure they'll leave him to us.\" She wasn't quite ready to tell Harry that the apparently welcoming smiles among her fellow Hufflepuffs were all fake... yet. She would wait until she had him in her lair before she reeeled the whole truth. She also had nothing to do with the Gryffindors kicking him out of their common room either but that suited her plans for him perfectly. She had wondered at first how she might pull him away from the lions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noted that there was something she did like about Harry, he was a very comfortable seat. She noted this to Hannah at one point and her friend smiled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quarter of an hour later the desserts arrived on the table and Susan helped herself to a generous potion of chocolate cake and ice cream, but she didn't give Harry any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the feast, the students started filing out of the Great Hall, heading towards their respetive common rooms.</span></div></div>",

This didn't bode well for his own chances if the password had indeed been changed. As he neared the Fat Lady, the two girls ducked behind one of the stauies in the hallway, and watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stood before the fat lady, the portrait asked for the password, as it always did. Harry gave the same password that had afforded him entry the previous day, not entirely sure if the two Hufflepuff girls had spoken the truth when they told him it had been changed. He had only their word after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fat Lady did not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a short distance away, a girl's voice chuckled. It was a familair voice, but it didn't belong to either Hannah or Susan. It was a voice he had known for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the new password, Hemrione?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Harry\" her voice answered \"what makes you think I'm going to tell you? I am the one who evicted you Harry, and now you are out... permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about my trunk, all my things are in my dorm and you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to learn to live without them, Harry. Don't accuse me of stealing them either. I haven't taken anything, your stuff is still here, waiting for you. All you need to do is come inside and claim it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, not without the password.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a shame\" Hermione didn't sound sympathetic. Harry looked over to where her voice was coming from, he could hear her but he couldn't see her at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you can no longer get into the common room Harry, it seems you are a Gryffindor in name only\" she continued \"if you lost us any points though, I will personally come and pay you a visit. Be aware that Filch's detentions are nothing compared with what I will do to you if you lose us the house cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do to me?\" Harry asked, foolishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask\" Hermione purred as she pulled of Harry's invisibility cloak and threw it on the floor beside her she had been wearing it the whole time, she came forward and stodd right in front of him. She took Harry's wand out of his pocket and held it it both hands, horizontally near the top of his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" she asked as she swiftly raised her knee, connecting with both Harry's groin and his wand at the same time. His wand snapped instantly and Harry felt a sudden intense pain in his genitals, He cried out in agony and dropped to the floor. Hermione dropped the wand pieces down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you will have to sleep out here tonight\" she told him \"that is something I can help you with.\" She wanted to get inside and find her own bed, but she didn't want Harry giving the true password to the fat lady, she still had to deal with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew out her own wand and cast a full body bind spell on Harry. As his limbs locked thmeselves to his sides, Hermione through his invisibility cloak over him and Harry instantly vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to put you to sleep, Harry\" she advised as she stood over him, her legs either side of where she knew his face would be, then she dropped into place, sitting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry suddenly found his airway sealed off as Hermione seated herself over his nose and mouth. She sat with her kneese bend, her legs either side of him, her butt planted firmly on his face. She knew Harry was helpless and smothering beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom their hiding place behind the statue, Susan and Hannah watched, enjoying the show and yet hoping to remain as quiet as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes later that Hermione stood, She knew that Harry would be unconscious by now and indeed he was. Reaching her hand down though she could feel his pulse and his breathing, he was alive but passed out, just as she wanted him.  As she made her way over to the fat lady and spoke the correct password, she looked over at the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is yours now girls\" she informed the pair if Hufflepuffs, apparently fully aware of their presence \"as far as Gryffindor is concenred we don't want him any more.\" She then walked into the Gryffindor common room and the door closed behind her.</span></div></div>",

Now she was gone and only two other people knew where Harry was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the entirity of Gryffindor house, except for Harry now in their common room and no doubt heading up to their beds, Susan and Hannah walked up to where Harry was resting. \"Let's take him back to our common room\" Susan suggested \"Hermione said that he was ours now, and I agree completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the cloak?\" Hannah asked \"should we remove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, leave it on him. People might ask questions if we are seen carrying a sleeping Harry Potter downstairs. With his cloak on nobody willl know he is with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except we need to grab hold of hom somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find his arms, they'll be stuck to his sides thanks to that body bind but he'll be easier to carry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls felt around his body until they each located what were clearly his arms. Taking are to make sure that the cloak didn't slip, they then lifted him up, and started carrying him back down the corridor and finally down the stairs heading back to the main entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't light, the girls noticed but he wasn't heavy eather. Being the thin and scrawny boy he was, it was easy enough for both of the girls to carry him together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had made it down to the ground floor, the girls continued to carry Harry as they decende another staircase which led to the lower levels of the castle. They didn't encounter anyone, the rest of the students were now in their common rooms and yet it would still be a few minutes before the staff started patrolling ther castle. Even if a professor did find then, they were heading the right way, going towards their common room so only someone as mean spirited as Snape woudl accuse them of being out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls arrived at the Hufflepuff common room and it was Hannah who let go of Harry for a moment in order to gain entry. Once the door was open, they dragged him inside together and pulled him up on to one of the many sofas in the main room. It was only at this point that Susan removed his invisibility cloak and the still-unconscious Harry Potter could now be seen, frozen yet laid across the sofa with his feet at one end and his head at the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in the morning, Harry\" Susan remarked as she and Hannah made their way up the staircase to the girls' dorms, still holding his invisibility cloak in her hands.</span></div></div>",

What he felt was the full weight of the two Hufflepuff girls; Susan and Hannah. They were sitting on him, Susan was sitting on his chest and Hannh on his groin. As Harry 's body was no longer stiff and rigid as he had been when under the spell, their butts had actually sunk down into him, pressing his body firmly into the sofa beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no longer wearing his Hogwarts robes, they were on a nearby side-table along with his school tie, if that was still his tie. His Hogwarts tie was red and gold, the colours of Gryffindor but that one was jet black. He could see too that the robes no longer held the Gryffindor emblem over the breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are not my clothes\" were the frist words out of Harry's lips that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but they are\" Hannah purred she showed him the name badges on his robes and his school tie, which all student clothes were requried to carry. The name read \"Harry Potter\" and it was written in his own handwriting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in Gryffindor\" Harry pointed out \"there are no Gryffindor colours on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were in Gryffindor\" Susan told him \"you were kicked out of the common room last night, the Gryffindors got together and ejected you. Your robes have reverted to their original state. This clearly proves you are not a Gryffindor any more,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the sorting hat would say to you now Harry\" Hannah queried \"we could ask it I suppose but I'm not sure whey they put it after the ceremony concludes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw it in Dumbledore's office when I was sent to him once, it was during the Chamber of Secrets incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing in Dumbledore's office, were you a nuaghty boy, Harry\" Susan asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but everyone at the time thought I was the Heir of Slytherin, even some of your lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" Hannah nodded \"Ernie in particular was convinced it was you, he half convinced me but we both know you are no Slytherin, you belong with us in Hufflepuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sorting hat told me I would have done well in Slytherin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well clearly it knew you weren't ever meant to join the lions. Maybe you need to be re-sorted Harry. You are clearly not a Gryffindor any longer so until the sorting hat says otherwise, you will stay with us in Hufflepuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, what about classes? I still take my lessons with the Gryffindors don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not a good idea, since the whole of Gryffindor house has turned against you, and your robes have unsorted you\" Susan advised \"I'll ask Professor Sprout if you  can work with us instead. You will come with us to Herbology, it is our first class of the day and it will be the perfect time to ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One other thing\" Hannah told him \"as you are no longer Gryffindor, there really isn't any point you cheering for the Gryffindor team, I doubt they would welcome your support anyway. From now on, your allegiance should be to Hufflepuff, and to our own seeker Cedric Diggory; the true Hogwarts Champion. You should get used to cheering for Cedric since it is he, not you who will win the triwizard cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I don't feel like cheering for Cedric?\" Harry asked, his tone defiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Hannah both started grinding down upon him, sitting on him even more firmly. \"Owwwww, fine\" Harry gasped and Susan nodded \"In tame, Harry, you will learn to do as we say\" Susan told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they walked in, they made sure to walk closely by the professors' table so that they could see that Harry no longer had Gryffindor colors or symbol on his robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me a moment, Harry\" interrupted Professor McGonagall. \"Did you alter your robe yourself or did they change on their own.\" She said this in a very serious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They changed on their own, Professor McGonagall. The other Gryffindors evicted him from their Common Room and his robes changed by the morning\" said Susan in a voice loud enough so that the entire Great Hal could hear. Soon enough, the Great Hall was buzzing with gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. If it is unanimous by every single Gryffindor student, then you are indeed kicked out of Gryffindor and must be re-sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" asked Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an old rule set by the Founders. If there is an unanimous decision by every House student to kick one other person out, they must be re-sorted into one of the other 3 Houses. All it takes is one person to not want you out to prevent it. Since it just takes one person in a House to be against it, this has never actually happened in Hogwarts' history. You are the first to be unanimously evicted from your House. Furthermore, if you get re-sorted into a 2nd House and they unanimously reject you as well, you'll be re-sorted into the remaning 2 Houses and if the 3rd option fails, then you'll be Sorted into the 4th House. If the 4th House also unanimously rejects you, then it is an automatic expulsion.\" Professor McGonagall stood up and left the Great Hall to get the Sorting Hat from Professor Dumbledore's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Harry. Whether the Hat chooses Hufflepuff as your 2nd, 3rd, or 4th choice, we will not unanimously reject you. Myself and Hannah, at the very least, will always want you with us\" said Susan. She had full confidence that Ravenclaw and Slytherin would also unanimously reject him if the Hat chose either or both of those Houses. Harry was very nervous the entire time that Professor McGonagall was still getting the Hat and he was still nervous when she finally returned with the Sorting Hat and she placed it on his head.</span></div></div>",

SMACK \"Listen to me boy when I am speaking to you,\" Winkey said smacking Harry right across his face leaving a small Elf hand pint and causing some of the watching crowd to faint and others began to worry how the free elf would get punished by the young Wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Madam,\" Harry said bowing his head in apology making those Elves still conscious to open their mouths in shock as not only was Winkey not getting punished but Harry was apologizing to her.  \"It won't happen again Madam.\" Harry said oblivious to the reaction of the crowd watching while Winkey was enjoying her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that it doesn't boy,\" Winkey said grabbing Harry's chin and making him look her right in her eyes, \"but maybe it is my fault I guess I might have to dumb it down for you are both a male and a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great Madam,\" Harry said having learned at a young age never to contradict the person in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy maybe it would help your concentration if while I talked you had something to do so while I lecture you I want you to...</span></div></div>",

In fact some Elves in the line in front of him called over other Elves just so he would have to wait longer for his turn.  When he got to the water valve he could not figure out how to turn it on as it required the use of magic, and his wand was now in the possession of Winkey so he asked one of the Elves behind him to help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid human doesn't even know how to turn on a faucet,\" the Elf said loudly enough for a group around the faucet to hear and snicker at Harry who had by now lost any standing with the Elves as they saw him as a new hire who knew nothing, which would be a disgrace for a House Elf.  After the Elf helped him Harry bowed low and said thank you before struggling to carry the heavy bucket of water back to Winkey while the Elves around him, some of which had larger loads had no problem with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\" Winkey asked when he finally got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Madam I could not figure out how to use the faucet and had to ask for help,\" Harry answered still holding the bucket correctly guessing that he would be punished if he set it down before he began the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you thank them for the help?\" Winkey asked already knowing the answer but wanting confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Madam,\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now get to work,\" Winkey said indicating the fireplace.

After all that had happened Harry forgot that he is in nothing but a pair of tied towels so that when he was in his current position it showed off his butt and crotch.  Winkey checked out his tight little bubble butt under the excuse of watching him work as passing Elves snicker at the Human's posterior basically being in public view.</span></div></div>",

There was somebody missing from the room, someone Harry felt he desperately needed on his side - Professor Dumbledore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened to Dumbledore, why wasn't he here to speak his case? Fudge and that horrible Umbridge woman were twisting his every action to make it sound like he was acted out of some deep seated need for attention, rather than defending himself against a group of attacking dementors that the ministry themselves had sent for him. They made no mention of Dudley's peril either. It all sounded like Harry was trying to cast the Patronus charm merely to see what effect it might have in a muggle community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbledore was not there to plead the truth for him, this was all wrong. Where was Dumbledore?<br>\r\nThe truth was that the location of the meeting had been changed at the last minute in order to keep Dumbledore well away from the proceedings, a clever ruse by Fudge so Harry would have no representation at all, nobody to speak for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt clearly worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a damning appraisal by the prosecution, and Harry's defence simply not in attendance, the conclusion of the case was merely a formality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those in favour of clearing all charges.\" Fudge invited<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry raised his hand, among with a couple of others who clearly still believed in him. They were the only ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFudge knew that he had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those in favour of conviction\" he continued, a taste of satisfaction in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even need to count the number of raised hands in the courtroom, the numbers were so vast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The original charge stands, Mr Harry James Potter, you remain expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. From this moment hence forth you are no longer allowed to perform any act of magic or to own or carry a wand. Delores, if you would do the honours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbridge came forward and seized the wand out of Harry's hands, then snapped it in two and dropped the broken pieces onto his lap. She rubbed her hands together as she walked away, a cruel smile playing across her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Dumbledore burst through the doors and looked around at eveyone assembled \"I'm so sorry I am late, what did I miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Dumbledore, Fudge gloated, good to see you arrived at last. Mr Potter here is no longer a student at Hogwarts School, he has just been expelled from said insitution. Mr Potter you may keep the broken halves of your wand if you wish,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis look was self-congratulatory as he walked from the courtroom, Umbridge followed close behind. Should I notify the Daily Prophet?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means, with any luck he'll make the front pages of the evening edition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room emptied and Harry and Dumbledore were left alone together, both with tragic looks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you Harry\" he began \"but the ministry has decided, it is out of my hands now. Know that whilst you may now be expelled from the school, you are not banned from the grounds. I don't know if you know this Harry but Hagrid was once expelled too, in his third year I believe. The doors of Hogwarts School are not closed to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Professor\" he sighed, wondering what good it would do him. His life had just fallen down around his ears. Never again would he be permitted to perform magic. What else was left for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I shall have to go back to the Dursleys? he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Harry. I believe you were staying with the Weasleys before you were called to his hearing. If they'll have you then you may stay thee for now. Perhaps in due course we might find a more permanent alternative to the Dursley family. For now I will escort you to Mr Weasley's office\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor\" Harry replied in a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The worst news, Arthor\" Dumbledore shuck his head once they arrived \"I was too late to stop them, clever ruse on the part of the minister. Harry has been expelled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur Weasley looked devestated but he invited Harry to spend the rest of the day here. He would take him back to The Burrow when his shift had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Arthur carried Harry back to his home via side-along apparition, and once they went inside both his wife and daughter were in the kitchen. \"How did it go, Arthur?\" Molly asked. Arthur's face said it all.<br>\r\nHarry held up the two broken pieces of his wand. \"I lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny looked across at thebroken wand in Harry's hands. She could clearly see the Phoenix Tailfeather sticking out of it. Clearly that wand would not perform magic ever again, and neither would Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat in her chair at the dining table, she mulled this over in his mind. Harry was expelled from Hogwarts, that was undeniable. She was still attending the school though, she could perform magic with her fully functional wand and if she chose to use her spells against Harry then there was nothing he could do stop her. The mroe she looked at poor, dethroned, defenceless Harry the more the knowledge that she could make him like putty in her hands appealled to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had come back, still in possesson of his maigical abilities she might have considered him more of an equal, or perhaps of greater magical potential but that potential had died in the ministry and all that was left was a pathetic shell of a boy who had the misfortune to return to a magical home, her home. He appeared to be right for the plucking, and she, Miss Ginny Weasley would pluck this boy who was now so far beneath her he couldn't even reach her with a broom. She would dominate him of course, oh dear gods she would dominate him so completely, and so easily. She would make him both fear and worship her and the famous Harry Potter would be hecome her non-magcal slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question that remained to her was when she was going to enact this wonderful plan, but it didn't take her long before she felt the time had come to put things in motion.</span></div></div>",

He needs us right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of him, mother\" she promised \"come along Harry.\" Of course her idea of 'taking care' and her mother's were worlds apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry followed Ginny from the room, naively unaware of her true intentions for him, he heard Mrs Weasley calling after them \"Dinner will be ready in about an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ginny led Harry upstairs she commented \"You've never been in my room, have you Harry. This should be quite an event for you. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept talking to him in an apparently friendly voice until they reached the door of Ginny's bedroom. She opened it for him and gestured for him to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry walked into Ginny's room and looked around. The place looked to be an ordinary girl's bedroom, not particularly large but a bedroom nonetheless He could clearly see her bed, a dressing table and char, and a wardrobe in the corner. There were a number of feminine beauty products on the dressing table, along with a hair brush, a mirrror and a pile of books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" She asked him as she came in and closed the bedroom door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sit down if you like, no need to stand on ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and went over to sit on the chair in front of her dressing table. It was the only seat that seemed to be available to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my seat, Harry\" she remarked as she came over to him \"but as you wish.\" She immediately sat there too, dropping heavly on to Harry's lap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOww, Ginny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shush Harry\" she admonished him \"this is my chair and I will sit here if I want to. If you didn't want me on you then you shouldn't have taken it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you invited me to sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did but I didn't say where. No matter though. I am here now.\" Now that Harry was beneath her, her veneer of friendliness dropped away in an instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does it feel to be a muggle, Harry?\" she asked then \"a muggle trapped in the lair of the witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a muggle Ginny, and we both know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you are Harry\" she purred \"you were mugglified at the ministry, by the minister himself. You are as much a muggle as those Dursleys you live with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... a... wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a wizard Harry, now you are just a muggle. In fact that is going to be my name for you from now on, muggle.\" She took one of the broken halves of Harry's wand out of his pocket, studied it for a moment and shook any traces of the Phoenix Tailfeather core out onto her lap, then handied it to him. \"Give it a wave, Harry.\" she advised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry waved the broken half-wand in his hand but nothing happened. It was now nothing more than a small stump of wood. \"Like I said, you are just a muggle\" she bore in to him again \"I am the other hand am a witch, and this is what a witch can do with her wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny took out her wand and showed him its full, perfect length. Then she pointed it at him and cast one of her famous Bat-Bogey Hexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Harry\" she told him as large and painful eruptions came pouring out of his nose. They rose up and flew around her bedroom ceiling. Harry cried out every time one of them emerged. \"You see Harry\" she continued \"I can do magic, you can't. Your magic evaporated the moment you were expelled from Hogwarts. You are just a muggle now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are not meant to use magic outside of school either\" Harry informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Harry, do you think anyone will notice? This is a magical home, I am a witch. The ministry will think it was my mother or something.  It's not like they'd have thought you did anything, you can't do magic any more. You can't even hold a wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They snapped my wand Ginny, if I had one to hand then I am sure I could still do some spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Ginyn offered Harry her wand. Try it Harry, go on. I know that in your current state of delustion you think that you might still have some magic in you. Prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry desperately wanted to do it, he wanted to take her wand and cast the most unpelasant jinx on her that he could think of. Why was she treating him like this? As his right hand closed on her wand though, the thing suddenly felt white hot in his hand and an intense pain shot through him. \"Aaargh!\" he cried. He instantly dropped the wand, and Ginny caught it again. \"Anti-muggle defences\" Ginny informed him \"you must have tripped them when you touched my wand. I told you that you were a muggle, even my wand says you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHary looked down at his hand, a long, thin burn mark was clearly visible there and it felt extremely sore. The scarring looked so severe that he wondered if it would ever heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the of the bats dislodged a small speck of green as it emerged, and it dropped onto Ginny's skirt. She immediately drew back her hand and slapped him sharply across his face. \"How dare you sneeze on me like that\" she flared \"If you do it again, I'll break your nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, what is that?\" She showed him the tiny fleck of green that had fallen on her. Don't do it again. In fact you can have it back.\" She wiped it onto his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bats continued to emerge from Harry's nose, she looked at him disapprovingly. \"Turn your head away\" she instructed him, then to force the issue she got hold of his face in both her hands and twisted it sharply to the side. It felt to Harry like she was breaking his neck. He felt a sudden jolt of pain in his neck, followed by a continued dull ache that wouldn't go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better, Muggle\" she approved, as Harry now kept his face turned away from her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normally of course the use of magic in a wizarding home is an everyday occurance, but as you may know Mr Potter was expelled from Hogwarts School earlier today. Perhaps I might be permitted to come in and talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, of course.\" Molyl Weasley nodded.

Could you come down a moment please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny heard her mother calling her, so she cancelled her spell, as entertaining as it had been and climbed off Harry's lap. \"We'd better go down, come with me Muggle\" she informed him, then firmly took hold of his wrist and led him from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they emerged at the kitchen door, Umbridge was sat down at the dining table along with Mrs Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you are aware, Mr Potter\" Umbridge inquired \"but even though you have been expelled from Hogwarts, the ministry trace is still in effect. It seems that a spell was cast in your presence earlier this evening. Can you please explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny suddenly recalled that she had performed an act of magic outside of school, which was clearly against Ministry rules. she wonered how she might be able to talk herself out of trouble, but then her mother spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute\" Mrs Weasley gasped \"you can't talk to him that way. This is a wizarding house, spells are used here all the time. Who do you think you are, anyway? Show her your wand Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded and held up the broken half of his former wand, just as umbridge answered \"Delores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic. I am well aware of the state of Mr Potter's wand, since I broke it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny blinked, this was the person who had mugglified Harry, and she seemed to have the minister's ear. She wondered what her true feelings about Harry truly were, she sounded like an even worse version of Percy and he had been living on a steady diet of the Fudge's boot polish for some time now. Supposing, just supposing she could get this woman on her side. That would fit in wonderfully with her plans for the boy beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that aside\" Umbridge continued then \"there are still a couple of matters that the ministry would like to clear up. First of all, only witches and wizards are permitted their own broomsticks. I am afraid Mr Potter's broom will have to be confescated. I believe it is a Firebolt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny considered that a moment \"Perhaps I might be permitted to take it?\" she hinted \"it'd be better then having the thing just taking up space in the Ministry store rooms.\" As an experienced flyer and with her interest in quidditch, she was sure she could make good use of Harry's broom which was much faster than her own. She glanced across at him as she said this, his expression looked seriously deflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then\" Umbridge continued \"there is also the matter of Mr Potter's owl. The rules on magical creatures are a little less cut-and-dried but I believe, and the minister agrees with me that as Mr Potter is no longer a student at Hogwarts, he should not be permitted to keep any magical creatures. The owl shall be rehomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of Hedwing for you too\" Ginny added in a sweetly reasonable tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I suppose that cocludes our immediate business\" Umbridge sighed, she reached into her bag and took out a copy of the evening edition of the Daily Prophet, dropping it on to their table. \"Compliments of the ministry\" she remarked as she did so. The headline on the front of the paper stated in large letters \"Harry Potter Expelled.\" Mrs Weasly looked chagrined when she read it, Ginny however was elated.<br>\r\n\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Weasley and Harry just had their eyebrows raised, wondering what Ginny wanted to talk to her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you want to talk to me about, Miss Weasley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you turned Harry into a Muggle (Umbridge chuckled at that), I've begun to see him in a different light. I see now that he is inferior to me and I want to dominate him, control him so badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my. You're very ambitious aren't you? And to humiliate Potter, I love it. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering if Harry could return to Hogwarts even as a Muggle. I know that Dumbledore said he could, but then again he couldn't protect Harry from being expelled. It's clear the Ministrey has more power than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. We do have more power than that old coot. But no worries there; I'll let you in on a secret. Minister Fudge and I are about to smear Dumbledore's name for both his support and lack of defense in the expelled Potter. If this works, Dumbledore will no longer be Headmaster and I will become Headmistress in time for the school year to start. And I can ensure that Potter remains at Hogwarts as long as he is under your control\" finished Umbridge with an evil smile, which was mirrored by Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Headmistress. I believe this is the start of a beautiful friendship\" as Ginny held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it is, Miss Weasley\" said Umbridge as she shook the offered hand. \"Feel free to contact me with Potter's former owl anytime for suggestions to humiliate Potter. In fact, here's a little present for you.\" Umbridge pulled out a blood quill nd gave it to Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a blood quill. You have Potter write lines many, many, many times with this and it'll leave a permanent scar on the han with which he writes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I could make him write \"I am a Muggle\" or \"Property of Ginny Weasley\" or something like that over and over and eventualy, it'll be branded on his skin?\" said an excited Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Well it is time I go. Got to get rid of Dumbledore after all\" said Umbridge as she left the hallway and then the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny smiled at her new friend and the gifts that she had received.</span></div></div>",

What I didn't say was that I basically thanked her for turning you into a muggle and even told her of my plans for you. She approved of all of them, so I don't think she is likely to bother us again. Sit down, Muggle\"<br>\r\nHarry suddenly realised that he didn't have a choice in the matter. He sat on the chair and Ginny resumed her seat upon him. She then seemed to ignore him for a moment whilst she scanned through the newspaper. \"This is very interesting, reading muggle\" She told him then \"listen to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry James Potter, sometimes referred to as the Boy Who Lived and the boy said to be responsble for the downfall of He Who Must Not Be Named was today expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during a hearing at the Minstry of Magic where has unanimously found guilty of th heinus crime of using magic (namely a Patronus Charm) in front of a muggle. Immediately following the anouncemnt of the guilty verdict, Mr Potter's wand was destroyed by a witch acting on behalf of the minister. The ministry accepts that he is no longer to be considered a member of wizarding society, and he has been banned using magic or being in possession of any magical objects. On no account is Mr Potter permitted to own a wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Potter has of course for some time been suffering from mental instability as evidenced by the unfounded stories he has been telling about the apparent return of You Know Who. The boy has always had an over invlaited air of arrogance and superiority, just like his father\" stated Professor Severus Snape, Potions Master at Hogwarts \"clearly this proves how mistaken he truly was.\" Delores Umbridge, the ministry official who snapped Mr Potter's wand in half at his hearing added \"Finally, the lies of Mr Potter are laid bare for all to see, clearly he has shown that he is not deserving of any of the fame as he clearly took the credit for what others have done in his place. It must have been another witch or wizard who stopped the Dark Lord and then spread rumours about Mr Potter in order to hide the truth of the event. We created the monster that was Harry Potter, now we at the ministry have unmasked and defeated it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has been speculation among a number of prominent members of the ministry as to where Mr Potter will live now, many believing that he will live out the rest of his life with the muggles who raised him. When approached by our reporters though, Mr Vernon Dursley of Number Four Privet Drive explained that he never liked Mr Potter and would rather Mr Potter never set foot in his house again. He seemed particularly pleased to hear of Mr Potter's exclusion and said it was the best news he had heard in a long time. Since Mr Dursley never formally adopted Potter, there is of course no legal requirement for him to take care of the boy, and he informed us that he only did so in the first place after reading Dumbledore's note because he felt that he was being bullied in to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for Albus Dumbledore, presently headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has been made apparent that he did not even turn up for Mr Potter's trial until after the judgement was announced, even though it was at his request that this clearly pointless hearing was carried out in the first place since the outcome was clearly inevitable anyway. In this reporter's eyes it would have been far easier to have expelled Mr Potter as soon as his crimes were brought to light instead off wasting the minister's time with such a cherade. One must also conclude that Dumbledore, clearly a brilliant man in his time, is now getting confused and forgetful in his old age. We must only wonder how long a man such as that can continue to hold down his job as Headmaster of Hogwarts School.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Further comemnts from our readers about Harry Potter, his past, present and future and their feelings about the outcome of the hearing will be welcomed, and selected articles may be featured in a later edition. Continued on pages 2, 3, 4, 6 to 8 and 10. Further discussion by the Ministry pages 12-13 \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny then turned the page and continued reading the article to Harry, she loved to watch his expression of stunend outrage as he spoke. Not only had be been expelled but the Prophet was using this news to utterly destroy him in the eyes of the wizarding world. He suspected they might try something like this, but he really didn't want have it all dictated to him in this way. He didn't see any way to avoid it though. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could have protected me from the Fudge and the rest but he never turned up.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Dumbledore was sent an owl by the minister, telling him that your trial had been moved to a different date. A clever ploy designed to keep him away, it worked.\"<br>\r\n\"So Fudge got a free hand, and between them, he and that witch got their way.\"<br>\r\n\"There was another hand in the game, a hand which was well hidden but made absolutely sure that Dumbledore would be nowhere near your trial.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Dumbledore got a second owl, the sender did not give their name but they informed him that you-know-who was preparing to launch an attack on hogwarts, even gave the date and time in which said attack was going to take place. Incidentally it would have coincided with the real date and time of your trial.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you know about that?\"<br>\r\n\"Who do you think sent that second letter?\"<br>\r\n\"You?\"<br>\r\n\"I needed to keep Dumbledore out of the way, that your trial would go the way that Fudge intended and thatyou would fall into my waiting hands. It went exactly as planned. Dumbledore ran off to the school to prevent the perceived threat and now here you are, stripped of your magic and your wand and destined to spend eternity as my personal slave.\"<br>\r\nDumbledore will no that that letter was a lie, that there never was a threat to the school. He'll find out what you did.\"<br>\r\n\"No he won't Harry. That is the beauty of it. Firstly I am a Weasley, my entire family is seen by the entire wizarding world as supporters of yours. Secondly it will be Fudge, not me upon whom his suspicion will rest. Fudge did after all send the other letter and it was in his interests to keep you away from the trial.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll tell Dumbledore the truth.\"<br>\r\n\"He won't believe you Harry, after all in his eyes me and my entire family are whiter than white.\"<br>\r\nHarry was crestfallen.

At 45 years old, she showed no sign of aging, looking more 30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just escaped from Azkaban with her fellow death eaters thanks to her Lord, but thanks to this time she stayed in prison, she did a lot of thinking, and decided that Lord Voldemort's goal was impossible to achieve, there were just too many muggles, and while she still loathed them, she thoughts it was not worth trying to kill them all, and one day could probably turn bad for wizards, if muggles decided to strike with their nuclear weapons. Of course, she didn't tell anyone her thoughts, especially not her master, hiding them behind her occlumency shields even her master couldn't enter, he just thought he could, when in reality, she always showed him what she wanted him to see.<br>\r\nShe was in her first death eater meeting since escaping, listening to Voldemort, who was talking about some prophecy, which they needed to retrieve from the Department of Mysteries, but first, they had to lure the Potter boy there. They were making some plans, but she only half listened, in her head, she was making her own plans to leave the country. Her thoughts strayed on the fact she never founded a family, because she was sterile from birth, perhaps because of too much inbreeding, another fact that now made her think the pureblood propaganda was bullshit. Don't get her wrong, she was still a sadist who took pleasure in others pain, but she didn't want to fight a war which could become planetary. Suddenly, she has an idea, she could capture Harry Potter for herself, to be the son she cannot have, and also enraging  the dork lord, killing two birds with one stone.<br>\r\nThe meeting was over and now, she had to plan the capture of the Boy-who-Lived, who was very protected inside of Hogwarts.

After only a minute and a half, one of them used the charm to tell her Harry was near the Shrieking Shack with his mudblood friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparate with me inside the Shrieking Shack, I have a mission for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both apparated inside the Shrieking Shack, you could hear screams and cries outside, they apparated in front of 2 young witches, she stupefied them both before they could act, then she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pettigrew, go outside and shout at the potter boy, before transforming and running back inside, I want you to bring him near me, I will be invisible waiting, also I'm going to cast a shield charm on you, since he will probably try to capture you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry Potter was a young boy of 15, quite short for his age at 160 cm, but fit from quidditch and running, he was having perhaps the his worst year, with that bitch Umbridge using that blood quill. He was with his best friend Hermione, Ron being in detention for punching Malfoy \"Worth it\" he said, Harry agreed totally, and was kind of happy, because he was alone with Hermione, who had grown quite attractive(just picture Emma Watson, nuff said), she was quite fit, he didn't know how, he never saw her doing sport, but he was not with her all the times, and she was a little taller than him, at 165 cm tall.<br>\r\nThey were both hiding near the Shrieking Shack because some death eaters thought it was a good idea to attack in broad daylight, with a lot of professors present, <br>\r\nbut they were very nasty, using only unforgivables and something called fiendfyre, a very potent dark fire spell, Hermione told him. Harry managed to take one out with a stupefy, but decided to let the professors handle it, his priority is to protect Hermione. But something happened, something that made him loose his mind and  all rational sense, he saw Wormtail walking out of the Shrieking Shack yelling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Potter, nice mudblood, I will take pleasure killing her, since I wasn't able to kill your mother myself!\" before transforming into a rat and running back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry ran after him, followed by Hermione shouting \"Don't go, it's probably a trap\" , he didn't listened, he was to mad. They both entered and didn't see anyone, before Bellatrix knocked them out both, them she ordered Wormtail to go back to Malfoy Manor and try to kill as many death eaters as possible while yelling \"I killed your favorite bitch\" to Voldemort, and pretends to have organised the attack, he will be killed very fast, as he was not that skilled, but would make him appear a traitor, and threw them off her back. Then she obliviated him off so Voldemort wouldn't know it was her doing!<br>\r\nWormtail apparated back to Malfoy Manor to carry out her orders, she pondered what to do, does she takes only Harry, or the mudblood too?</span></div></div>",

She obliviated the two young girls she stunned earlier, leaving no clues of her , then she accioed both Harry and Hermione near her and activated her portkey to America, where she bought a big house near Los Angeles, under the Fidelius charm.<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, Bellatrix put a deep sleep charm on Hermione, deciding to deal with her after her Harry, and put her in a bed in an empty room. She wondered what to do with Harry, he was quite short for his age, but still much too big to be her baby, so gave him a shrinking potion, it was permanent unless you take a counter potion, and Harry was reduced to half his size, he was now only 80 cm tall and 11 kg, like a baby. She then put him inside his room, in a crib, she decided against a diaper since he was obviously potty trained, she let him naked, which he will be at all times now, and put a blanket on him. Since he was asleep, she decided to take a peek in his mind to see if was dreaming, what she saw stunned her, in his dream, Harry was with his friend Hermione, she tied him up naked, then kicked his balls, and made him worship her feet! Her son was a masochist and feet fetichist! She could use that to make him addicted to her she thought, maybe use the mudblood to help her, she probably will knowing their lives where in danger if she didn't. She casted a charm to let her know when he wakes up, and left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POV change*<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHarry felt very confortable, he just had the most wonderful dream, you see, since he was a child, Harry always had twisted fantasies of women hurting him and putting him under their feet, probably because his Aunt was always very violent with him, beating him even worse than Vernon did, she always beat and kicked him where it hurts the most, and recently, his fantasies where all about Hermione doing this to him! <br>\r\nFirst thing Harry noticed was that he was naked, strange because he never slept naked, then he saw bars around, him before realising he was in a giant crib, in a giant room. What was happening? Did he landed in a giant nursery? The walls were green, with snakes motives. He then heard sounds of steps before the door opened. In front of him stood one of the most beautiful woman he has ever see, she was only wearing panties and pantyhose, her legs and feet where magnificents, but she was also a lot taller than he was, it was then that he realised she wasn't a giantess, it was him who shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Where am I?\" he asked panicked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your new mommy and we are at our new house, how are you sweety?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fucking crazy? Let me go, you're not my mom, my mom is dead\" said Harry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix was pissed off, she used her right hand to grab his small balls and started to squeeze very hard, knowing the shrinking made him a lot more durable<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your new mom, and there is nothing you can do about it, and every time you make mommy upset, she will punish your balls, understood?\" she asked, squeezing even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was in extreme pain, but also exctasy, he had fantasied about something like that, it hurted so good, maybe he was too slow for her, because she took him out off the crib, then before he could react, she kicked him very hard with her right foot in the balls, her foot was very big at his size, and it completely smashed his balls, he was lifted off the ground until he was eye level with her before falling back!<br>\r\nThe pain was indescriptible, it hurted so much more than when his aunt kicked him, then something else happened, he ejacaluted more than in his entire life, he was curled on the ground, when Bellatrix feet where in front of him, he did the only right thing in his mind, he kissed them and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mommy for punishing me, please do it whenever you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix was so happy, it was easier than she thought! </span></div></div>",

Since he couldn't cum anymore, his dick was becoming so hard it was painful, his balls felt like they were about to explode, he was on the edge of cumming but couldn't. She kept doing this for 20 minutes, then made him suck her other breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mommy let me cum, it is too painful\" cried Harry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella's face became cold, how dare her son ask something like that! She took his small balls between her fingers and started squeezing very hard, feeling his balls trying to escape. He started crying but she cast a silencing charm, and resumed squeezing using both hands this time! She was pushing her thumbs into his balls, using her sharps nails to try to pierce his balls! They were becoming very red and bruised but she knew they were indestructible because of the shrinking, so she could abuse them as much as she liked! She continued for 10 minutes before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never ask mommy to cum ever again, or I will hurt your balls in ways you cannot imagine!\" she said, knowing already he liked this too much to not ask again soon! It was so exciting to have a masochistic son!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come wake up your sister with me, we are going to see your aunts today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blanched, he really didn't want to see the Malfoys like he was now!

The Toad or Umbitch) was finally ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the Minister in his wisdom (<b><i>meaning stupidity</i></b>) has decided to grant me the position of High Inquisitor of Hogwarts I sadly do not have as much time to devote to teaching our young minds the intricacies of magic\", spoke the Toad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily...,\" she (<b><i>or is it he, I can never quite tell</i></b>) continued, patting it's head with a pink handkerchief, \"The Minister himself has recommended another upstanding member of our community to take my place (<i><b>blah, blah, blah...get on with it!</b></i>). Please welcome Lady Narcissa Malfoy as the new teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short woman gestured towards the end of the table where another tall woman stood up, giving a small elegant curtsy. She looked like the definition of a pureblood lady. She was tall, haughty and pale, with a slight tan, had high cheekbones and a condescending look in her clear blue eyes as she surveyed the students. Her long hair had thick silver blonde streaks through it, differentiating her from the usual black hair her original family was famous for. She was undeniably beautiful, but also emitted an aura that made anyone hesitant to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell.\" Ron muttered in shock,  as the Slytherin table exploded into applause. Harry couldn't help but agree, politely clapping but feeling very worried about this turn of events. One Malfoy in Hogwarts was bad enough, now they had another? His eyes met hers and he saw her full pale/light red lips curl into a playful smirk, sending a shiver of dread down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feast started Narcissa had her eyes discreetly on Harry, while at the same time engaged in a conversion with Septima Vector the Professor of Arithmancy. She licked her lips. She had seen Harry before and seeing his looks and the achievements he had obtained made Harry quite eye catching to her. She doubted Harry knew of how much power he really possessed considering, as she learnt that he lives with muggles and Dumbledore kept hiding things from him. This could be used to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had decided that she wanted Harry for herself, and would get him by any means necessary. Harry would become her slave....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone was quite surprised, as the following weeks didn't turn out that bad at all. Lady Malfoy was strict but didn't seem particularly unfair at all, something that was evident by the way even Draco understood to behave in her classes. They could still see the Ministry sabotage in action by how slowly she was going through the DADA course, but unlike Umbridge she actually taught them something. <br>\r\nHermione had tried to argue for a faster pace at times but had been verbally slapped down by the intimidating woman every single time. Unlike Umbridge who would resort to threats and shouting, Lady Malfoy merely argued her point with such an incredibly condescending tone that whoever was up against her felt like a complete fool. She had spent years in the Wizengamot debating politics, outwitting schoolchildren wasn't even a challenge for her.<br>\r\nAfter seeing the way she had practically destroyed Hermione, Harry opted to simply stay quiet. If the smartest girl in their class couldn't do it, he wasn't even going to try.<br>\r\nAnother aspect that actually made her very popular was her style of dress. Unlike the rest of the teachers who wore loose and old robes, she opted for clothes that emphasized her figure. It also helped that the only professors who came even close to her looks were Septima Vector and Aurora Sinistra, neither who had any interest in flaunting their appearance. Lady Malfoy had a trim figure, one which she clearly enjoyed showing off. Her stylish robes were always of a very tight cut, displaying a bit of pale full cleavage, hugging her small waist and hips before ending above the knees. Hermione had once commented that she wouldn't have looked much out of place in a muggle office, comparing her outfit to a tight office skirt and blouse.<br>\r\nHarry had also never seen her without high heels, even on the weekends the sound of her shoes against the hard floor drew male eyes, no doubt wanting to ogle her stocking clad legs and pert behind in the figure hugging robes. He wasn't very proud to admit that even he found his eyes straying to her and he doubted he was the only one who had used the woman's striking looks as as fuel when polishing the family jewels at night. Sure, there were plenty of attractive girls in Hogwarts, but they simply lacked the experience to exude such a sense of raw mature sexuality that Lady Malfoy could do whenever she felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of her relatively neutral approach to teaching, her sudden request one Friday did surprise him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Potter, please stay behind after class\", asked Narcissa<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sent him a worried glance but he shook his head, he doubted it was anything serious. \"Sure Professor Malfoy,\" he replied, before turning to Hermione and Ron, \"you guys go ahead, I'll catch up to you in the common room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed a bit hesitant to leave but finally agreed, following the rest of the students out. When the last student left Lady Malfoy walked up to the door, closing it behind them. His eyes widened as she threw a couple of spells on the door. It was all non-verbal so he didn't catch them completely, but they did  ook like privacy charms. Harry glanced at the clock. While it was his last class of the day, he knew that the NEWT students would still have one last class with her, meaning he only had to endure whatever she wanted for ten minutes before the next batch of students entered. Finished with the door she pocketed her wand, making him relax a bit more. She seemed amused by the tension in his shoulders, walking over to the table right in front of him and leaning against it. She slowly crossed her legs as she rested her toned butt against the table, making the tight robe ride up on her thighs. Harry could see the laced edge of her black stockings, realizing she was wearing one of those sexy thigh high sstockings he had seen in the magazines. Abruptly he noticed that she was looking at him as he stared at her smooth legs, making him blush bright red as he quickly averted his eyes. He saw a smirk on her face out of the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the view Mr Potter?\" She murmured, clear amusement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed awkwardly, not certain what he should say. That only seemed to amuse her more.<br>\r\n\"Well then, if you are quite done, let's move on to why I asked you to stay for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached up to her bun, quickly releasing her long silver and black hair, making it cascade down over her shoulders. Her amused blue eyes turned frosty as they narrowed in on him and then spoke.......</span></div></div>",

The sudden change in tone and topic caught him completely off guard, but he did manage to keep his flinch internal. What did she know? She didn't give him a chance to reply before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if said rogue group was being lead by none other than the Boy-Who-Lived, recently in the headlines for fabricating ridiculous stories? A group that not only involved his friends, but also students from other houses, all working against the recent Ministry Educational Decrees?\", continued Narcissa. Harry forcibly kept his hands from shaking, but was quite certain his face had lost some colour. How did she know all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..\", his voice was stiff, \"I have no idea what you're talking about\". The frosty glint disappeared and she seemed amused again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Mr Potter, we are way past that. Unlike that toad Umbridge I don't try to beat the students into telling their secrets, all I needed was some private time with some of the younger members of your little group, and with hint of cleavage here and a bit of leg there, they were all eager to share their prowess.\", replied Narcissa. This time he cursed, he could just imagine how someone like Colin Creevey, would have handled being alone with a beautiful and sexy woman who wanted to hear all about how good he was and how amazing Harry Potter was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no evidence!\" He tried, only to bite the inside of his cheek when she chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Come now Mr Potter, this isn't the muggle world! My word alone carries a tremendous weight as the Lady Malfoy, let alone the various ways I can prove it. Vows, veritaserum or even watching my memories in a pensieve\", said Narcissa in an amused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry exhaled heavily, knowing the truth of her words. He then swallowed and said, \"What...what do you want? If you think I'm going to betray my friends you are sorely mistaken\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually laughed this time, a melodious sound that almost made his lips twitch. Narcissa then replied, \"No, Mr Potter, I'm not even going to attempt something so silly. I have been looking into you quite a bit, and your loyalty and willingness to do anything for your friends were values that constantly came up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..\" He wondered, caught off guard by what he took as a compliment, uncertain if it was meant as one<br>\r\nShe picked up on his question. \"So why haven't I informed Umbridge or the Ministry?\", she said. Harry nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I, it would no doubt get you and your friends expelled and Dumbledore removed, but none of those things really help me in any way.\", replied Narcissa<br>\r\n\"But.. Voldemort?\", said Harry in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent him a frosty glare for using the name in her presence.<br>\r\n\"Just because I agree with some of the ideals of the Dark Lord doesn't mean I want that madman to rule over me, nor do I want him anywhere near my son. Sadly I can't tell Draco exactly what to do, he is too much his father's son, but I can at least do my part. And keeping Dumbledore in Hogwarts is a good way of keeping the Dark Lord out\", said Narcissa bluntly. Harry was surprised by her blunt answer, feeling a bit confused now.<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly do you want from me?\", Harry spoke in confusion<br>\r\n\"Now we're getting to the hundred galleon question.\" She smirked, standing up from the table and sauntering towards him.  He felt like blushing as he watched her walk, no, stalk would be the more accurate word, towards him. She shook out her long hair before reaching up to her tight robe, opening another button and letting just a hint more of her tantalizing cleavage <b><i>(she has DD cups)</i></b> show. Her hips swayed from side to side and he swore she just licked her lips. She leaned over his desk, bringing her blue eyes only inches from his, letting him look straight down her cleavage. He swallowed nervously, the sudden change of atmosphere had once more caught him flat-footed. His eyes dipped down to her chest, admiring the soft pale flesh on display before trying to pretend like he never looked. There was an amused glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Sometimes being a Lady of a noble house can be a rather lonely job.\" She whispered, her voice husky as her minty breath washed over him. She leaned closer to whisper into his ear. \"Sometimes I just need to get a little..\" Her pink tongue slipped out to wet her lips, \"release.\"<br>\r\nHarry groaned, trying desperately to control his erection, but his cock had no intention of listening, tenting hard in his pants as his thoughts scrambled. Was she really asking what he thought he was? Narcissa switched to the other ear, hot breath sending shivers down his spine.<br>\r\n\"I could use a man to take out my urges on.\" She purred. There was no misunderstanding her intentions anymore. Harry wanted to decline, she was a Malfoy after all, but a much lower part of his body was vehemently disagreeing.<br>\r\n\"Cat got your tongue?\" She grinned, before placing her perfectly manicured hand on his bulging crotch, making him jump, \"Mmm, looks like this part of you agrees with the idea\".<br>\r\nHis face flushed red but he managed to meet her eyes, \"If I agree to, uh, this, will you keep the knowledge of our group to yourself?\" Harry said<br>\r\nHer grin turned predatory. \"Indeed. I can even swear a vow if you like\", she replied.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't her word he counted on anyway, him sleeping with her would be the sort of blackmail she wouldn't want to get out either. It wouldn't be as punishing as her secret but it would cost her face in her social circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Why don't you bring that sweet butt over here\", She stood up and gestured towards her own desk and chair. Feeling a bit humiliated he obeyed, following her while cursing his own dick for showing how eager one part of him was. His eyes strayed to her swaying hips, watching as she made the poor robe strain against the seams. Damn, maybe this deal wouldn't be that bad after all. She sat down in her chair, crossing her feet with a regal air, almost making it appear as if she had just sat down on a throne. Her blue eyes glinted with something he couldn't recognize, but somehow made him feel vary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she purred, \"why don't we get started. Kneel at my feet pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes bulged at the sudden command, leaving him standing there with a flabbergasted look on his face. \"W-what?\", Harry spoke in a confused tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned. \"Did I not make myself clear? Are you deaf or just dumb? Kneel. Now.\", She spoke in a commanding tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlushing red he realized he didn't really have any options here. Reluctantly he slid to his knees, having to look up to her. The smirk on her beautiful face betrayed just how much she was enjoying this. \"So you can hear after all? Good. In the future you will refer to me as Mistress Narcissa whenever we are in private, do you understand?\", Narcissa said.<br>\r\nAvoiding her eyes he gave a mumbled \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that slave?\" Her voice was sharp, like the crack of a whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress Narcissa.\" He grumbled through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can learn as well, excellent. Why don't you give your Mistress a kiss on her feet as gratitude for teaching you?\", she spoke in an amused tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was formulated as a question, Harry recognized the order for what it was. Swallowing his pride he gave both her stocking covered feet a kiss, unable to stop his eyes from wandering over her long toned legs as he bent down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, good boy!\" She praised, making Harry feel even more embarrassed over the fact that his pants were still tenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she grinned, spreading her legs wide and starting to hike up her robes, \"it's time for you to put that mouth to good use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's mouth went dry as he watched her ever so slowly pull up her robes, exposing more and more of her pale legs. He licked his dry lips as she exposed the top of her thigh highs, showing the black suspenders that lead to her garter belt. He breathlessly followed the thin strips of cloth up under her robes, seeing a hint a black lace panties underneath. </span></div></div>",

Harry sat in disbelief on his knees, trying to estimate how large it was. He already knew that he wouldn't be able to close his fingers around it, it was simply too thick, and the way it was growing he wouldn't be surprised if it ended up as long as his forearm. A pair of thick massive balls popped out of the poor panties that had completely given up on attempting to keep the package contained. She was completely hairless except for a small rectangular area of silver blonde soft hair right above the shaft, clearly left there intentionally.<br>\r\nW-what?\" He stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" she murmured, slowly teasing her shaft, \"is your new lollipop.

For such a large clearly male appendage, it was strangely feminine. The steady dribble of precum from the tip was making it glisten in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my little pet. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll learn to love it eventually. I'll even forgive for forgetting to call me Mistress just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strongly doubted that, his eyes wide as he tried to back away, but instead ended up bumping against the side of the desk behind him. The drowsy lusty look in her eyes faded, replaced by a cold calculated glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The choice is very simple slave, either you worship your mistress's divine cock or all your little groupies get thrown out of school. The muggleborn especially will be easy pickings for any death eaters.\" She tilted her head to the side, her blue eyes like ice chips. \"In fact if you look at it from another angle, it will be your fault that they are expelled, and your fault if they suffer because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis resistance crumbled like an ice cube left in the sun, making her ruby red lips spread into a wide smile as she saw his shoulders slump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say 'Aaah' for Mistress Narcissa.\" She grinned, grabbing her huge meatstick in one hand and rubbing the tip against his lips, smearing precum all over his cheeks. He saw the victorious expression on her face and knew that he was caught. Swallowing nervously he ever so slowly parted his lips, making her coo happily as she painted his parting lips with her fat wet tip. Finally wide enough to allow entry she pushed in, moaning happily as her pulsing mushroom head rested deep in his mouth, pushing down on his tongue and leaking her slippery essence all over his taste buds. He frowned at the musky taste, trying to adjust his tongue, but that only served to make her groan in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it pet, lick my lollipop like a good boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumiliated but deciding to get this over with as quickly as possible he started lathering her hot tip with his tongue, making her moan happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to suck now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated he did as he was told, hollowing his cheeks as he tried to suck on the massive cock that kept his jaw wide open. The flow of her precum increased even further, giving the blowjob a noisy slurping sound, making his face go red all the way to his ears. He had to routinely swallow, her clear lubrication coating his throat as it slowly slid down, afraid she would actually drown him in her juices otherwise. He felt her hands in his hair, petting and caressing his head as he did his best to service her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a good boy.\" She murmured, a warm smile on her face as she looked down on him.<br>\r\nHarry avoided her eyes the best he could in his current position, feeling confused by how much he had liked her praise when he was doing what he was. He soon found another reason to be embarrassed when one of her high heels pressed against his crotch, toying with the obvious bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you you would like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glargh!\" He tried to deny it, making her chuckle softly as her foot toyed with his helpless erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush, don't speak with your mouth full.\" She grinned, her hand caressing his bulging cheek.<br>\r\nHe gave her a glare of impotent anger, but with him currently looking like a chipmunk storing food for winter it only made her smile wider.Their 'moment' was broken by a knocking on the door, making them both glance up at the clock on the wall. Harry felt a huge surge of relief, their ten minutes was up, the NEWT students had finally arrived, meaning he could leave. He started pulling back, trying to dislodge the huge chunk of meat stretching his jaws?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just chuckled before waving her wand towards the door, removing the silencing charm around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute.\" She said with a melodious voice, hearing a shuffling behind the door as the students waited. Looking back at Harry she gestured towards the narrow space under the table where one usually rested their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty of room in there, be a good boy now.\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened at her insinuation but she only had to lift a perfectly plucked eyebrow to make him obey. He backed into the small space, watching as she brought her chair close, trapping him between her legs toned and the desk. The awkward position pushed the cock even further in, nudging the lubricated entrance to his throat. He struggled awkwardly but his feeble attempts only made Narcissa moan softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" She purred, \"get back to cock worshipping now.\"<br>\r\nHe watched her wand flash underneath the table, a brief flash of light illuminating the small space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I silenced the area around you so you can be as loud as you want, you might be able to hear everything going on outside but only I will get to enjoy your exquisite sounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa calmly buttoned up her robes again before using a quick charm to sort out her hair, leaving it in a firm bun on the top of her head. Satisfied she waved her wand towards the door, making it unlock and swing open. The seventh year students marched in, greeting her politely as they took their places. Harry was blushing up a storm under the desk, even with the silencing charm around him he still felt embarrassed by every slick slurping sound that escaped him. It didn't help that Narcissa was using her feet to play with his erection as he sucked, making him involuntarily groan around her thick meat. The thin robe didn't offer much protection, so Narcissa could easily trap his smaller cock between her feet, rubbing him back and forth as he desperately milked her fat babymaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa had a lifetime of experience in politics to draw on as she kept her face completely neutral, not a single gesture betraying that her new little toy was sucking on her monster right under their eyes. She calmly went over the basic theory before having them read through and summarize the passage in their books. As soon as they started focusing on their reading her wand slipped underneath the table, a quick non-verbal spell striking Harry.<br>\r\nHarry saw the wand pointed at him, completely unable to do anything about it as a spell struck him right in the face. He frowned, not really feeling anything. He watched the manicured hand turn the wand around until it rested like a pencil between her fingers. Then she slowly nudged the wand towards herself. To his shock his head followed the movements, being forced towards her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grmbhgll!\" He protested, drool leaking from between his lips, feeling her fat tip push against his slick throat, the leaking precum having lubricated him thoroughly. He placed his hands on her smooth thighs, trying to fight against her, but found himself completely powerless against the strength of the spell. The wand moved back, letting him catch a breath before once more driving his head towards her crotch. His garbled protests died when the head forced its way into his gullet, making his throat stretch obscenely around the hot pulsing cock. His gag reflex was feebly protesting but stood no real chance at dislodging the fat invader that was slowly sinking ever deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked her wand back, letting him catch a panicked breath as he coughed around her flesh. This time he was at least prepared when the wand inevitably moved in the other direction, forcing the fat cock right down his abused throat once more. She didn't stop this time, twisting her wand until his nose rested in the soft silver blonde patch of hair she kept above her shaft. He tried to struggle but had already accepted that it was mostly pointless, a feeling that was only reinforced when Narcissa's other hand started caressing his hair, as if proud of him taking her massive cock all the way down to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throat was burning when she finally let him pull back again, this time barely letting him breathe before plunging her fat mushroom head into his tight wet cavern again. She quickly developed a rhythm, flicking her wand back and forth, making him continuously deepthroat her with wet slurping and choking sounds, drool slipping down his chin as she practically used him as a masturbatory tool. He could soon feel the muscles in her toned thighs clench in pace with his blowjob as the hand that had earlier been caressing his hair was now grabbing it firmly. Her pace suddenly became even faster, leaving him lightheaded as he tried to grab a breath of air whenever he could, before finally with a very muffled sigh she buried her long fat cock all the way down his throat.<br>\r\nHarry could feel her thick seed travel through her long shaft before exploding down his throat, force-feeding him her creamy gift one spurt after another.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could feel her nails digging into his scalp as she practically flooded his poor stomach with her syrupy essence, making it bulge outwards as it struggled with the sudden deposit of warm semen. Ever so slowly her orgasm started dying down, her grip on his hair slowly relaxing as she used her wand to pull his head back, pulling the angry red tip out of his throat with a wet slurp. He coughed loudly, drawing in a deep breath before being forced to swallow even more of her thick cum as she kept the still spurting tip between his lips, as if making sure he got a proper tasty of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wand disappeared from beneath the table and the hand on his head started petting him again, yet when he tried to pull back completely from her cock it stopped him. Sighing heavily he realized she wanted him to continue, so left with no options he continued nursing from her spent softening cock, his tongue teasing the bulbous head and coaxing out every last drop. The musky strong taste was strange, but not as bad as he had feared. Yet having swallowed so much of it he could feel his stomach gurgling, unused to the sudden change of diet. He was ashamed that his own prick was still hard as steel, enjoying the teasing her feet would give it every now and then. Even worse was that he actually liked when she petted him, finding the hand massaging his scalp exceptionally soothing.<br>\r\nHis licking suddenly stopped when he felt the previously shrinking cock start growing again. His eyes widened in shock and he tried to groan in protest, but Narcissa completely ignored his muffled sounds, happily stroking his cheek as her cock grew back to its massive size. Merlin help him, he thought, this was going to one long class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's prediction turned out to be quite correct as Narcissa deposited another two creamy hot loads into his stomach, making his stomach visibly bulge as his body desperately tried to keep her butter down. It felt like an eternity until he heard the last student exit the class and the door close behind him, no doubt once more being covered with privacy spells. He gasped as Narcissa pulled her chair back, letting him close his jaw for the first time in two hours. Harry whimpered slightly, the muscles in his throat and jaw aching as he crawled out from underneath her table, having to grasp the desk to get back on his feet. Never had simply being able to breathe freely felt this good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa stood up, hugging him close, pressing her cock against his stomach because of her height advantage. He wasn't even surprised anymore that it was hardening again, her stamina was simply incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a good boy,\" she murmured, giving his ear a nibble, \"you have made me so very happy today.\"<br>\r\nHer hand slipped down to the front of his robes, finding his aching and neglected erection. He shivered as she circled his shaft, her blue eyes boring into his as she smiled down at him like at a cute puppy.\"What a poor thing, I've gotten all this pleasure while you've been forced to hold back. Don't worry, Mistress will take care of you.\" How does Narcissa take care of Harry?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He froze, not really knowing how to respond, but her gentle hand pumping him made him gasp into her mouth, something she quickly took advantage of by slipping her tongue between his lips. It felt less like a kiss and more like her plundering his mouth, but he couldn't deny how much it turned him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ended the kiss and released his cock much to his disappointment. She could read his expression like a book and chuckled again.<br>\r\n\"So very eager, aren't you? Take your clothes off pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too aroused to argue with her command, not to mention he couldn't wait to get rid of his robes, they were sweaty and hot from all the time spent under her desk. He quickly discarded everything into a pile, standing naked in front of her. Her eyes roamed his body and he shivered when she ran her hands down his chest before grabbing his narrow waist. Her soft hands slipped behind him, grabbing his pert ass in both hands, giving it a a good squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" she smiled, \"slim but so very fit and perky, you are simply perfect pet.\"<br>\r\n\"Turn around and place your hands on the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes widened as his gaze dropped to her cock. Was she really going to... ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again.<br>\r\n\"Yes pet, I'm going to ram my huge cock into that little bubble butt of yours and you are going to learn to love it. But if you're a good boy and do as I tell you I will even prepare you and promise to be gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but..\" He quickly added, \"Mistress Narcissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remembered this time, good boy. As for my cock, it's going to end up in your little boypussy one way or another. If you don't like it you can leave, but that's the end of our deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slumped before slowly turning around and resting his hands against the table, leaving his poor little butt completely undefended against her massive meatstick. He shivered in anticipation, not knowing how to prepare. She patted his ass consolingly before using her foot to spread his legs wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sshhh,\" she cooed, rubbing his butt cheek. \"Don't worry, Mistress will take good care of you, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his confusion that actually made him feel a bit better. He saw her wave her wand from the corner of his eye, feeling a cleansing spell run through his bum before a sudden oily feeling spread inside him. He inhaled sharply when he felt two fingers poke around his rosebud, gathering the lubricant her wand had deposited there and slowly slipping past his small ring. He gasped as she quickly worked her fingers in, stretching him in ways he had never experienced before and teasing nerves he didn't know existed. A third finger quickly followed and together they started rubbing against a strange spot inside him that made him feel weak in the knees. His flagging erection returned with a vengeance as his tight anus started clenching around the invading fingers, making him even more confused. Who knew something like this could feel so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other hand slipped under him, gently playing with his balls as she continued rubbing his insides. Merlin but it felt good, this was unlike anything he had felt before. Harry could feel his previously denied orgasm approach quickly, even though he wasn't even touching his cock. He realized he was humping his hips against her fingers and blushed bright red, but still didn't stop moving, he was so.. very.. close. Then just as he was about to peak the fingers disappeared, making him whimper in disappointment as his rosebud clenched around thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" he heard behind him, no sincerity whatsoever in the voice. \"Was my poor little pet about to cum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked behind him, hornier than he had ever been, wanting so desperately to come. Narcissa stroked some lubricant over her massive cock, clearly showing it off for him.<br>\r\n\"If you want I can finish what I started, but you'll have to ask for it pet. All you have to say is 'Mistress Narcissa please fuck my boypussy with your huge cock'.\"</span></div></div>",

Her hips slapped into his ass, sending him down to his elbows on the table as a jet of cum was forced out of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" She praised him again, running her hands over his back before taking a firm grip on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started really fucking him, giving absolutely no quarter. He moaned and whimpered as she pummeled his ass, rubbing his prostate in ways he didn't even know existed, making his own cock leak cum all over floor with every single deep thrust. He clenched wildly around her fat log as she drove into him, something that she rewarded by slapping his ass every few thrusts. The pain of the slaps made him clench even harder which in turn made it feel even better. It was humiliating and impossibly embarrassing, yet Harry could simply not stop cumming as the dominant woman used his ass for her pleasure. He had no idea when he had sunk to his knees, merely resting his sweaty upper body against the desk while she railed his colon, her huge python performing a magic trick by disappearing completely into his small body every few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you you would love it pet!\" She laughed, slapping his butt again. \"Tell me you love my cock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your cock Mistress.\" He moaned, swimming on a wave of pleasure, not bothering to feel any shame about admitting it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good little slut.\" She laughed, plowing straight into his prostate, making him moan obscenely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhhh! Get ready pet, with the load you are about to receive it wouldn't surprise if you got pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry just grunted in response, he couldn't even fight her if he wanted to, the large wet stain on the floor showed just how dry he was being milked. He did understand her words though, feeling her massive smooth balls slap against his, no doubt churning with her potent butter. Her pace increased even further, leaving him a whimpering mess before she hilted herself, not a single inch of her shaft remaining visible as it was all buried in his clenching anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh!\" She grunted as a thick wad blasted against his colon, her thick cream invading him from another hole this time, quickly filling up his intestines as she made every attempt to paint his insides white. Thick jets of her girlcum spread ever deeper, any chance of leaking out prevented by the massive cock acting as a buttplug. Narcissa moaned and scratched his back, pumping her hips slightly as she made every effort of filling him up to the brim. Harry groaned against the desk as his stomach expanded even more, forced to make room for all her potent seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa finally exhaled loudly as the stream ended, laughing softly as her hand found his protruding stomach.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I did make you pregnant after all?\" She chuckled, rolling her hips and making sure she squeezed out every drop. Harry was too exhausted and full to answer, merely panting loudly as his prostate tried to recover from the pummeling it received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Narcissa do next to a defenseless fucked out Harry? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry watches with drowsy eyes as Narcissa summoned her bag to her, pulling out two items before dropping it on the floor. He shuddered as he felt something click around his now limp cock, feeling slightly uncomfortable as it encircled both his cock and his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave gave her a strange look but she just showed him a big egg-shaped black item that had a flat thick base.<br>\r\n\"Just so you know what you'll be carrying around from now on.\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" His question was answered when she pulled out her cock, making his hole gape obscenely before being stuffed by the big black buttplug she had just showed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" He asked, turning around awkwardly as he tried to adjust to the big egg resting in his ass. Narcissa quirked an eyebrow, making him quickly follow it up with \"Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" she explained, pointing at his butt, \"is a buttplug of my design. It will help develop the sensitivity of your prostate and boypussy and you keep you nice and ready for me whenever I feel like using your pretty little hole. You'll find that it vibrates every night, so your dreams from now on will be very sweet indeed.\" She smirked happily, making his eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about removing it, only I can do it. You don't need to worry about waste either, it's spelled to remove it, making it even more useful for whenever I wish to enjoy your pretty little ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw opened in stunned disbelief before she pointed at the ring around his genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That on the other hand is a simple abstinence-ring, it will stop your from getting any more erections. With the plug in place it will save you from embarrassing erections and prevent you from playing with yourself. After all,\" she grinned again, \"the only time you're allowed to cum now is through your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his shocked face she stroked his cheek while cooing softly.<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't worry pet, you will learn to love both your new gifts soon enough. In fact I'm certain that already tonight you will be experiencing your first prostate orgasm alone. As the plug does it work it will become easier and better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. what about showering Mistress? Wont other people see them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she grinned again, \"you'll just have to learn to be very fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as he was about to argue further she just patted his butt, making him hiss slightly as he noticed the red cheeks she had left from the earlier spanking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you get dressed and catch up to your friends now, we'll have plenty of time to talk again tomorrow.\"<br>\r\nHe looked ready to protest but finally sighed in defeat, stumbling slightly as he got dressed again before almost limping out of the room.<br>\r\nShe sighed in pleasure as she admired her work, watching the way his hips swung as he tried to walk with the imposing plug. Maybe she should get him a nice pair of panties to wear, she was certain he would look simply adorable in some girly clothes. The thought of having to lift his skirt and pull his panties to the side before plundering his ass made her hard. Hell, she could even take him to the Malfoy summer retreat in France for a weekend. Some lotion to help get rid of all his body hair and she could dress him up as a girl, maybe even have him act as a maid serving her or a daughter with a deep love for mommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her cock rise again she banished those thoughts lest she hunt down Harry for another go. She was in no hurry, she did after all have all year to enjoy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Every practice, Harry brought the Marauders' Map with him and while he had the rest of the team run drills, he would discreetly check the map for a certain Malfoy. Oh, Ginny knew quite clearly his theory of Draco Malfoy being a Death Eater, but he was going at it without any tact or planning at all and it was hurting the team. Whenever he thought Malfoy was making a move, Harry would abruprly end the practice and take off, with Ron right behind him. The Chasers and Beaters, however, loved Quidditch so much that they would continue practicing without Harry or Ron. They would even adjust things so that Ginny could act as Seeker or one of the other players could act as Keeper. One practice, however, it finally got too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sick and tired of our Captain blowing us off!\" said Ginny one day to the rest of the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with you, Ginny. I've been his teammate since we joined the same year when I was a 2nd year and he was a 1st year\" replied the 7th year Katie Bell. \"Ever since Umbridge took him off the team last year, he's become more and more unreliable. Regardless of the circumstances, he's only won us 1 championship. You were the Seeker when we won the Championship last year, Ginny while Harry didn't play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He might be a good Seeker, but he's a terrible teammate and leader. I've hardly seen him practice at all. He takes his position for granted. Ginny, for all we know, you might be the better Seeker!\" replied Demelza Robins, the 3rd Chaser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even when he is here, he gives too much leniency to Ron Weasley even though he's inconsistent just because he's his best friend. If anyone, Ron should be prscticing with us, but he always leaves with Harry because he thinks he's a great Keeper when he's not most of the time. When the Captain tries to correct us, it's almost laughable because he's always distracted by that parchment of his!\" added Jimmy Peakes, one of the new Beaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of us had to earn our way onto the team through the tryouts earlier in the year, even Katie and Ginny who were both on the team last year. If one of you two were Captain and Harry had to try out, would he have made the team?\" questioned Ritchie Coote, the other new Beater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question. Our first game is coming up in a few weeks and I don't know how we'll win with the lack of leadership on our team. I say at tomorrow's meeting, we call for a vote of no confidence in both his position as Captain and Seeker. I think I have a good chance at beating him. He relies on his past accomplishments too much to feel the need to keep sharp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'd also make a good Captain as well\" replied Katie. \"In our own practices with the 5 of us, you are a natural at taking charge, organizing drills, and critiquing us fairly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree\" said the other 3 at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Starting tomorrow, there'll be a new Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.\"    </span></div></div>",

I believe I'm a better Seeker than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie then pulled up a bag that was by her feet and held it up. \"In this ball is 100 golf balls. I'll throw all 100 balls to each you. Whomever gets the most out of 100 will be the new Seeker. In the event of a tie, we will do a tiebreaker. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" mumbled Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay with it.

After just a few minutes Harry discovered the locker room had not been cleaned in a long while for a cloud of dust with each sweep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes Harry hears a call from the pitch, \"Hey water boy get you ass over here,\" Harry hurries out to see Katie Bell standing next to the cooler tapping her foot in frustration.  \"How about you do you actual job you idiot and get me a drink,\" Katie said as Harry rushes over and not wanting to be kicked off the team by using his broom to hit her, Harry muttered an apology and filled a cup with water.  Katie snatched the cup away and gulped it down and took off without out another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to work Potter I want that locker room swept out by the end of practice,\" Ginny called making Harry jump and head back to sweeping the room.  </span></div></div>",

Hermione always knew a great deal about a great many things except perhaps potions, he clearly was better at that subject than she was these days, thanks to the Half' Blood Prince.<br>\r\n\"I can't explain it Harry, I'll have to show you but it is not here in the common room it is... elsewhere. Will you fillow me please?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so\" he grunted in a non-commital voice. He had the Prince's potions book in his hands and he was trying to familiarise himself with a new concoction, he had no real desire to go anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed Hermione out of the common room and on to the seventh floor, wondering what on earth was of such earth-shaking importance that it should lead him away from his potions book. Hermione stopped shortly in front of the tapetry of Barnabus the Barmy and Harry scoffed, disinterestedly \"Oh, the room of requirement\" he sighed \"I've seen it Hermione. I'm going back to read my book.\"<br>\r\nNot this room, Harry\" she informed him \"it is one of my own invention, you'll like it.\"<br>\r\nWell, uh alright.

She whispered a password in his ear \"think of that word too, but don't say it allowed or it won't work.\"<br>\r\nHarry thought he might as well give it a go, he wasn't going to get any peace from her until he did this, experience had shown him that It would take maybe a couple of minutes to see this room of hers then he could get right back to that book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work out that way.<br>\r\n\"Remember what I told you Harry, and remember the pacing, we pace back and forth in front of this spot and my room will appear, you know that.\"<br>\r\nHarry nodded and started walking back and forth along the corridor, as did Hermione.

If I want an exit, one will appear for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? Why don't you try it.\"<br>\r\nHarry slently willed for the doorway to appear to him but nothing happened. He pleaseded with his thoughts, silently begging for a door, he vocalised his begging, pleading for a door to appear, he threw all his will behind the thought of a doorway, all he could try to try to bring forth the exit to this room. It didn't work.<br>\r\n\"You see?\" Hermione purred \"this room won't answer to you because that was one of the demands I placed upon it when I created this place. I also asked for it to be a room that only you and I could ever find so nobody will ever disturb us here. I even protected it with the password I asked you to remember. There's no escaping from me Harry, not now and not ever again. You'll live out your days and nights in this room.

She even removed his glasses and tossed them onto the floor. \"No wait, Herm. mmph\" was all he managed to say next as Hermione sat, her butt cheeks making contact with his face, then she shifted forward until his nose was buried in her crotch, his nose under her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving achieved her optimum position Hermione relaxed and simple allowed her young womanhood to own Harry's face.</span></div></div>",

She had other ideas and Harry Potter was going to be a part of them, not that he had any choice in the matter. He was tied to the bed and Hermione was sitting on him, he was hers to use as she saw fit and she was definitely about to use him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel his nose inside her, right where she wanted it of course. She sharted rocking back and forth against his nose, sliding it in and out of herself and delighted in the waves of energy that shot through her as she did so. She didn't leave it there either, she leaned into him, she leaned back, she rocked back and forth. She ground herself upon his face. Each and every way she could use his face to stimulate her womanhood, she achieved short of asking him to get personally involved. She did not need his tongue inside her, at least not yet. All those delightful sensations she was starting to experience would be of her own making, Harry's face was simply the tool that she would use for her own amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, Harry wasn't exactly having a pleasing time of it either. He was in almost total darkness ever since she had removed his classes, and now that she had sat upon his face the darkness was absolute. She could feel her twin butt cheeks presisng down upon him, her weight enveloping and entombing him, Her weight was everywhere on his face, as was he warmth and a feminine fragrance that due to her presence upon him was exceptionally potent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he couldn't breathe as she sat on him, his nose and mouth sealed shut under her but then she started to use him to pleasure herself. Her heat and her pungent aroma arising as she did so but at least as she worked he could now draw the occaisonal snatch of breath, each breath smelling strongly of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Hermione was in the throws of ecstasy either, crying out \"Yes, Yes, Yes!\" as she bucked wildly on his face, riding him as she would ride a bucking bronco. Then suddenly a squirt of liquid shot out of her womanhood and washed over his waiting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wonderful, Harry!\" she cried out as she finally allowed her ravaging of his face beneath her to come to a halt.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having ridden herself to orgasm on Harry's face,  Hermione slips off him for a moment, going over to her discarded robes and retrieving a glass vial from the pocket. The vial contained a strange brown liquid, a potion of some kind it seemed. She brought it over to where Harry was still laid out on the bed, his face soaked in her secretions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning broadly she removed the seal from the vial and touched his face with it, then with one finger she wiped some of her juices from his face, allowing them to drip into the vial. She replaced the seal and shook the vial a few times to make sure the new ingredient was mixed properly into the potion, and as she did so the liquid inside turned more creamy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo bring a sense of artistry to what came next, Hermione used an unspoken spell to induce a sense of thirst in Harry, as she unsealed the vial once more. As he did not have his glasses on at the time, he would of course be unable to see exactly what she was holding in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be thirsty after what just happened\" Hermione advised him [b]\"here is a little something to make everything better.\" She brought the vial towards his mouth. [b]\"Drink it all, Harry\"[/b] she instructed in a mild sounding voice, and as Harry opened his mouth she poured the contents of the vial down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry thought the strange drink tasted funny, but he was suddenly far too thirsty to object. He swallowed it all. Hermione watched him, satisfied at least that he had taken his medicine. She even relieved the thirst spell she had cast on him so Harry would think the strange potion was actually doing him some good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, Harry\" she smiled at him \"now I will put you back where you belong and explain to you what you have just drank.\" She climbed back onto the bed, and resumed her seat upon Harry's face, sealing his airway with her crotch and her butt cheeks as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you have just taken\" she informed him \"is a potion which allows a potion to remain alive, and conscious for a time without the need to breathe. I know you cannot breathe Harry. I know that my womanhood is sealing your airway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew she was right, she tried to draw a breath, but he could not draw any air past her enveloping softness. His airway was sealed shut by her feminine body. Ordinarily Harry was sure that after a few minutes under her he his lungs would be crying out for air, he would be seeing stars but his lungs remained silent, his brain alert, his consciousness intact. Was this the potion she had given him? How long would it last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she spoke again. [b]\"Under normal circumstances you would have passed out by now Harry\"[/b] she advised him [b]\"and if I maintained my position for much longer, you would pass away; the boy who lived no longer a living boy.\" Clearly though, what she had given him was preventing that scenario from becoming a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The potion, once taken need not ever be taken again\" she told him \"but it has an active ingredient that must be replenished. Without regular doses of that ingredient, it loses its potency, it fails. Once you take more of the ingredient though, it comes in to full effect once more, you will be able to survive without air for a while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wondered what the active ingredient was, perhaps Hermione would tell him. In his current situation, potion or not he was unable to ask her anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incidentally Harry\" she added then \"the active ingredient was the last one that I added to the potion, the substance I wiped from your face just before I made you drink, the same substance I sprayed all over your face when I used you to make me feel oh so happy. You need regular doses Harry, You need to keep swallowing my nectar, Without it Harry, you cannot sustain what I am doing to you right now, Without the potion you would be dead now Harry. Your life depends on how often and how willingly you service me with your tongue, Harry for you will go under me on a regular basis Harry. I guarantee that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't sure how often he would be required to do as Hermione asked him, but he had no wish to die. Hermione was playing on his own instinct for self preservation, He may be required to live off her pussy juices for the rest of his life, but he was eager for that life to continue for as long as he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The start of the party had been fun as the cruelly nicked-named \"Loony\" meet with some important people and in one case a vampire.  But as Luna was talking to her favorite Professor, Trelawney, Harry had walked away with the excuse he had to use the bathroom.  Rather then head towards the bathrooms Slughorn had formed in to his expanded office, Harry had left the room and was gone for a good thirty minutes after which he was acting too sudden for her taste.  For the rest of the night Harry was distracted even walking into several people and up ending a tray of drinks being carried by a house elf right onto her new dress.  With a sigh Luna pulled out her wand and cleaned the dress before taking a firm hold of Harry's arm and leading him out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she lead a non-resisting Harry into a nearby classroom she finally let go and ask him what was on his mind.  \"Sorry Luna it is Draco again,\" Harry said making the blonde girl roll her eyes for while she was not fully in Harry's inner circle of friends she had heard from both Ginny and Neville about Harry's seeming obsession with Draco Malfoy this year that made the previous years seem like he was ignoring his rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Harry it is Christmas don't think about that try to relax and enjoy your self,\" Luna said placing a comforting hand on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Luna I just can't he is up to something I just know it,\" Harry said casually brushing her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know something that will distract you,\" Luna said moving to stand right before Harry and before he could ask what she was talking about Luna reached up and grabbed the sides of his face as she stood on tiptoes and kiss him right on his mouth.  Luna saw his eyes widen as their lips touched but she did not let go of his face until she felt him begin to relax a little  Once Luna felt his body seem to mellow she let go of his face but did not break contact as this was her first kiss and she wanted to enjoy it for the moment.  Luna was actually surprised that after she let go of his face Harry had not pushed her away but was actually returning the kiss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Luna herself move away from him brushing a lock of her blonde hair away as she looked at him and was glad to see a smile on his face.  \"See you look better when you smile and less like a detomat-veso,\" Luna said smiling up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can never tell if you are talking about real creatures or just making them up to lighten the mood,\" Harry said smiling down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I never make things up Harry,\" Luna said placing her hands on her hips as she scowled at him but only for a moment before she broke into a grin as on impulse she grab him by his tie and pulled him in for another kiss.  Harry once more offers no resistance as he is pulled in to the kiss as he actually wraps one of his arms around Luna's body in a hug.  As the pair kissed without even realizing it Luna began to push Harry backwards until his legs hit a desk and forced him to fall back onto it with a happy expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looks up at Luna, who was still holding onto his black dress tie before he states, \"That was some kiss...</span></div></div>",

The person introduced herself as Professor Sprout and took Jenny to a place to get supplies for school as well as a magic wand.  As Professor Sprout lead Jenny through her shopping she informed the girl about some does and do-nots of being a Witch such as not using magic in front of a muggle, a person who could not perform magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a muggle born Jenny was given an expanded list of books to help her gain some knowledge of the Wizarding world so she would not be surprised by some things, all of which were paid for by Hogwarts.  These books included <i>Hogwarts: A History, Dark Arts Users: Where Good Wizards Went Wrong</i>, and finally <u>The Boy Who Live: The Early Life of Harry Potter by Rita Skeeter.</u>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home Jenny threw herself into the books to learn all she could about the Magical world she would soon find herself in, she was very interested in the book about Harry Potter for Professor Sprout had told her some of the adventures of him while he had been at school surprising Jenny to learn that he was still in school.

Feeling the glass shatter on meeting Harry Jenny was in a huff until the sorting ceremony where she was placed in Gryffindor and went to the table but could not find Harry at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry walked in right before the deserts appeared with a blood stained robe making the people near her gasp.  Looking up she saw him walk a short distance away and sit between the red haired boy and a girl with bushy brown hair.  She was near enough that she heard some of the conversation but as she tried to listen in thinking that she had been wrong about him and he had just fought off a bunch of Dark Wizards laughter erupted from a nearby table and looking up she saw a platinum blonde boy miming a nose breaking with his eyes locked on Harry.  Knowing right then what had actually happened Jenny's opinion of Harry sunk even lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the feast Jenny and the rest of the first years were called over to be show the way to the dorm as Harry basically fled from the hero worshiping gazes of her new dorm mates.  The girl with the bushy brown hair, who introduced herself as Hermione, told them the password to get into their dorm and began to lead them to it.  Jenny broke from the crowd as she saw Harry going upward, remembering a map from <u>Hogwarts: A History</u> Jenny took a short cut that got her to the Fat Lady's picture to find Harry, who did not know the password pacing back and forth.

Sara goes over to apologize only to accidentally step on the glasses.  \"Sorry about that this is all so new to me,\" Sara said blushing as she helped the boy to his feet, Now Sara was rather short for her age barely standing four feet tall but she was well muscled while the boy she had run into stood around five and half feet tall was rather skinny wearing over sized clothes with messy hair and what looked like a bolt of lightning on his forehead.  As Sara had three older brother's she guessed his age based on his height, \"I am so sorry you must be new here as well,\" Sara said taking his arms and helping him to a nearby cabin to store her luggage.  Sara barely seemed to notice as the boy tried to pull away as she stored her stuff.  \"I'm Sara by the way who are you?\" Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um I am Harry Potter,\" Harry responded finding it strange not to be recognized and figuring Sara was a muggle born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Harry,\" Sara said shaking Harry's hand and almost crushing his fingers.

To no ones surprise Hermione passed the test, but what was really shocking was that Ron passed and Harry failed so for the first time ever Harry was riding the train to Hogwarts alone, as Ginny wanted to take a break to morn her older brother but also some of her friends that died during the final battle of Hogwarts.  Harry found he was the topic of many conversations the ride down not to mention during the opening feast.  After the feat Harry was pulled over by the new Head of House as McGonnigal was now the Headmistress of Hogwarts.  Harry was informed that since he had not graduated last year his old dorm was now the first year dorm room and since the other male dorm in the Tower were all filled Harry would have to sleep with the first years.  Harry just shrugged seeing no problem with it, at least until he got to the dorm room to find that the first years had claimed all the good beds leaving him with the worst bed in the room, the one that had been used by Neville.  Feeling to tired to really care Harry feel asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day some of his new dorm mates celebrated to find themselves sharing the same room with the famous Harry Potter, leaving Harry just to give the a polite nod as he got dressed.  The story soon spreed around the Tower that Harry was sleeping in the first year's dorm causing some of the second and first years to laugh.  After breakfast when the schedules were handed out Harry saw he had a free period right away and went back to the Common Room to relax.  It seemed that the damage from the Battle at the end of the term last year had not been cleaned up so the when he got back he found the whole first year class hanging out in the Common Room.  Not wanting to be swarmed by the kids Harry grabbed his bag and left for a empty class room.  As he sat down in a desk in the room he really began to miss Ron and Hermione when the sound of a door opening caused him to look up.  Harry sees that a first year girl enters the room carrying her own back pack.  She is shocked to see Harry sitting at a desk in what she though was her first class, evident missing the fact that first years had a free period.  \"So not only are you sleeping in the first year dorm but you are taking first year courses?\" the girl asked taking the seat right next to Harry.  Harry tired to explain that he was just in the room to do some reading before his first class but the girl did not seem to be paying attention instead she...</span></div></div>",

Flitwick composed himself as he began to teach having the kids bring out their books for the lesson.  Harry was once more forced to share with Sarah until he could send for year appropriate books.   Flitwick began to Harry's surprise with a test to see what his students knew about Charms handing out pages like a pop quiz and created an hourglass.  As Harry was more of a practical student usually relying on Hermione for the actual theory Harry gazed down at the question completely stumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hourglass ran out of time Flitwick used his wand to collect and grade all the papers.

The only noticeable different was that these new panties had a small picture of a lightning bolt on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sarah clapped with delight and silently congratulated herself. As a pair of panties, Harry would be hidden under her regular clothes so nobody would even see him, and yet she would still be wearing him close to her skin, pressed against her butt.

The panties soon began to travel around the school with girls of every year seeming to find them at some point and no matter their body type the panties were the perfect size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo ends the story of Harry Potter born to stop the Dark Lord and the end his life as the most comfortable panties any girl at Hogwarts would ever wear.</span></div></div>",

You personally told me not to hold back, so that's what I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor glared at him in barely contained rage. \"Are you for real? There is a massive difference between 'not holding back' and 'publicly humiliating an innocent girl', Mr. Potter. This was no duel, this was straight up bullying. I will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. Now cancel these spells and apologize, as for every additional second this poor girl has to endure in that state I will double your punishment.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The black Hogwart's robe began to shimmer as it changed into a sky blue one piece leotard.

Seeing this as a perfect time to escape Harry rolls over the bed and tries to grab one of his school robes from his trunk only for Rose with a flick of her wand close the trunk and lock it.

Looking at Harry Rose felt the urge to tease and humiliate him even more by dragging him out into the Common Room as he was at the moment for all to see him in his special panties.  At the same time Ginny felt love for Harry but a deep desire to dress him as her bunny boy and wondered if she could convince McGonagall to find a way to transfer Harry back up to Seventh Year but keep him in the female dorms,  which would work out for her since there were only one other female in her dorm room.  Who reaches Harry first?</span></div></div>",

Yes he had defeated Voldemort and she along with the rest of the world were happy about that, but it gave he a special thrill to cause him humiliation she had only been teasing him about being back in first year never even imagining it would become a reality.

Taking a firm hold of the waistband of his yellow and pink polka-dot panties she gave them a sudden jerk upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry let out a loud screech as Rose gave him a wedgie, something that had not happen since he was in muggle school from his cousin Dudley.  As Harry screeched he became the center of attention as people began to laugh at the great Harry Potter wearing panties getting a wedgie from a first year girl.  Rose was over the moon as she hoisted the panties even higher making them thread deep into Harry's ass crack so both his cheeks were in plain sight.  Than showing surprising strength Rose actually began to lift Harry off the ground and began to turn him around so everyone could see how deep the wedgie went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your time,\" Rose said letting Harry back down before dragging him out of the room to thunderous applause from the girls and teasing laughter from the males.  Harry's eyes began to cross as he was pulled back into the First Year girl's dorm room due to the pain  before Rose finally let go.  With the pressure no longer over powering Harry was able to collapse to his knees squeezing his eyes shut in pain as he cradled his smashed grapes.

Harry who had mostly recovered by now, though walking a little bowlegged, came over and giving Rose a glare began to gather his stuff and put them back in the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry leaned over to deposit the first handful of his things back into the trunk Rose comes up right behind the Seventh Year boy and gave his butt a little push.  The push was enough to overbalance Harry who fell face first into his own trunk; Rose smiles as she quickly pushes his arms and legs into the trunk as well, giving his bottom a quick swat as well, before the ten year old girl closes the lid to the trunk,  The trunk begins to rock back and forth as Harry tries to get out of it but the way he was stuffed into it did not give him much room to push the lid open with either his hands or feet.  Rose smiles at the rocking trunk before with a giggle she turns around and jumps backward onto it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rose perched on the trunk she looks at the mess she had made which would also be a clue to where Harry was if anyone came to look so the young girl pulls out her wand and cast a spell that makes all of Harry's possessions stack themselves neatly on the bedside table and under the bed which Harry would have slept in.

Harry almost called out for help, thinking that Ginny had returned by before he could overcome the shame of his current situation he hear a couple of unfamiliar female voices laugh and converse with Rose, but due to where he was Harry could not tell what the girls were talking about, though he could hazard a guess that the laughter was about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Rose, that was hilarious,\" the First Year girl named Mandy said as she went to sit on the edge of he bed facing Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" Rose asked looking at Mandy who unlike Rose had dark brown hair that was only to the top of her slim neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt seeing the \"Great\" Harry Potter receiving a wedgie from a fellow First Year was awesome the whole house is talking about it,\" the only other First Year girl answered.

As well as cementing Harry acceptance of Ginny claim to be the dominant sexual partner in their marriage and of his occupation of the submissive feminine role to which he was obviously more suited to as evidenced by the slutty french maid outfit that he was wearing and by how easily Ginny had turned him into her slave once she set her mind to it.   .<br>\r\nIt stiffened as she, in a playfully manner, approached him, while her large cock swung from side to side as she did so creating an almost hypnotic effect on her submissive husband fixing him to the stop he stood in a kind of trance caused by her girl cock that was only broken when she reached her husband and pulled him into a brief but passionate kiss in which her dominant tongue explored  and savored every inch of his mouth, while the feeling of her new equipment pressing into Harry's small and caged dick, underneath all that lace and silk stirred further feelings of submissive and arousal which Ginny noticed due to Harry's flushed state when she broke the kiss. <br>\r\nDeciding to further increase these feelings and make harry feel comfortable in his new role, Ginny orders him to?        </span></div></div>",

He loved feet and he liked Ginny dominate in the bedroom but he wasn't sure about this... he hadn't made any protest yet since it might just be part of her 'take charge roleplay' they were doing.  He had an unsettling feeling that it was more than that though.  Before he could focus on that and try to get Ginny to clarify she dropped another bombshell!  Inviting Hermione over as well?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had always found Hermione attractive.  He had only gotten to see her cute feet a few times but each memory of it he cherished.  To actually be able to kiss her feet... well that was a fantasy he had never even dared bring up with his wife.  Now it was happening, but would it still be fun with a chastity cage?  And would Hermione still respect him as a friend later?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny...

Harry crouched down with his arms above his head, fearing his wife was going to crush him like a bug under her shoe. She didn't crush him but she stomped her foot down next to him. \"Don't give me any more lip, or I will flatten you under my boot, understand?\". \"Yes dear.\" Harry said. \"Good.\" Ginny said with a smile. She continued \"Now as I was saying, Hermione read this article about shrinking spell to try on your husband and she thought it would be fun to try on Ron, so she did.\" \"Did he know she was going to shrink him?\". Harry asked. \"Of course not silly.\" Ginny said. \"But she told me yesterday that she has kept Ron shrunk for a whole week, but she has been changing his height, so he can be used for different things in the bedroom\". Ginny said with a smile. \"Ginny I demand that you return me to my normal size.\" Harry said with a nervous voice as he looked up at his beautiful wife who could kill him with one stomp of her boot. Ginny reached down and picked up her shrunken husband between her thumb and index finger. Glaring at him she said \"First of all you are to address me as Mistress Ginny, second you are to obey my every command and third you are in no position to argue with me.\" Knowing his wife, Harry realized that he needed to shut up and obey her if he didn't want his beautiful, but deadly wife to kill him.

Hermione had actually been thinking of inviting Albus to visit with her daughter when he and his father turned up at her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had never suspected that Hermione had a dominant side, during their time at Hogwarts she had been a bossy know-it-all to be sure but she had also been a valued ally. When she had first met him on the train, he hadn't been alone, since Ron was with him in the compartment, and they were so close to Hogsmeade at that point that she wouldn't have had much time to carry out her plans anyway. At Hogwarts, it seemed there was always something to distract her from her plans;not only their regular lessons and homework, but also trying to uncover mysteries and stop foul plots and dark lords. In their final year when they were tracking down the horcruxes,  she had finally managed to get Harry alone but but she knew that even then her priority had to be to destory the horcruxes and stop Voldemort, so even then she had to keep her secret plans to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, the wizarding world was no longer in danger, now she had him in her own home. Now she could do to Harry what she had planned to do from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you make yourself comfortable, Harry\" she invited, indicating the nearby armchair.<br>\r\nHarry sat down, and the moment he did, Hermione went over to him, turned and sat in the exact same place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof\" Harry gasped \"Hermione!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, harry?\" she asked sweetly whilst she sat on him.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Sitting, of course. Can't you tell?\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm here.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, believe me, I know.  Are you suggesting I shouldn't sit where I want in my own home?\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you sitting on me?\"<br>\r\n\"I invited you to make yourself comfortable? Shouldn't I be comfortable too?\"<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\"<br>\r\n\"No, Harry. I like it here. You could try pushing me off if you like, not that it'll get you anywhere.\"<br>\r\nHarry tried to throw Hermione off him, he tried with all his strength but Hemrione was sitting firmly, using Harry as her chair and even from childhood, Harry was never all that strong or muscular, he couldn't budge her. Eventually he slumped in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Albus came downstairs and found 'Aunt' Hermione sitting on his father.<br>\r\n\"Aunt Hermione\" he asked \"why are you sitting on my father?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't see why that is any of your concern\" Hemrione advised him \"I thought you were going to visit Rose.\"<br>\r\n\"She was doing some weird stuff, with Hugo. I didn't like it.\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of weird stuff?\"<br>\r\n\"He was\" he made a face... \"kissing.... her feet.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't expect a girl to wait around all day.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"She has been asking after you for some time, she was probably bored. That's why she's playing with her brother instead.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you saying she wants me to kiss her feet? I won't do it!\"<br>\r\n\"That's up to her, I'd say.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't want to kiss her feet.\"<br>\r\n\"I dare say your father didn't want to be used as my seat, but here he is. I daresay though that if Rose knew you were here and that you were avoiding her, she would be most upset with you. Kissing her feet might be the least of her demands.\"<br>\r\n\"Perhaps she didn't see me.\"<br>\r\n\"You saw her didn't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Then, you can assume that she saw you as well. My advice to you right now is go back to her room and apologise to her. If you are lucky, she might even accept your apology.\"<br>\r\n\"I won't\"<br>\r\n\"Silly boy!\" Hermione raised her voice \"my daughter will come down eventually and find you here. What do you think she'll do then?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll leave.\"<br>\r\n\"Where will you go? Your father is my seat now, he's not going anywhere, and neither are you.\"<br>\r\nWith a wave of a wand, Hermione locked the door. Albus was now trapped in the house with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say you have three choices\" Hemrione advised. You can stay here and wait for Rose to come down and find you, you can go up and apologise to her or you can come here and worship my feet while I continue to sit on your father. If Rose sees that I kept you here, she might not be so mad at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbus sighed, realising that he had already been neatly backed into a corner</span></div></div>",

One last look back shows him that Hermione had not moved from her seat upon his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gets upstairs he sees that Rose is still sitting in her chair, and that Hugo is still worshiping her feet, He can also see two metal cages in the corner of the room, large enough for a pair of boys to fit inside. The doors of the cages are slightly open, and there is no padlock. Albus was sure that Rose would use magic to lock those cages when she needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of those cages made the boy hesitate at the door, but Rose had caught sight of him. \"Albus, get your ass in here\" she commanded in an imperious voice. Her tone was so authoritative that Albus found himself wandering into her room even before he realised what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the boy was in her den, Rose waved her wand and the door instantly vanished, leaving a solid wall in its place, and offering the boy no possibility of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Hugo. We are done for now. Go back in your cage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother nodded, sauntered over to the nearest cage, wandered inside and closed the door behind him. One more wave of Rose's wand and the cage door sealed itself shut. There was no way he would be able to open that cage without magic, and it was then that Albus noticed that Hugo did not have a wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Albus\" Rose spoke in a deceptively mild tone \"why didn't you come in earlier. I saw you hanging around outside my door, then you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like what you are doing with Hugo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I do to my brother is my business, not yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not your place to determine what is right and wrong. I'm a girl, he is only a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I ONLY a boy too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are and you will soon learn your place\" she glanced at the second cage \"but that is later. For now, you can tell me what finally made you see sense and come back to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother told me I had to come up here and apologise to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you should\" Rose nodded \"so, where is the apology?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Rose. I shouldn't have walked away. Forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That apology is nowhere near good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else would you have me do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here!\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose then....</span></div></div>",

Pansy smiled thinking of finally getting out of this cell so she gathered her small amount of belonging and headed toward the door which Harry had opened and followed her out.  Not bothering to ask directions even though she did not know the way Pansy walked out after a few minutes she looked back at Potter to ask him where they were going only to find him looking at her pert ass.

Pansy took off with a faster step making Harry almost have to run after her.  When they got out to the front there was a Muggle car waiting Harry opened the door and Pansy got inside liking that Harry was acting more like a house elf than a guard as he opened doors for her and walked a few steps behind her.  After a short trip in the car Harry got out and opened her door for her and showed her a nice sized house.  Pansy let out a impress whistle as Harry open the door for her again.

The only other child sleeping are was a crib that Harry and her mom had used on her and her older brothers, the main problem with that is she was not sure if Harry had progressed that far or if she even wanted him to.  Unable to decide which bed Harry should sleep in Lily did what any person would do and flipped a coin with heads standing for the race car due to its slightly older of the two beds and tails for the crib for a diaper that a normal crib's inhabitant would wear on their tail.

She knew he would need help at work and might not be suitable to be an Auron anymore but he could still work at the Ministry if she could put her plan in place.  Lily hurried to her father's study to find him working on a bit of parchment his tongue sticking out in concentration.  With a flick of her wand she summons the parchment to her and read it; after she was finished she was glad she had for if anyone from the Ministry had read this Harry might have been sent to St. Mungos for a while.  \"Why don't I help you out in fact I had the perfect idea on a suggestions to your bosses,\" Lily said crumpling the parchment and turning it to ash with a poke of her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you Mommy thank you,\" Harry said clapping his hands in child-like joy.  Lily than moved to the desk and motioned Harry to move aside pulling two letter sized bits of parchment to her.  On the first parchment she wrote a letter to Hermione asking if she would help out and then sent it waiting for a response before she started the next latter.  Harry who had become board was now doodling on an bit of parchment total content with his thoughts.  When Hermione's response came back with an agreement to help out as best she could Lily smiled as she started on the second letter to the Minister of Magic himself.  In the letter Lily, writing as if she was Harry, told about how the work was becoming a bit much and want to spend some more time at home with his family before his youngest went off to Hogwarts.  Lily stated that Harry still wished to work for the Ministry just not at the post he was in stating that he would rather work as...</span></div></div>",

Raising her eyebrows in worry, she read the letter that was addressed to Harry first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the strangest thing this morning from Hermione, who heard it from Kingsley himself. You've decided to retire as an Auror to become the assistant of a female teenage girl at the Ministry daycare? I'm surprised you made such a decision so quickly without telling me, your wife, first. For your sake, I hope that you're not just going through a mid-life crisis and that you'll regret it later. On the bright side, we do have a lot of money, so we are good financially, otherwise I'd be really angry right now. I am curious about your new boss though. most teenagers in Magical Britain are at Hogwarts right now. I wonder if she is a Squib or perhaps she is one of the few that is homeschooled?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll talk to you later. I love you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily breathed a bit since her mother wasn't yelling at her father in the letter to him. If she was, then she might have decided to come home early. Maybe the letter to her wouldn't be so bad? She picked it up to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can tell that your father's job change is due to you somehow. When I was nine, I felt powerless sometimes, being the youngest in such a huge family and spending most of my days with my mother who was controlling while Dad was at work and my brothers, except for Ron, were at Hogwarts or already left home. I would have loved to somehow usurp some powr within my family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving said that, this is perfect timing. You see, after spending so much time with the all-female Quidditch team, the Holyhead Harpies, I wondered if I made the right decision to get married so young. A couple of my teammates are in a relationship with each other and seeing them makeout with each other makes me a bit curious at least. Another teammate of mine has asked me out a few times and so far I have turned her down due to me still being married and not wanting to lead her on. But it has made me question whether I was still in love with your father or not.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHaving said all that, my biggest concern was our family. It wouldn't be fair to you or your brothers to tear up the family due to my own doubts. However, you have solved that by taking control of your father with me gone and I couldn't feel more proud of you and feel more relaxed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy only question is what is the new relationship between you two? My gut feeling tells me that as the second Lily Potter, you have taken the role of Harry's mother. I am also wondering if his new job is real or if he's somhow reduced himself mentally to that of a young child and he is staying there as another child. If that is the case, that would alone be cause for me to file for divorce; I don't want to be married to someone who sees themself as a young child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf my guess is right, how would you like to really become Harry's mother? At the same time I'm getting divorce papers ready, I can also have some adoption papers drawn up as well for you to adopt Harry.

She had just wanted to let her father have a second childhood but it looks like it would be a domino that would somehow end her family it was a lot for a ten year old even one as mature as her to take in.  Putting the letter out of her mind she went back to help Sarah watch over their group of charges leading a game or two before the teenage called it was nap time and pulling out her wand summoned sleeping mats for all the kids, and Harry.  The two of them than became quite busy laying all the toddlers down for their naps and just for fun Lily let Sarah be the one to put Harry onto his sleeping pad making Lily smile to see her adult father being told to take a nap by the teenage girl who was able to coax him to the nap with the promise that afterwards his \"wand\" would arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's on your mind Lily?  You have seen a bit distracted since you received that letter after the kids snack break,\" Sarah asked concerned for her new aid.  In response Lily pulled the two letters out of her pocket showed it her.  Sarah read both letters sometimes chuckling at what she read before she turned back to Lily.  \"Well to answer your mother's question no I am not a squib and neither was I home schooled you see I past my O.W.L.s but since I had always wanted to be a child care provider it was not necessary for me to go back to get my N.E.W.T.s as for the rest well that is a lot for a ten year old girl to take in I suppose her mother telling her that she would be willing to dump her father so that the daughter could legally adopt him.  And from what I see her concerns of his child-like nature coming back would be fit her conditions for wanting a divorce,\" Sarah said sagely as the two child care providers sat around her desk as their charges at least pretended to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but do I really want to take on such response ability to being Harry's new mother I was just trying to give him a real child hood until I went off to Hogwarts so what would happen if I agree to this and than go to Hogwarts next year?\" Lily asked sharing her concerns with Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well from how I see it, and I do not want to tell you how to live your life, you could take the path your mother has laid out for you which would keep your family together maybe get some help or even find someone to home school you so you could watch over Harry.  Or you could write back to your mom about why you did all this and hope that she does not divorce your father after all,\" Sarah said after a bit of thought placing a supportive hand on Lily's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Lily said kicking her feet of the edge of her chair as Sarah left her with her own thoughts to find a toy wand to give to Harry as a replacement for the one that now belonged to Lily.   Even though Lily was not one to seek power there was an old idea that power was always corruptible so she did not really want to lose her power of Harry, plus she wanted to see her brother's reaction when they came back from school to see Harry as her child their mother fine with it and possibly making them her children to so her mom could leave without any problems and live a happy life, after all when she divorced Harry she would get a lot of money from Harry's multiple bank accounts.  But Sarah was right Lily might need some help so when the blonde teenager came back Lily turned to her and stated, \"I have agreed to go with my mother's plan of her divorcing Harry and him becoming my child but I think I might need some help do you think you could do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily I am touched, but let me think about it for a while okay,\" Sarah said placing a hand over her heart at the consideration of Lily Potter asking her to help take care of the famous Harry Potter as if he was a child full time not just stopping at the end of the work day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I ask,\" Lily said when Sarah suddenly realized it was time to wake the kids from their naps.  The pair began to go around waking the group words or gentle touches on the kid's shoulders leaving Harry until last.  Sarah let Lily handle her soon to be new son having to smile as she could tell even from a distance Harry was asleep and sucking on one of his thumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily touched Harry's shoulder to wake him up his new toy wand in her hand to give to him as well as his part of the letter from Ginny.

Lily than walked away to stop one girl from beating up one of the boys leaving Harry alone with his thoughts.  Yes he stilled loved Ginny but for the second part of the question on what made him really happy it was hard to say.  Yes he had been happy at school with his friend growing up but running the Auror department had been fairly annoying.

Thinking back to the picture she had seen of the blonde teenager in Harry's room she had to laugh as well thinking of the younger girl giving Harry a spanking.  \"Well after that Sarah had Harry stand in time out his hands on his head and pants down well it seems that one of the girls had seen him get a spanking and went over to him and gave him a couple of swats as well leading a group of them to spank Harry while he was on time out.  Ever since then she has gone out of her way to pick on him as if she does not seen him as an adult at all but a kid like her despite his size.  In fact earlier this day he was walking across the room and she stuck out a foot to trip him before giving him a wedgie,\" Lily said.  Ginny was having a hard time containing her laughter of thinking of Harry one of the most famous wizards in the world being bullied every day by a female toddler and not seeming to fight back.</span></div></div>",

Harry than lays before the TV holding his stuffed Dino close to his chest kicking his legs behind him as the show starts.  \"Harry how about no TV tonight since this is Grandma's first night back?\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Mommy,\" Harry whines making Lily try to hid a smile at how childish had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is alright Lily, but how about you watch it on Grandma's lap,\" Ginny said patting to her lap and was happy as Harry came over and climb onto it.  Once more she was surprised at some changes that seemed to have happened to Harry finding him less heavy than before as he get situated on her lap while she wraps her arms around his waist pulling him in tight.  Harry immediately zones on on the show kicking his legs over the edge of Ginny's lap as she thinks back to some of the times she would miss from their marriage that would most likely never happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told she was not all that surprised that Lily had been able to turn Harry into her son after all Ginny had found that Harry while being projected of being a powerful hero was actually more than willing to let others take the lead.  Ginny had found that out quite earlier in their marriage maybe as early as their first month after their wedding when she had talked Harry into letting her use a strap-on on him.  Since than to the rest of the wizarding world they had been a happy equal married couple but behind closed doors she was the one who lead the way.  Though it was a shock that Lily had made him more child like Ginny had not lied in the letter she had sent her daughter after news of Harry's job had changed.  While she liked to dominate Harry some of the thrill had gone out of it at how easy Harry would always submit to her no matter what she had asked him to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny could remember one time after Lily herself was born that she had decided to put Harry through a test giving him the most submissive activities she could think of to see if he would stand up to her.  Unfortunately, he never did while she had liked some so much she had added them to her growing list of things she would do to dominate him, but still after a while having full control over Harry had begun to not excite her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ginny was remembering all of the stuff she had done to Harry she had begun to run her hand over his body which if they were Grandmother and Grandson would be considered her molesting Harry.  Lily saw he mother play with Harry and was actually happy to see that despite everything that had changed in their lives Ginny stilled loved Harry.  After the show it was time for Harry's bed time and Lily let her mother tuck her former husband and now grandson into his bed as Lily wrote her a note for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Lily kisses Harry as she leaves with Sarah, who had come to pick her up since Harry could not apperate her since he was staying home with Ginny.  Ginny was playing the full part of a grandmother with a young grand child as she lifted Harry's hand and made him wave to the pair.  As Ginny closed the door she thought about the note Lily had left on her pillow the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom I saw you \"playing\" with Harry during Blues Clues, and I just wanted to let you know while I am gone you can do anything you want with him even it it is note the typical grandparent/child activity.

Deciding to help him Lily grabs a hank of his hair forcing him further over her fist until she felt his lips touch her shoulder.  With a laugh Lily gave Harry's legs a little kick to the side in preparation as she pulls her fish out of his gut.  With her arm no longer supporting him Harry began to sink to his knees but due to Lily's positioning of his legs he ended up doing the splits.  As his body bulked at sinking lower Lily put her arms onto his shoulders forcing him down until his crotch touched the floor and his legs spread out from under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You are just like play-doh,\" Lily said with a laugh at how easy she was able to move her daddy's body to follow her wishes.  Lily was laughing so hard she did not even try to stop as Harry used his hands to push himself off the floor and stand wobbling in front of her.  For a moment Lily wondered if her daddy would try to control her again but was surprised to see a small quiver of fear in his expression.  Giving it a test Lily took a small step towards him making Harry flinch as he tried to take a step back but could not with his back against the wall.  Lily looked up into her daddy's scared face happy that she was the one to cause him to be so afraid.  Crossing her arms over her chest Lily wondered how she could use her new power of her daddy and decided to make him...</span></div></div>",

Yes Harry was a powerful wizard but since she had just hidden his wand she was not that scared for she had already proven he was weaker than she was.  Seeing her yawn at him Harry almost seems to become rabid as he begins to foam at the mouth getting ready to yell at her for everything she had done to him today.  Lily was not having any of that, however, as she pulled one of her feet back and with as much strength as she could muster sent it right into Harry's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost comical as Harry went from foaming at the mouth in anger to see his eyes bulges as her foot connected and dug into his crotch.  Harry let out a pained whimper as he let go of her collar sinking once more to his knees but Lily was not done yet as she spun around lifting her foot so in connects with the side of Harry's head sending him crashing to the floor of the hallway.  With a superior smile Lily dropped to her knees beside her father pulling him into her grip as she wrapped an arm around his neck in a sleeper hold.  Harry, though dazed, quickly brought his hands up trying to move her single arm but had as much luck as he had moving her thighs earlier.  Seeing the futility of trying to move Lily's arm from around his neck Harry tried to find anything to use against her.  Lily let him work for it as seeing him struggle was making her extremely happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes Harry's fingers were able to grab a book which he thought might distract Lily enough for him to escape.  Taking hold of the book's spine Harry began to slowly shift it to the hand closer to Lily so he could knock it against her elbow and possibly get free.  Unfortunately for him though was that Lily was watching the whole time so before Harry could bring the book up to attack her Lily...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry awoke with a gasp, his body ached but he was surprised to find he was on silk sheets, which wouldn't have surprised him half as much, if he wasn't expecting not to wake up at all. Voldemort cast the killing curse at him, it should have destroyed both himself and the horcrux living within him. Perhaps this is the afterlife he thought to himself, if it was it was a drab one at that. Dark curtains partially covered a large dusty window which let in a trickle of light for Harry to see by. He appeared to be in a very old house, Grimmauld Place perhaps? He hadn't remembered a room like this at his Godfather's, now his, house in London, though it was a very strange house, perhaps they missed a room? He rolled out of the antique looking bed and stepped into the dull light from the window, it was only at this point that Harry realised he was completely naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed the room and stepped into the dull light. Now that he was getting more used to the dim lighting he noticed a large wardrobe against the far wall and a vanity desk next to it. They both looked as old as the bed and Harry was beginning to wonder if he really was dead after all, the afterlife was a bizarre place if he was. He found a short robe hanging over the chair in front of the vanity and slipped it on, it didn't fit quite right but it covered the necessities, it seemed a little too loose around his chest and a little too tight around his waist. He thought about trying the wardrobe for something else but his curiosity got the better of him and he instead tried the handle on the pale wooden door in the corner. It didn't budge, he thought of using the Alohomora charm but suddenly realised he had no idea where his wand even was. He was about to start looking through the drawers of the vanity for his wand when a key sounded in the lock on the door and it opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway with a tray of what looked to be a bowl of porridge and a glass of water was a girl, roughly his age though he couldn't tell for sure, she had long arrow-straight blonde hair and was wearing a short black dress with a white apron. He realised she was dressed like a French maid. Dean Thomas had snuck a copy of Playboy into Hogwarts in their 5th year and though they were disappointed none of the pictures moved, the Gryffindor boys were delighted to have a good ogle at all the sexy muggle girls. Harry remembered this outfit vividly, though if anything the outfit the girl in front of him was wearing was more revealing than the girl in the magazine. The short black dress had capped sleeves on the shoulder and a plunging neckline which revealed perky but not large breasts, Harry could just see the outline of a lacy pink bra and smiled to himself devilishly. The dress was tight around the legs and stopped halfway down her thighs, revealing the barest traces of the tops of a pair of sheer black stockings which began in a pair of large heeled stilettos, they must have been 3 or 4 inches high at least. Harry returned his gaze to the girl's face as she placed the tray down on the table and he noticed the pale pink lipstick. He'd always preferred red on Ginny but pink suited this girl and Harry felt guilty as his penis stirred a little beneath the robe. She placed the tray down on a small desk Harry had previously not noticed in the corner, she turned to face Harry and he noticed how nervous she looked, her hands were encased in silky black gloves which she kept tugging at and adjusting nervously. Harry could have sworn he had seen her before but he couldn't remember where, if she was a witch she must have gone to Hogwarts and she did remind him of a Slytherin but he just couldn't think who. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis musings were interrupted by a shrill voice from down the hall. \"Dorothy! You lazy ingrate! If I find you crying up there again it'll be the cruciatus curse!\" The girl paled visibly at this and turned to head off the source of the call. Harry didn't need to see who it was that came round the corner with Dorothy, he'd recognise that voice anywhere. She returned leading a tall witch with black hair and an evil sneer on her face; Bellatrix Lestrange, the woman who had murdered his Godfather Sirius. Dorothy was whispering in her ear and pointing at Harry, Bellatrix waved her off and pushed her to one side. \"Yes girl, I'll tell the dark lord how loyal and obedient you have been, now get out of my way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry balled his fists with anger and looked around him for a weapon he could use against Bellatrix but she had already drawn her wand and was pointing it at him with a triumphant smile on her lips. \"Looking for something Potter?\" She withdrew a pouch from her hips and showed Harry the beginnings of a pair of wands protruding. Harry looked longingly at that bag and noticed that Dorothy did the same. Harry was thinking of a dozen ways he could get one of those wands before Bellatrix killed him when he was thrown backwards by a blast of red light, she had stunned him. He distinctly heard Bellatrix's trademark laugh before he blacked out entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harry regained his senses he was being rolled onto the bed by Dorothy whilst Bellatrix lounged in the corner on a comfortable looking chair which wasn't there before. \"Awake now Potter? Hit your head hard you did, if you don't want it to happen again I'd listen well. The Dark Lord has decreed that you are not to be injured severely, but he didn't define what severely meant so I think that anything less than death will be allowed don't you?\" For emphasis she lowered her wand in Harry's direction and he felt a shooting pain in his feet as if he were suddenly standing on hot coals. The maid had finished rolling him into bed and Harry tried to sit up as ropes extended from Bellatrix's wand and snaked around his wrists and ankles, tying him securely to the four posts of the bed. \"That's better, let's see what we've got here shall we Dorothy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy undid the robe Harry was wearing and pulled it away to reveal a slim body, the last year had been hard on Harry, although they hadn't been starved for food whilst on the run, they hadn't eaten as well as Harry was used to, especially not compared to the meals he was used to at Hogwarts and the Burrow. He was now back to the wiry body he had last had before he even knew what Hogwarts was, though he had grown almost a foot. \"Yes, this will do nicely, Dorothy, run along and bring up the bag your mother dropped off this morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dorothy left the room Bellatrix waved her wand and the door shut behind her, she stood and loomed over Harry, still prostrate on the bed, though he had given up trying to wriggle out of the bonds. \"I suppose you're wondering what you're doing here Potter? You thought you could outsmart the greatest wizard of all time? You and that crackpot Dumbledore are fools, the Dark Lord knew about the Horcrux in you, oh yes, he told me, his most trusted servant. You thought you could trick the Dark Lord into weakening himself? Now you've delivered yourself to us he will never die, the Dark Lord will live forever!\" Harry replayed the events from the forest in his mind, it was coming back to him now, he had expected Voldemort to kill him immediately but he had hesitated, it was Bellatrix who attacked him, first stunning him then hitting him with a full body bind before he passed out. He supposed they must have shown the defenders at the school his body to make them surrender, his thoughts turned to Ron and Hermione and he prayed they had made it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy returned with a large paper bag and set it down on the floor. As she stood up Harry realised where he recognised her from. \"Malfoy! Is that you?\" Bellatrix laughed hysterically and turned to Dorothy who had gone pale white, even with the pink blush on her cheeks. \"Well well Draco, don't disappoint Mr Potter.\" Dorothy turned paler still as her hands crept down to the bottom of her skirt, pulling it upwards to reveal a pair of pink lace panties with what was clearly a penis trapped inside. \"Dorothy's a little shy these days Potter but I'll explain, my idiot brother in law thought he could flee the Dark Lord but he was a fool. Dorothy is here to make sure Lucius does a good job at the ministry and tows the line in future. The Dark Lord does so hate to waste magical blood.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix waved her wand again and the ropes on Harry's wrists temporarily unhitched themselves from the bed, only to shoot forwards and wrap themselves around the tops of the four poster, dragging Harry with them so he was standing at the end of the bed spread eagled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The corset first Dorothy.\" She withdrew from the bag an emerald green corset, with garters dangling from the bottom. Harry realised too late what she was doing with it as it was snapped around his midriff and Bellatrix snapped the laces tight with a wave of her wand. Harry gasped as all of the air in him was expelled at once by the force, his waist had shrunk to nearly half its original size. Harry felt a wave of pain rush over him as Bellatrix waved her wand again, he thought she was using the Cruciatus curse on him but quickly realised she was pulling the hairs out of his body, all at the same time, it was agony. Bellatrix sneered at Harry as the hairs on his chin finally popped out and disintegrated, she grabbed his chin and lifted it, daring him to give her a reason to inflict more pain. She pointed her wand at his toes and bright pink paint suddenly sprang up on each nail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do your toes for you this time Potter but Dorothy needs to practise so she will do your hands.\" She turned to Malfoy. \"I want her ready and downstairs in one hour.\" She cast one last spell and Harry didn't know what she'd done until black hair began creeping down the side of his face and onto his shoulders. She slammed the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was left alone with Malfoy who refused to make eye contact as he withdrew items from the bag on the floor, now that Harry knew the truth he could see the tell-tale signs of Draco Malfoy beneath the makeup and clothing. Draco had never had a masculine face anyway so the light makeup made him look pretty, his doe eyes hid the shame which hid beneath, with every blink Harry saw huge curved eyelashes sweep down. A white maid's cap held back most of the blonde hair but the occasional lock would fall into his/her face and Harry watched as a gloved hand pushed it back behind her ears. He noticed the silver snakes hanging from each lobe, a mockery of Draco's former school house. Harry caught another glimpse of cleavage as Draco/Dorothy bent down to withdraw another item from the bag, Harry didn't see what as he was too entranced by the milky flesh under the pink bra, he could do nothing as his now hairless penis sprang to attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy seemed to notice this and blushed greatly, standing up he/she found herself level with the tip of Harry's penis and without a moment's hesitation she took its length in her mouth and sucked furiously, her tongue rubbing the length delicately. Harry couldn't believe what was going on and came within seconds, Malfoy continued sucking until every last drop had left Harry, he swallowed it all and had to lick her pale pink lips to catch an errant drop. <br>\r\nHarry was left confused yet oddly satisfied and Malfoy turned to the vanity, frowning. She withdrew a tube of lipstick from a pouch in her apron and refreshing herself in the mirror. Confusing thoughts were racing through Harry's brain and barely noticed as Malfoy pulled a pair of frilly green panties up his legs and tucked his penis in, adjusting it until Harry had a smooth front with no bulges. She began rolling a pair of white stockings up each of Harry's legs and clipped them to the garters, Harry blushed at how feminine his legs looked. Malfoy went back to digging in the bag and returned with a small pink box. Harry's fears were quickly realised as she withdrew two large breasts, considerably larger than those Malfoy was sporting he thought to himself. Malfoy worked silently, pressing the breasts to Harry's chest where they instantly stuck, the edges moulding themselves to Harry's skin and creating a gapless seal, to an untrained eye you wouldn't realise Harry had never had breasts as the inherent magic in the forms perfectly mimicked the real thing. Harry felt Malfoy's breath on his new breasts as she lightly blew on each nipple, which instantly went hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy continued Harry's transformation in silence, Harry tried to plead with him at first, as a matching green bra followed his panties he decided to change tack and instead tried asking Malfoy questions about Hogwarts and his friends, all of which were ignored, Harry couldn't remember her muttering a word since he had woken up. A green choker with what Harry realised was a Slytherin snake at the centre was fitted around his throat and Malfoy undid the ropes around the bed frames, though as Harry tried to make a run for the door the ones at his ankles instantly tied together and he fell flat on his face, the pain wasn't too great as his fall was cushioned by his new breasts, which now ached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy guided him to the chair at the vanity at which point the ropes wrapped themselves around the arms and legs, securing Harry again. She began taking pots and brushes from the drawers and Harry realised that he would be getting a makeover too. She began with his nails which she filed and then painted a pale green colour, matching the choker around his neck. As the nails dried she went to work on Harry's face, a large amount of concealer was used on his forehead and Harry realised she was covering his scar. After what seemed an age of powders, brushes and liquids, Malfoy stepped away and Harry saw his reflection in the mirror, if Malfoy was pretty then he was downright gorgeous. Pale green eyeshadow was delicately painted over each eye and dark mascara hung on huge eyelashes like Malfoy had. Pink blush highlighted his now high cheeks and a matching shade of pink lipstick adorned his lips, though his was glossy and wet unlike Malfoys drier look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Malfoy returned he felt a sharp pain in each ear and realised his ears had been pierced, she slipped matching snakes into each hole and then went to work on Harrys hair. Malfoy pulled and prodded his hair for around ten minutes before stepping away again. Harry saw in the mirror that his jet black hair had been braided into a bun at the back, with bangs at the front helping to hide his now invisible scar. Malfoy returned again with a pair of green stilettos, with around the same size heel as the pair she wore already, they were slipped onto Harry's stocking clad feet and the buckle melted together, Harry realised they would not be coming off without some help from a wand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ropes disappeared at last and Harry rubbed his aching wrists, now noticing the effect of the nail varnish on his already small hands. Standing away from the mirror he realised just how feminine he looked and stared in dismay at the beautiful girl in the reflection, not a hint of the boy who lived remained. His legs were long and slender and looked gorgeous in the frosty white stockings, the heels, combined with the corset, made his butt stick out a little more and added a very feminine hourglass to his slim figure. The large breasts, his breasts he realised, were nearly bursting out of the pale green bra which looked too small to contain them. The Slytherin choker covered his Adam\u2019s apple perfectly and his perfectly made up face made him look like an 18-year-old model, much like those from Dean's Playboy Harry remembered with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned clumsily, still adjusting to the heels and found Malfoy removing another maids dress from the wardrobe, though this one differed to her own. The apron had a green fringe, as did the bell sleeves and the hem. She laid this down on the bed and held up a short green petticoat for Harry to step into, which he reluctantly did, Malfoy was about to fetch Bellatrix when Harry first threw it to the floor, before Malfoy could make it to the door Harry had picked it up and begun pulling it over his stocking clad legs. The feeling was new to Harry and to his annoyance, very enjoyable. The dress quickly followed, it was pulled over Harry's head and Malfoy began adjusting it, doing up laces in the rear and fluffing the skirt out over the petticoat. Harry realised that if he bent over even a little his panties would be visible to anyone behind him, his stocking tops were just visible to him now in the mirror<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Malfoy did a quick lap of him and quickly popped a green cap into Harry's hair before pointing to the porridge and water on the desk. In a girlish whisper she told Harry to eat, and be downstairs in 10 minutes, she also popped lipstick and lipgloss tubes into the pouch in Harry's apron and told him to refresh himself after eating. At first Harry just stared at his reflection in the small vanity mirror. The dress clung to him like a glove, tight around the hips and flared at the waist where hints of green petticoat peeked out, several times he had to pull the dress up to stop it exposing his bra and considerable cleavage, with each tug upwards he felt a breeze across the bare flesh at the top of his thighs and Harry was wondering which was worse. He realised he was running out of time and just how hungry he ate, he supposed he hadn't eaten anything since the forest, how long ago must that have been? The world must think him dead, and the Order more than likely disbanded already. He ate quickly and his thoughts strayed from his friends who must now be in hiding to the dramatic change in Malfoy's voice, he hoped Bellatrix wouldn't do something like that to him but realised that it was a silly hope because she almost certainly would. He would just have to look for a way to escape and worry about reversing the changes later. It seemed clear to him that the world thought he was dead so that might make getting away a little easier, as no one would be looking for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry finished eating and reapplied the lipstick and gloss in the mirror. It was feminine enough putting on lipstick, but when Harry noticed his nails whilst holding the lipstick tube he realised how far gone he was and blushed furiously, this brought the pink in his cheeks out further and he felt even worse. He slowly made his way down the hall on wobbly legs, the heels constantly threatening to pitch him over, the petticoats rustled loudly with every step, the heels clacking along too. He realised it would be near impossible to go anywhere quietly in this house. He was tempted to check in on some of the rooms he passed but realised that being late downstairs could be a painful decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reached the stairs he placed a hand on the banister and crept down slowly, making his way into the next room he found Bellatrix on a large sofa braiding Malfoy's hair into two long blonde pigtails. She looked up and beamed. \"Potter! At last, well Dorothy you outdid yourself here, you really have been paying attention to me little niece. Tell you what, as a reward, how about you decide on Miss Potter's new name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy looked up at Bellatrix, half convinced she was playing a joke on him, this was the closest to nice his aunt had been to him in a month. \"How about Hazel, Mistress?\" She tied off the last braid and patted Malfoy affectionately on the head. \"Fine choice Dorothy, I like it, Hazel and Dorothy Malfoy, my live in nieces and maids.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she uttered this she withdrew her wand again and cast a spell at Harry, muttering under her breath. Harry felt no different, he opened his mouth to protest his new name and call Bellatrix a number of colourful names he had picked up from Uncle Vernon but when he did so, all that came out in a melodious female voice was, \"My name is Hazel Malfoy.\" Harry stared in shock and realised he was in big trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much trouble is Hazel now in?</span></div></div>",

Instead of working for the Ministry of Magic Harry had taken up the post of the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, mostly due to the fact that after the year long hunt for the Horcruxes as well as the final battle had left Harry feeling drained so he decided instead of going after other dark magic users he would pass down what he knew to the next generation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to his time with the D.A. he turned out to an excellent teacher and had a well loved class, though he tended more towards practical lessons than written assignments most students passed his classes with flying colors.

That is until about ten years after he became the teacher when he was doing the first lesson for the first year class where a girl were goofing off in the back of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Harry was sort of used to this from first years in their first class as they were excited to find out their teacher was the Legendary Harry Potter, but also wanting to see how strict he was in his classes and it usually took a couple of times asking them to settle down and be quite for the student pay attention.  This young first year girl, however, did not even seem to care as she gossiped and made rude statements in the back of the room and basically disrupted the classmates around her.  Harry finally got tired of this and for the first time since becoming a teacher told them to stay after the bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the class filed out at the bell Harry went to go talk to them and saw that with the kids in front of her gone the girl had placed her feet on the desk in front of her.  With a sigh Harry told her to put her feet down but the girl just looked up at him and told him no and to leave her alone as she crossed her hands across her chest defiantly glaring up at him.  When asked why she was acting up the girl said she did not respect him and he was just a fraud.  \"Why?\" Harry asked.  the girl just sneer at him and told him....</span></div></div>",

The young first girl smiles as her plan got results.  The other girls move away so as to get out of the line of fire as Harry and Emily saluted each other by raising their wand to eye level before making a quick motion of the arm to make an ninety degree angle with their elbow and raise it back to their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to hurt the first year student in her first week of classes Harry cast a basic Knockback jinx only for Emily to spring out of the way sending a leg locker curse at him.  Harry was so surprised he barely dodged it in time and before he could cast another spell he was hit by a spell that caused binding to wrap around his feet.  Not losing his cool Harry quickly made them vanish using the levicorpus spell only for Emily to dodge again and his spell to hit a mirror and rebound on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick jerk his legs were raised into the air dragging his body along with them making the girls watching laugh as he floated there for a moment before undoing the spell and sending himself crashing to the floor at Emily's feet.  Raising his eye Harry found himself staring down the barrel, as it were, of the first years wand.  Emily smiled as she cast Lumios blinding Harry before backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the spots out of his eyes Harry decides to get serious as he cast a spell of the full body bind to end the match quickly only for Emily to cast a shield charm, a spell she should not know or be able to perform, which shot his spell right back at him.  Becoming as still as a statue Harry fell to the floor the only thing he could move being his eyes.  He heard laughter as Emily moves to stand above him.  \"See I just beat you and this is my first class ever in magic talk about pathetic my mom was right about you,\" Emily said making Harry try to recall what her last name in hopes of knowing who her parents were.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Emily was speaking, she was standing over Harry, who whilst stuck in the full body bind spell he himself had cast, could still look up.<br>\r\nEmily was standing over his face, one leg on either side of his head, facing towards his stiffened body, and Harry could see directly up between her legs, giving him the perfect view up her skirt, to her panties. He kept thinking he should look away; look off to the side even though he could not turn his head. He did  not. Harry continued to look upwards, his eyes transfixed on the pale panties of an 11 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose panties started to descend. Emily bent her knees and started to lower herself down towards his waiting face. As she descended, she knelt on the floor, pressing her thighs firmly into the body of the man beneath her,. At one point she removed his glasses and dropped them into her own pocket, clearly wanting them out of the way when she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared the end of the drop, she pulled her skirt and lower robes out of the way, allowing them to form a tent around the man, at this point falling loosely around his face, hiding it from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sat, settling her weight and her young butt cheeks onto the face beneath her, allowing her backside to own the man she was now sitting upon. She relaxed and took pleasure from the simple truth that the famous Harry Potter was now her seat, or at least his face was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was now in total darkness, for not a single shred of light could pass through the girl or her clothes, He felt the weight of the girl sitting on him, Even though she was only a first year girl, Harry felt like his face was being crushed beneath her, He also quickly discovered that he couldn't breathe at all, her ass cheeks sealed his airway completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Hermione ever sat on your face\" she mused \"if she didn't then she clearly missed out on a wonderful opportunity. Here you are, the famous Harry Potter, smothering under a girl's butt. It could have been hers, now it is mine. I could do it easily, let my butt cheeks finish the job that Voldemort's wand could not. I wonder,,,,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl fell silent, giving Harry time to let her words sink in. Was she really doing it? Was he really about do die, smothered under the young backside of a first year girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost a minute before Emily shifted slightly, allowing Harry to draw a couple of breaths before smothering him some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would be the fun in that?\" she mused \"it will be far more enjoyable to keep you around as a plaything, an amusement for me and the girls to entertain ourselves with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis remark was met with several nods, and agreements from the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls took out a wizarding camera and took a picture of Emily sitting on Harry's face.<br>\r\nAnother girl came forward and snatched Harry's wand.  She carried the wand back to her own desk, laid it on the chair and sat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever I bounce, you do the same\" Emily advised her \"let's see which breaks first; the wand or the man.\"<br>\r\nThe other girl giggled, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Emily decided to give Harry a little change, as sitting on a stiffened man who could not react to her smothering presence was also no fun. She cast ropes from her wand, binding him tightly then lifted the body bind. The ropes would keep Harry just as immobile as he was when he was stiff as a board, but at least he would have some mobility, and be a little more entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis became clear as his body started to writhe as he continued to smother under the girl, but his efforts were entirely futile. Emily watched him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued to sit on their respective seats. Once every minute or so, Emily allowed Harry the odd breath by bouncing slightly on his face, and the girl on his wand bounced in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need a change of administration in this class\" Emily admitted at one point \"my seat is clearly less magical than me, so I'll be taking his lessons from now on. That means I am now the professor and he is the plaything I mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will be your first act as our new professor\" a girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll give us back those points my seat tried to take, and give us an additional five points each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the Great Hall, an hourglass started filling at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, as he is no longer a professor, I don't think my seat is in any position to award or take points, or give detentions so that means I won't be serving one of those either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The  girl sitting on Harry's wand laughed, and bounced delightedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Emily decided \"I think it is time my seat went to sleep for a while.\"<br>\r\nAt this point she relaxed, stayed perfectly still and stopped bouncing. She was going to smother Harry to sleep, so that meant reducing his air intake still further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could only wait, he was still trapped under her and this time there would be no gasps of air to keep him conscious. In time his oxygen-starved mind started to drift away from him until eventually it passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry slept, the girl who had been sitting on his wand, stood and looked down at her seat. The wand had been reduced to tiny splinters and fragments of phoenix feather, its magic gone forever. She brushed the tiny fragments onto the floor and sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harry finally awoke.</span></div></div>",

Knowing what he did about Hogwarts he was aware that unless a male teacher was the Head of the House he would not be allowed in the girls dorm room and by the wall hanging he was in a Hufflepuff dorm.  He had learned since he became a teacher that the castle was semi-sentient which was what allowed teachers and prefects giving and taking points so Hogwarts somehow sensing what Emily and her friends had done allowed them to put him in their dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah he is finally awake good,\" a voice calls out seeing Harry was finally conscious.  Harry tried to move but found that while he was no longer under the body bind curse or had magic ropes tying him up the only part of his body that would follow his directions to move was his head, toes, and fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Do you like it?\" Emily asked looking down at his prone form \"I found the spell in one of my Aunt's old books it seems the magic disconnects parts of the affected's brain leaving them magically paralyzed for I believe an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this now Emily,\" Harry ordered making the girls in the dorm room laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what you will spit on me? Your wand is crushed I easily defeated you in a wizarding dual before smothering you to unconsciousness to use an old quote \"You have no power here.\" Emily said as the girls laughed.  \"Oh by the way I should tell you that if you try to get us in trouble I will not hesitate to give everybody in the Great Hall during a meal a copy of the photos we took of me using you as a seat.  I already sent one to my Aunt and while she was upset she never did it she said she was proud of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is your Aunt?\" Harry asked more to move the conversation away from the photos being spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know boy my sweet Aunty is your old friend and Minster of Magic Hermione Granger-Weasly,\" Emily said making Harry's heart drop to the lever of his stomach now seeing where her magical abilities and knowledge of his past came from.  As this conversation was happening Harry found himself becoming free of the magical paralysis so in fear he jumps up and try to defeat Emily using the Muggle method.  Unfortunately Harry barely got two feet before Emily knocked him back...</span></div></div>",

She sat firmly, lifting her feet off the floor so she could bring her full weight to bear upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Hermione?\" Harry gasped, suddenly finding himself beneath her<br>\r\n\"Are you blind as well as dumb, Harry? Surely you can see that I am sitting on you. Well, I guess being soft is an advantage when you are a seat cushion.\"<br>\r\n\"Blind? How could you say that? You know I wear glasses.\"<br>\r\n\"I am well aware that you wear glasses Harry, not that you need them right now. In fact I would say you would be far more comfortable without them... for me anyway.\" She reached behind her, pulled Harry's glasses off his face and threw them to the floor. The impact when they hit the ground shattered both the lenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" He shouted, pushing against her back, trying to knock her off but his efforts proved futile. A life growing up with the Dursleys had kept him weak, he had no muscles and no strength. Hermione was a girl who was almost a year older than him  and she was clearly stronger and smarter than him as well. She was also fully intent on remaining precisely where she was. After a few minutes though, she had decided that she had had enough amusement from witnessing his wasted efforts and threw down her own gauntlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going nowhere, Harry\" she told him \"and clearly there is nothing you can do about that. Now are you going to calm down or shall I put you under a full body bind? You will be under me either way but in that case you will be a little stiffer and a little less comfortable.\" Harry sighed and finally relaxed just as Hermione muttered \"I should have done this years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Sat on me?\"<br>\r\n\"Sat on you slapped you, enslaved you... take your pick.\"<br>\r\nEnslaved me?\"<br>\r\n\"Good choice, but we'll get to that later. I'll settle for sitting on you for the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I have only just realised how pathetic you are, You don't do anything, you don't listen. All you do is go on about that silly quidditch game.\"<br>\r\n\"Quidditch isn't silly.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? What do you think you will achieve by it? It is a game, nothing more  You spend several afternoons and evenings a week practicing this game when you should be studying. You have been goofing off, no wonder your grades were always so low.\"<br>\r\n\"You don't know anything about it.\"<br>\r\n\"I know all I wish to know, and all I need to know. I have far better ways to spend my time.\"<br>\r\n\"You say I haven't done anything. I have defeated Voldemort may times over.\"<br>\r\n\"In case it has escaped your attention Harry, he is out there right noFw causing havoc and you are doing nothing about it. You haven't defeated him at all.\"<br>\r\nHarry couldn't find an answer for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's examine all these apparent acheivements of yours\" Hermione bored in \"see them for what they really are.\"<br>\r\n\"Firstly, when you apparently stopped him as a baby. You didn't do anything, how could you? You were only a year old. The magic that defeated him was the result of your mother's actions, not yours and yet you take the credit. Those are the first threads of the tapestry of your wasted life Harry.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\"<br>\r\n\"Those years living with the Dursleys, you were nothing there but that is hardly surprising, you were dominated by a fat, brainless muggle. I am also muggleborn Harry and whilst I am not fat, I do have brains. Dominating you should be easier for me then, shouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"You come to Hogwarts and in your first year, you apparently defeat Voldemort again who this time has taken one of the professors as his agent, only you didn't. Hagrid told you everything you needed to know and I figured out the rest. I saved us twice when we were down there, first by stopping the Devil's Snare and secondly in that potions room. All you did was fly around and catch a key, any of us could have done that. In the end, when you met Quirrell/Voldemort it was your mother again who had provided the magic to save you. Do you want to know something else, Harry? We needn't have gone down there at all. Quirrell could not have taken the stone from the mirror, his desire to use the stone was greater than his will to find it. Dumbledore was already on his way back. If we had stayed well out of it, Dumbledore would have gone down there and stopped Quirrell whilst he stood blindly gazing at a prize he could never collect. That whole trip down the trapdoor was a waste of time.\"<br>\r\n\"I hadn't thought of it like that.\"<br>\r\n\"You don't think at all, Harry, that is your problem.\"<br>\r\n\"I saved GInny in my second year though, you can't deny that.\"<br>\r\n\"Ginny's life would never have been threatened if you had taken that diary to Dumbledore in the first place. Didn't your meeting with Riddle tell you it was full of dark magic?\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't think\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, there is a pattern emerging here, isn't there.\"<br>\r\n\"Erm...\"<br>\r\n\"What about when I saved Sirius.\"<br>\r\n\"We saved him Harry, and you could do nothing without me, it was my time turner. Dumbedore gave his instruction to me, not to you. You just tagged along for the ride.\"<br>\r\n\"I stopped the dementors.\"<br>\r\n\"How many times did you practice that spell before you finally got it to work? You got lucky. If you don't believe me then try casting a patronus cham now. Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry took out his wand and called out \"Expecto Patronum\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hermione smirked as a result before Harry cried out \"Expecto Patronum\" two more times, but only causing wisps of silver smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean, Harry? You don't think. Have you forgotten what fuels a Patronus? You need a happy memory. You were too focused on my challenge that you forgot what was necessary to make it work. With this moment as a happy memory, I wonder how powerful my Patronus would be. Let me try. Expecto Patronum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of Hermione's wand came out a great sized otter that Harry was able to vaguely make out even without his glasses due to how bright and large it was. Harry and Hermione could both tell that it was very powerful, much more powerful than Harry's that drove off a hundred dementors and certainly many times more powerful than his attempt just a few moments ago. Hearing that Hermione chose this moment to fuel her Patrons made Harry feel more depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have one last chance Harry to prove that you can still cast a Patronus, Harry. Try to think of a happy memory\", said Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to think of a happy memory, but all he could think of was Hermione casting a very powerful Patronus because of this moment of her dominating him, which made him more depressed and thus harder to think of a happy memory. He tried again anyway and this time, not even a wisp of smoke came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize it don't you, Harry? Everytime you tried to think of a happy memory, you were thinking of me casting a Patronus because of this moment. I have caused you to create a mental block around you thinking of happy thoughts. From now on, whenever you try to think of a happy thought, you will think of me using this moment as my most happy thought. And as a result, you will never form a Patronus again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry just sat there in silence as the truth of Hermione's words hit him. He tried again to recall a happy moment and instead he was reminded of this moment. He quickly  stopped trying altogether.   </span></div></div>",

Next came the year of the Triwizard Tournament of course.\"<br>\r\n\"I was one of the four champions, and I won the tournament\" Harry explained<br>\r\n\"You did not enter that competition, so you can't claim responsibility. Crouch Jr tricked the goblet with his own magic and we both know it. You were entered on the whim of a death eater.\"<br>\r\n\"I still won.\"<br>\r\n\"Again, you can't claim anything, Harry. The tournament was rigged. You were given help in each of the tasks  You were told how to get past the dragon, you were advised to use Gillyweed by Dobby and Neville, and crouch helped you get through the maze. Actually, when it comes down to it Crouch was responsible for both entering you and making sure you won so that you would fall into his trap, and fall you did.\"<br>\r\n\"Well erm, I erm\" Harry was trying to come up with something to counter Hermione's argument but he couldn't think of anything.<br>\r\n\"Then what did you do Harry? You went and brought back Voldemort. You did it. If you hadn't have gone to that graveyard then he would never have returned.\"<br>\r\n\"Just a minute.\"<br>\r\n\"Wasn't it your blood that was used to revive him?\"\"<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but....\"<br>\r\n\"No buts, Harry. You, the boy who is famous for defeating the dark lord as a baby when you did nothing of the sort, 13 years later you went and brought him back. That is your true Legacy Harry. The world may not know this but I do.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that what you will tell the world?\"<br>\r\n\"Why should I bother? Voldemort will do that himself. We are not part of the world now, Harry. The world does not know where you are, you are untracable due to the magical protection on this place. Now that Ron has left us, we are all alone here.  The world can go along without you. You are all mine now, Harry - now, and for ever more. You deserve no less.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't understand\"<br>\r\n\"You will, soon enough.\"<br>\r\n\"What about the following year, when I joined The Order of the Phoenix?\"<br>\r\n\"You did not join, Ron's mother would not let you anywhere near the order and now I fully endorse her actions.\"<br>\r\n\"We went the the ministry, we recovered the prophecy.\"<br>\r\n\"You were too stupid to realise it was a trap, I told you it was a trap and you ignored me. You nearly got all of us killed, you block head.\"<br>\r\n\"I formed Dumbledore's Army.\"<br>\r\n\"We formed it, Harry  I did all the work, you were nothing more than a figurehead. People thought you were the second coming or something like it, and so I played on that by creating the group in your name.\"<br>\r\n\"I taught them all that defensive stuff.\"<br>\r\n\"You instructed, you told them what you had been taught - even if you failed to perform the spells yourself, you told them. How much skill does it take to remind someone of something they had already been told?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"They had already covered all that in their classes, they only needed a little more practice. They only spell they hadn't covered yet was the patronus. Once it was explained, I mastered the spell immediately. How long did it take you? You'll never cast one again, but I can. Which of us is the greatest witch or wizard?\"<br>\r\n\"You, I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"Correct. Like I said, you were a figurehead and once I had my own patronus, it was only your celebrity that stopped you being completely redundant.\"<br>\r\n\"I uncovered the Half Blood Prince\"<br>\r\n\"You found out that Snape had once used that title? So what? It was a nickname he used at school, nothing more. I'll tell you what happened that year though. Firstly you used Snape's old potions book with all his old notes written in it. That was why you did so well in that class that year, you cheated. Slughorn thought you were so good though he have you some of his Felix potion. It was that potion which led you to uncover Slughorn's secret, you can't claim any credit. Anyone charged with the task Dumbledore gave you who had then drunk the potion would have done the same.\"<br>\r\n\"I uncovered the secret of the Horcruxes.\"<br>\r\n\"What did I just say? That was the effect of the potion, you did nothing.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n\"Then you and Dumbledore went off to that cave and brought back something that wasn't a Horcrux at all. R.A.B. had beaten you both to the prize. Then when you got back to Hogwarts, Snape killed Dumbledore and you didn't even try to stop him.\"<br>\r\n\"Dumbledore told me not to.\"<br>\r\n\"He told you not to save his life? That is ridiculous, Nobody in his right mind gives that instruction, and nobody with any sense obeys it.\"<br>\r\n\"That is a bit rich.\"<br>\r\n\"No, it is the truth. You let Dumbledore die, another failure of the great Harry Potter.\"<br>\r\n\"What of this year, going after the horcruxes?\"<br>\r\n\"What of it? You took me out of school to go after them so we could stop Voldemort only you haven't done a damn thing, just like the rest of your life, Harry. You needn't concern yourself with that any more though. Since you don't care for Horcruxes, we might as well abandon the search. We can't go back though since we are both now fugitives from wizarding society. I suppose I could go after them myself but for now I think I will take this opportunity to thank you properly for the mess you have now made of both of our lives.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank me?\"<br>\r\n\"In a way, I am sure I can find many inventive and entertaining ways to show my gratitude, but for now I am content to keep sitting on you, something I should have done a long time ago. I would have saved us all this aggro if I'd started that day we first met on the train, but at that time i still believed all the hype.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite the numerous protective spells that had been placed around their shelter, it appeared that owls could still reach them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis owl was carrying a letter and it dropped that letter on Hermione's lap before it perched on her shoulder. Hermione took the letter and opened it.<br>\r\n\"It's from Ginny\" she commented as she started to read the letter aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nHermione<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope this letter finds you still safe and well, I have been combing every edition of The Daily Prophet and whilst it is freely reporting on the Death Eaters' search for you and Harry, there have been no reports of sightings. I am sure that if you had been caught then it would be all over the front page, we both know that HIS people have control of the ministry, and by extension the paper itself. For the past two years, the paper has been nothing but a propaganda tool for the office of The Minister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife at Hogwarts has become a living nightmare over the last year. We used to talk about the reputation of Durmstrang durign the Triwizard year, but that is nothing to what our own wizarding school has become. Snape is headmaster now, and that is bad enough but he has allowed true horrors to take place under his roof. He may have been raised in the house of the snakes but I don't think he ever grew a backbone. He has appointed two new teachers, The Carrows and according to father that pair were very close to You Know Who, and it shows in their every diabolical deed. The Defence class is now simply named Dark Arts for that is what is taught. Detentions students are subjected to the Unforgivable Cruciatus curse. You are so lucky to be away from the school for it has turned into a chamber of horrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna has organised a resistance movement among the students and we are doing what we can but we are up against an establishment that does not care. It is clear that not only Snape but the Ministry itself will continue to turn a blind eye so long as everyone still answers to HIM. I can't bear life at Hogwarts any more, and I don't think Luna will have any real effect with what she is doing although her heart is in the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You Know Who needs to be stopped and I want to help stop him. Perhaps I could join you and Harry, is there some way we could meet up? Luna says she can sneak me out of the castle unnoticed and I have leaned to apparate, those lessons have continued as usual. Once I am away from the anti-apparition zone surrounding Hogwarts I can join you in a place of your choosing. So you know it is me writing this letter, I have written some details that only you and I know. <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nGinny then wrote a paragraph of information that Hermione didn't read aloud. She read it to herself and nodded a number of times, this related to matters the two of them had discussed between them. It was not necessarily personal, but it was not common knowledge and it showed Hermione that Ginny had written that information or supplied someone else with it. Hermione did not think though that Ginny would divulge any of what she had written willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part of the letter simply stated that Ginny had asked the owl to wait once the letter was posted, so that Hermione could write back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hermione had finished reading Ginny's letter, she dropped it to the floor, and used one of her speciality controlled fire spell to destroy the contents. The flames disappeared as as soon as the letter was consumed. She then took up quill and parchment and drafted a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione therefore wrote back, saying she would be happy to meet and suggested the pitch where the Quidditch World Cup was last held would be an ideal choice as it was an open area, and yet enclosed and not used now the game had ended. Hermione suggested that Ginny should apparate in the precise centre of the pitch and that she would be waiting nearby. She wrote that she would be waiting there at precisely noon the next day, but if Ginny couldn't make that time then she should suggest an alternative with her next owl. She even mentioned that Ron was no longer with them as he had abandoned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hemrione ha written her reply, she attached it to the owl, who then flew out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the remainder of the current day Hermione continued to sit on Harry, she spoke to him very little but instead took up her book and continued to read.<br>\r\nWhen she eventually went to bed, she cast a full body bind on Harry. She was not going to let him go anywhere after all.<br>\r\nShe did not release the spell the next day, instead she simply resumed her seat (upon Harry of course), then finally she packed away their tent into her beaded bag which could of course carry so much more than it appeared able to support.  When noon  arrived she took hold of his stiffened body and apparated both of them to the quidditch pitch destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Ginny arrived. At least it looked like Ginny. She was still wearing her Hogwarts uniform, having apparently not bothered to change after escaping from the school. Not taking chances though, Hermione straightaway pointed her wand at Ginny  and asked her to turn out her pockets and to hand over her own wand. Hermione took this and told Ginny she could have it back once her identity was confirmed. She had used Polyjuice Potion, had brewed it so she was aware that this might not be the girl she appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ginny had offered her wand and shown she wasn't carrying anything in her pockets, Hermione patted her down to check there was nothing else on her person then told Ginny they would need to wait at least an hour to check that Ginny was herself as Polyjuice Potion would run out after that time. She would not be content with merely asking for answers to her questions for a smart doppleganger would find ways to glean this information from their host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione cast a body bind spell on Ginny but took no further action aganst her, but she did establish her usual magical protection spells around their location. There was no reason why they couldn't stay here for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour had passed, Ginny was still herself so Hermione cancelled the body bind spell and embraced her friend.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry about that, but I had to be sure it was really you. From what you have told me about Hogwarts, anything could have happened.\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I would have done the same\" Ginny replied \"so it is just you and Harry now?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ron walked out on us. As for Harry though, I am severely disappointed.\"<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n\"Apparently he has no interest in finding Horcruxes.\"<br>\r\n\"What? After everything that has happened, the dark cloud that has fallen on the school and Harry doesn't care at all?\"<br>\r\n\"No, he has done nothing, he doesn't want to do anything.\"<br>\r\n\"That is disgusting, I can't believe I was his girlfriend last year. Where is he?\"<br>\r\n\"Just over there\" she pointed to the place where she and Harry had apparated, Harry's frozen body was still laid on the ground. Ginny went over to him and kicked him firmly in the gut.<br>\r\nShe then noticed the position Harry's body was frozen in, it seemed to have maintained that shape.<br>\r\n\"Was he sitting down when you cast that spell?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, he was, as was I in fact. I recommend it. He is a comfortable seat.\"<br>\r\n\"You were sitting... on Harry\" Ginny giggled.<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"<br>\r\nHermione then took a chair out of her bag, placed it on to the ground, and lifted Harry's frozen form so he was sitting in it. <br>\r\n\"If Harry moves when I release the spell, cast a bat bogey hex on him, a strong one\" Hermione handed Ginny back her wand.<br>\r\nGinny nodded and pointed her wand at Harry as Hermione cancelled the body bind. Harry took one look at Ginny's wand but did not move.</span></div></div>",

Pretending to no longer pay attention Hermione went back to reading her book util she heard a small cough from Harry to let her know her drink was ready.

The floor changed from hard wood and ground tones to being covered with a ruby red carpet as the walls began to look less like fabric and something more akin to upscale wall paper of sunflowers.

Turning from the bed Hermione used her wand to demolish the other chairs while making her own into something the resembled a golden throne.

Ron's mouth falls open to see the current state of his best friends and was about to tell Hermione off for finding Harry in such a state when to his shock Harry smiled as he begun to suck his thumb.  \"You really missed a lot we tried to find the Sword at Godrick's Hallow ran into Him and were able to distract and get away from Him due to what Harry was wearing so we thought we would stick with it,\" Hermione said given Ron half truths as she bounced Harry against her as she walked over to Ron using a finger of her free hand to close his open mouth before taking the Sword from him and using just one hand which shocked Ron even more for he had to use both of his hands just to heft the thing.  \"Well don't just stand there come inside,\" Hermione ordered leading Ron in who gaped at the new decorations inside the magical tent.  Once they were inside Hermione made sure Ron took off his shoes as she goes to sit in her throne like chair transferring Harry to her lap and holding his arms as she began to playfully bounce him on her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do in here?\" Ron asked standing transfixed still in the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just made some more modifications to make it a better place to live when I took control,\" Hermione said and with a flick of her wand transformed the fluffy gray couch back into the small wooden stool.  \"Why don't you take a seat Rondald?\" Hermione asked in a tone making it more of an order than a suggestion.  Ron still mystified by all the changes around him as his feet working as if he was on autopilot went to the stool and crouched down on it to finding himself having to look up at Hermione in her throne like chair not to mention staring at Harry's bouncing butt.

Ron standing up shows he had hurt his nose as a trickle of blood was leaking out it as he glared at Hermione.  \"I don't want to hurt you Mione,\" Ron said taking time to aim his wand and cast a disarming charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the difference between us Ronald I will do anything to not only complete this mission but to protect Harry,\" Hermone said holding Harry tight to her as she moved a mere fraction of an inch letting Ron's spell shoot past her.  With a wicked smile she cast her own disarming charm which hit Ron right in his chest sending him flying into the kitchen to hit the marble counter as his wand goes flying into the bed room landing in Harry's new crib.  Hermione stalks toward Ron pure fury in her eyes for leaving them but also almost hitting Harry with one of his spells.  Filled with so much anger she did not even give him a chance to apologize as she recast the full body bind curse sending Ron stiff as a board crashing onto the counter top.  Seeing the victory was clearly hers she began to twirl her wand around her fingers as she slowly walked over to Ron frozen body on the counter top reaching him she takes her wand aiming it right into her former friend's face and cast a spell that made Ron...</span></div></div>",

There was one flaw in his plan as a shadow fell over him making him look up to see Hermione arrive and kneel down beside him a hand on his back keeping him basically pinned to the girl's table.  \"Why Harry what cute little friends you have made,\" Hermione said making the girls blush and giggle at the complement not noticing that she was keeping Harry firmly in place.  \"Hello girls I am Harry's older sister Hermione I want to thank you for looking out for him,\" Hermione said not wanting to inform the girls of any of her relationships with Harry as either his friend or current \"Mommy\" just in case they talked to their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Miss Hermy,\" the three girls said standing up and curtsying like the princess they were dressed as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why such manners,\" Hermione said with a smile.  \"I see you are confused by Harry's happiness at using the tea pot well the truth is we have one much like it at our house but it is a bit heavier, well Harry here decided to try to pour some tea for himself and ended up dropping it and splashing tea all over his Pink Princess Onsie,\" Hermione said making the girls laugh and Harry blush who could not believe she was doing this to him.  \"You see Harry has always been a little weak so to lift up a tea pot that looks like his own made him really happy,\" Hermione said ruffling Harry's hair as the shrunken boy-who-lived tried and failed to fight back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How weak is he Miss Hermy?\" Belle asked smirking at the tears falling from the boy's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is the thing he has never really played with other kids so we don't know,\" Hermione said giving a half truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can find out for you,\" Sleeping Beauty said  wanting to test her strength as she saw her older siblings did in an arm wrestling match<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it would be fun,\" Cinderella said just wanting to rough house with the weak boy and pin him to the ground and bully him like some of the boys in the park did to her.  Cinderella had such a vivid imagination she could almost see herself pinning Harry to the ground and like some bullies had done to her make him open his mouth as she spit into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione could see the girls were eager as she was to see how weak Harry was and agreed to let them help.  Bell who was more interested in finishing her tea decided to just watch so Hermione choose one of the others to help her.</span></div></div>",

She heard some laughter behind her and turning her head to look behind her a little she was members of different houses starting to gather around her and Malfoy and laugh at his predicament.  With a large smile as if she was putting on a show Hermione decided to play to the crowd as she pulled one fist back showing how she easily pinned Draco to the wall with a single hand before she bawled her hand into a fist and gave him a gut punch making him gasp in pain face still pressed into the wall.  The crowd that had now grown to have members of each house began to shout out suggestions on what she should do to Draco, Hermione was actually surprised to hear members of Draco's own house call out some suggestions as well showing Draco was even disliked in his own dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione decided to ignore all the suggestions and do something else as she took a firm grip on Draco's upper arm and spin him around to see the crowd that had gathered to see him get beaten up by a female and \"mudblood\" no less.   She could almost feel Draco's face fall as his body goes a little limp in her grasp as he sees all the other students egging her on.  With a wide smile Hermione let's go of Draco for a moment but before he could run off his reputation in shatters Hermione reached down and adding insult to injury grabs the waistband of his underwear sticking out of his pants and hoist them up.  The crowd break out in screams of laughter as Hermione lifts Draco's underwear to his armpits showing off, of all things, childish muggle underwear before she leans down and taking hold of one of his feet causes him to fall flat onto his face in front of everyone his butt in the air.

As she looked around the crowd Hermione put her hands together and pumped them in the air to thunderous hoots of laughter and applause.  After taking a moment to bask in their cheers Hermine took a step over to the knocked out Draco and winding up her left foot sent it careening right into Draco's raised ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond boy returned to consciousness with a scream as the kick lifting him off the ground and into the wall.  \"Ah did you enjoy your nap Draco?\" Hermione asked as she stalked over to the boy now quivering in fear.  Before she could take another step forward a ripple washed over the crowd and the message that a teacher was coming.  With practice ease Hermione moved back into the crowd leaving a dazed Draco in the center of the large circle of students.  Soon Professor Snape walked up and blanched at seeing Draco in such a state he gazed in thunder at quickly dispersing crowd as he helped Draco up and with a flick of his wand helped to put Draco's underwear back into place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part though, at least to Hermione who was ease-dropping in the next corridor was when after asked who had done this to him Draco had responded with, \"The yellow pixie sing with a purple cactus.\"   Hearing this Hermione had to place a hand over her mouth to stop herself from bursting out in laughter.  Thinking that she could catch up to Draco latter Hermione hoisted her overstuffed backpack and went to have breakfast in the Great Hall.

Throughout the day a smile would spread on her face as she recalled the events of the morning as she dominated Draco in front of the crowd and utterly destroyed his reputation.  She really wanted to do it all again but could not think of a way that she would end up alone with him ever again.  With a sigh of frustration Hermione worked her way further into the stacks she heard something behind her.  Thinking it was Malfoy with his goons coming to pay her back from earlier Hermione spun around wand out stretched ready to defend herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what lay before her Hermione almost dropped her wand as she let out a quickly stifled laugh as she found Draco alright but in no real position to attack her.  Hermione held a hand before her mouth to stop more laughter, which would get her into trouble with the librarian, as she saw Draco bound in bright blue rope and a gang stuffed into his mouth, but best of all was the fact that he was being carried aloft by a group of first year Slytherin male and females.  The look on his face was so priceless as it showed fear, haughtiness, but also outright rage at how this group of younger students from his own house was treating him.  Seeing Hermione the group literally dropped Draco letting him crash to the floor at her feet.  \"Um Miss. Hermione all of Slytherin House wanted to let you know that we actually approve of how you finally put Draco in his place and we are sorry that you did not get to finish teaching him so we all agreed to let you continue,\" the young first year girl in front said holding out a hand in friendship.  Hermione smiled as she shook the girl's hand as she used her wand to make Draco float before her as she left the library while the first years distracted the librarian.  With a smile Hermione head to a place to be alone and \"train\" Draco as she headed to....</span></div></div>",
