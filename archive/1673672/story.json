He knocks on the door twice, and not even a second passes before Aunt Marla, his mother's slightly younger sister, opens the door, with her sholder cut blond and gray hair flowing, and he perfect teeth shining bright in Bobby's face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby, it is so nice to see you!\" Aunt Marla exclaims as she gives you a hug. Bobby gives an annoyed look, but responds in that fake joyfulness that every teenager knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Good to see you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to have such a great time for this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Great. Bobby thinks. He didn't mind his Aunt, but he didn't know how he would handle her for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you drop your bags into the guest room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby nods and heads to the mysterious guest room. Of all the times he had been here, he had never stepped foot into it. And when he entered, he found it surprisingly bland. The room almost looked as if it was easily adaptable, but he brushed off this feeling and put his bags onto the bed. He looked at the clock. 9:43. Man, he got here late. He would have a quick snack with Marla before he headed to bed. He was extremely tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his brief time eating, he found that his Uncle would be out of commision for the week as well, as he was out on a golfing trip through the southwestern USA. Great. It was just Bobby and Marla for the rest of the week. Bobby quickly excused himself and was in bed by 10:30. He couldn't imagine how boring this week would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he knew. What will Bobby's first transformation be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     After settling in Aunt Marla's guestroom, I decide to go to bed and catch up on some well deserved sleep.  My mind wonders on what the following five days are going to hold in store for me.  \"Oh to only not have any worries and just let come what may\" I say aloud as I drift off.  As sleep overcomes me I begin to dream of a life with no worries, just playing carefree with no responsibilities.  I dream of being taken care of, running free through the neighborhood park and letting someone else make all the decisions for me.  A life of unbridled abandonment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Upon wakening in Aunt Marla's guestroom I feel strange, not sure of how long I have slept.  As I stretch out with my usual morning yawn I notice my body responds oddly.  Try as I may I feel my arms and legs, in fact my entire body no longer responds the way it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I must be tangled in the bed sheets\" I say to myself only to hear \"arff arff arff arff arff\" in response.  \"What the heck?\" I ask myself as I roll out of bed and fall a dizzying height to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I shake my head and try to stand, only to find myself down on all fours.  Wondering what just happened I take a look at myself only to see the fury pink body of a dog in place of my human form.  A serge of adrenaline runs through my body as I panic realizing I have in fact become a dog! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I scamper across the room to the full length mirror and gaze in amazement.  Looking back at me is the reflection of a puny, pink French Poodle, complete with the funky hair cut.  My mouth drops and to my dismay the toy poodle dog's reflection also drops it's mouth.  \"Oh damn!  That's ME!\" I realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A knock comes to the door as it opens slowly.  Aunt Marla walks in wearing her robe and looks down at me smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well good morning Bobby.\" she greets me while bending down and fastening a collar around my neck attached to a leather leash.  \"I trust you slept well, and are probably wondering what happened that you are now a dog.  A silly little French Poodle I might add.\" Aunt Marla laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Come\" Aunt Marla commands as she tugs my leash and leads me through her house into the kitchen.  I am so puny I am only knee height to Aunt Marla.  She then prepares a double bowl of dog food and water and places it under the table.  \"Go ahead, eat up Bobby\" Aunt Marla smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Somehow, I can't quite explain how, I had to obey Aunt Marla and quickly started eating away at the bowl of foul tasting dog food as she sat down and enjoyed her morning cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It's like this Bobby, for what ever reason my guestroom transforms whomsoever sleeps and dreams in there into what they wish to be based on their desires.  You're not the first guest I have had in there.  In fact, I am wearing two of my previous guests right now.\"  Aunt Marla stands up and opens her robe to reveal her very alluring body clad in only a bra and panties.  \"Yes, both my bra and panties were former male guests I had over.  Now they are my everyday underwear.  It's what they dreamed of,  what they desire, so now it's what they are.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I gaze up from under the table at Aunt Marla's incredible body.  At first I was astonished at how snug her bra and panties fit, especially around her enormous breasts and tight waist, when I notice that her bra and panties are actually moving, hugging and caressing as it were her porn star actress type body.  It is with both horror and fascination that I realized her bra and panties were actual living beings.  Aunt Marla closed her robe and sat back down, \"Eat\" she commanded me and I eagerly feasted on my bowl of dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"From my experiences so far I have figured out this.  You can change back or into something else as long as you return to my guestroom and fall asleep before midnight of the same day.  If you do not, well let's just say you end up in a permanent position such as my underwear.  They are stuck being my bra and panties forever.  You on the other hand have four more days of transformations possible for you; but remember on the last night, before your parents take you home, you have to think and dream of being yourself as a human again.  Or else who knows what you may end up being.\" Aunt Marla laughs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"While you dream, I in my room see your dreams.  It's how I knew to show up with a leash and collar.\" Aunt Marla smiles down at me.  \"And since your parents, namely my sister forced me into this baby sitting, and neither you or I am into insest, I have arranged a special friend to stop by to help me watch over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Just then the doorbell rang, instinctively I yelped \"arff arff arff\" and ran towards the front door only to be stopped in my tracks by a tug on my collar by Aunt Marla.  \"Heel!\" she yells down to me and I instinctively obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Aunt Marla opens the front door and as I look up I see to my dismay her next door neighbor, my classmate and the school's female geek and outcast Laura whom I personally have teased to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hello Aunt Marla\" Laura hugs my aunt.  Laura looks down at me with an evil grin.  \"Hello Bobby\" and laughs out loud.  \"So this is the dog I am to babysit today\" Laura questions Aunt Marla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes he is Laura.  Please take good care of him and have him back well before midnight or else he'll be stuck as a dog\" Aunt Marla giggled.  \"And may I add, YOUR DOG if that should happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh he's in good hands\" Laura laughs evilly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You may be wondering why I'm doing this.\" Laura says while practically dragging you on your leash.  Honestly you could care less about her motivations, just so long as you were back in your aunt's guest room by midnight.  \"You see Bobby, as much fun as leading you around on a leash is, it's not my sole motivation.  I'm actually attempting to start a nice little dog training business on the side, but it's an awfully hard business to start up out of the blue.  Owners want trainers with 'experience' and what better way than to show off my neighbor's well trained french poodle.\" Laura stopped and looked me dead in the eyes.  \"And if the poodle <i>isn't</i> well trained, then I guess I'll just have to take him and send him off to some kennel to spend the rest of his miserable doggy days.  Do we understand each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there absolutely terrified I just nodded my doggy head and gave a quick little yip.  I have absolutely no plan to be stuck as a freaking french poodle for the rest of my life.  \"Good,\" Laura said giving you a way too hard tug at the leash, \"Let's go meet my client in the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting walked to the park it just feels like every pair of eyes is on me and it feels like every one of them can sense my embarrassment.  I'm sure they are just taking a glance at the dog with the funny hair cut, but every look felt like a dagger of humiliation.  If just being on the leash wasn't bad enough, at a crosswalk Laura started walking with and chatting up some dog walker guy for a while, and it felt like every single one of the dogs he was with just had to get a sniff of your ass.  I kept trying to keep away from them but Laura kept dragging me back to the pack.  Finally after what felt like a lifetime we reached the park and Laura directed me towards an older woman with her own poodle, this one a bit bigger than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mrs. Wright.  I'm ready for my demonstration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Laura, and this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifi\" Laura said smiling down at me after I let out a low whimper at being christened with such a...lame name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely adorable, not as fine as my Champ, but still a fine dog.  Why don't you show me what your training can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, we'll start with the basics.  Sit.\" Taking the cue from Laura I immediately sit back on my back legs.<br>\r\n\"Shake.\" I reached a paw out for Laura to hold.<br>\r\n\"Roll over.\" <i>This isn't too bad</i> I think as I rolled on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All very basic, but what puts you above other trainers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can make this dog do things you've never seen another dog do.\"  Laura went over to a puddle of mud, moss, and filth and stomped a foot in it and walked back over to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it clean.\" <i>Excuse me</i> I think to yourself looking up at her with my little doggy eyes making sure I heard her right.<br>\r\n\"Lick. It. Clean.\" Laura said again with a malicious tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing I didn't have any choice in the matter if I wanted to turn back, licked all of the disgusting crap from her shoe, trying not to gag with each lick. <i>Can this get any worse?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed!  Do you have any more?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes he can.  Fifi!  Kiss Champ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes it can.</i>  I thought as I took a walk of shame over to the larger poodle who seemed to be giving me a look over.  Before I could give it a second thought I cocked my neck up and licked Champ right on the nose.  In return I got a slew of licks back and my backside got sniffed, thankfully this seemed to amuse Mrs. Wright enough to end the demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic work!  Bravo!  You can start next weekend.  Here is your agreed advanced payment.\"  Mrs. Wright said excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much.\" Laura said greedily taking the cash.  As soon as the old lady and her dog were out of sight Laura looked at you and said,</span></div></div>",

Taunt you with this but never let you have it.\" At that I felt my ears droop slightly. \"But this is better than I could've imagined.\" She gets up and walks out to the kitchen. She pulls out of the fridge... Oh, my God! It's a bone from a T-bone steak! I want it, I want it! Laura laughs as she dangles it above me. I jump and jump but can't reach it. C'mon lemme have it! Look, I'll do tricks for you! I spin, sit, stand, but she still won't give it to me. After a while of me desperately showing how much I want it, she finally drops it. I take the bone to the other room. She's not gonna take it back now! She just laughs a little and then goes to watch TV. I have fun gnawing on my bone but after a while, I realize I need to go! I go straight to Laura, the only person in the immediate vicinity who can take me out. I go to her and try to let her know that I need to go outside.</span></div></div>",

This couldn't have been a prank by his aunt, because she wouldn't have the time for it nor would she want to.

For some odd reason, Bobby felt really happy when she started to do this. In his mind, Bobby decided that his aunt had been effected by whatever was effecting him too. She wouldn't be able to act like this if she had done something to him, and she is not that great of an actor either. Lost in his thought, Bobby snapped back to realize that he was panting. Like a Dog. Great, Bobby thought, now there were mental changes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for Breakfast?\" Marla said to Bobby. Bobby followed Marla upstairs to the dining room, where he saw what he was afraid of. A large bowl of dog food and a bowl of water waiting for him. He had no choice, he thought. Marla was expecting him to eat. Marla went to the table to eat her eggs, while Bobby slowly got onto the floor and walked towards the bowl. Bobby, by some instinct, started to sniff the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin three minutes, Bobby had licked the bowl clean.

Hahahaha!\" The woman laughed as her dog barked at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy! Sit!\" Marla commanded sternly. Bobby obliged, and sat in the same position that the German Shepherd had just did. Only then did Bobby realize what he had done, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't stop himself from acting the way he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jenny, thanks for coming.\" Marla said with a smile. \"And hello Spike!\" Marla petted the German Shepherd, as Spike moved forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy was just excited to see you. He loves visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spike started to sniff Bobby, Bobby sniffs back. The two were just saying hello. As Bobby finished the sniffing of Spike, he heard Marla say...</span></div></div>",

His conflicting thoughts built up more and more, and unnoticeably he started to make nervous yips and other dog noises... Aunt Marla caught them and knew something was wrong. As she opened the door, Aunt Marla felt herself get all dizzy and faints on the floor. Seeing his aunt on the floor unconscious made the situating feel more real to him than he did a few minutes ago. With all of his might, he tried to get up on two legs, but for some reason he kept getting off balance and fell over every chance. Sighing he walked an all fours over to where his aunt's face was. He looked at her and feelings of sadness built up inside him making him whine a little. Bobby noticed this time, but he didn't care... He didn't know what to do and his now cramping hands would not help him... Bobby sat down the was it was natural for canines, and acted like he hadn't, to focused on his aunt. As another minute or so came by with out her waking up, Bobby started panicking, unaware that patches of golden fur was growing around his newly formed paws. Still siting, bobby leaned over and instinctively sniffed her. He could tell that she was still alive, but he was still very worried. Finally his mind urged him on and he kissed her awake...

If a regular person could truly see Bobby now, they would see a more of a dog with a few human traits. But as they reached the kitchen, Bobby's now baggy clothes was dragging slightly on the floor. Instinctively, he shook himself, and when he was done, he was naked, but no worries, his bottom half now accurately resembling a golden retriever. As he took a few steps forward, he looked back at his now lonely clothes and then turned back. <i>Noooooo!!! Go get those clothes!!! Come on, you need clothes!</i> He thought and Bobby stood there staring... Although his human mind tried to put up a big fight, it was being over powered by another thought that yelled, <i> Dogs don't need clothes Bobby! C'mon, go to your master! My aunt is not my aunt!!!</i> His thoughts kept fighting and he stood still until aunt Marla called. \"Come bobby!! Food!\" The call of food as well as the smell of it came, Bobby perked his pointier human ears to the call and literally galloped all the way over to where his aunt was. The food was still on the counter and she usually held it there for a while, at least in her mind.When he sat by her feet, he looked up, his body was fully canine, all that was left now was his muzzle, the senses, and the rest of the fur. \"You want some food boy? Do ya?!\" The word food, made him get all excited and he started barking. \"Bark Bark Bark!!!!!\" His tail wagged ferociously and actually got up on his hind legs.<br>\r\nAs Marla laughed, she knew he had enough of the tease and brought the bowl down. As Bobby stared, he got a little hesitant. His muzzle was almost all the way formed just as his new floppy ears were done and his nose started gaining a new texture. The process was making his nose itch and he brought his paw up to it and tried to get whatever was on it off. He broke focus again as Marla talked. \"I know it's not your favorite brand, but I bet it tastes just as good!\" As she finished his now fully functional, but furless muzzle started to sprout a few whiskers. When Bobby looked back at his food, he had the instinct over come his mind and learn forward trying to get a good whiff at the food in front of him. He remembered from the few times that he went to the pet store with his friends that it would smell awful. He wondered how dogs ever liked that crap. This time however, was different, as his new senses kicked in, the smell was perceived differently and this smell was way more appealing than he ever would've expected! In a matter of seconds, the dog food was no more and he licked the bowl clean. As Bobby brought his head up, all that was there now was a regular, young adult golden retriever. Although he was wagging his tail happily and smiled a goofy canine smile, the back of his mind finally realized that he was indeed a dog and that he might even stay like this forever... He felt defeated, as this was only the morning and he was already a fully fledged dog. Soon Marla said.</span></div></div>",

He heard so many new sounds and smelled so many new smells it was almost overwhelming. His dog mind kept getting so sidetracked with everything that what remained of his human mind had to remind him who he was at least every five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The first time he felt he was in almost full control, <i>Hydrant! Must smell!</i> Thought his dog mind. His human mind was more powerful though and prevented him from bounding toward the fire hydrant as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Not five minutes passed before Marla and Bobby turned a corner and Bobby found himself face to face with a squirrel. Before his human mind could react he started to bark furiously at the squirrel. While the human part of his mind kept him from moving once again, he couldn't stop himself from barking until the squirrel had taken shelter in a high branch of one of the nearby trees and Marla had ordered him to be quiet. <i>No! Stay in control!</i> thought Bobby as his human mind regained full control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     This regained control didn't last however, with only one block to go until they reached the park, Bobby's human mind lost control entirely when he saw another dog and it's master heading toward him. With his ability to reason gone, the only part of his human self left was his memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of dog was it?</span></div></div>",

As she looked at him, she felt drawn to him for some reason, but she sat next to her mistress like a good girl. Bobby noticed that she repeatedly glanced at him a few times, but then looked away, almost as if she was embarrassed. As he saw her, a growing affection to lick her muzzle grew inside of him and his human mind tried to resist, but even him, for some reason felt like she was a hot dog... They suddenly had a moment to stare at each other for a long time until Marla's friend suggested something. \"Hey Marla...\" Marla looked at her friend and noticed that she was looking at the dogs. this made Marla look at them and had a feeling of what she was going to ask. \"So Marla, you know that both our dogs are of the age and that it is almost the time where all animals will need to make the next generation... Do you think that maybe we should let them out into the backyard and get better 'aquatinted?'\" Marla smiled feeling that her friend's female was the best choice for her Bobby and nodded. \"Yes, I think that's a wonderful idea!\" Bobby looked at his aunt and widened his eyes. <i>Nooooo!!!!!! Master can't be serious!!! She's no master!!! She's my aunt!!!</i> His human mind tried to fight it, but his dog mind and part of his human mind agreed. <i>C'mon Bobby!!! This is a fine female!!! She is the perfect choice!!</i> As he thought of being able to be with his new mate, his tongue hung to the side and he started wagging his tail faster than he had since he grew the tail.<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, Bobby's ear perked at the sound that the back door made and dashed. His mind made up memories of always getting excited any chance he got to go outside! As soon as he and the female were out there, Bobby looked up in horror yet also excitement as he saw his aunt and her friend leave. Now, he was alone with the prettiest female he ever laid eyes on and his instincts wanted her!! As he walked over to her, he felt like he needed to do something, but what was it</span></div></div>",

With all of his might, he clamped his muzzle on Betty's leash and tugged. As Betty aided him in tugging, she licked his muzzle a lot of times, making Bobby motivated to tug harder. Seeing this sight, Marla's friend agreed to let the love birds stay together a little longer. \"Hey Marla? Is it ok if I leave Betty here overnight? I have something to do, and I want her to be happy.\" Marla smiled at her idea and nodded. \"Yes! I'll be happy to!\" Marla's friend unhooked the leash and said goodbye to Betty who licked her face. When Marla and her friend went to say goodbye in the front, Bobby and Betty continued to where they left off. Each dog licked each other's muzzle. Soon Betty and Bobby got the feeling to be playful and played tag by nipping one another and running away. They played for 30 minutes and got a little tired. By now, Bobby's mind stopped trying to fight and kind of adjusted to being a dog. It wasn't as bad as he thought it was, unless you counted the drinking from the toilet and using your muzzle and tongue for other reasons... Soon, Bobby felt the need to use the bathroom, which put his human mind to protest, but unlike times before, he didn't put much of a fight. He wandered everywhere until he noticed Betty getting ready to do the same. A thought soon came to his mind. <i>Betty will soon be mine, I need to show her who the boss is in the relationship, so I'll let her go first...</i> As he saw how Betty did her business, he went over to where she went and sniffed around the area which was pretty normal for dogs, and as he was around Betty's mess, he felt the need to go on top of her mess to show who was boss and soon, he did. <br>\r\nAfter he did his business, he sniffed to make sure it smelled like him and hen it did, his tongue hung out to the side and he was wagging his tail in victory. Betty came over soon and to Bobby's amazement he heard her communicate to him. <b>You are handsome</b> he heard her say and he wagged his tail harder. She started licking his muzzle and he was so happy and excited that he started licking back. A thought started to spring in his mind. <i>I need to breed!!! This mate smells ready!</i> this time Bobby's mind tried fighting as hard as he could. <i>Please!!! Don't do it!!! Think of if you changed back? What if you did and Betty is still pregnant?!?!?! You would still be the father, and you would have to take responsibility!!!</i> Bobby was thinking this for a while while still licking Betty. What would he choose?</span></div></div>",

Tommy said at the side of his bed.  'Ribbit.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla looked down and saw the frog look up at her.  She let out a nasty shriek and slammed the door.  Marla must have been afraid of frogs.  But Tommy's mind could barely register that right now.  All he new is that he wanted to stay still, until he didn't.  He hopped around the floor, using his back legs to his advantage.  His body felt that this was only temporary, and he wanted to get the most out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Bobby would never get that chance, as Marla was too scared of what he had become, that she wouldn't have dropped him in the tub, or even the sink or a pale of water.<br>\r\n'Ribbit.' croaked Bobby with some disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful.<br>\r\nSoon night came and it got colder, and Bobby crawled under a piece of the blanket that fell over the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day boby woke up to find</span></div></div>",

He then noticed to lumps under the blanket where his chest was.  He pushed his back against the wall at the end of the bed and sat up.  Suddenly long raven hair fell down to his elbows, as his newly acquired breasts began to giggle.  Instinctively, Bobby felt more horrified that he was a female than that he was once a cat or a frog during the last two days.  He tried to yell, but a high pitch screech came out of his mouth.  Embarrassed, Tommy lifted one of his hands to cover his mouth, only to find out that it was webbed.  Terrified, Bobby tried to run out of the bed and towards his aunt.  This action was a disaster, as he tripped out of bed and started flapping his body like a land locked carp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby looked down to see that he didn't have legs anymore, but a giant fish-like tail covering him from the waist down.  Bobby shrieked in terror, trying to form words, but his throat produced nothing that sounded human.  Slapping his (her?) powerful tail against the floor, he finally created enough commotion to get Marla into his room.  She opened the door and...</span></div></div>",

Bobby groaned mentally in frustration, as he tends to fall off his bed during the night when sleeping. The second thing he felt was the sun's bright rays shining into his eyes, forcing them open slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his vision blurred, Bobby shook his head until his vision became clear. Blinking a few times, Bobby then noticed the situation that he was in. He saw that his surroundings have become MUCH bigger, everything becoming massive around him. Bobby looked up and saw that the average sized bed that he slept in last night now towers above him, with some of the now-massive duvet touching the floor, making a pathway up to the bed. Bobby then looked behind him, and saw that the small space under the bed has become vast and plenty of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Bobby noticed something. Last night, Bobby had put his bag under the bed, with it half closed. It appears that the mirror that he brought from him is propped against his giant bag, which he had done last night. But, something seems wrong in the reflection, so Bobby gets up and walked over to the large mirror, feeling a bit funny when walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bobby finally gets to the mirror, he was shocked. In the reflection, instead of his own, is an ant. A single red ant with suspicious blue eyes stares back at him. Bobby blinks, and sees that the ant blinked as well. Bobby then looked down and saw that his legs and arms have become appendages. Finally, to test if it's not a dream, Bobby touches his face with one of the appendages, and saw that the ant is also touching it's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confirms it. Bobby has turned into an ant, a very small insect. Bobby attempted to scream in horror, but then realises that due to the fact that ants do not have voice boxes, he couldn't scream.<br>\r\n\"<i>What on earth happened to me....?</i>\" he thought, still unsure why on earth he turned into an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM! BOOM!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of loud, consecutive explosions roar through the room, catching ant Bobby off by surprise. Bobby quickly scurries out from out of the bed. What he sees absolutely terrifies him. Something that threatens him in his current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic figure of Aunt Marla is looming above him, completely unaware of her nephew-turned-ant at her feet. Marla walked around Bobby's room in her black-high heels, creating some quiet footsteps from her point of view but booming explosions for Bobby's point of view. Marla's dress is a navy blue, covering her top half of her body and going just above the knees, showing a lot of leg. From a certain angle, Bobby imagined that he could see his aunt's panties, but that's disgusting. There is a low-cut part around her chest area, which shows off her big (now massive, to Bobby's current size) cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM! BOOM!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive Marla then proceeded to walk near the bed, stopping directly above ant Bobby, still completely unaware of her ant-y nephew below, quivering near her gigantic feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>BOBBY!</b></font>\" Marla called for him, with some frustration in her voice. Bobby covered his head with his appendages to help block out the noise, as his body flinched at the loud voice. \"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>WHERE ARE YOU?!</b></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Maybe if he's quick enough, Bobby could quickly scuttle his ant-y body out of the room before Marla's huge black high heels come crashing down. So, Bobby nods to himself while his monumental aunt notices that a single red ant is in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Bobby begins to move when suddenly.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>HUH?</b></font>\" Bobby freezes in horror, and then looks up to see that Marla is looking down at him, with a blank stare, feet moving a little and creating a lot of noise for Bobby. With the intensity of the star, Bobby moves his ant body back a bit and would be sweating and panicking right now, if ants could sweat. Massive Marla stared at the single red ant with blue eyes for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to Bobby's surprise, instead of gaining a expression of disgust, Marla begins to grin. \"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>AH. THERE YOU ARE, BOBBY!</b></font>\" Marla then goes down on her knees, making sure not to crush Bobby by accident, creating lots of loud noises for Bobby as she shifted her movement. Once on her knees, Massive Marla then extends her giant hands to right in front of Bobby, who looks somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>GO ON, BOBBY. IT'S SAFE.</b></font>\" Marla reassured Bobby gently, though still loud for him. Bobby then nods with his ant-y head and crawls onto the large fingers then giant palm of Marla's hand. Marla then brings her hand with Bobby on closer to her face. Bobby backs off a bit in surprise of Marla's enormous face, though the gentle smile puts his worries to ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>NOW, YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING, RIGHT?</b></font>\" Marla whispered, quieting her voice for Bobby, though it was loud to him as normal shouting. Ant Bobby then nods, as he cannot speak. Marla then frowns, as she was expecting him to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>OH YEAH, YOU'RE AN ANT. ANTS CAN'T TALK....</b></font>\" Marla remarks quietly. She then shook her head. \"<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Well....</font></b>\" she went, even quieter for Bobby's sake. \"<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">What happened to you is actually quite easy to explain.</font></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby turned his ant head slightly in confusion. \"<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">This house....has a particular curse on it. Anyone who stays here during the weekdays as a guest are subjected to this curse.</font></b>\" Marla explained simply, smiling a little. \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>They go through transformation.</b></font>\" Bobby is taken aback by this, though it is hard to read an ant's emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">The guest must go through a certain amount of days of transformation, depending on what day they start to stay. They must be asleep for the transformation to begin and when they wake up, the transformation will be completed.</font></b>\" Marla continues to explain. \"<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">The guest returns back to normal on the weekdays, but will begin to transform again once they are asleep and the clock becomes midnight. Since you arrived on a Sunday, you have to go through five days of transformation, I guess?</font></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla then points one of her large fingers at Bobby. \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>The transformation can be anything. Today, you're an ant, which is quite surprising since that's never happened to a guest before. The next day, you could be anything. You could be an object, a different size, an animal, a body part, be yourself but extremely older, become a new person or switch your gender. Understand?</b></font>\" Bobby then nods to response to that. Then he sees Marla frown seriously, worrying a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">However, if you fall asleep when you are out of my house when transformed, you will be in that form, permanently, even if you return to the house. You must not fall asleep, got it?</font></b>\" Bobby nods once again, though nervously. Marla then grins, showing her titanic teeth off. \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>But don't worry, I won't let that happen to my little 'ant-y' nephew! I am your 'ant', after all! Ha!</b></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby then points at Marla, confused on how the curse hasn't effect her. She somehow knew what he meant. \"<b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">How am I not affected? Well, after a while, the curse recognizes that you live here and doesn't effect you. Believe me, I've had some weird experiences when I was transformed! Though, a part of the curse states that the owners of the house must transform along with guests when they stay, thought a lot less harsh. Don't I look different to you?</font></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Marla pointed that out, Bobby then had a good look at her. It was true, she transformed as well. It appears that her body age had gone down a lot. Instead of a 52 year old woman with greying hair, Marla now looks like she's twenty two years old with an amazing figure, stunning looks and fiery red hair. Bobby then nodded, causing Marla to grin. She then, with her other hand, gently picked off ant Bobby. Though panicking a little, Bobby then was put on her shoulder, which she then looked at him and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>Hold on tight! It's going be a rough ride!</b></font>\" Marla then gets up off her knees, with Bobby hold on tight on her dress. Massive Marla then walked out of Bobby's room, with ant Bobby holding on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Once recovering from the fall, Bobby attempts to crawl out of the cleavage, when he discovers that the bottom half of his ant body is stuck. He looks down and attempts to pull himself out, though it was hard since he was an ant, and Marla's breasts were too close together for him to pull out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby struggles to pull himself out when he notices that Marla has stopped moving.

You see, as you might have noticed the house has a spell on it, or rather a curse. Once long ago my family angered a sorceress who cursed us for all time. Whenever someone sleeps in a bed my family owns, they will wake up transformed in some way. My tried and succeeded to make peace with the sorceress but she was unable to completely remove her spell. So instead she modified it so that it would only occur one week each year. I didn't warn you because quite frankly I doubted you would believe me. Now there are a few other things about our curse you need to know,\" she paused to makes sure bobby was listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"First of all you can't tell anyone you are under a spell unless they already know it, and as far as anyone who knows you is concerned they will believe you have always been like this. Their relationship with you won't even change dramatically, your friends will still be your friends, although when it comes to those who love you things can get a bit confused. For example if you have a girlfriend she will now love you like a little brother, instead of as a romantic partner because you are an eight year old. Everyone will treat you as an eight year old, because to them you are,\" she stopped  for a moment to let the information sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Second sleep drives the transformation, when you fall asleep in a bed in this house you will transform in a semi-random way, generally feeding on hidden sub-conscience desires. Evidently some of yours revolve around becoming younger. However falling asleep at night is not the only way to trigger the transformation. Once begun anytime you fall asleep today the transformation could trigger again evolving further. Since we know your transformation is centered around getting younger any number of things could occur. You might get younger physically, or mentally. Or maybe you'll wake up wearing diapers and completely incontinent. I can't be certain. Tomorrow could focus on these desires or new ones, there's no way to be absolutely sure. But you have to makes sure that on the last day of this week you sleep in this house, or what ever transformations you have undergone will become permanent. You may or may not return to your proper age tomorrow morning,\" she finished and sighing, sat down. It was then that you finally noticed the changes to your Aunt, she had also become younger, although her regression left her in in late twenties, and quite beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bobby looked down at his now eight-year-old body and marveled. Magic was REAL! So many possibilities. \"Maybe this isn't so bad,\" Bobby thought to himself. After all his Aunt was right, he secretly did desire to be younger, and maybe some time as a kid, even a toddler would be fun, he wanted a vacation from peer pressure and expectations and responsibility. He was quickly warming up to the idea. \"What should we do now,\" Aunt Marla said brightening, \"Do you want some pancakes?\" \"Pancakes!\" Bobby shouted childishly smiling. Chuckling Marla said \"I'll take that as a yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued into the kitchen and Marla whipped up some of her famous pancakes, slapping three big ones down onto bobby's plate. He looked at them in awe, there were many perks to being younger again for sure. Bobby quickly began making a pig of himself. As the two ate, Bobby made quite a mess, eating like a real eight-year-old. He yawns as he finishes his large meal, and thinks about taking a nap, maybe a descent into toddler hood wouldn't be so bad. He remarked this to his aunt, and she replied \"Well, its certainly your choice, but be absolutely sure, there's no way to undo what ever happens until the end of the week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby yawned again, and decided he would risk it. He climbed back into his bed and and in moments fell back asleep. Hidden beneath his blankets Bobby began to change again, but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She could not hold in the smirk that she had attempted to conceal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like somebody had a little accident...\" Aunt Marla grinned as she held her hand out to the now 8yr old incontinent boy that was Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Bobby finally looked down to see the wet patch emitting from the crotch area of his pajama trousers, still leaking out urine. His face was slowly, but surely, becoming red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest we check the bathroom young man\" Aunt Marla said as she lead Bobby across the hallway.</span></div></div>",

He looked inside of his suitcase and groaned. There was a variety of shirts decorated with the Avengers, Legos, Bob the Builder, and other child appropriate characters. Wanting to get the day over with as quickly as possible, Bobby grabbed a pair of shorts, and an Avengers shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile changing, he noticed that his underwear had transformed from boxers to briefs covered with Pokemon. He groaned again. As soon as he was dressed he put his shoes. Booby didn't even have to lace his shoes as they were velcro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to the store was frustrating. Instead of being seated in the front and controlling the radio, Bobby was seated in the back, in a child safety seat. He rolled his eyes at how ridiculous he must look; however, he managed to catch sight of himself in the mirror. The mirror's image showed a scrawny five year-old boy looking bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want this!\" Bobby demanded, grabbing a candy bar off of the rack at the check out counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the way you ask for something,\" Marla answered, giving Bobby a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the duration of the shopping trip, Bobby's mind had started to regress. He was pouting more, and making more childish noises. At first, he had protested sitting in the child seat of the buggy, but by the time they had made it past the dairy section he was reaching out for things like a real five year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Marla,\" Bobby began, after having his candy taken away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, Bobby,\" Marla scolded. \"I have to pay. We'll be out of the store soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have to go potty,\" Bobby pleaded as he squirmed in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I need you to be a big boy and hold it for a few more minutes,\" Marla said, as she placed the last of the items on the conveyor belt. \"We'll go as soon as I'm done paying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby continued to squirm as the cashier rung up the items. The cashier looked to be a few years older than Bobby; and if he had had his wits about him, he probably would have tried to flirt with her. His squirming came to an abrupt halt as soon as the last item was rung up. Tears began to well up in his eyes as he wet his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sweetie,\" Marla cooed. \"We'll go home and get you changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride back to Marla's house was uncomfortable for Bobby. His pants were cold and damp and becoming itchy. His mind was floating back and forth between being a teenager and being a child. He was disgusted with himself that he had wet his pants in front of such a cute cashier; but he kept reminding himself that even big boys have accidents from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla helped Bobby change into dry clothes upon their return. She was quite insistent that he wear a pull-up, so as to avoid any further accidents. Bobby reluctantly agreed. He had come to recognize that his mind was no longer what it once was.</span></div></div>",

At one point made him hold her butt as she passionately kissed him while on their stroll through the park. Then they got their sandwiches as Marla was feeding Bobby his sandwhich which creeped him out more. Then when you where at the screening for Jerry Maguire she put her head on your shoulder which was ok since it was something small. Then at the Italian restureant Bobby accidentally re-enacted  the scene from Lady and the Tramp with your shared bowl of sphagetti which resulted in a giggle from Marla and the enevitable kiss. After words you enjoyed the boat ride as the two of them just starred at the river as she held Bobby next to him leaning on his shoulder. When the day was done they both headed home, picked up jack, and put him to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for the last event of the day.\u201d said Marla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m really beat can we do this another day.\u201d said Bobby hoping that she would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you big tease fine have it your way.\u201d she said playfully tapping him before getting to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bobby turned to go back to his room he was stopped by Marla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey where you going silly you sleep here.\u201d said Marla patting the spot on the bed next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we sleep together.\u201d thought Bobby sarcastically. \u201cWell since were. It doing that thing I guess it\u2019s ok.\u201d He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby yawned, put on pajamas he got from his room and slept next to Marla.</span></div></div>",

He was grossed out seeing Aunt Marla in her bra and underwear, let alone this dumbfounding day he was having, as if the world were conspiring to force Bobby into a role he was never meant for. He tried with all of his mental might to resist the urge to give into sinful incest, but he found that the more he resisted, the more the magic, or whatever it was that was doing this, was compelling him to return Marla's passionate embrace even harder and more salaciously upon her soft lips.  The feeling of Aunt Marla's tongue inside his mouth and the sound of her moaning was turning him on. It was at that moment when Bobby start to experience flashbacks, vivid memories that he had no business recollecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe visualized himself as a young man of twenty-one, about five years older than Bobby was now. His black hair was longer, but styled like Luke Perry. Looking around, he was on top of a motorcycle, awaiting the red light to turn green in some part of town he was unfamiliar with. He turned his head right and sees a teenage Aunt Marla as she was walking home with her girlfriends, laughing endlessly about some idle gossip session they were having. The Clueless inspired fashion of their clothes indicated that this was a good twenty years ago. At that exact right moment, like kismet, the young blonde girl turns her head left and sees the hunk in the leather jacket riding the chopper. Bobby sees young Marla's lecherous Lolita eyes undressing him. With the roar of the engine, Bobby flies past them as the light turned, realizing that he'll have to wait a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genuine part of Bobby was growing more and more confused. The actual Bobby hated this, wished that this was all a dream that he desperately wanted to wake up from. The phantom Bobby, however, the one who was really forty years old and married, was beginning to have an erection, daydreaming about the first time he met Marla in person. </span></div></div>",

Bobby was now 24, just at the end of his college life, trying to figure out the exact nature of what he could do his in his life. He still had that cool leather jacket persona, but it was just slightly more mature now. Through his college life he had also really gotten into movies and creative thoughts, and he was trying to find an outlet for that passion as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne fateful day, Bobby was waltzing through campus, listening to, of all things, Prince's 1999 on his walkman. As he walked through campus, he caught something through his sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her. It was Marla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would have thought that that girl he saw one day while riding his motorcycle through town three years ago would be going to the same college as him? And who would have thought that he would be running into her on a random walk through the campus. He couldn't waste this chance. His adult life was ahead of him. And this was the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strutted up, cool as ever, and gave her a look. That look. The look that made the girls melt. Marla was no exception. She had a distant memory of the cool older guy that looked at her from a motorcycle some time ago. And now he was here, in front of her. And she melted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt from that first moment that they were gonna be soulmates. They dined that night, they went and saw The Matrix, they returned to her apartment, and did not hesitate to make sweet, sweet love.</span></div></div>",

He felt his hips begin to grow and his thighs along with them. His legs became toned and beautiful like his body, all of his body hair began to be sucked back in and the hair on his head compensated for that loss as it grew and grew, while turning blonde at the same time. He then felt him self bounce up a bit, as if he was all of a sudden sitting on a pillow. His ass had just plumped up and grown quite big. His hands and feet began to get smaller and slimmer while the nails on them grew longer. Bobby got up and ran for the mirror. The only male parts of him left were his face and his penis... bit for long tho as before his eyes, Bobby watched his junk dwindle away and being replaced with a vagina. Then his face became rounder and softer and a face of pure beauty, as his lips became plump and his eyelashes grew longer. He was now completely female. And he was an absolutely beautiful female at that.<br>\r\nA couple moments later aunt Marla came in holding a bra and saw her nephew staring at himself in the mirror completely naked.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll need to get more than just a bra\u201d she sighed...</span></div></div>",

Sure, he felt he could handle being left at home alone, but he understood that that just wasn\u2019t in the cards. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t so bad. His aunt was cool enough, and she didn\u2019t live so far away that he couldn\u2019t go to see his friends.  He quite liked her, actually, and she was always very nice to him. Bobby liked his uncle, too, it was a shame he wasn\u2019t around.  They both liked kids, he wondered why they\u2019d never had any of their own.   He wasn\u2019t quite sure why his parents were leaving so late at night for their trip. Apparently it meant that their plane tickets were cheaper, although he didn\u2019t understand how that worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they\u2019d dropped him off at his aunt\u2019s that Sunday night \u2013 they\u2019d gone zipping away after only briefly  stopping to say hello, which struck him as a bit rude -  he\u2019d had the requisite polite conversation with her, then gone up to bed.  He unpacked his stuff, and set a photograph  on top of a bureau.  The photo showed two boys in basketball uniforms flanking a smiling girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d opened up his laptop, then accessed his aunt\u2019s wi-fi and gone on-line.  There was a Facebook message from his friend, Nicky O\u2019Halloran, suggesting that they get together the next day.  Nicky was the other boy in the photo.  He was taller than Bobby, lanky with reddish hair and green eyes. Nicky had lived next door to Bobby their whole lives, and they\u2019d been friends as far back as Bobby could remember. Nicky\u2019s father had died when he was young, and his mother worked long hours, so Nicky spent a lot of time with the Thomsons, so much so that he was almost a part of the family. He did have an older brother, Stevie,  who was out living on his own.  Nicky and Bobby were both on their high school\u2019s basketball team.   This was, Bobby admitted, more a sign of how sad their school\u2019s team was ,  than a sign of the pair of them being great athletes.  Nicky could be a bit of a loudmouth sometimes, but he was basically OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a message from Stephanie Belanger, who was the girl in the photo.  She was a beautiful brunette, with brown eyes and a real gift for art.  She and Bobby had been good friends since they had met on the first day of high school. Bobby very much wanted to be more than friends with her, but she had gently but firmly made it clear that while she liked him a lot, she wasn\u2019t interested in a romantic relationship.  Bobby did his best to swallow his disappointment so that they could remain friends, but deep inside he still really wished she felt for him the way he did for her.  Nicky said he thought she was a lesbian (actually, he had used a much coarser term), but then, he said that about any girl that didn\u2019t like him (which in practice meant <i>most</i> girls), so Bobby figured that Nicky was just projecting. Stephanie was asking his opinion of a painting she had done. That was one of many things he really liked about her \u2013 even though he was a jock of sorts, she still talked to him as though he had a brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie\u2019s sister, Lorraine, who was one year older than her, was also a good artist, and the two of them would be spending the week at an artists\u2019 seminar, so she wouldn\u2019t be around until the weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sending responses to both of them, he undressed and pulled on the ratty old green bathrobe that was all he usually wore at night, and climbed into bed.   He wondered what it would be like to have siblings.  He thought it might be better than being an only child. He knew his mother would have liked to have had more children, but health issues had prevented that.<br>\r\n When he woke up early Monday morning, he felt something odd, as though a weight were pressing down on his chest. He opened his eyes and noticed two things right away: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tHe was now wearing what appeared to be a loose-fitting, black nightgown, of the sort that a teenage girl might wear.<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n\t2)There were two weights on his chest, weights the size and position of a pair of breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on?  Had his aunt done this as some kind of a joke? How had she managed to do it without waking him up? He grasped the right \u201cbreast\u201d firmly to try and wrench it off.  Instead, he gave a high-pitched yelp of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I \u2013 FELT \u2013 THAT!</i>, he thought.  <i>I actually felt that! What\u2019s going on?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fumbled with the nightgown for a moment before realizing that it was the sort that zipped down the back. He unzipped it enough so that he could look down the front.  They were real!  There were real feminine breasts attached to his body!   They were real and very <i><b>SEN</b>sitive!</i> He zipped the gown back up. He knew what he had to check next, but he was afraid. Eventually, he reached down and pulled up the bottom of the gown. When he saw between his legs, he groaned. His \u201cequipment\u201d was gone, replaced by what he recognized as a vagina (for all that he\u2019d never seen one before in real life). He reached down and checked. It was real, too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat in the bed in shock.  <i>How</i> had this  happened?  <i>Why</i> had this happened? He ran his hand through hair that he now realized reached down to the small of his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have to see</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving robotically, he got up out of the bed, and walked over to a full-length mirror on the other side of the room. Looking back at him was a girl about his own age \u2013 16 \u2013 with long black hair with a red streak down one side.  Her face reminded him of pictures he\u2019d seen of his Aunt Mary \u2013 his father\u2019s sister \u2013 when she\u2019d been a teenager.   The girl was not heavy, but thickset and curvy, with a respectable rack.  Her nails \u2013 fingers and toes \u2013 were painted black.  Overall, not the type he went for, but attractive enough.    The name \u201cJune\u201d came into his mind.  His mother had once told him that if he\u2019d been born a girl, he \u2013 well \u201cshe\u201d \u2013 would have been called \u201cJune\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobby?\u201d, said Aunt Marla. \u201cAre you OK in there? I thought I heard you yell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby froze for a moment. What would his aunt say when she saw him like this? Would she even know him? But what else could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Marla?\u201d, he said,  trying to lower his voice as much as possible.  \u201cI think I have a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobby, can I come in?\u201d, his aunt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steeled himself for her reaction as she came into the room.  She stared at him open-mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Aunt M-Marla?\u201d, he said. I-It\u2019s m-me, B-Bobby.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes seemed to pierce right through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mother Goddess, Bobby, it <i>is</i> you! Oh, no \u2013 that room! I thought it was fixed! I should never have put you in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe room? Aunt Marla, what are you talking about?  Did you know this would happen? Did you do this to me? You\u2019ve got to tell me what\u2019s happening!\u201d  Bobby\u2019s voice shook. He was on the edge of hysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla touched his forehead.  \u201cBobby. Calm. Down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of calm swept over Bobby.  Suddenly, he relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuntie, how did you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA simple spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA spell? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome downstairs. We\u2019ll have some breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla put a robe on Bobby and led him to the kitchen.  They had a hearty breakfast, and then Marla poured them both cups of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobby, the first thing you have to understand is that I\u2019m not really your mother\u2019s younger sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, you\u2019re adopted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly.  You could say I adopted myself into her family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, here\u2019s the big reveal, the part you\u2019re going to find hard to believe.  Well, maybe not so hard after how you woke up this morning.  The truth is, I\u2019m a witch. In fact, I\u2019m the last witch on Earth. How old would guess I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno. Late 30\u2019s, 40, tops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m four hundred years old. I\u2019m not immortal \u2013 I\u2019ve probably only got about a century left.  It\u2019s OK, it\u2019s been a good life.  When my time comes, I\u2019ll go to be with my ancestors happily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last witch? What happened to all the others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA long time ago, this world was filled with magic.  Every magical being you\u2019ve ever read about in a fairy tale existed, and more besides.  Then, about two thousand years ago, something happened, no one ever knew what. Whatever it was, the world became increasingly less hospitable to magic.   Magical beings began to die out.  Finally, four hundred years ago, my parents were the last magical beings left on the Earth.  Then I was born, the last new magical being born here.  I\u2019ve lived in this house ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But this house isn\u2019t four hundred years old!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is, I\u2019ve just \u2018redecorated\u2019 it over the years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you become my mother\u2019s sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you live as long as I do, you need a little protective camouflage, to keep people from finding out who you really are.  So, I needed a family.  I\u2019d met your mother, and we\u2019d become good friends. I told her who I was, and she agreed to be my sister.  She was perfect for it. She was an only child, with no living close relatives. I cast a few spells, and I was your mother\u2019s kid sister, at least as far as anyone else was concerned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you look a lot like my mother. Is that why you chose her?.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I used to look a lot different.  I cast a spell to change my appearance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes Uncle Joe know about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.  I don\u2019t like keeping a secret from him,  but I thought it was for the best.  I knew I could trust your mom to keep it a secret, but I knew that Joe would give it away without meaning to.  I love Joe Vercotti, but he has no filter.  As far as I can tell, he\u2019s never picked up on it. That fact that our car has never  broken down or crashed or even been ticketed, the fact that we\u2019ve never been sick since we got engaged, my uncanny ability to pick Super Bowl and World Series winners \u2013 he\u2019s put all of that down to clean living and good luck. We could never have children, of course, there would be\u2026problems\u2026with that.  But otherwise we\u2019ve had a nice, normal life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, but how does this relate to what happened to me?  You said something about that room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you have to understand, my father was kind of a conflicted man.  Honestly, I think he was a bit unhinged by being one of the last magical beings.  My mother dealt with it well enough, but he didn\u2019t handle it well at all. Father wasn\u2019t all bad, he could be quite kind, but he was also quite cruel sometimes.  Anyhow, he put a curse on that room, and he used it to pass judgement on anyone who he felt needed judging.  Anyone who sleeps in that room is cursed. On each of the next five days, they will transform into someone or something else.  It can be anything, human, animal or anything else.  Sometimes it\u2019s totally random, other times there\u2019s a pattern. It can be something from your nightmares, or from your dreams.  Some people even ended up better off.  Also, each time you change, your personal history is changed. Everyone except you and I will think that that\u2019s who or what you\u2019ve always been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now, everyone else thinks I\u2019ve always been a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.  Everyone but you and I believes that you are June Thomson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens if I don\u2019t go back to that room tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you go, before midnight tonight you\u2019ll be pulled back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what happens on the sixth day?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the morning of the sixth day,  you will wake up having randomly transformed into one of the forms that you took during the previous five days. That will be your form for the rest of your life.  By the time your parents get here on Sunday, even you will have forgotten that you were ever Bobby Thomson.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you knew there was a curse on that room, how could you let me stay in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it was fixed. After my father died, my mother and I combined our powers to break the curse.  And it worked! At least a dozen people have stayed in that room over the years with no problem.  I guess our \u2018fix\u2019 was only temporary. I\u2019m sorry you had to be the one to find that out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you fix this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,  I can\u2019t stop the transformations, but if I cast the proper spell right at midnight on the fifth day, I can interfere with it, so that instead of the final transformation being one of the forms you took during the week, you will instead transform back to normal. Or, at least, somewhat normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018somewhat normal\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you might be a little taller, or have a different hair color, or be a few months older or younger, something like that. I\u2019m sorry, but magic isn\u2019t an exact science. Come to that, it\u2019s not a science at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything I can do to help you with that?\u201d, asked Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d, said Marla. \u201cThis is something I have to do on my own. I\u2019m afraid that preparations for it\u2019s going to take up a lot of my time for the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your life is sort of in \u2018suspension\u2019 for the next few days.  Like it or not, you\u2019re going to be transformed. Why not try being the other people or things that you turn into?  Today you\u2019re \u2018June Thomson\u2019. Trying being June Thomson, and see what her life is like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I do that\u201d\u201d asked Bobby. \u201cI don\u2019t even know her, or who she\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClear your mind and \u2018listen\u2019 mentally.  You\u2019ll be able to hear and see June\u2019s memories, and find out the kind of person she is.  In fact, if you want to try something really interesting, try and relax completely, and relinquish control of your body.   \u2018June\u2019 will go about her life without any effort on your part.  It\u2019ll be like being a passenger in your own body, but you\u2019ll be able to re-take control whenever you like. Who knows what you might learn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t it freak her out if she suddenly loses control of her body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. You have to understand, June isn\u2019t a \u2018real\u2019 person, just a \u2018potential\u2019 one. In a way, it\u2019ll be more like watching a character in a movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said I\u2019d forget everything at the end of the five days. What point is there learning stuff that I\u2019ll just forget?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll consciously forget. But subconsciously, you may well retain anything important that you learn.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clearing his mind, he found June\u2019s thoughts and memories coming into his heads.  By concentrating on certain subjects, he found that he could \u201cread\u201d the history of her life, at least as she\u2019d remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune had the same birthday as Bobby, although she was a year younger, 15 instead of 16, as he was.  Her earliest memories weren\u2019t too different from his, but as she\u2019d gotten older she\u2019d become somewhat withdrawn, not fitting in well.  However, when she got to high school, she\u2019d met Julie Nakamura and become friends with her. Through her, she\u2019d become friends with Ellen Peters, Anne DiGiacomo and Jenna Carlson. Bobby recognized them. They were a clique of goth girls at his high school.  Some of the other kids mocked them and called them the \u201cFrightful Four\u201d.  Sometimes Bobby had joined in with them.   June had taken to the goth lifestyle, and the group were soon known as the \u201cFrightful Five\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How did she fall in with those freaks?</i>, thought Bobby to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby was startled as he found himself suddenly getting up off the bed.  He had relinquished control to \u201cJune\u201d without even realizing it!  It was a strange sensation, not being in control of his own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to see where June would take him.  She undressed, and went and stood in front of the mirror for a moment, looking herself over. Then she took some towels out of the closet. Putting on a black bathrobe, she went to the bathroom and took a shower. Afterwards, she dried herself off and then did her hair the way she liked it.  She sprinkled herself with baby powder to make herself look pale, then applied black eye and lip make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she got dressed in a lacy, black outfit with matching shoes, then looked in the mirror and pronounced herself as \u201cPresentable\u201d.  She took out her cellphone and texted Julie, to confirm that the five friends were still on-schedule to get together that day.  Then she picked up her handbag and went downstairs again.  Marla was still in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Marla\u201d, she said, \u201cIf it\u2019s OK with you, I\u2019m gonna go down town and hang out with my friends for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, dear\u201d, said Marla. \u201c\u201dI\u2019m going to be busy all day. Call me if you need anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Auntie, I\u2019ll be back around 6:00. See ya later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune left the house and began walking to the bus stop.  A coarse voice rang out from across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Bride of Frankenstein, nice outfit! HAW! HAW! HAW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame she\u2019s such a freak, she\u2019s got a nice rack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pair of teenage boys hanging out.  June glared at them briefly, but moved on without saying anything, obviously angry.  Bobby winced, inwardly.  He\u2019d said stuff like that to girls, before \u2013 maybe not so crass, but still pretty unsubtle -  never realizing what a jerk he\u2019d sounded like.  As June rode the bus, Bobby noticed how many guys \u2013 not just boys, but grown men \u2013 tried to angle themselves to stare down June\u2019s cleavage. She was aware of it, too.  All the times he\u2019d done the same thing, he\u2019d thought he was being so subtle, when obviously the girls had known quite well what he was doing. He was beginning to understand why so many women thought men were pigs.  Men <i>were</i> pigs, and he\u2019d been one of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, June arrived at her stop, and got off the bus. She went in to Lotsa Java, a coffee shop that her friends liked to hang out in. She spotted them at a table in the back. They waved at her and she went over to set with them.  Bobby listed as the five friends discussed anything and everything. He began to feel bad about having thought of them as  \u201dfreaks\u201d. The five girls obviously liked and cared about each other, and were, in fact, intelligent, interesting girls.  June, a shy, withdrawn girl had gained a real fellowship with these friends, and had come out of her shell.  The more he listened to them, the less the fact that they looked a little \u201cdifferent\u201d mattered to him. He almost wished he could be a part of the group permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Julie looked up and said to the other girls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook out, here comes Buck Studly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune looked up, and through her eyes, Bobby saw that \u201cBuck Studly\u201d was Nicky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky came over to the table, wearing what he no doubt thought was in inviting smile, but which looked more like a leer to Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, ladies\u201d, said Nicky, unsubtly flexing his right arm in front of him, \u201cI hate to see you girls sitting all by yourselves, here. Wouldn\u2019t you like some masculine company?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls looked at one another, and burst into gales of laughter. Nicky walked away, red-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OH. MY. GOD.</i>, thought Bobby.  <i>I always knew that Nicky\u2019s \u201cMr. Smooth\u201d act was cheesy, but I never understood what it was like to be on the receiving end of it, before.  I never thought you could be goofy and creepy at the same time. If I come out of this intact, I\u2019m going to have to have a word with that boy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby knew that Nicky was basically a good guy, but he could understand that girls that didn\u2019t know him like he did wouldn\u2019t know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do <b>I</b> sound like that to girls?</i>, thought Bobby. <i>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that bad, but maybe I am. Is that why Stephanie doesn\u2019t want to go out with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls brushed the encounter off, and continued their conversation. After a while they left the coffee shop, and then went shopping. After that, they went for a late lunch, and did some more shopping. Eventually, it came time to go home. As June rode the bus back to Marla\u2019s house, Bobby thought over the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Those girls are really nice. I had a good time, today. I judged them by their appearance, and I was wrong.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs June re-entered the house, Bobby took control of the body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Marla, it\u2019s Bobby! I\u2019m home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in the kitchen, dear!\u201d, came her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby joined his aunt in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was your day, dear?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a really good time\u201d he said. \u201cMuch better than I thought I would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helped his aunt make supper. Afterwards, they had a pleasant evening together. Marla told him stories about what life was like when magic was common.   Around 10:00 p.m., he found himself yawning.  He went up to his room, put on June\u2019s nightgown, and crawled into the bed.  Today hadn\u2019t been so bad.   Maybe he could enjoy this week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, he woke up as...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He decided not to do it.  His mother placed little Ginny on a table, and checked her diaper. It turned out that she needed a change, so she changed her diaper, and the less said about that the better.   Then she gave her a bottle to feed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just as well</i>, he thought. <i>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m psychologically prepared to deal with the alternative.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA baby\u2019s day turned out to be fairly uninteresting. He picked up a little by listening to conversations around him. He was only about three months old, and his arrival had been a bit of a surprise.  Around 10:00 a.m., Mary McNair, a friend of his mother\u2019s, came by for a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Jeannie, imagine having a baby at your age!\u201d said Mary.  His mother was in her late 40\u2019s.  \u201cYou were lucky you both came through it so well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d, said his mother.  \u201cYou know, Phil and I tried so hard for years to have a baby. The doctors never found anything wrong, but it just never happened for us.  We even thought about adopting, but we never did. Then, one day last summer, I noticed that I was starting to get sick in the mornings. I never imagined it was morning sickness, so when Doctor Osterman told me I was pregnant, I thought he was crazy! My little miracle baby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby thought about this.  He\u2019d been born when his parents had been married for about nine or ten years.  While he\u2019d never really discussed it with his parents, he\u2019d picked up enough over the years to know that they would have liked to have had more kids, but that there were physical \u201cdifficulties\u201d. He wondered again what it would have been like to have had brothers and sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was fairly dull. Being a baby wasn\u2019t really all that intellectually stimulating.  He remembered a character from a movie his dad liked, <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i>.  One of the characters was unhappy because he had an adult\u2019s mind permanently trapped in a baby\u2019s body.   Bobby understood how he felt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the day ended.  It had been a learning experience of sorts, and made him hope he wouldn\u2019t have to be a baby again, even if he wouldn\u2019t remember being a teenager.  In the evening, he dozed. When he woke up again, it was dark, and he was back in the bed at Aunt Marla\u2019s house.  She was sitting in a chair next to the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe only have a few minutes to talk before the next transformation.  So, you were a baby today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby tried to speak, but had difficulty getting his mouth to form the words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to speak\u201d, said Marla. \u201cI can hear your thoughts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby mentally told her about his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting\u201d, said Marla.  \u201cI wonder if you\u2019re following a pattern. You seem to be transforming into other children your parents might have had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby didn\u2019t hear anything else she said, as he soon drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, he woke up as...</span></div></div>",

He was in his own bedroom at home, but it was furnished differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he tried to stand up, he realized that his legs felt funny.

Where are you, sweetie? Come to Mama!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby had a sneaking suspicion that he knew who Mitzi was. He relinquished control of the body,  and sure enough, the dog went running  down the hall, wagging its tail, frantically.    His mother was waiting in the kitchen. She scooped the dog up in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, who\u2019s Mama\u2019s little girl? Who\u2019s Mama\u2019s little girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby winced, inwardly. He was grateful that Nicky wasn\u2019t here to see this: He was now literally a little bitch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to take you outside\u201d, said his mother.  Let\u2019s get you dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dressed?</i>, thought Bobby.  <i>Oh, great, my mom is one of those people who puts clothes on dogs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie put a sweater on Mitzi, and then accompanied her out the back door.  Then she took the dog out into the backyard. Mitzi did her business, which Bobby tried not the think about.  Then Jeannie brought her back into the house, and gave her some breakfast.  The dog food tasted surprisingly good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess those commercials are true</i>, thought Bobby. <i>Dog really do love this stuff!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Bobby took control again and wandered around the house. He looked through all of the rooms that he could get into, but saw no signs that any people besides his parents lived there.  He thought about this for a while.  Marla had theorized that he was transforming into children his parents might have had instead of him. Well, some people thought of their pets as their \u201cchildren\u201d, so he supposed it might still fit the pattern.  His parents had no actual children, so the dog had become their \u201cbaby\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to probe Mitzi\u2019s memories, found them hard to interpret.  She definitely felt affection for his parents, especially for his mother.  She seemed to have had a pretty good life for a dog.   He went downstairs again, and sought out his mother. She was in her home office, working.  She stopped to pet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, little girl, but Mama\u2019s got to work right now. Would you like to go play out in the yard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby wagged Mitzi\u2019s tail, eagerly.   Jeannie let the dog out into the back yard, which was fenced in. She set out a bowl of water, patted Mitzi on the head, then went back inside.  Bobby relinquished control again,  curious to see what the dog would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitzi patrolled the yard, seeming to examine every twig and blade of grass.  Once, she\u2019d taken off like a rocket to chase a squirrel up a tree, barking furiously while it chittered down sciurine abuse.  After a while, she sat down and basked in the sun.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, at least dogs have more interesting lives than babies</i>, thought Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunchtime, Jeannie came outside and sat with Mitzi while she ate.  After lunch, Jeannie played with Mitzi, tossing a ball to her. Then she went back inside to do her afternoon\u2019s work.  Bobby thought about how weird his situation was.  It was a wonder he wasn\u2019t going crazy.  He could only hope that Marla would be able to fix it all.  It was interesting being different people (and a dog), but he wanted to be himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Jeannie brought the dog back into the house for supper.  Soon, Phil, Bobby\u2019s dad, came home. He greeted the dog amiably enough, then sat down to his own supper.  Afterwards, his parents sat down on the living room couch to watch TV, with Mitzi on the couch between them.  Later, Phil put a leash on Mitzi and took her out for a walk.  While they were walking, Phil told Mitzi about things he was concerned about, knowing she would never betray his confidence. Bobby enjoyed this, although he missed being able to talk to his dad man-to-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back, Jeannie took Mitzi\u2019s sweater and collar off and placed her on her doggie bed, patting her for a while before going off to her own bed.  Bobby drifted off, waking briefly when he found himself back at Aunt Marla\u2019s house.  He noticed his aunt looking in on him, but drifted off to sleep again before he could speak to her.  Who \u2013 or what \u2013would he be tomorrow?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he woke up Thursday morning, Bobby was in a darkened bedroom.  He could see enough to tell that he wasn\u2019t in the bedroom in his aunt\u2019s house.  He felt the by now somewhat familiar weight of breasts on his chest. So, he was a girl again! But there was something else, too \u2013 his stomach felt oddly rounded and bulky. Just at that moment, he had a strange sensation, as though something in his stomach had kicked him.  He was pregnant!    The idea that there was someone living inside him was enough to keep him completely weirded out for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the sound of breathing, and realized that there was someone in the bed next to him.   It was too dark to tell who it was, but from the size, it seemed to be a man.  Bobby relaxed his mind, and examined his new form\u2019s memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been born Karen Thomson, daughter of Phil and Jeannie, 25 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Another \u201calternate child\u201d</i>, thought Bobby.  <i>She must have been a \u201choneymoon baby\u201d</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren had a reasonably happy childhood. When she\u2019d hit her teenage years, she\u2019d seemed to have more than her share of \u201cteenage angst\u201d, frequently coming into conflict with her mother, who pressured her to have a career like hers.  In high school, Karen had and fallen in love with Steve O\u2019Halloran, Nicky\u2019s big brother! Karen had eloped with Steve right after she turned 18.  This had caused a rift with her parents, especially her mother.  It wasn\u2019t that her mother objected to Steve as such, she had just wanted them to wait, so Karen could complete her education.  Steve had gone to work as a mechanic at Peterson\u2019s Garage, and they had taken an apartment together. Karen had gotten an office job, but was soon pregnant. The next year, she gave birth to her daughter, Sarah.  Sarah had been followed two years later by their son, Alexander,  and two years after that by their second daughter, Jennifer.  Now, she was six months pregnant with her fourth child.  She\u2019d had various jobs over the last few years, but it had been difficult with one child arriving after another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was doing very well at the garage \u2013 Old Man Peterson liked him a lot \u2013 but money was still tight. But then, one day last year, had come a bolt from the blue.  She had bought a lottery ticket on a whim,  and won a small fortune!  It wasn\u2019t quite enough to set them up for life, but it was enough to change their lives completely.  They were able to pay off the mortgage on their house, and set up college funds for their kids.  Most importantly, Steve was able to buy the garage from Mister Peterson, who was ready to retire, and had no children of his own to pass the business along to.  It had also effected a reconciliation with Karen\u2019s parents.  Jeannie was an accountant, and Phil a businessman.  When they heard the news, both were eager to offer their expertise to Steve and Karen out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren herself helped out with the garage\u2019s paperwork when she could, although taking care of the children ate up a lot of her time, especially this week when school was on vacation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby relinquished control of the body to see what \u201cKaren\u201d would do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over and kissed Steve gently on the cheek.  He muttered but did not wake up.   She lifted herself awkwardly out of the bed. It hadn\u2019t occurred to Bobby how much pregnancy could throw off a woman\u2019s sense of balance.  Her feet felt bloated, too.   Their bedroom had a bathroom attached to it. Karen went into the bathroom and got undressed.   She stopped for a moment to look at herself in the mirror.  To Bobby, she looked a lot like his mother, only her hair was a lighter shade of brown, and was longer, as well.  Fortunately, she didn\u2019t seem to be prone to morning sickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren showered quickly, then threw on a maternity dress and went down to start getting breakfast ready.   Bobby laughed inwardly as the thought suddenly occurred to him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen!  I thought that was a clich\u00e9!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked up as she heard Steve come downstairs, and they had a quiet conversation over breakfast.  It was still ungodly early, and they didn\u2019t want to wake the kids up.  After Steve left for work, she had a little quiet time to herself.   While Karen relaxed, Bobby probed her memories about her kids.   Sarah was six years old and in first grade.  She was a very smart little girl and was already reading at an eighth grade level.  Alex was four, good-natured and full of energy. Jennifer was two, quiet and very thoughtful for a kid her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting a bit, Karen went upstairs and set about waking the children.   Sarah was able to get herself up and dressed, but Alex generally needed some help,  and Jenny needed everything done for her.   Karen got the kids up and dressed, then brought them downstairs and gave them breakfast.   Bobby had never realized how much effort it took to manage children, even three such well-behaved kids as Karen\u2019s were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, she took the kids out food shopping. By the time they got home, it was just about lunchtime.  Just as she was about to start lunch, the doorbell rang.   Karen answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! What are you doing here?  Don\u2019t you have work to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie smiled, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I thought you make like a chance to get off your feet and let Grandma lend a hand. I got most of my day\u2019s work done this morning. Plus I bought my laptop, so I might get a little work in this afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese visits were a regular occurrence, and Karen sat back as her mother took over the making of lunch.  Afterwards, Karen relaxed while Jeannie played with her grandchildren.  Naptime came, and Jeannie opened up her laptop, and started going over the garage\u2019s finances with Karen. Bobby was surprised at how quickly his mother turned from \u201cdoting Grandma\u201d to \u201call business\u201d at a moment\u2019s notice.  He\u2019d never seen this side of her, and was fascinated by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter naptime, Grandma said goodbye to the children and went on her way.  Karen got the kids ready and drove over to visit Betty Fleming, a friend of hers from high school, who had two children the same ages as Sarah and Alex.  While the children played, Karen and Betty talked over old times.  Bobby was astonished at how discreetly raunchy the conversation was. It all sailed far over the children\u2019s heads, but it would have made Bobby blush, if he were in a position to do so.  It was weird to hear people\u2019s moms talking that way.  Still, he supposed that a woman typically didn\u2019t become a mother without knowing about that sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Karen noticed that it was getting late,  and so she gathered up her children, took her leave of Betty, and headed home.    She parked the two older children in front of the TV, and brought Jennifer into the kitchen with her while she prepared supper. Steve came home and the family had their evening meal together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper, she and Steve played with the children for a while, and then it was bath and bedtime.  Once the children were in bed, she and Steve went downstairs to sit and talk for a while. It was only when Karen sat down to relax that Bobby realized how tired and footsore she was.  Steve surprised her by getting down on the floor in front of her and massaging her feet. It felt really good.  Bobby felt weird, like he was intruding on a private moment. Karen drifted off to sleep, and Bobby woke up to find himself back in the bed at Aunt Marla\u2019s house. He looked up and saw her sitting next to the bed.  She seemed to know who he had been that day, even though she hadn\u2019t seen him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you were pregnant for a day?\u201d, she said.  \u201cThat must have been very strange for you.  I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like having someone living inside of you, it\u2019s an experience I\u2019ll never have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby looked at this aunt, thoughtfully. He wanted to learn more about why she\u2019d never had kids, but he felt that this wasn\u2019t really the time.    Instead, he said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never realized how much work it was, looking after kids,  even good kids like Karen\u2019s were.  I feel a lot more grateful to my Mom after seeing that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis aunt smiled at that, and soon, he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up as...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Bobby woke up Friday morning, the first thing he noticed was that he was wearing a frilly, pink nightgown.  He felt smaller, and lighter, somehow.  He was a girl again, although he guessed he was fairly young.  She seemed to have only the beginnings of breasts.   Bobby noticed that her skin was a different color, too, a shade or so darker than what he was used to.  He looked around. He was still in the bedroom in Aunt Marla\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and looked in the mirror.  Looking back was a pretty little Chinese (or at least, Chinese-American) girl, maybe about ten or eleven years old.  It occurred to him that every transformation he\u2019d had this week had been female \u2013 even the dog.  He sat back down on the bed, and probed his new form\u2019s memories.  She was Grace Thomson, and was eleven years old.  Phil and Jeannie had adopted her from China when she was a baby. She had learned that she was adopted when she was fairly young. Bobby supposed that was inevitable when the adopted kid was from a different ethnic background.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace seemed to have led a relatively normal life. She loved and knew that she was loved by her adoptive parents.   She had several good friends and enjoyed the usual things that a girl her age enjoyed.   It hadn\u2019t always been a bed of roses, of course.  In addition to the usual issues that an adopted child had to deal with, she\u2019d had to deal with a certain amount of racism, too.   Bobby was shocked at some of the things people - even adults, who should know better - had said to her or in front of her over the years.  He felt that he had a reasonably clean conscience there \u2013 his parents had brought him up to treat everyone the same, and he honestly couldn\u2019t think of any bad racist remarks he had made.  He hoped he wasn\u2019t just rationalizing there, though, and began second-guessing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace had also had some issues of identity, which would never have occurred to Bobby.  Sometimes it could be hard for her, looking different fr0m everyone she loved.  This was a new concept to Bobby, who looked rather like a younger clone of his father, Phil.   Grace had one close friend of Chinese ancestry,  her classmate Alice Wang.   People who saw them playing together would sometimes mistake them for sisters.  Phil and Jeannie made an effort to get to know Alice\u2019s parents, who helped the Thomsons as they tried to teach Grace something about Chinese culture, so she could know about her ethnic heritage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby relinquished control of the body. Grace got up off the bed, threw on a bathrobe, and then went and showered.  Afterwards, she came back to the room and got dressed.  It turned out that Grace was something of a girly girl, and liked her clothing pink and frilly.  Even her 3DS was pink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow</i>, thought Bobby, <i>She looks like a cross between a princess and a cupcake!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby resumed control of the body and went downstairs to find his aunt preparing breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Aunt Marla\u201d, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla turned and looked at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, don\u2019t you look sweet\u201d, she said,  \u201cI could just eat you up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby drew back in mock terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, witches <i>do</i> eat little children!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t\u201d, not really\u201d, said Marla. \u201cAt least, not anymore\u201d, she added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d, asked Bobby. \u201cHow are your preparations for tonight coming along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell enough\u201d, said Marla.  \u201cI should be done this morning. I was thinking we could spend the afternoon together, maybe go out for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great\u201d, replied Booby. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Bobby relinquished control of Grace\u2019s body, curious to see how she spent her time.  Since she was too young to go down town by herself, she went into the parlor to watch TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Funny how families have \u201cliving rooms\u201d, but  aunts have \u201dparlors\u201d</i>, thought Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace watched one of Aunt Marla\u2019s anime DVD\u2019s. Bobby was amused to find that his aunt, a 400 year old witch, was apparently a <i>Sailor Moon</i> fan!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One \u201cmagical girl\u201d likes another, I guess!</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Marla came in and sat down and watched the end of the DVD with Grace.  Bobby resumed control of Grace\u2019s body, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything ready\u201d?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d, said Marla, \u201cI\u2019m as ready as I\u2019ll ever be.  Now, how about some lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla drove them to a nearby restaurant, where they each had a cheeseburger and fries. Aftewrards, she drove them to Overlook Point, where, as the name suggested, it was possible to get an overview of the whole town. They took in the view for a while, until Marla finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had much time to talk to you this week.  Have you been learning much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I have\u201d, replied Bobby. \u201cI\u2019ve really gotten a different perspective on life.  You know, I\u2019m wish they were real \u2013 I feel like I\u2019ve been introduced to several interesting people \u2013 and a dog \u2013 and then told I could never see them again. I wish they were really part of my family, so I could get to know them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know, you still may end up being one of them. I can\u2019t give a 100% guarantee that I can get you back to the old you again.  Is there any one of them that you especially like? It might be easier to guide you to that form than to try to get your original body back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby thought about it and decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw that picture of you with Nicky and Stephanie.

Are <i>you</i> sure she isn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! She can\u2019t be!\u201d, said Bobby, with more vehemence than he had intended.\u201d  More calmly, he said, \u201cI mean, she doesn\u2019t look or act like a lesbian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know, Bobby\u201d, said Marla, \u201cIn four hundred years, I\u2019ve known a lot of women like that, and most of them didn\u2019t look or act like what you might think.   Are you sure you\u2019re not just afraid that Nicky might be right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u201d, said Bobby reluctantly.  \u201cBut I wish that I could be the one <i>she</i> needs the way she\u2019s the one that <i>I</i> need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, eager to change the subject, he said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Auntie, what would you wish for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding Bobby\u2019s need to talk about something else, Marla sat back and looked thoughtful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mostly have what I want. The only thing I don\u2019t have that I\u2019ve always wanted is children of my own. I\u2019d gladly give up all of my magic to have a nice, normal family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking \u2013 if it\u2019s not too personal\u2026\u201d Bobby hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead\u201d, said Marla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have kids of your own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHybrids between magical and mundane beings, they\u2026they don\u2019t end well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Couldn\u2019t you have adopted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would have been dangerous to have a non-magical child in the house with my magical items.  Plus, any kid I adopted, I would almost certainly outlive them.   As it is, barring accidents, I\u2019ll outlive Joe by a long time.  I hadn\u2019t really thought that through when I married him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, said Bobby.  \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to bring up something sad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright, dear. Anyway, Joe\u2019ll be back tomorrow afternoon, he always cheers me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove back to Marla\u2019s house. Marla sat and watched a DVD together.  Later, they had dinner.  After dinner, Bobby played Parcheesi with his aunt, the way they had when he was little. Eventually, bedtime came.  Bobby changed into Grace\u2019s nightgown, and got into bed.  Marla came into the room, carrying a bag containing various magical potions and implements.  Marla raised her arms and spoke a few words. Bobby\u2019s body instantly went completely numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d, said Marla, \u201cbut I need to make sure that you remain completely still.  Plus, there might be some\u2026disturbing sensations during the night, and I\u2019d rather spare you that. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll wear off shortly after you wake up.  Now, sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby immediately fell into a deep sleep, disturbed only once during the night, when he had a distinct impression of someone screaming in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning he found...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m your mother\u2019s sister for real, now, and this is the only face I\u2019ve ever had. In fact, my life has been re-written so that I never was anything else.  All of my grimoires and potions are gone, and this house was built in 1945!  As far as I can tell, there\u2019s no magic left in the world - not in me, and not in this house.  It all burned itself out last night - the fact that we can remember it is just like a fading echo. By tomorrow, we\u2019ll have forgotten it, too.  But I don\u2019t mind,\u201d and here Marla smiled radiantly, \u201cI have four children: Samuel - aged 17, Janet - aged 15,  Billy \u2013 aged 10, and Miranda \u2013 aged 8.

I guess I\u2019m a \u201cniece\u201d, now.</i>, thought Bobby.  <i>That\u2019ll take some getting used to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby lay on the bed, and thought about his family history, as he remembered it.  His parents, Philip Thomson and Jean Hartford, had been married in late April 1990, and he -  Robert Thomson - had been born in June 1999.  He would be turning 17 in a few months time. He relaxed and let Bobbi\u2019s memories flow into his mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi knew from <i>her</i> family history that Jeannie had become pregnant almost immediately after getting married, and Karen had been born in January of 1991.  Roberta Thomson had come along in June 1999, on the exact same day at the exact same time as Bobby had.  June had been born almost precisely one year after Bobbi.  Grace had been born in August of 2004, although Phil and Jeannie hadn\u2019t brought her home until February of 2015. Virginia, known as \u201cGinny\u201d, had been born in December 2015.   Mitzi the dog had been part of the family for about two years now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi\u2019s early memories were similar to Bobby\u2019s.  She\u2019d met Nicky when they were toddlers, and they had become buddies, and were still, although Bobbi had given Nicky a few \u201csuggestions\u201d about treating women respectfully over the years.  From an early age, Bobbi had not likes \u201cgirly\u201d stuff.  Not that she wanted to be a guy \u2013 she was a girl and was happy to be a girl \u2013 but she never wanted to be \u201cgirly\u201d.  She had no use for frills and bows, and had never wanted to be a princess.  This was much to the chagrin of her older sister Karen,  who went through a phase of wanting to dress her little sister up like a doll.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bobbi got older, she began to realize that she liked girls the way other girls liked boys.  Any doubts she might have had were removed when she got to high school and met Stephanie.  Bobbi fell for her like a ton of bricks, just as Bobby had.   However, where Bobby had been afraid that Stephanie might be a lesbian, Bobbi had been afraid that she wasn\u2019t!  Bobbi had known Stephanie for six months before she worked up the nerve to come out to her.   It had been a clear day. The two had gone for a bike ride to the park. Sitting in a secluded corner,  Bobbi  had struggled to get out the right words, only to have Stephanie come out to her first, and confess that she had a huge crush on Bobbi!  It had been a scene straight out of a <i>yuri</i> manga.  They had been a couple ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi and Stephanie had given one another the moral support to come out to their parents.  Phil had taken it with the equanimity with which he took just about everything.  Jeannie had taken it well, also. Bobbi suspected that the fact that Karen had already begun producing grandchildren probably helped there, too.   Pete and Isabelle Belanger took it well, too. It helped that the Thomsons liked Stephanie, and the Belangers liked Bobbi.  Phil and Jeannie met with Pete and Isabelle to discuss the situation, and the two couples had become good friends.   Their relationship was something of an \u201copen secret\u201d among their friends and schoolmates. Most of them were cool with it.  Nicky claimed to have known all along that it would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had gone so smoothly that, Bobby, reviewing Bobbi\u2019s memories, had to wonder whether it was the effect of the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last week, Bobbi had been hanging out with her cousins and younger sisters, sending Stephanie the occasional longing text message.  Her parents were not in Paris, but instead had taken little Ginny down south to visit Phil\u2019s relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby sighed. So, the spell had granted his other wish as well \u2013 it had made him the person that Stephanie wanted the way he wanted her, only not in the way he would have chosen!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla came back after a while, and Bobby told her what he had learned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange to think that by tomorrow, neither of us will remember that this wasn\u2019t the way it always was\u201d, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably for the best\u201d, said Marla.  \u201cAnyway, why don\u2019t you come down and have some breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK\u201d, said Bobby. \u201cI think I\u2019ll let her have the \u2018reins\u2019. I\u2019m curious to see her interact with her family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou understand that after a few hours, you won\u2019t be able to take the reins back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u201d, he said. \u201cNothing can stop that now. While I\u2019m still \u2018me\u2019, Auntie, I want to tell you that I love you.  You\u2019ve always been everything a guy \u2013 or a girl \u2013 could want in an aunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, too, Bobby, and I will continue to love you, no matter what form you wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two embraced, and Marla left the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby relinquished control of the body, and Bobbi got up and went and showered. While she bathed and then dressed herself, he thought over his current situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It won\u2019t be so bad of a life</i>, he imagined.  <i>I got the girl I wanted, after all!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi threw on a tee-shirt, jeans and sneakers (not that different from what Bobby would have worn), and went downstairs.  June and Grace were still eating breakfast, as were their cousins Janet and Miranda.  Grace looked up as Bobbi came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Big Brother\u201d, she said. (This was her more-or-less affectionate nickname for Bobbi.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, LCP\u201d,  Bobbi said.  (This was short for \u201cLolita Cupcake Princess\u201d, Bobbi\u2019s nickname for Grace.  \u201cC\u2019mere, you,\u201d she continued, grabbing her little sister in a bearhug, and kissing her on the cheek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, get offa me, ya perv!\u201d said Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you know you love it\u201d, said Bobbi, tousling her sister\u2019s hair as she released her. Bobbi smiled across the table at June, who smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019, freak\u201d, they said simultaneously, and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitzi came into the room, barking enthusiastically. Bobbi stooped to pat the dog for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, cousins!\u201d, said Bobbi to Janet and Miranda, before serving herself  a plateful of food, and settling down to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a busy morning in the Vercotti household.    Joe would be arriving home later in the afternoon. Phil, Jeannie and Ginny were due to arrive later that night, and would be coming over tomorrow for a big Sunday dinner, along with the O\u2019Hallorans and Belangers.   There was food and drink to be purchased, and a house to be cleaned.  Children and cousins alike were recruited to help, and Bobbi was busy all morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught up in the activity, Bobby didn\u2019t even notice as his personality was slowly subsumed into Bobbi\u2019s. By the time Bobbi sat down for lunch, the idea that there had even been a separate person called \u201dBobby Thomson\u201d  had begun to seem unreal to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Joe came home around 3:00 p.m.  Everyone stopped working to greet him.  Bobbi had always gotten along well with her uncle, who was a happy, friendly man who loved to talk sports with her. Giuseppe Vercotti was a big, burly man with an honest face and rugged good looks.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joe went upstairs for a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the early evening , they ate supper, which was a loud and raucous occasion.  Afterwards, Bobbi snuck upstairs for a moment to go on-line and check her messages.   There was a brief little love note from Stephanie which she answered, but Stephanie was not currently on-line. By this point, Bobbi had only odd, fading memories of \u201cBobby\u201d.  <i>What a weird dream that was</i>, she thought.  She heard a call from downstairs and went and re-joined her family.    They spent the rest of the evening playing games, which resulted in the usual good humor and occasional near-mayhem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie called around 10:00 p.m. to let everyone know that she, Phil and Ginny had arrived home safely.  Soon afterwards, the children began drifting off to bed.  Bobbi pulled on her ratty green bathrobe and crawled under the covers.  Before drifting off to sleep, she reflected on the fun she\u2019d had with her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They\u2019re all completely nuts, but I love every last one of them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday morning, Bobbi woke up early. She had a brief moment where she thought she\u2019d forgotten something, but it soon passed.   She got up and quietly bathed and got dressed, then went and sat out on the back porch.   In time, she was joined by her uncles, who handed her one of the two mugs of coffee he was holding.  She sipped it gingerly \u2013 you had to be careful, you could raise the dead with Joe\u2019s coffee, he made it so strong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in companionable silence \u2013 Bobbi loved someone that she could just sit quietly with.  Eventually, there was a sound of movement from within the house.  Joe sighed and drained his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be Marla\u201d,  he said.  \u201cWe better go in and help her make breakfast.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi drained her mug and followed him in.  Breakfast was also a raucous affair. Her family just didn\u2019t <i>do</i> quiet meals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Karen arrived around 10:30 to help with preparations, bringing their children, Nicky and Mrs. O\u2019 Halloran, Nicky and Steve\u2019s mother, with them.   When they arrived, Bobbi, June and Grace were straightening up the dining room.  Karen walked in. She was holding Jennifer in her arms and Sarah was following right behind her.  Karen surveyed her sisters, who were dressed in their usual goth, lolita and  tomboy finery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Sarah\u201d, said Karen, \u201cYour aunts are putting on a seminar on how not to dress like a normal girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t all rock maternity wear the way you do, Karen\u201d, said Bobbi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, added June, \u201c\u2019Frumpy\u2019 is an \u2018interesting\u2019 style choice, but it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of us just prefer to look elegant\u201d, said Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well\u201d, said Karen, \u201cMaybe Ginny will know how to dress.\u201d Turning to Sarah, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay with your aunties for a while? I\u2019m sure they\u2019d like to spend some time with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, we would\u201d, said Bobbi.  They all liked Sarah. She was a fun kid.  Nicky came in to say hello shortly afterwards, before going out back to shoot hoops with Bobbi\u2019s cousin Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil, Jeannie and Ginny arrived around noon, and the girls all rushed to greet their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at all my girls\u201d, said Jeannie. \u201cLet\u2019s get a picture of you all together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDutifully, her daughters lined up against the wall.  Karen stood in the middle, holding Ginny in her arms.  June stood to her right, and Grace stood to her left. Bobbi, in her turn, stood to Grace\u2019s left.  Jeannie took the photo using her phone, and showed it to Bobbi afterwards.  Bobbi looked at the photo \u2013 it had come out really well.  They all looked and were smiling \u2013 even the baby. She felt a wave of affection for her sisters.  For all their flaws, she loved them deeply. She couldn\u2019t imagine being an only child. How lonely that would be! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, definitely send me a copy of that\u201d, she said. She would print it out and have it framed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla soon put Bobbi to work in the kitchen. Bobbi didn\u2019t mind. She was a talented cook, if she said so herself, and it was something she enjoyed.    She was alone in the kitchen, wearing an apron and a kerchief and stirring a pot of spaghetti when suddenly, familiar arms gently encircled her waist,  familiar lips kissed her left cheek, and a familiar voice whispered in her ear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love seeing my woman being all domestic, it gets me all\u2026excited.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speaker punctuated this sentence by breathing softly into Bobbi\u2019s left ear.   Bobbi wriggled with pleasure and turned to return Stephanie\u2019s kiss with interest.  Stephanie had just arrived with her parents and sister, and had decided to surprise Bobbi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir reunion was interrupted after a few minutes by an indignant-sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock it off, you horndogs, before you traumatize some poor, innocent child\u201d, said Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi stifled her irritation and replied, \u201cWhy, is there one around here somewhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace ignored this and said, \u201cMom sent me out here to help you with the cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, right</i>, thought Bobbi. <i>Mom sent you out here to play chaperone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, she said, \u201cAlright, then, clean and cut up those potatoes. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ll help\u201d, said Stephanie.  She and Grace sat down and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t get it\u201d, said Grace. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine wanting to play kissyface with either a boy <i>or</i> a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the good news is, you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to\u201d, said Bobbi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may find yourself changing your mind in a few years, though\u201d, said Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno\u201d, said Grace. \u201cI\u2019m very particular, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs well you should be\u201d, said Bobbi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, the whole collection of family and friends gathered for dinner.  Joe proposed a toast. Everyone raised their glasses (the non-pregnant adults drank wine, everyone else drank lemonade):<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo my family and friends: It is so nice to come home and find you all unchanged. You\u2019re still the nicest group of people a man could hope to know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone toasted him in return.    The family had their usual raucous dinner. Afterwards, they socialized while with the clean-up.  Eventually, it came time to go home. As usual, the goodbyes took nearly an hour.    Bobbi managed to steal a private moment with Stephanie to give her a personal \u201cparting gift\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also took a moment to say goodbye to Marla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for putting up with us, Auntie\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I was glad to, dear\u201d, said Marla. \u201cI\u2019m only sorry it was so uneventful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Bobbi was home in her own room in her own house.  After unpacking, she got ready to go back to school the next day.  Fortunately, she had done all of her schoolwork during quiet moments at her aunt\u2019s house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In three months, Karen had another daughter,  Patricia, and three months after that, Marla had another daughter of her own, Josephine.  Bobbi eventually turned her love of cooking into a career as a chef, and Stephanie became a successful graphic artist.  They stayed together, and, while they never had any kids of their own, they were doting aunts to their sisters\u2019 offspring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, many years later, when they were babysitting Grace\u2019s eight year-old daughter, Janice, Stephanie turned to Bobbi and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, do you ever think about what it would have been like if youd\u2019ve had a different life?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:2.0;\">  A ray of sunlight fell across the face of young Bobby, waking \"him\" from his slumber. The sun flooded his open window, signaling that the day had moved on from dawn and had proceeded to full-on daytime. Bobby remembered what his aunt had told him the day before. That he would spend the entire week transforming daily, though to what exactly he would transform into seemed to be an unknowable thing, up to some divine deity.(Or a particularly bored writer.) With this thought, Bobby decided to play a bit of a game. He would close his eyes, walk up to the full-length mirror just across the room, and try to figure out what exactly he had been turned into. Thinking this was a great idea. (And rather interested to see for himself.) Bobby closed his eyes, swung his feet off the coverings of his bed, and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Immediately, Bobby could guess some things about who he had been transformed into. He felt human,(A rather massive relief, if he was being honest.) and from the two weights on his chest and the feeling of nothing between his legs, Bobby could also guess that he was she. \"Great... Again? Am I just supposed to take this as a lesson for some sort of past misdeed? Or is this whole thing really just random and I got unlucky? Whatever, guess I need to see for myself. With a flourish, he opened his eyes to see... Nothing. At least nothing concrete, with only blobs of color being visible. \"I guess I need glasses. I know that Aunt Marla had a pair on the bedside table.\u201d retrieving the glasses, she finally turned to the mirror to see the girl she had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The very first thing she noticed was the long, dark brown hair, flowing down to her shoulders, just covering her chest. He noticed that it had a slightly greasy quality, as if it hadn't been washed in a few days. Her face was an undersized, but well formed, scrunched up in a small smile. Despite her best intentions, he also noticed a few small pimples around the corner of her mouth, and the small, flighty movements her eyes seemed to involuntary make every ten seconds or so. Starting to work her way downward, she next took stock of her chest. If anything, her tits seemed to be slightly larger than they were the day before, (Something Bobby was secretly happy about.) But also hung lower than they did before. Slowly massaging her boobs, she also noticed that they were more filled with fat, seemingly more the result of food and lack of exercise than good genetics. This theory was confirmed by a look at her stomach, as it bulged out, forming a cute little pot belly that was just starting to hang down over the rest of her. \u201cOh, great. So not only do I have to spend the day as a girl, I have to spend the day as a chubby girl. I bet she... I... couldn\u2019t do a single lap on a track.\u201d Deciding to go lower, her thighs just started to touch near her privates, even if she stood with her feet under her shoulders, much to her dismay. Finally deciding to turn around, her eyes drifted down to see her rear end. Seeming to fill out her underwear to a nearly comical (or obscene) degree, Bobby promptly decided that maybe this body wasn't all that bad. She playfully gave her ass a slap, and was surprised by just how much is jiggled. Deciding to slap it harder, she yelped and began to feel a warm tingling feeling in her lower region. \u201cJeez, only that got her..eh..me that aroused? I really must not get action. At all.\u201d Deciding to get dressed for the day, Bobby noted a change from the clothing she had just yesterday. \u201cNot that most of it would fit me now.\u201d Bobby rued softly, lightly patting her belly. The black ensembles had been cast aside in favor of some plain greys, browns, and a few flashes of bright yellow or blue. Even more noteworthy to Bobby was the numerous nerdy catchphrases on the shirts. The catchphrases spanned everything from Star Trek, to anime, to even video games, like Total War and Kingdom Hearts. Glancing around the room, she also noticed that the walls were covered by movie posters, funny quotes, and video game concept art. Video game consoles dominated the TV in the corner, and Bobby could tell that there were at least 2 more handheld consoles on the nightstand beside the bed. \u201cYou know, a girl like this would be great to hang out with. I wonder if I have any friends in the nearby town?\u201d Deciding on a Pokemon shirt and some mercifully stretchy sweatpants, Bobby turned back to the mirror. In it, he saw a surprisingly endearing, chubby little nerd. A sort of \u201cgirl next door\u201d if that next door was a library or Gamestop. With that final thought, Bobby was ready for the day.</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The next part is hard, does he go for a long skirt, protecting his legs like a trouser, or short shorts, whilst being more feminine, they are just shorts. Digging deep he opts for a skirt, picking out a floral skirt which went down to just below his knees. It felt odd, but strangely freeing to the teenaged boy.

So why don't you go wash up while breakfast is being made?\" smiled Aunt Marla, as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that....oh never mind.\" said Bobby, giving up on it for now. He might as well shower up and get out of the nightgown and into some proper clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked up, what happened?</span></div></div>",

It smelled a lot like lilacs and all that, and Bobby seemed to find it soothing to some extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, he turned the warm water on and waited for it to warm up a little more. He stripped his clothes off, putting them neatly on the side. For some reason, those old clothes seemed to disgust him ever so slightly, as if he needed to wear something different. He shrugged it off though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the water was ready and Bobby stepped in. Soon after, he realized that he didn't bring his soap and shampoo with him, but Aunt Marla's were in there with him. He winced a bit at having to use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she doesn't mind this either.\" he said hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed her bar soap and began to wash his body. Like the rest, it also smelled of flowers, and Bobby didn't feel that bad about it. The same happened as he went to the hair shampoo and ran it throughly through his short hair. For some reason, this all felt a bit more soothing than his normal shower felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe this will be a pretty good trip then.\" he smiled to himself as he washed the rest of the soap off and turned the water off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was done, he grabbed a towel, tucking it around his torso. He didn't realize how feminine it was, as he had wrapped the towel around him like like a woman.</span></div></div>",

He walked out of the bathroom and tried to dry himself some more. As he looked around, he saw a cute white bathrobe, and something inside him urged him to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it does look nice.\" said Bobby as he grabbed the bathrobe and put it on, tightening it around his waist.

As he started downstairs, he thought about how he had nothing on underneath the bathrobe.

Bobby started to get confused again. As he thought, he didn't noticed that he had grown a little taller, fitting a little better in the bathrobe in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Bobby entered the kitchen, where Marla was waiting.</span></div></div>",

As they went past C-cup, nearly going into D-cups, a light fabric began covering them. Bobby felt himself inhale a bit, even though he couldn't see what was happening. The fabiric tightened around his breasts, forcing them up a bit and giving him a good amount of cleavage. The material looped around his shoulders and back, connecting in the middle. Before too long, a bright pink bra formed around his impressive bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that time that Bobby stumbled upon a nice yellow bra.

In fact, why did he begin to question it in the first place? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them walked to find a store appropriate for Bobby's request, the road to the end of Bobby's changes was just beginning. Bobby rose a little more in height, now a bit taller than Marla was, and the final set of wrinkles appeared on his face and body, cementing him a person now in middle age.</span></div></div>",

We gotta get our work out of the way so you can join Randy later.\" said Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby still had no idea who this Randy was, but he wanted to see what this was all about. So, he put his shoes on, getting himself ready. He didn't know what to think of how thin he was feeling, although a part of him seemed to prefer it. As he got back up, he took a look at his arms. They looked pretty thin as well, with very little muscle, and appeared very delicate. His hands even looked softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the---\" started Bobby, not sure what to think about his small hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcia, you coming?!\" called Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes!\" responded Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he got back to Emily after saying good bye to Aunt Marla, who wished that he have fun today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked out, Bobby felt another odd feeling.</span></div></div>",

Again you open the cupboard and take a look. These things are all cloth to fit for a woman, a busty woman you determine as you read the label on the bra 36 DD. Well but these the only things you have brought, so you have to wear it. You put on a panty that fit perfectly around and grey sport pants. No you try the bra closing the band and pull the  straps over your shoulders. Of course the cups aren't filled out so it is a way to big.

But wait, you look closer. It's your face but changed. Your nose is smaller and your eyes seems bigger. Gentle wrinkles all around give you a more mature woman look. So not only your face changed, your breasts swell to the same size as Marla's a firm b cup, your butt become more shapely and the waist thinned out become the body of the 35 year old Becky.<br>\r\nAt this moment Marla came with a pink bra for you to wear. As she presage it was a sport bra so you have to go jogging with her. You put the bra and the matching top to your pants on, take your hair in a bun and go out with Marla to the jog. At first the bra done a great job, but after the first mile you feel a upcoming pressure in your breasts. Then Marla says: \u201e After your boob boost you never can go to a jog with me!\u201c You wonder why she saying such a curious thing and concentrate on your breath to eliminate the growing pressure that now begin to hurt. In pain you pleased your aunt to go home fast as possible and in no time you can see her house. Stepping in you headed in the bathroom and take your shirt of. What you now see scares you more that your hole transformation do. Your breasts oozes out of the cups on all sides an the band isn't on body anymore. It's lifted up by the huge mass on your chest now. Slowly you managed to put the bra out.<br>\r\nRed lines marked that these bra is alot to small for your new burden.Then Marla comes in and verify that it wasn't the best idea to go jogging with these very well endowed breasts that Becky is known for. You remember the bra in your room and go to put it on. As you go up the stairs your boobs bounced unpleasant and your manhood is lost in womanhood. Now you put on the bra and it fit perfectly around your identifier.<br>\r\nNow what to do the rest of the day?</span></div></div>",

Firstly, Carl here knows where he can find some grapes for us to squeeze the juice, and Tom the ragamuffin brown and white bastard, can help me and me him to gather the mead needed to cause your body to conform, change, transform, okay?\" Said the black satyr as he waiting for Bobby to reply, said then, \"Oh, and my name is Stud, a proper title given me by my father, praise his soul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hairy hand reached for to take hold of the left hand on Bobby, as the young satyr said, \"I am Carl and your Bobby, oh I can read minds, as satyrs we all gain some magical attribute, and mine is what lets me know early on who is a friend and who are my foes. Now then, come or follow me, we need first to find something to use for collecting the grapes, and then go to picking them, but when you speak, talk softly, as the glade has many listening ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby sat up and then rose to standing, he holding still the hairy, furred hand of Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleet footed walking on cloven hooves, Carl surged far ahead of Bobby as he ran after, trying hard at keeping Carl in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby ran as swift as he could, but not long and Carl had vanished from sight in the tall grasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... oops, huh,\" Bobby said as he was tripped and fell face to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick-like he was grabbed at his elbows by two hard fingered hands and rolled over to looking skyward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by what Bobby saw was a girl satyr, though she was furry from her navel down to cloven hoofs. As from her navel and up she was all female human, but not fully named, as she wore a rather soiled white bra covering her very voluptuous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you going so fast there buddy boy, dare I say you are all human, and that on this focal plane is a rarity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you too, my name is Bobby,\" Bobby heard his voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby, huh, well has I not stopped you from blatantly running through the grassy glade here, you might have met something far more dangerous than me.

Or, if you are of the kind who would prefer becoming as a female, I can help you gain your fond desire here and now!\" Charlene said, as Bobby began to feel as if he were a pawn in a game of chess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but no, as Carl, Tom and... Stud already offered me to become for them as a buck goat. I do not want to become an animal, neither goat, bison, sheep, or anything what eats grass to stay alive!' Bobby said, as then Charlene pushed at him hard, slamming Bobby to the ground, as she leaped to straddle his lap with her naked lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs then from out of the tall grass a blurred body flew, as slammed hard its shoulder, knocking Charlene from where she had sat, to rolling along the ground, she screaming, and using foul language.</font></span></div></div>",

Carl said with a smile, as letting the proverbial cat out of the bag, and informed Bobby of Carl had a satyr sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is near that time again, as a couple of my sister satyrs have begun to act irritable. Dale, that elderly buck, he is about worn out, he gets dry..., well you know the problem. He is old and fat, better for slaughtering and being the center of a feast. Your friend here is very young, and would if transformed, meet our needs for many years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to infect him when you smashed into me..., ow but where you slammed me now hurts, and I might get a blue spot too!\" Charlene said, as Bobby looked and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl took hold of Bobby by the arm and led him a short distance away from Charlene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen to me, she was my sister, but since she became a Satyress, she thinks of men or males as a foe, and does to them what she wishes. At times she becomes brutal, as had I not knocked her on her royal butt, and off from you, she was straddled and prepared to infect you, doing it by vile means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trust you never wished to be a girl, well had Charlene tainted you, infecting you, there was a 50/50 chance that after five sundowns you would look like her, you being female permanently, and if not favored by the Satyress herd, they would continue your changes and make for them a milk goat, a doe goat. Would you like to live the life of a doe goat getting bred by bucks and giving milk for the Satyress herd?\" Carl said as asking of Bobby, the hearing of what Charlene might do to him made a scared boy feel horror struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come then with me and we shall get those grapes,\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, as what Charlene said to me, that from the grapes squeezed you would prepare a drink, a wine what would change me into a male satyr?\" A suspicious Bobby asked of Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl looked Bobby straight in his face and calmly he said, \"If you remember, we three, Tom, Stud, and me, we three told you what to expect might well happen, as being a part of this focal plane you must become as part an animal, or as all an animal. The difference between part and all, is that after five days you could return to where you came from, being there as a satyr before changing back to what you were, as are at present. The other possibility is becoming an animal and it is a 70/30 chance you will remain here as an animal, rather than to return home being an animal for five days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnow this, that of all who came this way and were transformed to being an animal, when they return home as that animal, most tend to return here and stay then an animal. Becoming an animal and returning home, as what we have heard from those returning by choice, their bodies did not revert wholly to being again as human, but they retained a goodly amount of their animals self as a permanent transforming; maybe to remind them they had their chance to stay with us, here on this focal plane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlene,\" Bobby said as if to ask a question of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Bobby, Carl my real brother is correct about what I was planning to make use of you, as my herd has need of a young stud buck, and you would do nicely!\" Charlene said, as she said her piece as if embarrassed for having tried to doom Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" asked Carl, \"Your facial expression, and what I see forming in your thoughts, really, what Charlene offered as planned to do to you thrills you, I am stunned!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby, is he telling the truth, you would prefer coming with me, as well become a stud buck goat to keep my herd friends feeling happy?\"  Charlene said, she acting as surprised and her body stiffening, nipples puckering, tenting her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure, but what you offered does thrill me, yet I would like it better to be in a modern world and not as a common beast, either here or back there, the whole of what either of you offered is a fun fantasy thrill to me.\" Bobby admitting, he backing away from Carl, coming to standing directly between Charlene and her brother.</font></span></div></div>",

As he laid there still snug as a bug in a rug, all warm to his toes, he noticed a yuck-o taste in his mouth.His tongue began some searching, it plucking free warn he thought was tapioca pudding pearls, but he had no memory of having eaten tapioca pudding for the past few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, his tongue discovered his entire mouth, between his teeth, snugged about his gums, and caked on the roof of his mouth was a layer of some creamy slime what tasted salty. The flavor alone helped Bob to decide, he thought to get out of his warm bed and go brush his teeth, and make use of some mouthwash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA righted flipping of the warm bed covering from it cloaking him so warmly, he sat up and swung his legs off the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden like, Bob knew his dream has a basis upon some factual reality. His legs were not the same legs and feet he had come there to stay at Auntie Maria's. Firstly, he discovered he was in bed but not wearing a stitch of clothing, though he felt like he was as dressed. There, hung off the left side of the bed were a pair of furred goat legs of much larger size than what Bob ever saw a goat to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs were his legs furry, his feet were much longer, as narrowed, being furred over, his heels being then as hind leg hocks, and his toes were cloven hoofs as big as might be a horse's hoof. His physically not wearing a stitch of clothing, the pajamas he wore when going to bed were as gone. Bob then combed his fingers through the curly locks of goat fur grown along his thighs, as he noticed the sheer size of his scrotum having swelled, his testes similar in size to a pair of Papaya fruits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Oh wow,\"</i></b> Bob muttered, he seeing the fur covered big balls, as cupped his hands to holding one in each hand, taking note to the bulk and their weightiness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Bob noted the absence of his male ember not being then near or there, as associated with his huge scrotum. a padding feeling around his groin and he noted inside his groin what felt like a hard tube. He fingered at the tube, trailing along it to discover he had then the belly mounted sheath similar to those owned by Billy goats. His sheath protruded from his belly about three inches below where was his furry navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the goat fur had spread to cover Bob all over his torso. He recalled Tom and Carl, as their goat fur ceased about their navels. Stud, the other as older and bigger satyr, his black fur covered him from head to hooves, he looked more like a whole male goat than did his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob continued to check as feel, combing his fingers through the dense body fur, and coming to his arms, he felt the fur thinning, it not as dense or as shaggy. His previously formed arms were stronger, he had begun lifting barbell weights when he turned twelve. His broader shoulders had stayed the same, but his arms looked daintily in comparison to what he knew they looked as the day before arriving at Aunt Maria's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new pelt of goat fur ceased there as it encircled the base of his neck, as his whole head felt normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, cautiously, Bob boosted himself from sitting on the bed to then standing upright like as did Tom, Carl, and Stud the satyrs in his vivid dream. Bob lifted first his right leg and took a long stride step, as then stepped forward his left leg, gaining a strange as new style of walking, doing so using legs of an animal, he felt oddly appreciating as he stomped his hoofs on the bedroom parquet hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, yes, I can walk and maybe learn to run as fast as did Carl,\"</i> Bob said, he admiring his goat gait of the new walking style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened just then that the closed bedroom door was swung open, and caused Bob to turn, to him seeing as standing in the doorway, was a voluptuous female Satyress, it was Charlene. Bob's eyes widened with both surprise at seeing her again, as seeing her being as he vividly recalled she was, a sexy, womanly female satyr, a Satyress as her title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><i>\"Good morning..., there stud, you do resemble Stud our herd-sire buck goat, except you are not all a male goat, but a overly furry satyr. Oh my, but you are endowed with big goat balls, I might like for you to try them out with me later, but for now, Auntie Maria had me come here to welcome you to having breakfast with us.\"</i></span> Charlene said, as she stood smiling at Bob, while taking visual notations of his goat-like physique.</font>  </span></div></div>",

Every day of the five days he is staying there, Bobby finds that he has transformed into something else, be it an animal, or an age transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow Bobby transforms is entriely up to you. He can transform slowly through the day, or wake up with his transformation complete. He can transform physically, or only have his perception of him by others changed. (For example, you can have Bobby physically become a baby, or have him keep his teenage body and have everyone think that he is a baby.) You can also choose how Marla reacts to the transformation. She can be shocked, the one who made the transformation happen, or beleive that you are supposed to be this way. This is all entirely up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suggest that you give people the option to choose other reactions and transformation types so that they can play this story however they want, but you do not have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are some rules you must follow, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- There can only be one transformation a day. Bobby cannot transform again in the middle of the day unless it involves a slow, singluar transformation. Once Bobby falls asleep at night, he must begin a different transformation when he wakes up.<br>\r\n- If a chapter line goes through five different transformations, the story must end with Bobby returned to somewhat normality<br>\r\n- Different age transformations count as different transformations. One day can be middle aged, one can be elderly, and one can be younger, and that is three days of the story.<br>\r\n- Swearing is allowed, but don't fill your chapters with them.<br>\r\n- No Sex<br>\r\n- No Death.</td>",
