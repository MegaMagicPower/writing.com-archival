If you don't like these choices then you have the pleasure of inserting your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Megan<br>\r\nTwo smoking hot blondes, 5'10 and 5'8 who appear to be coming to the theme park in search of a good time for a week, but instead are trying to uncover the truths behind this place for their fist major story! Claire is more loose than the two, always looking to have fun and do different things. Megan on the other hand is somewhat strict and a fitness nut. She lives to stay in shape and tries to exercise every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrie<br>\r\nThe ghetto girl from the big city who has been sneaking into the Fatusement Resort for over a week and has been able to leave without gaining a single pound! She lives to steal and swindle others, but who knows whenever her luck will run out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy and Kim<br>\r\nTwo theatre performers who stay at the Resort for a month to audition for the many Fat themed plays they have here. They're both in it for the lead roles, but only one can be chosen.<br>\r\nCindy is tall, spanaird, and a bit on the snippy side. She has a good figure with the exception of her slight paunch on her stomach and noticeably big ass.  Kim is a quite woman, who's short with thick legs and an ass much bigger than Cindy's, but she more cheerful and experimental<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Look, this is the funnest place around and while I'm here I'm going to enjoy what I can. Besides, those tickets were expansive.\" Megan folded her arms, \"Fine, if I get the big scoop then I'll take all the credit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire finished applying her sunscreen and left to explore the resort, \"See ya, later kill joy.\" The door closed, Megan sighed and brought out all of her survey lance equipment. Cameras upon Cameras upon Cameras were unloaded from the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked outside, it was a nice, beautiful day to be at a resort. She saw the people playing, eating, and enjoying themselves, \"The job comes first.\" Megan booted up her laptop and inserted the CamPro software in the CD tray, \"Come on. Lets hurry.\" A window popped up on the screen and read that installation would take about 8 hours, Megan huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess there's nothing to do except wait.\" Megan thought.

Fine, I'll.....take 3 of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I order that?\" Megan slammed down the phone. Someone she had been goaded into ordered 3 Fatuesment's park's biggest burgers.

There's no history, no known owner, and most of the employees are hired on the spot by a machine. Weird, right? Anyways, all anyone knows is that the Fatusement park is where delicious food and fun come together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the way that the story works is that someone, either fat or skinny, comes into the park only to leave larger than they were. Research data has shown that they average consumer has gained at least 30 pounds during their stay. It really doesn't matter how long the duration, whether it be staying for a day or delivering a package, there will always be some form of weight gain. At least, that's according to the Fatusement policy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters can gain wether for even the most mundane reasons. For example, Anne enters the elevator and presses the button for the top floor. As the elevator slowly rises, so does her weight. Stepping out on the 80th floor Anne felt entirely different. Her stomach thickened, widened, and expanded. Making her shirt ride upwards and creating love handles that slightly spilled from the sides. It became nice and round, resting on the waist of her pants. Etc....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeja fastened herself into the roller coaster, \"Fatty's Fumble? That's a hella weird name\". She looked around and noticed that the seats were made for either much more people than one or really large riders. \"Good thing I'm the only one here. more fun for me!\" She rested back waiting for the ride to start.<br>\r\nSuddenly steam decompressed from the sides and the gears started to move, \"Here we go!\" The ride sped through many rickety twists and turns, Deja held her hands up high, feeling the wind flow through her hair, \"Uh, oh here comes a drop!\" Down below she could see something resembling sugary snack cakes in a troth. The ride swooped downward, only to suddenly stop and fill the remain ain't space with those treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea as to why this happened but, \"Hey. Free food.\" She instantly dug into the morsels, biting into every pie, eating every cupcake, and devouring each chocolate. She knew eating like this would catch up to her later on, but when would this happen again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeja felt her shirt and shorts tighten, \"What happe-! Oh!\" She saw her belly push towards the front of her shirt and her thighs much thicker than usual. Nearly filling the leg holes of her shorts, \"Okay, now this place is rea-\" A camera flashed, capturing her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we get to the rules let's get to know the locations in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Central Plaza</u></b><br>\r\nUsually, the first place where the character(s) begin their story. The bright brick road paves the way for the rest of the park Located inside the plaza are a pretzel stand with massive portions, vending machines, a water fountain filled with strange coins, clothing store with hidden properties, and a delightful candy store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Fatlantis</b></u><br>\r\nBasically, it's right there in the title. 'Fatlantis', is much more than just a pun like the 'Fatusement' Park. It's a place where the patrons can swim and forget all about their troubles. Just don't go into the deep end or eat at the concession stand. It may cause bloating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The 5 Star *sigh* Fatel</b></u><br>\r\nRecently titled the fanciest hotel in all of the US. The Fatel provides to all of the guest's petty needs. No matter how tedious or unnecessary the task seems, the staff is always at the ready. Usually, the guests tend to become gluttonous and lazy if the stay around too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Fatusement Theme Park</b></u><br>\r\nNow here is where all of the real fun is. Rollercoasters, joy rides, slow rides, and carnival games. All hosted here at the theme park. This is the true attraction to the Fatusement Park. The patrons don't even care how big they're getting, cause they're having too much fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Theatre District</b></u><br>\r\nThis is where all of the shows take place. The latest movies and the best productions are only found here! Inside the theatre seat extra large seats for the bigger audiences because the audience tends to grow with the unhealthy, buttery, snack foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*More Locations to come*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now that that is established. Let's get to the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale WG only (sorry girls and some guys)<br>\r\nNo one under the age of 18.<br>\r\nCelebrities and people alike are allowed<br>\r\nBlueberry, Weight Loss, Water inflation, breast/butt/hourglass, air inflation is allowed in this story (Along with Weight Gain, duh)<br>\r\nNothing involving toilettes or grossing out.<br>\r\nNo in depth sex.<br>\r\nLight slob is allowed (smell, drool, IQ drop) no farting or anything like that. Although, belching is completely fine.<br>\r\nAlso, any effect is the story can be reversed. So someone can go from fat to skinny and hen I've on to any other form of expansion.<br>\r\nYou can create more locations and areas as the story moves along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! Enjoy the interactive!</td>",
