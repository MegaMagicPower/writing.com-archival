A few trees covered in creepers stood high above the tall grass, but there was enough open space so as not to obstruct the crowd\u2019s view. The grass tipped in a fluffy, almost feathery head that tickled as her hands as she pushed through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, her hands were the only thing beneath her shoulders that were exposed, which was more than could be said for her opponent. Ashley was already snickering as the grass brushed against here sides and midriff where her jeans and jacket didn\u2019t quite protect. She didn\u2019t mind admitting she was panicking about this round. If she was laughing before she\u2019d met her opponent that how much worse would it be when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she was fighting a smaller girl. Who looked a few years younger. Oh thank god. Sure the grass was gonna tickle like hell, but she\u2019d got this- she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd began murmuring in anticipation as Ashley and Rebecca drew close, neither eager to attack first just in case it was an illusion. Neither were voracious ticklers looking to break the other into submission, but as Ashley grew closer an evil look must\u2019ve crossed her face. Rebecca\u2019s resolve faltered as she realized that this was another battle she probably wasn\u2019t going to win. All she could do was lessen the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d She whispered, so the crowd couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cI\u2019m only here because they kidnapped my brother.

Her search for employment one day saw her desperate enough to try seeking work in the castle of Queen Catherine herself who took her in as her \u2018personal entertainer\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer juggling and making a fool of herself, Arya quickly found herself in a guarded world of court intrigue and secrets. As royal tickler her duties saw her in the court, in the Queen\u2019s private chambers and in the dungeon. Unfortunately for her she had an unlucky encounter with a tickle dragon, the saliva of which increases the sensitivity of any skin it touches. And a lot touched her- all over. Once only moderately ticklish, Arya is now insanely ticklish to the slightest touch all over her body in a traditional garb that protects nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so Arya\u2019s role as royal tickler is not merely ceremonial- she is skillfully gifted in the art of tickling and possesses a natural command of anybody she lays her fingers on. She can dish it out like the best and would be able to take it too if it weren\u2019t for that infernal tickle dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrown into the tickle tournament to prove her worth, Arya must now prove herself in order to keep her job- and not fall down the food chain.</span></div></div>",

The two paused, eyeing each other from about ten feet apart. Jassaya straightened herself up, standing tall on her tail and stretching. \u201cGirl, do you really think you have a chance against someone like me?

The standoff ended as Arya leaped at Jassaya, surprising the naga. Coming in low, she reached out quickly to skitter her fingers up the snake-woman\u2019s side with curling, squeezing motions. Jassaya hissed and flinched away from the tickle, reaching out with a hand to bat the lithe woman away. Arya backed away quickly, staying out of reach of Jassaya\u2019s grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a quick little tickle, but it had been important. That hiss and flinch was an unmistakable reaction: the naga was ticklish. And if she was ticklish, it was just a matter of finding the rights spots and methods to make her weak with hysterical laughter. Just the task for the Royal Tickler of Coninze\u2026 \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Is the big snake monster just a little bit\u2026 <i>ticklish?</i>\u201d Arya taunted the other woman, becoming a bit more confident. Jassaya hissed angrily and moved forward, reaching an arm out to grab at Arya. But Arya dodged, ducking under the arm and darting her hand into the naga\u2019s armpit, skittering quickly with her fingernails. \u201cWhat about here? Ticklish under here?\u201d Arya teased, putting all her skills into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNahahaha! Gehehet out of thehere!\u201d Jassaya giggled, retreating backwards and bringing down her arm. Her eyes narrowed as she looked at the human girl with more respect now, having underestimated her before. \u201cSss\u2026 I\u2019ll teach you to treat a princess with more respect, girl!\u201d Jassaya said threateningly, but a ticklish grin was still slightly visible on her lips, and the naga could still feel phantom fingernails gliding across the smooth hollows of her underarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny, I get commanded to do this sort of thing for royalty all the time!\u201d Arya replied, a more confident grin on her own face. She had a strategy now, and as long as she was careful, she could wear down the naga enough to get some real tickling in. Clearly she had discovered at least one good spot. Her sides had reacted to that quick little tickle quite well, and the underarm tickling had easily gotten some giggles. Maybe those weren\u2019t even her weakest spots? Arya knew as well as anyone that strength did you no good when your muscles are turned to jelly from overwhelming tickles. Arya dashed in once more, this time reaching for Jassaya\u2019s ribs and squeezing with both hands. But the naga\u2019s tail moved quicker than she expected, trying to wrap around Arya from behind! She saw the movement out of the corner of her eye, rolling away to safety in the nick of time. Arya panted from the burst of adrenaline at the near miss, noting to herself that those ribs seemed to be a less receptive spot to target. Still, Arya put on a brave face. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before I find all your weak spots, you know. You might as well just step into my hands now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSsss! Insolent woman, its only a matter of time before you fall into my grasp!\u201d Jassaya said. She appeared confident still, but the quick tickles made her more cautious, as she eyed the human, debating whether to be defensive or try to close the distance between them. For her part, Arya was getting bolder, and eyeing the naga for her next opening.</span></div></div>",

She just needed an opening to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Fall into your grasp?\u201d She scoffs, placing one hand on her hip. \u201cBy that point we\u2019ll both be old and frail.\u201d Her taunt earned her an angry hiss that only caused the grin on her lips to grow. \u201cHonestly, I expected a challenge at least. They send me to fight a naga princess and I find a listless slug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJassaya hissed again in anger. How dare this woman, a mere human no less, turn her, Princess Jassaya IV, into a laughing stock and mock her in this way? Enraged she reared back, drawing herself up to her full height and towering above Arya before pouncing forward with a speed that shouldn\u2019t have come so easily from a creature of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the princess Arya had been anticipating an angry attack just like that. Even so it was only by a fraction of an inch that she managed to dive under the four outstretched hands that would\u2019ve immobilized her if they caught hold of any part of her body. Landing outstretched in the sand, Arya pushed herself up before the naga could turn around to correct her overshoot. Thinking fast, but acting faster she swung a leg over Jassaya\u2019s tail, straddling her scaly body just behind her human torso. From here, Arya knew, she could wreak all sorts of havoc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting and writhing, Jassaya fought to shake the royal tickler off her body. Before she lost her balance though, Arya wrapped her arms around the naga\u2019s ribcage- left hand to right side, right hand to left side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you human!\u201d Jassaya growled, venom dripping from her words in more than a figurative sense. \u201cI am not some mount to be ri-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya had an idea of what the princess was about to say, but decided her breath was better spent laughing than threatening. Without further delay she dug her fingers into the naga\u2019s sides. The reaction was instant and to her horror, Jassaya realized this was no quick, glancing tickle. As Arya readjusted to enter her lower right armpit and wriggled her fingers over ticklish flesh, the mighty princess through back her head in screamed with ticklish laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter princess? Is a little human too much for you to handle?\u201d Arya grinned as both hands entered her hollows, stroking incessantly the sensitive skin. The naga\u2019s armpits were definitely her most ticklish spot, more so than her ribs. And Arya had four of them to explore- a worthy task for the royal tickler of Coninze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her twisting and tickle-induced spasms, Jassaya couldn\u2019t throw off the little human on her back. In desperation she locked her arms against her sides in an effort to entrap her hands, but only succeeded in giving Arya an extra handhold on her body. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen! She was Princess Jassaya IV, protector of the kingdom and future queen. A little human was not supposed to beat her in a fight and shame her in front of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then coherent thought left her as one of Arya\u2019s hands danced a ticklish path across her belly, before twirling into her belly-button. A hissing, hysterical laugh erupted from her lips as Arya wriggled her finger around inside the spot that had reduced her to an incoherent wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya too knew that she\u2019d found the spot. You didn\u2019t need to be a professional tickler to figure it out and she knew that if she kept this up, Jassaya would be out sooner than she\u2019d bet on. The naga swiped pitifully behind her, not quite flexible to reach her body and she responded back digging and wriggling the fingers of the left hand around her navel as her right, still pinned, wriggled around in her armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry princess. But you\u2019re too slow and too ticklish.\u201d She teased. She didn\u2019t expect a coherent reply back and she didn\u2019t get one as she continued to press home the advantage, shifting her legs to readjust her position-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd instantly gasping as Jassaya\u2019s tail coiled tightly around her leg.</span></div></div>",

While the naga wasn't able to reach backwards with her four arms to reach the nimble human, she still had a long tail capable of wrapping around a limb brought within its grasp. And even despite Jassaya's hysterical laughter and wriggling, she was still coherant enough to use her appendage effectively. As Arya shifted slightly lower on the naga's body, Jassaya took full advantage, reaching up with the tip of her tail to coil around Arya's ankle and calf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya gasped as she found herself forcefully yanked off her perch, swinging around in the air. With a yelp she was spun around, the tail lifting high and brought in front of the naga. Now the royal tickler was hanging upside down, Jassaya's tail now coiling tightly around both the woman's lower legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJassaya, still a little giggly from the earlier tickling, tried to regain her composure, looking down on her now vulnerable opponent. \"Hsshshshs-hehehe\u2026 rrr!\" Jassaya shook her head, finally able to stop giggling, although the giddy smile remained on her face. \"I'll teach you the consequences of touching a naga princess without permission! Let's see how you take to being my plaything\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya tried to struggle free, but quickly found her wrists grabbed by Jassaya's lower arms, pulling her downward. All Arya could do now was squirm in place, pulled taut and fully exposed before the vengeful serpent. Jassaya reached out with her upper arms, bringing them to Arya's knees, which were just at the princess's eye level. Her nails began to teasingly dance down Arya's thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya instantly gasped and tried to hold in the building laughter. But those nails were perfectly manicured, the touch well tuned to be just soft enough, just forceful enough to be completely ticklish. And the Coninzian royal tickler was nothing if not completely ticklish. Her resistance lasting no more than a moment, she burst into girlish giggles, unable to hold in her reaction farther than those nails reaching mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a ticklish spot already? I wonder just how ticklish you are, pretty little thing. I think I'll take my time finding out\u2026 it looks like you'll be hanging around for a while\u2026\" Jassaya teased, as her nails softly wiggled to Arya's upper thigh, getting a squeal of laughter as a result. The nails zig-zagged back down (or up? It was so hard to tell when you\u2019re upside down) the smooth hairless thighs back towards Arya\u2019s knees. The tickling was slower than it could have been, with Jassaya confident in her position and wanting to drag out her revenge on the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd through her giggling, Arya\u2019s mind was racing. Trying to focus despite how ticklish it felt to have those nails glide up and down her thighs took more than a little effort! Her ankles were gripped tightly in those snake coils, feeling like a solid wall of muscle. Meanwhile her wrists her held tightly by two strong hands, and in her ticklish state she was in no position to muscle her way free. All she seemed to be capable of doing was wiggling back and forth in the naga\u2019s grasp, hanging there like the princess\u2019s tickle toy. Through her laughter, she noticed she was hanging directly infront of the naga\u2019s smooth, taut tummy. Knowing just how ticklish that skin was made it even worse. Her bellybutton was only inches away! But she couldn\u2019t reach out to scribble over those sensitive sides, the soft ticklish skin of her tummy, to twirl a fingernail in that deliciously sensitive navel, to squeeze at those alluring hips swaying contentedly as Jassaya played with her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTickling was filling the royal tickler\u2019s mind, but it was increasingly about the electric feeling of nails exploring her legs rather than inflicting it on her opponent. Jassaya had found that quick little scritches up and down Arya\u2019s inner thighs produced the most delightful laughter, the royal tickler breaking down into rapid, high pitched giggles. What had seemed like a quick victory was looking like it might be shifting into a quick defeat, and Jassaya wasn't going to stop now...</span></div></div>",

Maybe Aezvia just wants to watch Bridgette squirm and beg and suffer under the tickling fingers of the whole world... or maybe she wants to test the powers she's bestowed on her newest acolyte!</span></div></div>",

Each syllable was a complex oral exercise, and each had to be pronounced perfectly, or who knows WHAT the consequences could be?! Bridgette really wasn't much of a combative person at all, but the Naga's taunting snapped her into reality quickly: if those slithereen coils wrapped the smaller girl up, then the Naga may never have to stop tickling and teasing her! A nightmarish image in her mind of her arms coiled overheard, accompanied by an imaginary feeling of the cold breeze on her tender armpits, drove Bridgette through her chant, a plea of assistance from Aezvia, as Jassaya came closer to making that nightmare a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last syllable passed Bridgette's soft lips, and black tendrils materialized nearly instantaneously in midair, seeming to just flow into existence at some point, which shoot to envelop Jassaya! The thin wiry tendrils wrap themselves around the Naga's wrists, forearms, and elbows, stopping her fingers just inches from the redhead's defenseless tummy. More tendrils come in short order, coiling themselves around Jassaya's body, even her forehead, and her long tail, and in one sweeping motion they all pull her back upon a wall of darkness that materialized. Her arms are enveloped, as is her tail, leaving only her horrendously sensitive torso exposed. The tendrils all began to shift slightly as Bridgette sighed in relief and takes a few steps forward, getting into position almost right on top of the Naga's human half, held completely immobile against the wall. Her relief soon gave way to irritation as her nails took position atop her prey's underarms, and she leaned in to the Princess's immobile ear and said \"You may as well step into my coils now!\" in a stage whisper for the audience, and let her nails start tracing up and down the skin above her armpits, building anticipation. Jassaya's determined eyes, if watched carefully, would show a flash of concern...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette had, at Aezvia's advising, become rather practiced with her fingerwork. Leading up to this tournament, she even took to using her powers to kidnap and tickle people to tears and begging and beyond as a form of training. While she's fairly new to breaking the strongest of wills with only tickling, she is far from incapable. Her nails continued their teasing stroking and seamlessly transitioned into tickle torturing her ensnared prey's pits, using her first two fingers to tap out a figure-8 on the smooth hollows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHUUMAHAHAHAN!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! ILLGEHEHEHETYOUHUHUHUSOOHOHOON!!!\" Jassaya threatened through her laughter.<br>\r\n\"Princess, that's a very naughty thing for you to say! Naughty little girls like you get punished for threatening me!\" Bridgette shot back, while her other fingers joined in, stroking and wiggling in the smooth underarms. \"I'm going to make you beg me to let you apologize for those nasty threats you made to me!\"<br>\r\nBridgette was giggling along with her opponent as she kept the armpit tickling up, teasing Jassaya so the crowd could hear, hoping for a quick win. However, she was so caught up in the Naga's beautiful laughter that she didn't quite remember that at the very end of her incantation, she had a slip of the tongue as she yelped in fear. Unintended consequences are sure to follow...</span></div></div>",

Her arms were stretched out and pulled taut by the tentacles, completely exposing her underarms to even the gentlest tickling. The skin there was silky smooth and wonderfully responsive to the soft stroking of fingernails. The naga laughed unreservedly, unable to hold back loud giggles as Bridgette explored every millimeter of the vulnerable spot with her nails, teasing with an experienced touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the occultist was so focused on tickling her beautiful opponent that she became completely unaware of her surroundings. More black tendrils appeared out of the ether, this time grabbing Bridgette in the same way they had retrained Jassaya. \u201cAh! What the-!\u201d Bridgette yelped as the strong appendages pulled her off the vulnerable naga, pulling her onto her own black wall. Tentacles restrained all her limbs, leaving the two restrained and eyeing each other with some frustration. Bridgette realized that she had bungled the ending of her spell, and the tendrils weren\u2019t given a target, just a purpose: restraint. And they had done so on anything in the vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph! Some bumbling witch you are!\u201d Jassaya sneered, after a long moment of recovering from the lingering feeling of tickles under her arms. \u201cJust wait until I get out of this, then I\u2019ll teach you a lesson!\u201d Bridgette looked on in increasing concern as the naga pulled at the tendrils. At first this seemed to be futile, but the naga was quite strong, and Bridgette saw the tendrils stretching and giving under the strain of Jassaya\u2019s powerful tail and arms. Bridgette tried her best to tug her own way out, but she wasn\u2019t nearly as strong. There was no way she\u2019d be able to break free before the naga could. And she didn\u2019t have much time, those tendrils were bring strained to the breaking point now that Jassaya wasn\u2019t being distracted by being tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette realized she\u2019d have to magic her way out of this one. But how? She could undo the spell, putting both combatants back at square one\u2026 which still left her at a disadvantage. Could she replace the spell with something? There was no time to think, the growling naga tensing and pulling free, and so Bridgette began another chant...</span></div></div>",

So smooth and tender!\"<br>\r\n\"There's another one! I'm almost there!\"<br>\r\n\"I can almost feel your armpits under my fingers! Can you feel it too?

Jassaya, being a Naga, didn't really fall down at all. Bridgette was not so lucky. Jassaya hissed and lunged for Bridgette, who let out a fearful squeak and started to scamper away. Jassaya missed her prey's ankle, but wound up scraping her nails up Bridgette's nylon-clad feet, elicited a couple of cute giggles from the girl. Jassaya grinned as Bridgette, eyes widened in fear behind her tiny glasses, pushed herself away fearfully on the ground. Once the Princess gets a grip on Bridgette, it could well be a round spent getting tickle tortured to the brink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette suddenly bumped her back into a pillar, and realized that there was nowhere for her to back up to.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Bridgette chanted quickly, arcane words spilling out of her as fast as she could mouth them. Without even thinking, she had called out the shortest spell she knew. And the moment she finished, a bright flash throughout the arena made Jassaya stop in her tracks. The naga was close enough now to lunge at her prey, wrapping her in coils with four hands to tickle her into oblivion. But the princess knew something had happened, and was cautious\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flash died down, there seemed to be several black balls hanging in the air, about the size of a bumblebee. The fluffy looking spheres seemed to hum and buzz with some kind of strange energy. And then Bridgette realized with a sense of dread what she had done: she had summoned tickle wisps. And she definitely hadn\u2019t had time to assign them a target. The little monsters were free to do whatever they wanted. And whatever they wanted was to hone in on any ticklish flesh in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving with impressive speed, the wisps darted at the two combatants, dividing themselves into roughly equal number. Given her size, Jassaya seemed to draw a few more, attracted to the taller expanse of ticklish skin. The little wisps zipped in, nestling themselves against bare skin and vibrating with a wavelength that seemed perfectly tuned to tickle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette had only a second to prepare, and brought her arms down tightly and wrapped them around her chest. But she couldn\u2019t protect herself fully, and a pair of wisps attached themselves to her sides, rolling up and down her bare skin in a way that made her gasp and wiggle side to side in a futile attempt to escape their touch. Another honed in on her bellybutton, and jiggled inside, seeming to roll around in the little space in tight circles. Still two more found their way underneath Bridgette\u2019s top. While most of her chest was carefully guarded by her arms, the smooth undersides of her breasts were vulnerable, and the wisps eagerly rubbed up against them, brushing and humming. Bridgette squealed in loud laughter and fell to the ground, rolling around but not daring to move her arms lest the wisps find even more ticklish spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJassaya was in just as much trouble. Four tickling hands were a strength, but four ticklish underarms were a vulnerability, one that attracted four wisps to an underarm each. Jassaya hissed in surprise and tried not to laugh\u2026 but the feeling of being tickled in four underarms at once is not something easily resisted, and Jassaya writhed and burst into girlish giggles. For a large monster, the way she curled and giggled and tried to swat at the speedy little things was actually quite cute, if Bridgette had had the ability to observe such things. Two more wisps played with the sides of the naga\u2019s breasts not covered by her black bikini garment, fuzzily rubbing up and down. Jassaya didn\u2019t seem to know what to do, unable to bat the little wisps away, but unable to protect herself now that they were firmly nestled under her arms. Clamping her arms down only made the situation worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette, squirming on the ground and trying to laugh as little as possible, knew she couldn\u2019t possibly cast a spell while tickled like this. But she knew the wisps desired the most ticklish places above all else. If she could just hold out and convince the things that Jassaya was more fun to play with, they\u2019d eventually leave her alone and focus on the big ticklish snake monster. But, if those wisps found their way to her underarms, and the rest of her ticklish chest\u2026 then they might be convinced she was the better tickle toy. She had to try her hardest to appear less ticklish, and keep her worst spots protected!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bridgette did her best to keep her arms clamped down, she really, truly did. She knew that the moment her cursedly ticklish armpits caught the attention of the little demons, they would decide that she was the one worth playing with and tickle her into exhaustion... and she <br>\r\nhad no clue what would happen after that! More wasps slowly seemed to come from the ether; they seemed rather evenly drawn to both contestants, but Bridgette was closer to their source and was getting the worst of it as a pair of them found her nylon clad soles almost instantly, throwing her into an even deeper ticklish hell when the wasp on her left foot ground her stocking down to nothing and attacked her soft bare sole, caressing up and down with tickles. Jassaya was farther away, but she certainly seemed to be getting nervous when a pair found her ribs and traced and and down them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the focus and effort in the world, however, couldn't stop the adorable redhead from twitching when she jumped as the tickle wasps on her breasts changed tactics and lowered themselves to her ribs and, along with buzzing ticklishly against them, seemed to add a \"drumming\" frequency, tickling her ribs like a barrage of fingers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette instinctively grabbed for the little demons before she could stop herself, and that's all the time it took for a wasp that seemed to be circling her in anticipation to home in on her right armpit. Bridgette screamed. The vibrating fuzzball seemed to send electric waves of torture through the poor girl's smooth underarm, which instinctively clamped down on the fuzzball! She rolled around, kicking and screaming on the ground as the wasps in her vicinity slowly started meandering around her body before zipping to a vulnerable spot on her. Jassaya was finally getting some relief as the wasps found their target and left her own horribly sensitive armpits. She sighed with relief through her post-tickle giggles, glad that her belly wasn't found and she wasn't where her opponent was.... She wisely decided it was best to stay away for now until the wasps were finished. \"Ha! What a spell you've cast!\" she shouted. A wasp buzzed menacingly at her, however, and she decided it would be best to watch without heckling the performers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wasps found their target and they stopped flowing into the corporeal world, with about 20 of them total. Bridgette was left hysterical and too helpless with laughter to give any kind of meaningful resistance as the wasps seemed evenly divided tickling and moving and binding her. The girl's wide-open green eyes teared up as she laughed through the inescapable tickling as the wasps produced some form of sticky red goop to keep Bridgette's arms in place after they were wrapped behind her and over her head in a sort of backwards hug with the pillar she was moved against. The goop stopped just above her deathly ticklish pits, which were still being tickled by tickle wasps that shapeshifted into flying anemones, tantalizing the flesh beneath it like a hundred wet tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ankles were bound in a similar style, to her arms, encased in red slime, but leaving her feet open to whatever attentions lavished upon them, save the very tips of her toes, which were attached to the ground to immobilize each foot. Her right foot was still covered in nylon (save the tip of her toes), and the wasp on it seemed to be receptive to it, going over her stockinged foot like a brush, while her left foot was given the anemone treatment itself, her bound toes finding no shelter from the ticklishly-rough appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the tiny girl's toned, exposed torse wasn't ignored; the girl's bindings made it jut out slightly. A wasp was still on her belly button, swirling itself around cruelly like a tongue, vibrating like an eternal raspberry. The wasps that broke her had stayed on her ribs, and had vibrated so heavily that they destroyed the garment, and whenever Bridgette shook violently, her breasts would jump with and against what was left of her outfit, giving the audience (and her competitor) quite the show. Two wasps in the form of pixies seemed devoted to simply rendering their prey as helpless and immobile as possible even after the rest moved on to her thighs and midriff, taking all reprieve from the tickling away. Bridgette threw her head around, leading the wasps to bind her forehead to the pillar. She clinched and unclinched her hands into fists, and the wasps bound her fingers. Indeed, her jumping breasts seemed to be the only motion they tolerated. The last two wasps, finally satisfied, high-fived each other and split up. One went to the poor girl's ear, hugging it in a ticklish embrace. The other one flew beneath Bridgette's miniskirt... and suddenly Bridgette went bright red and her laughter changed pitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette laughter was the only part of her unrestrained. Her trapped feet were given continued attention, the soft skin between her toes being nearly as ticklish as her underarms. Her arms remained hopelessly trapped while her pits were put through insanity-inducing tickle torture from the anemones that were happy to slide and lick around the butter-smooth weak spots. Just below, the pixie that was on her ear moved to her breasts, rubbing and caressing both nipples with her tickly little hands while a couple of fuzzballs crawled around her tits like ticklish little slugs. Below that, the girl's ribs started to turn red under the touch of the wasps, which has since changed into small hands (with an exceptionally ticklish touch... and a manicure) that drummed and flicked all over her ribs. Below that, the girls tummy was covered with ticklish fuzzballs, one in her navel and a few turned into little hands to pinch her sides and stroke her waistline, with several dragging their ticklish bodies all over her soft abs. Below that, the girl's thighs were being prodded and squeezed in the most horribly ticklish ways... and the pixie beneath her skirt was tickling closer and closer to... Bridgette tried to clamp her legs shut to no avail. She felt the touch of a feather stroking her sensitive clit through her panties with a touch designed to arouse and tickle, but nothing more. Were her forehead not pinned to the wall, her head would slump down. Instead, she clinched her eyes shut rather than look out to the audience... or Jassaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJassaya watched smugly and excitedly for several minutes as Bridgette was rendered exhausted by the relentless excruciating tickle torture. The girl's hair was matted to her head with sweat, the vacant gaze that replaced her sharp eyes gave away just how tired she was as the wasps finally slowed down to a stop. Bridgette had no clue what would come next. She closed her eyes in fear of whatever was to come...</span></div></div>",

Along with the fact it protects her from the weather, the cloak also comes with a hood that she usually keeps on her head, preventing people around her from seeing the signature signs of a blood elf: emerald green eyes, pointed ears and long blonde hair. With only a tight-fitting red brassiere with gold trimmings covering her chest leaving not much to imagination, a translucent red cloth was also wrapped around her waist as a sort of skirt, fluttering easily in the breeze, barely covering something which resembled a crimson bikini bottom underneath it. Like most of the elves, Ellenia chooses to go barefoot, also finding it convenient for her line of work of being a \u2018Spell Blade\u2019, finding it easier to move around as compared to when she wore footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Ticklish spots: Belly (9/10), Feet (10/10), Thighs (10/10), Underarms (7/10), Ribs (8/10)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness: 70/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEndurance: 50/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult: Yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther: Choosing to take part in the tournament in order to hone her skills, Ellenia, unlike her friend Aprah the Thief, who was also taking part in the tournament, had been battle-hardened due to the various fights she has gotten into, getting her a knack for close quarters combat, as well as creative use of her magic and strength. Different from the dark elf which preferred seduction and espionage in order to obtain victory, this blood elf favors a mid-range battle which allows her to use her favorite type of magic as a Spell Blade warrior, \u2018Enchantment\u2019 type magic. However, to say that Ellenia would not fall for the tricks of the trade which cunning and sly people like Aprah operated by, along with her nasty habit of underestimating her opponent, was a whole different story...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it didn't matter- this was the one chance she had to gain the upper hand and she was taking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flung herself forward before the elf could pick herself up, diving and landing on top of her. She'd had a split second to plan it and it wasn't a pretty landing- both her legs were on either side of Ellenia's body who lay on her back in the sand, a mix of shock and anger on her face- yeah, no. No mercy was gonna come from there. Time to initiate plan I-have-no-idea-what-in-the-flying-frick-I'm-doing before Ellenia could turn the tables. Ashley dropped, landing hard on top of Ellenia's waist, her legs clamping hard around the elf's thighs. Her fingers darted forwards and began scrabbling over naked ribs and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her relief the reaction was instant- the elven woman guffawed then burst into laughter, squirming and wriggling in a desperate effort to escape the dancing fingers tracing a ticklish path up her ribs and into her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was, what's the matter?\" Ashley cooed as the elf's hood fell back from her head. \"So ticklish a toddler could make you beg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer her fingers skittered in helpless armpits, Ashley turned her attention to the crowd, delighted by the sudden turn of events. She looked from them to the giggling elf and back, acutely aware they'd been calling for her torment, but ready to give them what they wanted nos anyway- the show had to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?

NOHOHO!\" Her taunt was cut short as the blood elf's hands, at no point restrained, shot up to her belly and skittered all over her midsection-, causing Ashley to break out in ticklish laughter and screaming.

You do know there is more than one way to fight in this tickling tournament, do you?

This is so cheeating-eheheheehee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips as one finger slowly traced along the sides of Ashley's partially exposed chest, Ellenia playfully gave a little wiggle where the the skin of her chest met her ribs, causing the dark-haired girl to splutter into another bout of giggles, certainly not expecting this. \"And whats wrong with this?

His success on the battlefield lead to him becoming incredibly vain and egotistical to the point where he eventually stopped wearing armor over his head and wore only a thin vest over his upper body so that \"all the world could witness [my] flawless body\". When not engaged in battle or contest, Picha usually spends his time fawning over and admiring his own reflection. Picha's pride and arrogance has gained him more a few enemies as well as angry and bitter lovers following many a one night stand. Having bested all forms of combat presented to him, Picha comes to the Tickle Tournament to once again cement himself (even if only in his own mind) as the greatest fighter to ever grace the world no matter the form of contest. Picha's biggest weakness, aside from how unbearably ticklish he is, is his hubris which leads him to expose several vital areas of his body as well as underestimate his opponent. The only prize Picha seeks is stroking his own ego yet again (that and potentially a night of action with any ladies impressed by his dominance).</span></div></div>",

Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Rick stated, not quite sure how to react. Though he'd been all nice and confident when he entered, he wasn't really sure how to go about things. Would he attack first?

It earned her a few wolf-whistles more than Rick had received when he stepped into the arena and she remained thankful she still had pants and footwear protecting her lower-body even if that was nowhere near as ticklish.

How on earth would anyone be able to take his fights seriously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne could hardly say that the crowd \"went wild\" at the sight of Ashley removing her jacket, but a few more of the men decided to be vocal about it.

As he moved down in the posture, however, he was ashamed to say that his gaze lingered a little more than it should have. There was no excuse for it, and Rick felt another small flush rise in his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley caught it too, adding to Rick's guilt. What she said next caught him off guard, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We what now?\" the Rookie remarked out of sheer surprise. One hand rose to scratch his chin while the other held the opposite elbow, both in front of him as he thought about it. Did they not have to fight? That didn't sound right, though, because if he remembered the rules at all correctly then victory could only be declared when one contestant or the other passed out. Then again, surrendering was an option, but how did Ashley plan to decide-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext think Rick knew, he was being tackled and knocked backwards.

A quick tug proved it: Ashley had tied his arms together behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than just get flustered, however (which he most noticeably did, blushing even slightly harder), Rick kept up his persona. \"Ah, a cunning attack! But now it's my turn!\" It was all bravado and he knew it, but if he was destined to lose he may as well make it a good show. And with that, he charged, trying to tackle Ashley to the ground.

Her skin tone is a dark, rusty red, betraying her inhumanity. She also has long, pointed ears and tiny horns on her head, making her appearance distinctly demonic, if not very intimidating. She is a very attractive woman by the standards of any species: silky black hair tied in a braid down her back, alluring dark eyes (a little too alluring in fact, it is not wise to gaze too long into the eyes of an imp), and full pouty lips. Her fit, lithe body is also a distraction, with firm breasts and a tight stomach, toned legs and small feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wears little, preferring to use her body as a tool of seduction and distraction. Unfortunately, this also exposes a plethora of ticklish spots. A sleeveless black top does little more than cover her breasts, leaving her neck, underarms, and cleavage exposed to eyes and fingers. The entirety of her midriff is exposed, and her lower garment is a tattered black skirt, looking as though it has been through centuries of brambles and fire. She also wears no footwear, confident in bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Ticklish Spots: Zochi is ticklish all over, but some spots are much more sensitive than others. Her inner thighs, hips, and underarms are the most ticklish spots on her body, and soft stroking in any of these spots will cause her to twitch and squirm, giggling swiftly overcoming her. But just about any spot on her body is capable of tickling her to laughter, if you can hold onto her long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness: 99/100<br>\r\nEndurance: 40/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult: Yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstory: Zochi is a minor imp, a low rank amongst the demon-kind. But she has honed her skills over the years: seduction, trickery, and tickling prowess with feather and fingernail. She had joined the tournament with the hopes that victory will give her new status, perhaps even becoming an Arch-Imp granted new powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZochi is a very skilled tickler and teaser. Normally, this would lead to victory, but she has her own weaknesses. First, she is immensely ticklish herself, and hasn't figured out how to withstand tickling for more than a few moments without retreating or curling into a giggly ball. Also, enough tickling has the potential to evoke more than just mirth from the sensual little demoness. Second, she has the bad habit of playing with her victims, occasionally letting the mouse escape the cat through her own carelessness.</span></div></div>",

Zander's expression of surprise soon turned to one of rage as the fallen cloak revealed pointy ears, horns, and plenty of bared red skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of my way, human!\" she repeated angrily. \"Pray you have not made me late to the tournament, or prepare to suffer the wrath of Zochi the Imp!\" Zochi wiggled her fingers menacingly, despite being about a foot shorter than Zander, she made up for it in ferocity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZander was unprepared for such a confrontation with a hot-headed demon, but quickly launched into a counter. He hastily recited the diatribe his masters had drilled into him as the proper response to meeting a lesser demon face to face. \"Y-you fiend! Your kind shouldn't be able to show yourselves in public, you'll damn us all to Hell or worse!\" He reached out his arm and pointed at her, putting on his most commanding voice. \"Prepare to face me in the tournament and be banishhehehey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started to proselytize, Zochi deftly reached out under his outstretched arm (easy due to her height) and jabbed her clawlike fingernail into his ribs. The stoic cultist, uncharacteristically yelped and jumped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't be able to show ourselves in public?\" she purred, rubbing her barely concealed, perky breasts seductively, \"That doesn't sound like much fun...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZander's face turned red and he prepared to tackle her, but before he could a horn blew to signal the time to pick their weapons. Zochi hurried to her chamber, even managing to walk seductively. Zander tried to assuage his feelings of arousal and sexual repression with yet another reading from the Six Strictures, one of his cult's religious texts, as he briskly walked to his own chamber.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All sorts of feathers, feather dusters, brushes, balms and oils designed to increase the ticklishness of their victims, or tailored to stimulate their arousal.

Scent is effective on any male within five feet on the wearer. Inhalation will provoke erotic desires in nearby men, causing distraction. Tests have indicated effected males tickle less effectively, begin targeting erogenous zones over more effectively ticklish targets, and hesitate in decision making. Caution: Victims are still capable of effectively tickling, and may have increased motivation to do so while under the spell of the fragrance. Use with caution.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp grinned, deciding this was the perfect item for the purist. Giggling to herself at the thought of the distracted, conflicted man, she sprayed the perfume over herself. The perfume was puffed over each side of her neck, giving off a flowery odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, I can just imagine how this\u2019ll go.

He found the same problems with a handheld bristly brush, which he figured would probably be hell on the soles but needed very close range. A set of dual tickle-bolt pistols was up next, but Zander faltered when he remembered his poor scores in long-range marksmanship in his training. He moved over more brushes, guns, magic devices, and clothing until something finally caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sized up a staff lying on a table in front of him, a sturdy wooden pole about six feet long, with a long haired tip like a giant paintbrush, which was glowing with a yellow shine. \"Finally, a weapon I did train with...\" Zander muttered. He read the tag hanging from it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Staff of Unknown Fortunes. This stave's tip serves as a versatile and excellent tickling tool, but its true powers come from the blasts it can emit to imbue completely random but magical spells on its target.

It was easy to see straight ahead and to the sides, but diagonals were blocked by the pillars, allowing the contestants to sneak up on their opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZochi stepped onto the sand, her bare feet padding on the soft surface. She noticed the sand slowed down her movements a little, but she could still move relatively quickly. The sand surface was also very soft, so she knew she wouldn\u2019t get hurt if she fell onto it, although doing so would leave her quite vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026 come out, come out, wherever you are!\u201d Zochi said in a singsong voice, looking for her opponent. She couldn\u2019t see him, and moved cautiously. She could hear the crowd in the distance, some trying to tell her which way to go. But they were saying all sorts of things, and some were clearly trying to lead her in the wrong direction. She ignored them, trying to listen for the sound of footsteps. Unfortunately the sand muffled the sounds, and she couldn\u2019t hear a thing. He was being careful, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and down the rows, still not seeing him, and starting to get frustrated. \u201cC\u2019mon\u2026 when I get my fingers on you...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Zochi, it was Zander who saw her first, but is he able to capitalize on it?</span></div></div>",

He would have gotten in closer but something in his instincts told him to not get too near, so he instead brought his paintbrush-esque staff to bear. Right as Zochi heard a noise behind her, Zander jabbed the bristles of his frondy staff into her left armpit. Its effect was immediate and devastating: Zochi the Imp shrieked and jumped into the air as she felt the end of his staff brush her underarm, then over her back and sides as she wriggled with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Purist followed his training and pressed the attack, moving down and waving his staff's end over Zochi's ass. \"Nohohohot thehere, humahahan!!\" Zochi snarled pitifully as she stumbled forward, unable to find her bearings under the disorienting tickles. Zander simply grinned and kept up the tickles relentlessly, though he tried to ignore the feeling in his midsection from seeing Zochi's smooth thighs and curves waving from side to side. <i>Just keep your head in the game and win it</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zochi managed to lithely jump forward, out of the reach of the brush-staff. Panting heavily but glad her worst spots weren't hit, Zochi turned to face her opponent and form a plan. Now that she knew where he was she was confident her imp instincts and deviousness could do some damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And gotten her to squirm and giggle... Zochi decided she shouldn't underestimate this human. While this man might be bigger, stronger, and have the advantage of long range, Zochi had her own advantages over him as well. The imp's grimace turning into a grin, she hopped back and to the side, hiding behind a broad pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZander pursued, feeling like he had the upper hand. He moved around the other side of the pillar, looking to meet her head on, his long brush at the ready to tickle across her midsection. \"You can't hide from me, demon! By the end of this tournament, I'll be victorious and you'll be banished back to-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zander had miscalculated. Zochi had quickly doubled back around the pillar, and Zander had fallen right into her feint. Zochi leapt onto Zander's back, wrapping a hand around his neck. She leaned in and whispered into the man's ear. \"Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself, human? After all, we're only getting started. I want to have a lot more fun with you...\" Zochi's free hand moved down and began squeezing and wriggling against Zander's ribs, starting her counterattack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZander immediately started twisting away from the tickling feeling and trying to throw off the demonic creature. But he immediately noticed some aspects of the situation that weren't so bad: the woman's bare skin was pressed against him, her chest rubbing against his shoulders and her bare thighs wrapped around his waist alluringly. And he hadn't noticed before, but she had a pleasant scent to her, smelling more like a field of roses than a sulfur and brimstone. He was almost enjoying... <i>No! I can't think like that! Focus: You already know she's ticklish!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Hahahaha- Gehehet off mehehehehe, foul creatu-huhuhuhure!\" Zander looked down, and realized those smooth, exposed thighs made for a tickle target. Through his laughter, as well as other distractions, he reached down with both hands wiggling... But Zochi noticed what he was doing. She had to keep one hand around the man's neck to hold on, compared to his tickling two: not a recipe for victory, and the imp wasn't sure she'd be able to win such a contest. Zochi lithely hopped off of the man, tactically retreating before he could get in his own tickles, kicking off as she leapt to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you don't like me on top of you?\" Zochi asked suggestively. \"If you surrender now, I'll promise to be gentle with you...\" Zochi stood just outside the range of Zander's brush, the two facing each other now. Zochi had gotten him to inhale some of that perfume, and was curious to see how much it would affect him.  The two began to circle each other, looking for an opening to make the next strike.</span></div></div>",

His vision was just a little bit fuzzy, and everything had taken on a slight pink haze. He coughed, realizing that the imp's pleasant scent still filled his nostrils. <i>It must be some kind of spell or something... or her perfume...</i> he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZochi the imp looked at her faltering opponent and realized her weapon was taking effect. <i>He's already losing his concentration</i> she thought. <i>But his dose isn't big enough yet! Perhaps I can sway him into making a foolish move...</i> Zochi bent forward, thrusting out her chest and ass in a vulgar display to the pious man. \"Heh heh, come here and get it, big boy!\" she purred, delighting in watching the mixed disgust and attraction splayed across his conflicted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zander was having trouble making up his mind. He was having to fight a little to keep the sensations in his head at bay, sensations which ever so slightly pushed him into thinking of things he had been forbidden to think. However, one thing he could make sense of was that he needed to tickle back. He was glad for picking his long staff, because although he wasn't sure exactly what it was, his senses told him it would be unwise to get in close to the imp. Then he remembered the name of his weapon: the Staff of Unknown Fortunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recalled that the description for his item had said that the staff could fire blasts of magical energy, with untold results. Zander wasn't exactly sure what the results would be, but it wouldn't hurt to try and he could stay back and recuperate his strength; as it was; Zochi the Imp looked like she was about to strike. With that thought, Zander pointed his staff at her, tensed, and fired his weapon.</span></div></div>",

She hit the ground and slid, coming to a rest on her side, shaking from side to side as big belly laughs worked their way out her. <i>The blast must have been imbued with intense tickling power</i> Zander thought incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZochi's imp reflexes had been far too slow for the bolt of tickle magic- it had hit her square in her midsection and tossed her to the floor. She had nary a second to dwell on her reflexes, however, because a millisecond after coming to a rest she felt what felt like fingers prodding and kneading her belly. \"Wha-ha-nohohoho!\" she shrieked as she struggled to escape from the feeling on her stomach, which felt like thin, pointy yet strong fingers sinking deep into the soft flesh of her tummy and wiggling, sending electric shock feelings through her as the blast's effects sunk in. She gasped and her heart skipped a beat as she felt phantom fingers form into claws and drill into her the soft red pockets of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zochi thrashed about in the background, trying to pry invisible fingers from her waist, tummy, and ribs, Zander took a moment to breathe. It would be no good to attack without recovery from her strange scent, and he didn't want to risk getting any of that potent magic on him. Gradually, Zander felt the overbearing feeling of arousal and lightheadedness ease away as he leaned up against a column. He wasn't sure how he could possibly avoid her pleasing pheromone power for too long, but for now he was safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, Zochi felt the tickle spell wear off, leaving her gasping for breath as she clutched at her stomach. It still felt like the tickly hands were there, at least slightly. She staggered to her feet, realizing she'd underestimated the power of Zander's weapon. <i>Of course...</i> she thought. <i>It must be the Staff of Unknown Fortunes, and I just got really unlucky.</i> At the very least, Zochi realized the chances of Zander getting the exact same effect from his staff again was one in a million. But now she felt a little inadequate...he got a giant paintbrush and a magical staff while she had to make do with just her perfume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Zochi had never been one for dwelling on inadequacies. And she was confident she would have the upper hand in a hand to hand tickle fight. </span></div></div>",

He uses his stature to his advantage, as he is a master of sneaking through forests and fields alike unseen and is a capable gymnast despite his height. He wears a thin, foresty tunic as well as simple loose sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA newcomer to the Arena, Quint bets that his experience as a ranger as well as his passion for tickling will serve him well here. He is used to assessing a situation before diving in, which could present a problem or be a boon to him. Because he is very ticklish, he cannot take being held down and tickled in the same spot for a very long amount of time. However, he can jump, dodge, and run for a long time without tiring.

Somehow she lost contact with the Earth and ended up at the omnipresent Arena, so after getting used to the idea of tickling as battle she decided to participate in the Tournament in hopes of encountering new species and perhaps winning the means to get home. In the Arena she met Quint and took a linking to the half-halfling, and teamed up with him for this round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklish spots: Particularly her feet, as well as, ribs and hips<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nanea awlked confidently up to a table of close range tools and began examining them carefully. Wailani was more apprehensive, looking at all the tickle tools nervously, vividly imagining what they were capable of. While she was excited for the chance to use them on her opponent, whoever it might be, she was also wary of similar tools being turned on her. Many of these she had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWailani walked over to some of the long range weapons, looking over various items to shoot or throw along with their descriptions. Her bright orange eyes lingered over what looked like a pistol with a long barrel, reading its note: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGun pellets contain sap from the <i>Kietel knismesisia</i> tree. When shot at bare skin, the sap sticks to the surface and causes a strong tickling sensation. The sap is difficult to remove, and careless action will only spread the substance across more ticklish skin. Warning: Pistol can only hold one pellet at a time, and must be reloaded for each use. Warning: Sap only works when in contact with bare skin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWailani, not thinking that her opponents might be sensibly wearing more clothing than her people do, took the pistol, opting for an effective long range attack over something closer where her opponent could tickle back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanea was doing just the opposite at the other table. She had put on a pair of gloves with vibrating feather tips at the end. Experimentally, the woman touched her gloves to the exposed ebony skin of her stomach, and yelped in laughter at the effect. The feathers were extremely ticklish, vibrating at just the right frequency to maximize the effect. Nanea smiled at her choice, going for a strong close-range offensive strategy. But she also recognized the downside: she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to let her enemy in very close to use them, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also have to be very careful not to accidentally touch herself with her own weapon. It wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be difficult to accidentally be the cause of her own defeat. But Nanea was confident she could handle the gloves effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Erimosi strode out into the arena. With a look between them, Wailani nodded wordlessly, knowing she was to be the first combatant. This fight was about her training, after all. Nanea was at the edge of the arena, waiting to be tapped into the fight if necessary, as Wailani walking ahead into the arena itself, ready to face whoever her opponent was.</span></div></div>",

Or rather, her lack of it. Her womanhood protected by a loincloth kept up by a thin golden string around her waist, practically unnoticeable. A thick golden collar adorns her neck, inlaid with jewels and engravings in an alphabet unfamiliar to you. Two cloth straps, seemingly held in place by magic, fall one over each breast, covering her nipples but on the whole leaving quite little to the imagination. She wears nothing else, her tanned, chocolate skin a feast for the eyes. Her long, smooth legs; hourglass figure; taut midriff; and firm, full breast compose a beauty unrivaled for hundreds of miles. Her hair is jet black, silky and straight. She is also visible not human. Golden goat horns approximately a foot long spring from her forehead, along with yellow cat eyes and fangs visible behind grinning lips. Overall, her appearance is as if a demoness styled herself as an Egyptian goddess, which perhaps she was once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Ticklish Spots- In keeping with her arousing nature, her erogenous zones are also her most ticklish. Her breasts are quite sensitive, along with her curvaceous hips, waist, and inner thighs. But that isn\u2019t to say that other spots are unresponsive. Her underarms, sides, belly\u2026 all will provoke delightful giggling for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (85) and Endurance (99)- Despite being rather ticklish, her powerful nature keeps her from becoming overwhelmed or exhausted. This is both a blessing and a curse, as a tickling session might last her a very long time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult tickler (required for explicit scenarios)- Yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Dathra is an immortal demoness, and quite powerful. Her beauty and sensuality rivals the succubi, and she is very powerful. But like genies and devils, she is also capable of being captured or controlled through bargains or trickery. On one occasion, she was entombed in an ancient catacomb for centuries before being freed. Other times she was indentured to a human for its entire (if small) lifespan, granting wishes and serving as the most alluring of concubines for men and women alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finds ticklishness to be a source of endless amusement, and finds great enjoyment in tickling mortals. She has become quite skilled at it as a result. But she is also very ticklish in her own right, something that her powers are unable to dampen. But the thrill of tickle fights and games are too alluring for her, even at the risk of losing and being put under the feather herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklee:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies- Human<br>\r\nGender- Female<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance- Her black hair is straight and chin-length, with thick bangs that are cut evenly just above her eyes, a \"cleopatra style.\" Her eyes are dark and almond-shaped, with skin that is quite tan. While once clad in adventurer\u2019s clothing, she\u2019s now clad in clothing more suited to a harem girl: a small silken top and equally small skirt, both jet black with a golden trim. The top clings to her chest tightly, with a gold-rimmed 'V' helpfully guiding your eye to her distracting cleavage. The skirt exposes her smooth, tanned thighs, and between the two pieces you can see the entirety of her firm, toned midriff. The black silk compliments her black hair and dark eyes, and the gold trim offsets her tanned skin quite nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (40) and Endurance (90): Miranda isn\u2019t terribly ticklish, under normal circumstances. But being tied up taut under the touch of a skilled tickler is not normal circumstances. Her pale underarms are fairly ticklish, as is her taut tummy. But given enough motivation, she can resist being tickled for some time. Or at least she hopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Miranda was an adventurer that had the misfortune to stumble upon a newly freed demoness looking for someone new to entertain her. But Dathra gave a chance, one contest, to either prove herself or become her slave. So Miranda has all the motivation in the world to hold out against her tickler, and would no doubt love the chance to return the ticklish favor.</span></div></div>",

Their bird-like features begin at the biceps and just above their knees, transitioning into immense gliding wings and webbed feet respectively. The feathers of Axa's wings and hair are a pure white in contrast to her pale milk-chocolate skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer human features are thin and graceful, with gentle swelling of curves at the hip and breast, complimented by the face of a pretty young woman. What causes these to appear alien, bird parts not withstanding, are her red eyes and 'hair' of wispy white feathers down to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarpy clothing leaves little to the imagination- a loincloth over the nether-regions and an overly-ambitious cloth wrap over her ample breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Ticklish Spots: Axa is ticklish in most of the places a human would be- armpits, breasts, midriff, hips. But her feet are also relatively ticklish, if unconventional to tickle, mostly because of the nerves in the flaps of skin used to check water temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (35) and Endurance (99): Axa is not a particularly ticklish specimen and their bodies being brushed against by their own insanely ticklish feathers since birth mean an inherent immunity to tickling-- though a determined professional might find the right spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult tickler: Yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Axa led a fairly normal life for a Harpy up to now- fish, kidnap lost sailors and travelers, whatever else Harpies do. Recently though the tides were turned and she found herself netted by a vessel of monster hunters. Originally they'd planned to sell her to a rich noble- an exotic specimen in a private collection to be gawked at. Then a careless hunter came to close and Axa spent no time tickling them into a screaming mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the potential in their prize they sold her off to someone else entirely- and a fate she is not at all opposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklee:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Human<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender: female<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Alexandria is beautiful young woman- tanned skin, long, toned legs, a flat taut stomach, pert breasts, and dark, hooded eyes that glint with mischief, that compliments her semi-permanent smirk. Her hair is long and jet black hair, braided down to the small of her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wears very little, only thin red silk garments covering her breasts and waist. On her wrists and ankles are four scarves of a similar silk material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (100) and Endurance (100): It's no secret- Alexandria is insanely ticklish, having endured years if 'tenderizing' by the tongue of a Tickle Dragon. It takes little to no effort to produce any form of reaction. On the other hand Alexandria is employed by Queen Catherine for the sole purpose of playing a ticklee- by the queen, by the princess and by anyone Catherine decrees. She's also been exposed to Tickle Dragon saliva so often her skin craves ticklish attention and she has admitted herself to enjoying the touch of another on her body. As the perfect ticklee making her laugh and squirm is oh so easy- breaking her is an entirely different matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Queen Catherine's love for tickling is a well-kept secret within the Coninzian court. Very few people know about it but a select few- her sister the princess (who indulges in the practice as well), the Royal Tickler Arya, Alexandria and a handful of others. Alexandria is her lady in silk- a position for a trusted and loyal servant, both submissive and ruthless when needed. Her position sees her mainly on the receiving by a number of individuals, though mainly the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Arya's position as Royal Tickler came into question and she was sent to participate in the tournament, Alexandria accompanied her friend to assist in any way she could and encourage her in times of doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterested in the challenge Arya faced, Alexandria looked for a way to involve herself too. Maybe this first contest puts her in a more vulnerable and one-sided position than her friend, but hey, it's the taking part that matters, right?</span></div></div>",

It got a bit harder when you remembered she loved being tickled- begged for it Miranda had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile a demoness literally hell-bent on making Miranda her pet was going to be doing everything she could to make her lose.

Although they seemed to be taking their time\u2026 either to make their entrance more dramatic or to come up with some even more fiendish way to tickle them, neither could figure. But it left both of them some time for contemplation, and eventually Miranda turned to Alexandria and asked \u201cUh\u2026 so, have you ever felt a harpy feather on your skin before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria turned to her opposite and grinned. \u201cOnly once, and that was just a single feather. But one was more than enough to make me laugh no matter how softly it moved over my skin. It was a unique experience, almost unbelievable how something so small and soft can tickle so much. I can\u2019t imagine what the whole wing will feel like, especially one attached to an actual harpy! And I\u2019ve heard the great southern harpies are some of the most impressive of their kind. Hmm\u2026.\u201d For a moment, Alexandria\u2019s mind seemed to go elsewhere, staring off into the middle-distance and trying to picture what was to come. But then she focused again, and looked back at Miranda. \u201cWhy, have you ever been under the harpy\u2019s feather?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? No, never!\u201d Miranda said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve been adventuring for some time, but I\u2019ve never encountered harpies before. Naga, mermaids, demons, sure\u2026 but never a harpy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria nodded, then grinned suggestively. \u201cAh, so what is it liked to be tickled by a demon? There hasn\u2019t been a demon in Coninze for centuries, and I imagine they only find their way to our world in more lawless lands. What are they like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda shivered, now remembering. \u201cI\u2019ve only run into her the one time, which is exactly how I got into this predicament. She\u2019s\u2026 something else. Devious, seductive, powerful. Once she\u2019s got her eye on you there\u2019s no getting away. And she seems to know just where to\u2026\u201d Miranda trailed off, shaking her head as Miranda\u2019s smile widened. \u201cBut she gave me a chance. She likes playing games, so we ended up here. If I can win, I get to go free. But if I lose\u2026 well, I\u2019m hers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. I\u2019d help you out, but I have a reputation to maintain.\u201d Alexandria replied, somewhat hesitantly. \u201cAnd besides, if I give in too quickly, who knows the next time I\u2019ll get to be tickled by a harpy! And if I win, I\u2019ll get to tickle your demoness! That sounds like it could be pretty fun, too!\u201d Miranda\u2019s eyes widened at Alexandria\u2019s tickle-gluttony, wondering what kind of person would want to prolong their time stretched out and vulnerable under a harpy\u2019s touch.

She gave the restraints that held her arms up one final defiant tug- just to make sure she hadn\u2019t missed a way to get out of this nightmare. But she hadn\u2019t. All she could hope for now was to outlast the girl opposite her and hope that the harpy feathers were more than she bargained for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDathra, tall and elegant stepped out into the bright light of the arena. She took her time looking up into the crowd around her, soaking in the attention that was being bestowed upon her. And then, smiling a predatory smile she made her way to where Miranda and Alexandria were bound in the center of the arena, hips swinging and one hand placed on her shapely hip. However, instead of stalking toward Miranda, the demoness instead set her sights on Alexandria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex writhed in anticipation as a premature giggle escaped her lips. Slowly, teasingly, Dathra extended a single black nail to her tanned forearm and slowly stroked down into her armpit, causing the girl to snicker and squirm at the ticklish sensations. Smiling equally broadly herself Dathra knelt down next to her, bringing her lips close to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe things I would do to you if we were alone.\u201d She whispered with a sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIhe can imaghine.\u201d Alexandria giggled as she tried to meet the demoness\u2019 gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh little one.\u201d Dathra replied, her fingers reaching down for the bound girl\u2019s sides and trailing them down to her hips as she writhed and snickered in ticklish euphoria. \u201cYou cannot even begin to imagine.\u201d With a final tweak at her sides Dathra stood up and left Alexandria to deal with the phantom tingling that lingered longer than usual on her skin. As the harpy finally closed in on the centre of the arena, impeded by the terrain, her webbed feet and the rule banning flight, the demoness came to stand in front of Miranda- leering over her with a look of hunger on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry.\u201d She purred softly, cupping Miranda\u2019s chin with her hand. \u201cYou and I will be all alone. Very, <i>very</i> soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get no such satisfaction out of me.\u201d Miranda growled in the only act of defiance she could make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don't concern yourself, my little pet.\u201d Dathra replied with a smirk. \u201cThe pleasure will be all mine.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll find out in just a mome-hehehehent!\u201d Alexandria replied, bursting out into giggles. The harpy didn\u2019t waste any time, and had begun to curiously brush her wings across Alexandria\u2019s bare, tan tummy. The exposed midriff fluttered and sucked in instinctively, doing absolutely no good as the feathers easily followed. The touch was just as bad as the tickle dragons, maybe even more ticklish! Somehow even the softest touch of those feathers was incredibly ticklish, the softest grazing as effective as that time Arya was experimenting with blowing raspberries over Alexandria\u2019s bellybutton\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the demoness had taken a much more patient approach. Instead of starting right with a tickle, Dathra was slowly massaging Miranda\u2019s skin. Starting at feet and moving northward, she was rubbing her palms up and down her body in firm, non-ticklish strokes. Dathra knelt next to her victim, her body pressed into Miranda\u2019s legs as her hands sensually massaged the other woman\u2019s thighs. \u201cHow does this feel, mortal? See, I can be quite benevolent to my humans. Doesn\u2019t this feel oh-so-nice? I\u2019ll let you feel good before I have to tickle you into submission\u2026\u201d Dathra told Miranda in a silky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was confused and wary by the whole thing. The demoness wasn\u2019t even tickling yet, even though her opponent already had her ticklee giggling like mad! Was she deliberately throwing the fight in order to be tickled by the harpy herself? No, Miranda didn\u2019t believe it, there had to be some trickery. She willed herself to ignore the massaging touch. But despite herself, she knew in her mind it was having an effect. Miranda felt her body relaxing, her muscles softening from the expert touch as the warm hands seemed to know just where to move in order to pleasurably relax her. Those hands moved up and down her exposed stomach and sides, but still didn\u2019t tickle! Miranda waited with anticipation, expecting each new touch to be the one where fingers curled, and Dathra finally moved in for the kill. But those cat eyes only stared back at her patiently, her palms touching her <i>here\u2026 and there\u2026 and right there\u2026</i> in some kind of pattern Miranda couldn\u2019t figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Axa tickled, her feathers brushing softly but ticklishly up and down Alexandria\u2019s body. Axa seemed to be exploring, hunting for a spot that responded to the feather more than others. But so far Alexandria was giggling constantly but consistently. She had a broad smile on her face, not even trying to hold in her laughter as one wing stroked her sides, then the other\u2026 and the harpy realized that the human was having a wonderful time! The creature was actually loving the feel of her ticklish feathers! It was an interesting problem to have. Normally, this would be a wonderful discovery, but the harpy was here to win\u2026 it was a new challenge for the tall bird-woman, and thought about her next move, never stopping her wings...</span></div></div>",

She wears black lace lingerie set- bra, panties and stockings and a pair of satin gloves for that extra tickly sensation. Like all spirits only black voids exist where her eyes should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Ticklish Spots- Shannon is as ticklish in death as she was in life all over her body- her feet, ribs, breasts and armpits are all responsive to tickling and she has a feeling death has only made it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (85) and Endurance (25)- ticklish and hates it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult tickler- yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio- Shannon died on Halloween night, tickled to death in the carnival of a mad-man. But instead of peace, her soul was claimed by Dr Tickles, to be his play-thing for eternity. In his depraved realm though Shannon made a deal- tickle a poor soul to a sufficient level and rarely would she be the lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her the doctor was pleased her her display and allowed her a more dominant role in his realm. Unfortunately she now finds herself in the tickle tournament purely because it amuses him to watch her work under pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName- Aren<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies- human spirit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender- male<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance- Aren is dressed only in a pair of ragged shorts that look like they've been worn for decades. Despite his withering clothes the rest of him looks surprisingly clean. He's not ripped, but it's clear that he hasn't spent his spirithood sitting around. Like Shannon only dark empty voids exist where his eyes should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Ticklish Spots- Week's particularly sensitive on his midsection- ribs, belly and sides. His thighs and pits are also hot spots as are his soles- which might be a funny punchline with the right set-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (90) and Endurance (95)- Particularly ticklish but also a spirit that enjoys being tickler- unfortunately for Shannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult tickler- yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio- Another victim of Dr Tickles, Aren soon came round to enjoy being tickled- sure he had no choice but if you're gonna be tickled for eternity might as well enjoy it. Initially meant to tickle Shannon, the two arranged to reverse the roles for Dr Tickles' challenge and as they say the rest is history. The two certainly have an affectionate, if not romantic soft-spot for one another- though whether that'll be reflected in Shannon's performance in the face of defeat remains a mystery. Probably helps that her companion and lee enjoys being under the fingers of a young beauty like her.</span></div></div>",

A tight-fitting army green blazer adorned with over a dozen medals from her conquest is also worn over a white blouse with a black tie, with black flats to cover her feet, thigh high nylon stockings covering her long legs. Lastly opting for a military-issued army green skirt, albeit its length tailored to be like a miniskirt's in order to provide her with more mobility (The sudden boost in morale from the soldiers when she crossed her legs certainly didn't prove to be a factor.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Arrogant and spirited. Even though she was made the commanding general of the Stossia's Army at a very young age of 24, Sonia didn't shirk away at her duties, instead embracing them with a fiery passion in order to make her homeland the best country in the continent. Now she leads the ground forces of Stossia's troops, morale always at a all time high with her presence. Normally seen on the front lines, she likes to be in the heat of the battle, where she can get the current situation immediately, often recklessly risking her life for the victory of the battle. However, even she is human, and of course, like all humans, the large ego which she had been feeding over the 2 years from victory after victory might cost her someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Ticklish Spots:Not too surprising, her stocking-covered legs are one of her most highly sensitive areas, along with her chest and navel, with only both Sonia and her guards knowing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (85) and Endurance (70): Even though the General is said to be quite ticklish even among her soldiers, her iron will and strong mindset to act a leader for her troops helps her to keep her mind from throwing in the towel, unless <i>persuaded</i> by an extremely skilled tickler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult Tickler: Yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTickler:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Layla Maxwell<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Human<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: A beautiful face unmarred by the scars of war, her most prominent feature being her blazing red hair that she kept in a ponytail; a rarity for Stossians even those among its royal bloodline. A vest over a camo-printed tank top that stretched only to her ribs, a green tinted miniskirt finished the outfit, along with a pair of Stossian issued army boots. An automatic tickle rifle slung over her shoulder along with a couple of laughing gas grenades and a trench knife, Layla is prepared for almost every scenario that involves direct conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Loyal with an attitude that earns even Sonia\u2019s respect, Layla was eventually made into one of the Commander General\u2019s personal guards along with two others. Ready to fight for her country and Commander at any time, she remains ever alert for any signs of danger to her leader, ready to sacrifice herself for the sake of victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (75) and Endurance (85): While not the most elegant tickler, Layla could take much more than she could dish out, her loyalty towards her general (and close friend) giving her the will to defeat most enemies soldiers and troops in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult Tickler: Yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Layla had objected to the fact of their positions in the duel, her commander had persuaded her that it was a leader's job to protect her soldiers. Now even more motivated than before to win with Sonia's faith placed in her, Layla knew she had to break her opponent before her general (and her) were the ones receiving the loser's punishment.</span></div></div>",

Her skin is normally quite pale and she maintains her appearance carefully. Her body is in peak physical condition: Smooth, strong legs; a firm, taut tummy; strong yet graceful with the build of a dancer, and quite beautiful. She wears the uniform of the Brusican Army Intelligence Division: A black long-sleeved top that hugs her form and stops just below her chest, exposing the entirety of her midriff and lower back. Tight black leather pants hug her hips and thighs, along with a pair of quiet black leather boots. The BAID insignia is emblazened on the left shoulder and thigh of her clothing. She carries a ceremonial feather-sword (more of a dagger, really), on her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Confident and ambitious, Eva comes from a long line of Brusican nobility, which explains her somewhat imperious nature. Determined to do the job herself, she's been sent behind enemy lines countless times to discover battle plans. While she can be stealthy and careful, sometimes she bites off more than she can chew. But her sense of duty is paramount, and she vows to continue to help her country, and never give in to the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost ticklish spots: Eva\u2019s exposed midriff is perhaps her most ticklish spot: stokes and squeezes to her hips, fingers dancing along her waist, or a tongue swirling around her bellybutton\u2026 all are tactics she wouldn\u2019t be able to resist for long. But that isn\u2019t to say the rest of her isn\u2019t quite ticklish as well: underarms, breasts, thighs, the soles of her feet and in between her toes\u2026 all are ticklish places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (90) and Endurance (60): Eva is a very ticklish woman, and despite resistance training can only maintain her resolve for so long before giving in to endless giggling. She only makes up for it by out-tickling anyone before they can get the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult Tickler: Yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklee:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha Urellia<br>\r\nSpecies: Human<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: 5'4\" tall, with light blonde hair in a ponytail and light grey eyes, features that are very uncommon in Brusica and reveal Stossian ancestry. Her build is athletic but well endowed, with a sizeable chest and alluring flare to the curves of her hips. She wears the uniform of the Brusican Army Intelligence Division: A black long-sleeved top that hugs her form and stops just below her chest, exposing the entirety of her midriff and lower back. Tight black leather pants hug her hips and thighs, along with a pair of quiet black leather boots. The BAID insignia is emblazened on the left shoulder and thigh of her clothing. She carries a ceremonial feather-sword (more of a dagger, really), on her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Natasha was a Stossian war orphan adopted into the Brusican Byrd household at an early age. She harbors no loyalty for her birth nation, instead being completely devoted to Brusica and the Byrd family that took her in. She's looked up to Eva her entire life, and now tries to look out for her. Natasha's personality is quiet and stoic, her calm and observant demeanor distinct from Eva's fiery intellect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Ticklish Spots: It seems that the farther up you go on Natasha, the more ticklish she is. Her worst spots are her underarms and breasts. When restrained and stretched out, even the softest strokes in the smooth hollows provoke a noticeable reaction, and exploring the curves of her full chest is an excellent tactic in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness (65) and Endurance (90): Natasha is definitely ticklish, but her sensitivity isn\u2019t off the charts. Her ability to hold in her laughter is also impressive, both traits that let her rise up the Brusican ranks despite her foreign features. However, the right tactics can definitely get the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult Tickler: Yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrusicans superior officers don\u2019t have the same protective nature for their subordinates as Stossians, and it will be Natasha going under the feather. She is completely loyal to her commander, but this will be her first time tickled by the enemy. Meanwhile, Eva has pride and her own sensitivity to motivate her to win before she ends up tickled by her adversaries, eager for a chance to tickle her into submission.</span></div></div>",

I have a hunch that once I get my fingers on those legs of hers, both of you will rue the day that you dare to challenge Brussica.\" Even as the Brussican espionage commander boasted, she could see that her opponent had indeed shed away a few layers of clothing to make her job of tickling her partner easier, opting to discard her usual vest and boots that she always wore to the battlefield. If it weren't for the rules that prevented the two tickler's from going at each other, Eva could already have imagined Layla on the floor in a giggling mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Colonel Byrd eyed up her opponent, Stossia's tickler did the same as well. While the Brusican was already clothed in an overly-tight outfit, she too chose to not bring any footwear for the task ahead as she deemed them as unnecessary, already knowing that she would win the match. \"Well then what about your sub-ordinate? 'Natasha Urelia', was it? With no protective layers of clothing just like you, I could make her squeal in a heartbeat just by running my fingers along her skin! And anyways, what kind of commander lets her soldiers fight for her while she sits back and enjoys tickling another person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost to the point of going at each other's throats, the bell luckily sounded, a signal that the match was about to begin. Calming herself down, Natasha held out her hand, the look of a tickle-starved predator on her face. \"Well then, I bid you good luck. Try not to break so easily when we finally beat the both of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA victorious smirk on her face as well, Layla shook Natasha's hand, the latter wincing at the red-head's strength. \"Oh don't worry, Stossia will be the ones having the last laugh by the end of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both tickler's exited through the raised gates... </span></div></div>",

As they were getting ready to enter their respective restraints, an argument had broken out over the starting conditions of the duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes the brave general need to wear so much protective clothing?\u201d Natasha mocked. \u201cAre you so too afraid that the second Eva\u2019s fingers find bare skin that you\u2019ll immediately be reduced to a laughing wreck?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really one to talk?\u201d Sonia replied incredulously. \u201cSure, that outfit of yours reveals your ticklish belly. But those sleeves protect your underarms, and those pants guard everything from the waist down! You\u2019re more covered than I am!\u201d  The two continued to bicker, arguing over who was more exposed than the other, and who was put at an unfair advantage because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the arena judge that had been ready to restrain the two of them stepped in. \u201cVery well!\u201d the judge\u2019s voice called out loudly. \u201cSince the ticklees cannot agree on fair circumstances, both ticklees will be restrained in their undergarments! Further, ticklers will have the right at any time to remove those undergarments when they so desire! There will be no hiding from the tickling!\u201d The audience cheered at the pronouncement, and the two ticklees shared a look, realizing they had just made their situations that much worse; that much harder to resist the tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took off their clothes, down to their underwear. Sonia was allowed to keep her nylon stockings, for whatever good they would do. The two were tied in the center of the arena, with their arms stretched over their heads, their bodies taut against a wall, facing each other from about twenty feet away. The two looked each other over, noticing their exposed and attractive forms on display. Each knew that their ticklers wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the ticklish flesh made ready for them.</span></div></div>",

As the crowd really started to get into it after seeing the equally skimpy attire from each would-be tickler along with the almost naked ticklees, the arena judge grabbed the mic, determined to start the match<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn this duel, we have been graced by the presence of not one, not two, but four beautiful women, two of them already almost nude and ready to be tickled to the bone! In one corner, we have the stoic Sonia Crestellia and her tickler, the infamous and ambitious leader of Brussica\u2019s espionage forces, Commander Byrd! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAcross from them, we have another pair of beauties with another one also coming from Brussica\u2019s spies, the mysteriously blonde Brusican, Natasha Urelia along her tickler, General Crestellia\u2019s right hand soldier, the strong, the beautiful, Layla Maxwell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFanfare resounding from the seats above, both Layla and Eva tuned them out, giving each other a smirk before moving to their respective ticklees, ready to begin. As both their lips curling upwards at seeing their squirming and barely clothed victims, Eva was the first to reach her adversary. Seeing the blonde stripped of all her usual protection, leaving her in only black lacy lingerie and garter-stockings, even Eva couldn\u2019t hold back a giggle at seeing the general put on fragile front , the former circling around the latter as she decided where to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo many vulnerable spots for me to take advantage of\u2026 Did you undress yourself for me just to tickle you, my dear general? All you had to do was ask\u2026\u201d Before Sonia opened her mouth for a retort, Eva had closed the distance with a large step, sliding up to the general as she dragged one finger up her naked side. Biting her tongue on her giggles, the blonde tried to shy away from the mischievous digit, only managing to move a few inches due to the chains binding her arms. Eyes ogling the Stossian\u2019s full chest, Eva had to tear her eyes away from that area, vowing to find out if the General was ticklish there sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at where the blonde from the other faction was, also clad in just her undergarments, Layla had taken her time as well in eyeing up the various curves on her ticklee, noting the especially fit and taut belly stretched out for her wiggling fingers. As Natasha gulped in seeing the red-head eye her up as if she were a delicious meal, waiting to be eaten, she nervously tried to bargain with her tickler. \u201cL-Layla, was it? I promise that if you don\u2019t tickle me, I\u2019ll try to ask the Commander to spare you as well while we just tickle your General.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to bribe me? I\u2019m sorry, but we Stossians are very loyal to our superiors, even more so to our country. And in order to bring our country honor\u2026 I\u2019m afraid you must laugh!\u201d Already being more forward than her Brussican counterpart, the red-head dug her fingers into Natasha\u2019s ribs, probing to see if that area was ticklish. Already with a wide grin on her face, the blonde was glad that she wasn\u2019t as ticklish as most people were, already knowing that if she was, she would have already been a laughing case right there and then. \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got, Stossian? I\u2019ve seen toddlers tickle better than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProvoked by Natasha\u2019s words...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her belly quivered and sucked inward, attempting the escape the tickling digits. The effort was useless, but Natasha couldn't help herself. She knew this would only encourage Layla to tickle her more, to hone in on more ticklish spots in that soft expanse of exposed skin. But she also new it wasn't her worst spot. Maybe if she could keep Layla interested in those spots which were ticklish but not irresistibly so, she could hold out long enough for her commander to best her Stossian rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Layla's eyebrows raised in interest as she got a reaction out of her ticklee. \"Oh, is this a ticklish spot? We'll see who gets the most laughs\u2026 I think it's going to be me. Coochie coochie coo, ticklish little Brusican\u2026\" Layla teased, something Natasha tried strenuously to ignore, as the feminine fingers roamed across her midriff, searching for the most ticklish areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eva was pursuing a subtler tactic. Her fingertips stroked in feathery touches up and down the General's sides, soft and teasing. But the gentle touch was getting to the woman, biting her lip and trying to resist the building ticklish feelings. Eva picked up on the reaction, and leaned in to whisper softly in Sonia's ears. \"You're going to giggle, General. I can tell how much this<i> tickles</i>. How <i>ticklish</i> you are. Such a<i> ticklish</i> girl, with<i> ticklish</i> sides, and a <i>ticklish</i> tummy. So, so <i>ticklish</i>\u2026\" She whispered, repeating that dreaded word over and over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva continued her gentle teasing, her nails also exploring her ticklee's tummy for sensitive zones. They drifted across the rim of her navel, and Sonia let out a gasp\u2026 one that Eva instantly picked up on. With a grin, those nails instantly returned, drawing soft little circles around the rim of her bellybutton. It was finally too much for Sonia to resist, and her wide grin cracked into an open smile, laughter spilling out from it. \"Nn-aahahahahaha! Stahahahahap!\" She giggled, to the Brusican's glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can stop anytime you want, my dear General\u2026 all you have to do is surrender to me. Is that so hard? It'd be much harder to lie there while I tickle and tickle this ticklish bellybutton here\u2026\" Eva taunted, patiently exploiting the discovered weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla heard her superiors laughter, making her all the more frustrated. This blonde Brusican was obviously ticklish! How could she make her start laughing? There had to be a spot, a technique\u2026. She couldn't let Eva best her! Switching tactics, Layla decided to tickle...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moving her fingers down to the Brussican\u2019s hips, Layla furiously latched on, squeezing without a care in the world. \u201cThese hips of yours look quite ticklish, Brusican! Would you mind if I gave them some tickles?\u201d With every squeeze feeling like an electric jolt coursing through her nerves, Natasha still managed to hold out, barely managing to maintain a smirk on her grinning face. \u201cI-Is that all you have? I think I would fall asleep first before I burst out laughing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready annoyed by her opponent\u2019s resistance, Natasha\u2019s provoking didn\u2019t help Layla in the least as the red-head made a beeline lower towards the blonde\u2019s pale thighs, spider-tickling away with all ten of her digits. Already knowing that she had caught a lucky break, an idea came to Natasha. Perhaps if she faked being ticklish in that area, the stone-headed Stossian might actually fall for it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurposefully faking her giggles even more so as before, the Brusican tried to kick her legs free of Layla\u2019s grip, the latter\u2019s face lighting up again at the thoughts of finding a ticklish gold mine. \u201cIt seems this Brusican is sensitive on her whole body! Your legs might even be more ticklish than General Son-Ahem, I mean you might hate to be tickled more than the General! Why don\u2019t you just surrender, and this will all be over!\u201d Not picking up on her slightly delayed reactions, Layla continued to be fooled as the Brussican could only laugh to herself at how easily she had managed to trick her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite the duo, Sonia was having trouble shutting the teasing words out from her mind, the sensation of soft lips brushing past her ears making the tickle talk all the more unbearable. \u201cOh yes general. You might seem like a strong person on the outside\u2026 But really\u2026 what kind of woman doesn\u2019t like the <i>ticklish</i> feeling of these <i>ticklish</i> nails along her skin? <i>Kitchie</i>\u2026 <i>Kitchie</i>\u2026 <i>Koo</i>\u2026!\u201d Letting out another snicker, Sonia tried her best to shy away from her assailant, periodically twisting her body from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to be deterred from a potentially quick victory, Eva constantly dragged one finger in a circle along the general\u2019s quivering belly, tracing another finger upwards along her sides. Surprised by the silky feeling of Sonia\u2019s skin, even the general could see the strained look on the blonde\u2019s face as she held in her laughter. \u201cOh my dear general\u2026 Making such a face already. We aren\u2019t even at the most ticklish part... <i>Yet</i>\u2026\u201d Dipping her nail once again into the Stossian\u2019s naval, Eva grinned to herself at seeing Sonia\u2019s eyes open wide before shutting again, trying to stifle her still-born giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe Brusicans have a saying\u2026 \u2018If you want to beat a Stossian, all you have to do is go forward\u2019. Would you care to test this rumor, my dear ticklish general?\u201d Lightly scratching the exposed sides of the general\u2019s chest in the latter\u2019s black lingerie, Sonia\u2019s lips clamped shut, her cheeks slowly becoming flushed pink with the effort of holding her laughter in. Not relenting, the Brussican spy didn\u2019t stop her wiggling finger. Finally after what seemed like several minutes, a stream of giggles burst forth into the air, even louder than the giggles coming from Eva on the opposite site. Eyes wide open in shock; Layla momentarily stopped her tickling to watch the blushing face of her general, the latter bubbling incoherently with girlish giggles as her body strained from side to side, the cause of which only being a single finger stroking in her lingerie top, the grinning face of the spy commander telling the whole story. Realizing what had happened\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
