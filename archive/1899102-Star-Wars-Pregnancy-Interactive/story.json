Dagobah was one such planet, there must have been a reason to keep the existence of the planet from the jedi.<br>\r\n With this in mind Anakin and Ahsoka not surprised to see two figures in dark robes standing in front of the holocron. \u201cYou jedi are so rude,\u201d one without look around, \u201cshowing up to place when you are clearly not invited,\u201d one of the figures turned around revealing himself to be none other than Count Dooku.<br>\r\n\u201cCount Dooku,\u201d said Anakin in angry tones.<br>\r\n\u201cNot hiding behind an army of droids,\u201d taunt Ahsoka.<br>\r\n\u201cand you two don\u2019t seem to have the clones to do your dirty work,\u201d replied the Count, \u201cbeside as you  no doubt know this artefact requires a personal touch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d blurted out Ahsoka her curiosity betraying her.<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d said the other figure turning around to reveal the snarling features of Asajj Ventress.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they will continue not to know,\u201d said Dooku igniting his lightsabre, everyone else quickly followed suit. \u201cNow we will know once and for all,\u201d said Dooku his voice bouncing around the overgrown ruins of the temple, \u201cWho is the strongest.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs one they leapt at each other, after a few brief seconds of a two versus two melee,  the combatants broke off into two groups with Ahsoka fighting Asajj and Anakin against Dooku, this continued on for several minutes with impressive display of swordsmanship and training in the force on both sides, Anakin knew that time was against them whilst he had face Dooku several times before the Count had shown his experience would more often than not triumph over Anakin\u2019s vigour, and whilst Snips was good for her age she would not be able to hold off Ventress for long. Just then he notice that Asajj had managed to get Ahsoka in a force choke, breaking off from Dooku for a second Anakin sent a wave of force to not Ventress off her feet. This worked but Dooku took the opportunity to the same to Anakin who was sent flying into the podium on which the holocron rested. Ahsoka free from the grip rushed over to help her master, but the Sith closed in for the kill. All four locked blades just over the holocron, where they were held for several seconds before they slipped and made contact, they was a massive explosion of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin open his eyes, he was still in temple and despite his body aching all over he leapt up snatching his lightsabre from the ground, but both the sith were nowhere to be seen.  Ahsoka was on the ground no far away alive but defiantly unconscious.

There were ways of healing people with force but Anakin did not have the patience to learn such a technique.

He returned to the cockpit in time to the strap himself in and switch deflector shield to front and increase power to the engines at expense to the weapons. The republic fleet seemed to have the upper hand and should be able deal with what appeared to be a patrol group rather than a full attack fleet, never the less it would only take one stray bolt from one of the larger ship of either side to vaporise Anakin, Ahsoka and the entire ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their ship came into range to be noticed by the combatants Anakin opened up communications on republic channels and said \u201cThis is Anakin Skywalker contacting Acclamtor Assault ship Implacable, do you read me?\u201d<br>\r\nIt was a couple of seconds be there was a reply which was slightly distorted by static but Anakin could easily tell without a doubt that it was a clone rather than a recruited officer. \u201cThis is the Implacable sir, sorry to have not caught you at a better time but as you can tell we got our hands bit full at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an injured jedi aboard along with\u2026,\u201d he hesitated, \u201csome remains of a jedi artefact.\u201d<br>\r\nThe was a couple seconds again before the reply came, \u201cI\u2019m sending you a coarse it should keep you clear of most of the major areas of fighting, but be careful of vultures.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs always Skywalker out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Anakin was stepping out into the hanger of the Implacable with Ahsoka carried in his arms and the holocron remain in a bag, even before he stepped off the boarding ramp a team of medics had rushed up with a floating stretcher.

Anakin was just about to knock on the door to Ahsoka\u2019s room when he heard a strangled scream from inside.<br>\r\nAnakin almost instinctively jab to door controls to open it, the door wasn\u2019t locked and slide open, Anakin rushed and a strange sight meet his eyes.<br>\r\nAhsoka was standing next to her bed clutching her stomach which was bulging as though she just had extremely large meal.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d asked Anakin urgently.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ahsoka looking up from her swollen middle with a frightened look on her face, \u201cone minute I was drifting off to sleep and the next\u2026\u201d She gestured at her belly which made her look as though she was four months pregnant, but given that jedi are celibate and the rate at which it happened Anakin considered it unlikely. Over the grunts of Ahsoka, as she tried to push her stomach back in with little avail, Anakin heard the faint whispering like before but slightly louder now.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you hear that, a sort of faint whispering,\u201d said Anakin tilting his head a fraction trying to listen. <br>\r\nBut Ahsoka was too distraught to care, \u201cDon\u2019t you care that I happen to ha\u2026hmmmpph.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cssshh quiet,\u201d said Anakin putting a hand over Ahsoka\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\nWhilst the ship still hummed and there were distant sounds of an army in wartime both the jedi could hear a quiet indistinct whispering. \u201cWhere is it coming from?\u201d ask Ahsoka pulling Anakin\u2019s hand away to speak.<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s coming from you,\u201d said Anakin he ducked down and placed an ear to his padawan\u2019s swollen middle.<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!!!

Besides if you body is really simulating a pregnancy then they will find out sooner or later.  We might as well collect our stuff and head over to the corvette now, it will be leaving soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater over on the corvette Ahsoka was given another room to use.<br>\r\n\"I will be another few hours before we reach Coruscant. You might want to catch up on some sleep,\" said Anakin, \"that's what I'll be doing,\" and with that he left to his room across the hall.<br>\r\nIt took some time for Ahsoka to drift off, even with the slither of light from under the door Ahsoka could see the dome of her belly rising in front of her, made all the more bigger in her point of view by lying down. Occasionally her hand would accidentally brush against it causing her to shudder, but eventually she did drift off to sleep.<br>\r\nIn her dream Ahsoka floated in blackness, her belly was massive but indeterminately so, as dreams so often are. In some ways it was large as an AT-TE walker at the same time being big enough that she could only just get her finger tips to touch when reaching around it and several sizes in between but always it was big, much bigger than a typical pregnancy for a human or Togruta. There was also the whispering, louder than before but still indistinct, she moaned as she felt her skin stretch and the whispering get even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds of closing and shaking her head, hoping it was all a dream, Ahsoka open her eyes again to see it wasn't. She glanced over at the mirror on the wall of her cabin apprehensive of seeing the full extent of changes her body had made, after a second or two she heaved her self to her feet and awkwardly made her way over to it. She looked at her profile view her heart sank to see that from this angle her 'bump' was even more pronounced. She ran her hands over the burgeoning orange semi-sphere feel a wave of comfort as she rubbed the taut skin. She the cup her growing bust under one hand getting a feel for the size of the cleavage that her top was having trouble to contain, while her other hand had slid down to gingerly rub her also increasingly large backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka spent the next few minutes in silence, transfixed at her growing body, her hands caressing her swelling curves hardly believing that it were her own body. She had just noticed her belly button was becoming increasingly shallow and started to investigate it when the sound of footsteps in the corridor outside broke her out of her reveriy.

There was another reason to her fear, for whatever reason she felt an instinct to protect whatever was ever was growing inside her, even though it was medically gas, and the idea of something growing inside her still horrified and repulsed Ahsoka, she still felt that the less people knew about the condition the better.<br>\r\nSuddenly an idea occurred to Ahsoka \"...how did the Sith know where to find the holocron? there clearly must be spy somewhere and I don't think we should tell anyone until the have been caught,\" she said in a rush.<br>\r\nAnakin gave a thoughtful noise, most Jedi would reject the idea of going behind the council's back out of hand but Anakin was somewhat rebellious to ruling Jedi body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he decided to....</span></div></div>",

She barely was able to adjust her position to conceal the bulge of her midriff behind her robes and legs, before Barriss Offee fellow padawn and friend of Ahsoka cautiously walked into the shuttle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said Barriss brightening up upon spotting Ahsoka, \u201cwhat are you doing in here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBarriss!\u201d exclaimed Ahsoka angling herself as best she could to prevent her friend spotting her bulging middle, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she said in a way to bide time.<br>\r\n\u201cI ran into Anakin in the temple and asked him where you were, he answer was very strange and I was afraid something had happened to you, like you were captured or worse,\u201d said Barriss, \u201cso I decided to check the ship he arrived on to find out and here you are.\u201d<br>\r\nAhsoka desperately tried to think of a way to send Barriss away or at least prevent her from asking\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing down there anyway?\u201d asked Barriss.<br>\r\nAhsoka sighed only a few minutes at the jedi temple and already her secret was going to be found out, she proffered her hands to Barriss and said, \u201chelp me up and I\u2019ll tell you, but be prepared to be surprised.\u201d<br>\r\nBarriss grunted as she helped her friend get to her feet, \u201cUuf, I don\u2019t wish to be rude Ahsoka but you may want to lay off the\u2026\u201d she started but fell silent as Ahsoka\u2019s belly came into view like a rising moon. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d said Ahsoka hesitantly, but she had tell Barriss now, and so she told Barriss about the mission and the holocron and how her belly started growing. It was a brief version of events but covered all the important details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now Anakin has gone off to fetch the council and bring them to examine me,\u201d finished Ahsoka in a distraught voice.<br>\r\n\u201cSomething tells me you don\u2019t want that,\u201d said Barriss.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d moaned Ahsoka before she could stop herself, \u201cI mean I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou obviously have been through a lot,\u201d said Barriss in an kind voice, \u201cthe council shouldn\u2019t put you through anymore stress if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know they won\u2019t do that, they\u2019ll say \u2018it\u2019s for the good of the galaxy\u2019 or something like that,\u201d said Ahsoka before hopelessly saying, \u201cTo be honest I wish I could just run away and hide.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Barriss, \u201cIt\u2019s not like there is anyone here to stop you.\u201d<br>\r\nAhsoka was taken aback, \u201cI can\u2019t just go out into the galaxy like this on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a ship here, besides you won\u2019t be alone I\u2019ll join you,\u201d said Barriss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the was a sense of anticipation in the air as it became apparent they could just fly away.<br>\r\n\u201cBut where?\u201d moaned Ahsoka, realising her plan to just run away and hide wasn\u2019t as easy as Barriss made it seem, \u201cIf any Republic official see us they\u2019ll report it to the Jedi Council and even if we could get into a Separatist system Count Dooku and Ventress are also probably interested in getting their hands on this,\u201d she finished giving her belly a prod causing it to wobble for a bit.<br>\r\n\u201cHow about Hutt space then?\u201d suggested Barriss her gazed transfixed on Ahsoka\u2019s quivering gut, \u201cit\u2019s neutral but still accessible.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk then let\u2019s go,\u201d said Ahsoka.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just go grab a few things\u2026\u201d began Barriss heading towards the ramp.<br>\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t enough time Anakin will be back any minute now.<br>\r\nThe excitement was back and was consuming both of them, Barriss crossed to the controls and started to initiate a take off without bothering to sit down.<br>\r\nAs the ship rose above the city skyline Ahsoka found herself holding her breath expecting at anytime they would receive a message from the council demanding they return or for another ship to start pursuing them, but neither happen instead they were able to clear the planet\u2019s atmosphere and make the jump to lightspeed without a single interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shuttle had entered hyperspace the reality of what they just done begin to creep over them. They had left the temple against the council\u2019s wishes, possibly having them abandon the order by doing so, in a shuttle which was not theirs, to what was probably the most lawless region of the galaxy with no supplies other than what meager supplies were on said shuttle; it seemed crazy. Despite the paranoia that drove Ahsoka to such a thing she still felt wary. She assumed that Barriss, who didn\u2019t have a large belly influencing her to, must be feeling even more apprehensive. Ahsoka sat down heavily in one of the shuttle\u2019s chairs and tried to adjust her robes to cover as much of her belly as possible as Barriss sat in the chair next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pressing awkward silence for a few seconds (even the faint whispering that eminated from Ahsoka\u2019s stomach seemed to have stopped) before Barriss turned her chair to face Ahsoka\u2019s and said \u201cSoooo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo\u2026\u201d replied Ahsoka giving a nervous grin which Barriss responded to with one of her own, then the awkward silence enveloped them once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another awkward silence Barriss started once again, \u201cSooooo that\u2019s really real?\u201d she asked nodding towards Ahsoka\u2019s bulging abdomen.<br>\r\n\u201cSure feels like it,\u201d said Ahsoka giving another nervous grin and lightly pat.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so strange,\u201d said Barriss before the awkward silence could return.<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d replied Ahsoka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there more awkward silence before Barriss blurted out, \u201ccan I feel it?\u201d before immediately tearing her gaze away from Ahsoka and blushing, \u201cI mean, if that\u2019s ok with you?\u201d she finished hesitantly.<br>\r\nAhsoka didn\u2019t feel the same fear she had at the idea of the council examining her; Barriss was her friend and just as confused by what going on as her. Besides another part of her body, the hormones flowing around her distended frame, was sending other feelings to her mind, the desire for contact, closeness, and other feelings which she sure the jedi forbid, that made her say, \u201cYes!\u201d much faster and louder than she intended, \u201cI mean, if you want to,\u201d she said with a shy grin, while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka pulled back the robe and offered up the orange sphere that was her belly, which by now had swollen even larger making her appear overdue. Barriss couldn\u2019t hide her eagerness as the leaned forward her eyes transfixed on her friend\u2019s rotund middle. She first stretched out a hand shaking with hesitation and gave a light poke to Ahsoka\u2019s stomach immediately withdrawing her hand as though she expected Ahsoka\u2019s belly to pop with a loud \u2018bang\u2019. All that happen was Ahsoka\u2019s belly swayed slightly, Barriss looked at Ahsoka and gave sheepish laugh while still blushing, and was answered by a nervous grin before Barriss gently put both her hands on Ahsoka\u2019s belly.<br>\r\nAs Barriss caressed her fingers across the orange dome, that was her friend\u2019s belly, Ahsoka was overcome by a sensation of peaceful bliss she had not felt since receiving her \u2018gift\u2019 and even then never felt as strong before. Barriss in turn started off nervous but as she continued to rub Ahsoka\u2019s middle she started to fall into her own sea of calmness as she became transfixed by the rhythmic rise and fall of Ahsoka\u2019s belly as her friend breathed in and out.<br>\r\nWhen Barriss\u2019s hand lightly clipped the nub of Ahsoka\u2019s protruding belly button, Ahsoka\u2019s whole body gave a shuddered and she made a faint noise but neither broke from their reverie. After a while Ahsoka\u2019s hands joined Barriss\u2019s in rubbing the swollen orb, Ahsoka vaguely marvelling at how small and dainty their hands looked in relation to her engorged middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for quite awhile both loosing track of the time as they sat there in complete silence except for the faint whispering (which had started again) and the occasional soft noise by Ahsoka as one of them brushed around her sensitive navel. As they sat there gazing either at the pulsating orb of Ahsoka\u2019s belly or into each other\u2019s eyes they were interrupted by a loud groan and rumble from Ahsoka\u2019s belly. Since both had their hands on Ahsoka\u2019s stomach at the time they felt the vibrations emanating from deep within Ahsoka\u2019s body, and with that the spell of peaceful bliss was broken. With that the awkward silence rushed back in, where they been gazing at each other before they now nervously eyed one another neither wanting to be the one to address what they had been doing even though they remained in place, their hands frozen in place on the surface of the orb of ahsoka\u2019s belly as though they had been caught doing something they were forbidden from doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ahsoka who broke the silence by saying with a nervous laugh, \u201cSooo, is there any food on this shuttle?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll check!\u201d said Barriss quickly and leaping up, desperate not to confront what the two of them had been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Barriss poked around the ship for ration packs the ship exited hyperspace into\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She also didn\u2019t like discarding her robes either, even though they didn\u2019t cover it entirely Ahoska felt conscious at just how big her changing body had become, particularly her belly; without robes all she would be wearing was a tube top that now represent more of a bra as it retreated from trying to cover her massive belly to try and focus on containing her growing breasts, a short skirt made all the more shorter her growing rump of a behind, her tights who decorative cut outs now seemed like a structural liability, all of with seemed increasingly way too small for her, as well as her boots the only part of her outfit she was currently happy with. Barriss got off much easier without her robes she still had a skin tight jumpsuit that covered most of her body and a long skirt over the lower half, and most significantly unlike Ahsoka Barriss did not have a massive belly that made her look pregnant with triplets. Despite all this though Ahsoka still hid her jedi possessions along side of Barriss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stood there, in silence as the shuttle began to descend letting them know that they were landing. <br>\r\nNot long after they landed a Duros flanked by four armed guards walked up to shuttle, Barriss pushed a button to let the ramp down.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease step out of the ship,\u201d said the Duros in basic.<br>\r\nAhsoka looked at Barriss, who gave shrug and the two exited the shuttle.<br>\r\nBarriss exited the ship first and paused half way down the ramp to help Ahsoka down, who was gingerly waddling behind her trying not to let the slope of the ramp or the weight of her stomach pull her forward.<br>\r\nAhsoka was more worried about the reaction of other people seeing her this big, and while she could not see any reaction the duros face one of the guards nudge another and pointed at Ahsoka\u2019s swollen middle, as though there was some way he missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am this spacesport\u2019s customs official,\u201d said the duros in a nasally voice, \u201cI hear to inspect the contents of your ship, do you have a manifesto?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Barriss \u201cwe just used it to get away from the fighting.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOn Anat 4?\u201d Questioned the official.<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Barriss and Ahsoka in unison.<br>\r\n\u201chmm,\u201d said the duros tapping on his data pad, \u201cI will now inspect the content of your ship please remain out here unless I call for you, if you try to run away you will be shot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike I can do that,\u201d muttered Ahsoka.<br>\r\nThe duros gave another, \u2018hmm\u2019 before up the ramp onto the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few minutes where the pair wait outside with the guards in complete silence with only the noise of the settlement around them and faint whispering from within Ahsoka. She was afraid that the guards might hear the whispering from her swollen gut and get suspicious, but either they couldn\u2019t her it or gave no attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10-15 minutes, which felt like an eternity to Ahsoka the Duros exited the ship, \u201chave you seen what you needed to,\u201d asked Ahsoka testily she for some reason was grumpy despite her fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I believe I have,\u201d said the official in a matter of fact tone while tapping a few more times on is data pad, \u201cguards I want you to arrest this pair.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? What for?\u201d blurted out Barriss.<br>\r\n\u201cFor stealing,\u201d said the Duros as the guard moved towards the pair of jedi one getting a couple of binders ready.<br>\r\n\u201cWe told you already tha\u2026\u201d began Barriss.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that you were fleeing the fighting from Antar 4, though the navi-computer aboard the shuttle shows that you clearly came from Coruscant. Ahsoka\u2019s heart sank as realised just how much they were caught out. \u201cWhat I reckoned happened was that you two are some entertainment workers from Courscant, possibly table dances or something,\u201d said the Duros.<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d said Ahsoka objecting at the accusation.<br>\r\nThe official continued, \u201cthen one day you found yourself in desperate need for some money fast, possibly because you,\u201d he gestured to Ahsoka, \u201cgot yourself knocked up by half the lower levels by looks of it.\u201d Ahsoka gritted her teeth. \u201cSo you two decided to steal a Republic Shuttle and sell it for cash, after all it would probably fetch quite a price either from smugglers or the separatists, both of which could do with one, may you have planned the idea in advance or maybe you just saw an opportunity one day and took it. Then you decided to come here because you think we have no laws in hutt space, well let me tell you ladies, that we do have laws they just happened to be our laws. You thought being criminals would be easy, clearly you had not done anything like this before as you would stripped the ship down and erased the navi-computer. Instead you don\u2019t and leave these to be found instead.\u201d<br>\r\nThe duros unfolded a bundle of cloth underneath one of his arms, revealing it to be Ahsoka\u2019s and Barriss\u2019 robes with their lightsabres. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best that we caught you first,\u201d said the official, \u201cthe jedi are said to take these things quite seriously,\u201d he finished before asking, \u201cSo tell me, how close am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please kind sir, have mercy, my friend just seeks a place to start a new life. Barriss motioned to Ahsoka, who was annoyed at being pulled into this pathetic charade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is the case, perhaps we could sell this ship for you, for a sizable cut.\u201d The official said with a sinister smirk. Barriss looked at him aghast that her plan was falling apart. \u201cW\u2026we actually need that ship.\u201d Barriss stammered, Ahsoka huffed in frustration. \u201cCome on Barriss.\u201d Ahsoka groaned. Ahsoka waved her hands and used the Jedi mind trick. \u201cYou checked our ship and found nothing of interest, now give us our stuff back and forget you ever saw us.\u201d Ahsoka commanded dismissively, but to her and Barriss\u2019 surprise everyone in the area froze in place apparently affected, more than a dozen goons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls walked away from the scene Barriss looked at Ahsoka worriedly. \u201cAhsoka I didn\u2019t know you could do that?\u201d Ahsoka defensively replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t, I was just trying to use the mind trick on that annoying customs office, I didn\u2019t mean to mind trick everyone there but hey, at least we got to keep our stuff.\u201d She said lifting up and showing off her ill-fitting robe. Barriss glanced at Ahsoka\u2019s triplet sized belly worriedly and asked. \u201cDo you suppose this has something to do with what is happening to you.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t it Obvious, but it sure helped us out back there.\u201d Ahsoka said trying to reassure Barriss. \u201cYour control of the force has gotten unnaturally strong, what if there are unforeseen repercussions.\u201d Ahsoka looked fearfully at Barriss and nervously asked. \u201cLike what?\u201d Both girls stopped as Ahsoka\u2019s stomach ominously gurgled. They glanced down together and watched in stunned fascination as Ahsoka\u2019s Swollen middle suddenly inflated larger. Growing a few inches larger and making Ahsoka look very overdue with triplets. \u201cWhat just happened, I blew up like a balloon.\u201d Ahsoka squeaked as she explored her newly enlarged gut. \u201cYou\u2019ve been growing, Ahsoka.\u201d Barriss explained in frustration, as she ushered Ahsoka into a place less crowded for their conversation. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve been growing slowly!\u201d Ahsoka corrected as they ducked into an alcove. \u201cI\u2019ve never grown that fast, Oh, what am I going to do.\u201d Barriss watched Ahsoka pace about distraughtly. \u201cI fear that using the force hastens your growth.\u201d Barriss warned. \u201cI think you should refrain from using the force until we figure this out\u2026 and that you need some new clothes.\u201d Barriss said with a worried smile. Ahsoka looked down noting several inches of belly protruding embarrassingly from her robe. \u201cI guess I do.\u201d Ahsoka sighed defeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka settled on an assemble similar to her older one obviously larger and with a voluminous maternity top, with a short jacked, and a larger robe. \u201cWell, this should do nicely.\u201d Barriss said reassuringly. \u201cYeah, until I grow out of it.\u201d Ahsoka countered despairingly. \u201cAhsoka you mustn\u2019t let those feelings get to you, you\u2019re stronger than that.\u201d Barriss implored, Ahsoka smiled weakly at her friend\u2019s faith, feeling slightly better. They checked into an inn and decided to settle down for the night. Ahsoka collapsed on the bed with a frustrated snarl. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing Barriss, I\u2019m trying to run away, but I can\u2019t run from this.\u201d Ahsoka moaned as she rubbed her stomach. Barriss sat beside her and contemplated their current options. \u201cWell, the only ones that might be able to help us are the Jedi council.\u201d Barriss said matter of factually. \u201cAre you serious, it was your idea to come here instead.\u201d Barriss was flabbergasted by Ahsoka\u2019s response, and nervously explained. \u201cWell you said you didn\u2019t want to deal with them.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s the last thing I\u2019d want to do.\u201d Ahsoka explained with a huff, and she started rubbing her belly. Barriss watched her regretfully and reluctantly reached out to help her. \u201cThanks, Barriss.\u201d Ahsoka moaned as she enjoyed her friends gentle touch. As she eased her friend, Barriss couldn\u2019t help but marvel at Ahsoka\u2019s swollen size. \u201cGoodness Ahsoka I can\u2019t believe how big you have gotten.\u201d \u201cYeah, I guess it is surprising.\u201d Ahsoka replied nervously, confused as to how to take the comment. \u201cI mean you were always so thin; I can hardly believe you could get so large.\u201d \u201cWell I am.\u201d Ahsoka growled starting to feel more insulted. Barriss noticed Ahsoka\u2019s irritation and clarified. \u201cNo, I mean you are miraculously gravid Ahsoka and I wouldn\u2019t think you could get any larger and yet, I fear you will. Barriss looked at Ahsoka fearfully, Ahsoka looked down at herself her stomach having grown about an inch larger throughout the rest of the day, making her look like she was going beyond triplets, Barriss rested her hand on the crest of Ahsoka\u2019s maternal swell. \u201cSurely you can\u2019t keep growing like this.\u201d Ahsoka nervously replied. \u201cSurely I will not.\u201d She turned away from her friend and settled into the bed. Ahsoka hoped to end the conversation and despite what she said, deep down she feared it was not true, and that she would keep growing. Barriss took the hint and settled in as well, and the girls drifted off into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka dreamed she was lying in a field looking to the stars and thin as she once was. Barriss called to her and Ahsoka looked toward her. However suddenly Barriss disappeared in a blue wisp, and Ahsoka\u2019s stomach gurgled. Ahsoka was confused as to what just happened and looked around for her friend only to find their ship looming over her. It too disappeared and Ahsoka felt full. \u201cWhat is happening.\u201d She cried and stumble to her feet and as she did so she found herself towering over the city. As Ahsoka looked down at the town the buildings began to disappear as well. One by one they vanished and as they did Ahsoka felt a strange sensation in her still flat stomach. Ahsoka had closed her eyes from the pain she felt, and soon she no longer felt the ground beneath her feet. She opened her eyes to find herself floating in space, she was the size of a planet the star dust and galaxies swirled around her head. Ahsoka was entranced for a brief moment when she felt something. Looking into the distance she saw many stars disappear and a familiar fullness growing inside her. She had grown again now she dwarfed the celestial bodies and she had begun to understand. Inside her she felt a massive power, she felt like the force itself, no the whole universe itself was inside her, immense and ever expanding. She realized...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a mountainous bulge in the sheets which Barriss knew was Ahsoka\u2019s stomach. It towered ominously over the svelte padowan, the crest shockingly approaching Barriss\u2019 eyeline. She gently pulled back the sheets and uncovered Ahsoka\u2019s orange mound. It was a stunning sight, Ahsoka\u2019s orange stomach was firm and looked like she had swallowed a large coastal play spheroid. It had even started rounding her sides. Barriss was fascinated by her friend\u2019s swollen middle and she felt strangely drawn to it. She hesitantly reached out to caress it but was stopped when Ahsoka unexpectedly spoke up. \u201cI know I\u2019m huge.\u201d Ahsoka said, Barriss quickly recoiled her hand in surprise. \u201cAhsoka! I didn\u2019t know you were awake.\u201d Barriss stammered trying to hide her embarrassment at being caught trying to feel Ahsoka\u2019s belly. \"I think I know what is happening.\u201d Ahsoka explained which got her friend\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka and Barriss where sitting across from each other on the bed facing each other. \u201cThe spirits that were sealed in the holochron are like conduits to the force itself. The holochron was meant to contain them and impede their connection to the force. When needed the Jedi could connect them to the force and channel their endless power to enhance their own. \u201cThat is horrible, those poor souls were trapped for eons to be used in such a way. Barriss was appalled, such a fate was worse than death, to be cut off from the force itself. Her confusion showed on her face as she processed what Ahsoka had revealed, she focused on Ahsoka again and asked. \u201cWas that the work of the Jedi.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ahsoka replied before she moaned in discomfort, obviously feeling uncomfortable. \u201cBut that is not all.\u201d Ahsoka continued ignoring the uncomfortable feeling she was experiencing. \u201cNow that they are free of the holochron they can channel the limitless power of the force into their new vessel which just so happens to be me.\u201d It quickly dawned on Barriss. \u201cThat is why you have gotten so powerful!\u201d She cried, Ahsoka nodded in agreement. \u201cIt is also probably why my growth hasn\u2019t impeded my mobility at all.\u201d Ahsoka added, Barriss slowly realizing how it was strange Ahsoka could move around easily despite her inflated form. \u201cThat\u2019s not the worse part.\u201d Ahsoka said regaining Barriss\u2019 attention. \u201cUnlike their previous vessel, I am a living being, and absorbing all of this force energy is actually affecting my body, I\u2019m like a balloon slowly being fill with all the water in the universe.\u201d Ahsoka accentuated this statement by leaning back and drawing Barriss\u2019 attention to her now uncomfortably tight pants. At that very moment Ahsoka\u2019s pants popped open unable to contain her growing gut and further emphasizing her point. \u201cAhsoka those fit just yesterday.\u201d Barriss exclaimed in a panicked tone. \u201cYes, and unless we can find a new vessel to contain these spirits I will keep growing endlessly.\u201d Barriss stared in disbelief, the severity of Ahsoka\u2019s situation slowly sinking in. \u201cAhsoka, what if we remove the spirits will you shrink down or will you stay\u2026\u201d Barriss looked at Ahsoka\u2019s middle anxiously. \u201cI\u2019d rather focus on getting these spirits out of me so I\u2019ll stop growing, we can worry about anything else after.\u201d Barriss nodded in agreement. \u201cSo, where shall we find a new vessel?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ahsoka just glared at her in disapproval. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go meet this contact of yours, how did you learn about him.\u201d Barriss asked. \u201cI know a Hutt.\u201d Ahsoka replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landed near the facility and Barriss made her way to the main building. Asking around she was led deep into the basement of the facility where she met the contact. A rodian smuggler with a collection of rare relics some created by the Jedi from eons past. He had an ancient relic a device that was said to be a source of power in an old Jedi stronghold, but has long since stopped functioning. If it was some sort of Jedi battery perhaps it could contain the power of the spirits. After she purchased the device Barriss quickly left the facility, she couldn\u2019t help worrying about the device. It didn\u2019t look to be in good condition but that is hardly surprise, would this even work, it was very risky and expensive. As she finally exited the building, a strong force shook the area. Immediately Barriss knew that something happened with Ahsoka and she rushed back to the ship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly before that Ahsoka was waiting in the ship rubbing her belly, it eased the stretched skin of her stomach. She didn\u2019t want to admit how good it felt, her stomach was becoming increasingly more sensitive and any touch brought a blush to her cheeks. She eventually got impatient and headed out to see if she could find Barriss. Ahsoka looked around nervously waiting for Barriss to return, she tried to stay out of sight to not draw any unwanted attention. Unfortunately for her, Ahsoka\u2019s efforts to be inconspicuous made her seem suspicious and as she turned to go back in the ship someone stopped her. \u201cHey you, what cha got there!\u201d Cried a lasat thug that noticed her suspicious secretive behavior. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Ahsoka asked as the lasat approached her menacingly. \u201cWhat cha hiding under that robe, it looks awful big, you think I wouldn\u2019t notice you got something under there.\u201d Ahsoka didn\u2019t know how to respond to the brute\u2019s accusations and could tell she was in trouble. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t have anything.\u201d The lasat thug grabbed hold of her collar and pulled off her hood. \u201cAin\u2019t got nothing under there, how stupid do you think I am, are you trying to make off with our merchandise you little thief.\u201d He forced her robe open and stopped in his tracks, Ahsoka massive maternal bulge leaving him completely dumbfounded. \u201cWha is this!\u201d he cried, Ahsoka losing control unconsciously pushed the thug away with the force, but her immense power sent a shockwave out in front of her. The guard flew clear over the building, Shipping contains were hurled away, ships were jostled breaking their landing gear, the whole area trembled. Ahsoka could tell she messed up as she felt a great power growing within her, she hurried back to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarriss sprinted into the ship to find a straining Ahsoka leaning on the hull. \u201cAhsoka are you okay, what happened.\u201d She cried going to her friend\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Barriss I lost control and accidentally used the force.\u201d She huffed out, exhausted she stopped resisting the power welling up inside her. Ahsoka groaned as her stomach started inflating, she quickly gained five inches on her waistline as her stomach started to resemble a mother overdue with quadruplets quickly approaching quintuplets. Her chest and butt grew slightly but not as much as her enlarged middle. Her still svelte limbs and face made her massive orange belly seem even more disproportionate. Barriss just stared in horror as if fearing her friend would explode like bomb. \u201cAhsoka you\u2019re huge!\u201d Barriss gasped, Ahsoka reached out for support and Barriss obliged helping her to the ship\u2019s bench. \u201cI\u2019m trying to contain it, and the power just keeps growing.\u201d Ahsoka says as she lays down. Barriss starts helping Ahsoka rub her belly causing her to sigh in satisfaction. \u201cIs it exhausting?\u201d Barriss asks in concern. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to hold back a sneeze, I want to just let go, but I\u2019m afraid I would outgrow this ship in an instant.\u201d Ahsoka explained, Barriss pulled out the device. \u201cWell, hopefully this can help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Barriss quickly regained focus, but noticed she was starting to feel overwhelmed. \u201cAhsoka, I something wrong.\u201d She asked, and looked to Ahsoka for guidance. \u201cIt\u2019s too much, It won\u2019t work.\u201d Ahsoka whimpered, Barriss looked and noticed Ahsoka\u2019s belly had visibly shrunk, having deflated to quadruplet size. \u201cWhat are you talking about It\u2019s working.\u201d Barriss said, but as she looked at Ahsoka\u2019s face she saw her, strain and frustration. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand we have barely made a dent in their numbers and this thing is already full.\u201d Barriss looked down at the device and noticed it glowed with an intense light. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Barriss.\u201d Ahsoka said, Barriss felt an immense swell of power consume her before the girls were sent flying into the opposite walls of the ship.<br>\r\nAhsoka groaned in pain as her stomach inflated once more. She was smaller but it was by a barely noticeable amount, her stomach shrinking four inches in size. Barriss stumbled to her feet and went over to Ahsoka. \u201cIt worked Ahsoka, you got smaller, I felt the spirits leave.\u201d She said enthusiastically before a strange feeling overcame her. \u201cBarriss?\u201d Ahsoka asked wondering what was wrong. An ominous gurgle from Barriss\u2019 stomach revealed the answer her stomach swelling up like she was rapidly eating a huge meal. \u201cAhsoka?\u201d Barriss whimpered, looking down at her new bulging waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka was beside herself. \u201cWhat have I done!\u201d She cried as she paced around the ship. Barriss watched the whole event in annoyance. \u201cPerhaps now we should seek the help of the council.\u201d Barriss said trying to get Ahsoka to focus again. \u201cI guess we don\u2019t have much of an option.\u201d Ahsoka sigh defeatedly, noting her friend\u2019s apprehension Barriss added. \u201cPerhaps after we get some rest.\u201d Ahsoka nodded in agreement and the girls retired to their quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka felt awful, her eagerness to exorcise the spirits caused her to be reckless, and Barriss was punished for it. Now if they didn\u2019t find a way to exorcise these spirits soon both her and Barriss will become blimps. Though it was not without any reward as the power welling up inside her was nowhere near as strong. At least she might be able to control it better for now. She focused her mind as she drifted of into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarriss rubbed her middle feeling a strange sense of peace, like this was something she always wanted, but didn\u2019t know it. She felt exhilarated and full of energy. She drifted off to sleep in a blissful slumber. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I sense a disturbance in the force, an uncontrollable power, unleashed she has.\u201d Yoda looked off in the distance in contemplation. \u201cMaster Skywalker, why did your padowan flee.\u201d Yoda asked looking to Anakin for his opinion. Anakin thought for a moment and replied. \u201cI think she was afraid about what the Jedi council would do about her situation and perhaps what everyone else would think of her condition.\u201d  Anakin was careful with his words trying not to reveal Ahsoka\u2019s embarrassing state to Master Yoda. \u201cFear leads to foolishness, and foolishness leads to regret.\u201d Anakin agreed with a nod. \u201cAnd what of this condition.\u201d Yoda pried causing Anakin to blush. \u201cI would rather not comment sir.\u201d Anakin stated confidently, Yoda nodded. \u201cRespectable choice Master Skywalker, to the council bring your padowan, deal with her we can.\u201d Yoda calmly said, Anakin bowed and left the chamber, but felt uneasy about the whole situation. While he didn\u2019t sound angry, Master Yoda\u2019s cryptic choice of words made Anakin wonder what Master Yoda planned to do about Ahsoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anakin was worrying about Ahsoka a voice suddenly snapped him out of his thoughts. \u201cMaster Skywalker.\u201d \u201cSenator Palpatine!\u201d Anakin said caught off guard by the senator\u2019s appearance. \u201cAnakin, I have heard that you and your padowan were sent on some mission for Master Yoda, and that something happened, something with your padowan.\u201d Anakin, sighed in defeat. \u201cYes, we were sent to get a holocron, Master Yoda said it would give us an advantage against the sith, and it may have affected Ahsoka.\u201d \u201cSo, it is a weapon, could it be used for the war?\u201d Palpatine inquired cocking his eyebrow. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Anakin answered with a shrug. \u201cAnakin, if you would, when you find that padowan of yours, I would like to have a word with her before the Jedi Council. I do not want to lose a potential asset for the war effort because of the Jedi Council\u2019s paranoia.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know sir, it\u2019s not my place.\u201d Anakin said and Palpatine gave a slight nod and put his hand of Anakin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat is fine Master Skywalker, do what you think is right, I only want to end this war as quickly as possible.\u201d Palpatine left Anakin a sinister smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin was entered his personal starship and was about to take off when he noticed that he was receiving a communication. When he saw who it was from, he sighed in frustration. He pressed the button on the console and a blue hologram of his padowan\u2019s face materialized it looked at Anakin and gave him a nervous smile. \u201cHello, Master.\u201d She said trying to be friendly. \u201cAhsoka!\u201d He barked at the hologram which flinch at his outburst. \u201cYour still mad aren\u2019t you.\u201d Ahsoka asked meekly, much to Anakin\u2019s annoyance. \u201cNo Ahsoka, why would I be mad, my padowan just defied the wishes of the Jedi council by running away like a scared child, endangering herself and potentially the republic, why would I be mad.\u201d Ahsoka glared at Anakin. \u201cHey, I was worried! If Barriss hadn\u2019t been there\u2026\u201d \u201cBarriss! She put you up to this.\u201d Anakin exclaimed, Ahsoka eyes bulged as she realized her mistake. \u201cAhsoka!\u201d Barriss cried from the background. \u201cOops, sorry Barriss.\u201d Ahsoka said her hologram looking off to the side as she focused on her friend. \u201cHello Master Skywalker.\u201d Barriss said nervously off screen, Ahsoka focused back on Anakin and said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Master, we thought we could solve my situation ourselves, but we couldn\u2019t and we just made things worse.\u201d Anakin just groaned defeatedly. \u201cWhere are you girls, we need to rendezvous so you can explain yourselves, and then we\u2019ll figure out what to do about your condition.\u201d Ahsoka avoided looking at Anakin as she revealed their location. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad Master, but we\u2019re near a planet\u2026 iiin Hutt Space.\u201d She said with a grimace anticipating an outburst from Anakin. Anakin just collapsed back into his seat defeated, and sighed. \u201cSend me the coordinates.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the coordinates the trio decided to meet up in an abandoned Jedi ruin located near the girls\u2019 location. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls arrived shortly after, he watched their ship as it landed and he headed over to meet them. The landing ramp lowered and a figure came down, one that left Anakin speechless. \u201cHello Master.\u201d Ahsoka said awkwardly, the figure was clad in a familiarly dark cloak but it was obviously not the same one he was expecting. Under the hood he saw the blushing face of his padowan, but beneath her face the cloak billowed out immensely looking completely out of place with the small head above it. \u201cAhsoka, what is that?\u201d Anakin asked full well knowing and fearing the answer. Ahsoka looked down despairingly and answered. \u201cIt\u2019s me Master.\u201d Ahsoka groaned as she revealed herself, her stomach was swollen large making her look heavy with quints perhaps larger. The ridiculously large swell looked even more strange on the still very svelte body of the padowan, its girth looking very out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAhsoka what happened to you?\u201d Anakin said in disbelief. \u201cShe\u2019s grown Master Skywalker.\u201d Barriss loudly said as she made her way down the ramp. As Anakin turned his attention to Barriss he noticed a change in the young padowan as well. \u201cYou too Barriss!\u201d Anakin groaned as he saw the round bulge on Barriss\u2019 middle. She had grown larger too looking to be entering the third trimester if she was actually pregnant. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Anakin demanded, Ahsoka just hung her head in shame and replied. \u201cYou know how I said I made things worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka explained what had happened to Barriss and the nature of their problem, Anakin listened and when they finished their story, he thought about what their next action should be. \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me that until we get the spirits out of you, that the two of you will just keep filling with the power of the force.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s about it, I fear that if not stopped we could even grow to the size of a planet.\u201d Ahsoka said, as Barriss thought about Ahsoka\u2019s words she felt a slight thrill, and her cheeks blushed. \u201cYou said that the power of the spirits has greatly increased your power of the force, couldn\u2019t this power be used to win the war.\u201d Anakin thought as he gazed at their bellies, Ahsoka gasped in disgust and replied. \u201cMaybe but we won\u2019t, not only is it wrong to use the spirits in such a way, it comes at a cost.\u201d Ahsoka explained turning away from Anakin in a huff. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll help you get into the capital quietly, but we need to get those spirits out of you both, perhaps I can arrange for you to meet with Master Yoda, he would surely know what to do.\u201d Ahsoka agreed with a nod. \u201cI guess that would be okay.\u201d \u201cAlright let\u2019s go, I trust you at least checked to make sure no one followed you here.\u201d Ahsoka looked to Barriss and said \u201cOf course we did, right Barriss.\u201d Barriss glanced anxiously between the others. \u201cWe did, what were we supposed to do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin and Ahsoka both groaned in annoyance. \u201cYou never leave Hutt territory without checking to see if you\u2019re being followed Barriss.\u201d Ahsoka cried. \u201cWell excuse me, I don\u2019t routinely enter Hutt territory.\u201d Anakin looked around, sensing the presences around them. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here long enough, they\u2019re probably going to ambush us at any mome...\u201d Anakin sensed an attack coming, but before he could even react, he heard his padowan. \u201cMaster look out!\u201d Ahsoka cried as she pulled Anakin toward her and out of the path of an incoming laser blast. The motion left Anakin leaning on his padowan\u2019s bulge which brought a blush to both their cheeks. He recoiled in embarrassment but quickly turned his attention to the ambushers. They all took out their lightsabers and prepared for the incoming barrage of blaster fire. \u201cGet back to your ship!\u201d Anakin cried as he went to confront the thieves. The girls slowly backed toward the ship using their lightsabers to reflect the blaster fire back picking off a few of the goons. Anakin used the force to jump toward them and struck some down, drawing the focus of the rest. The girls seizing the opportunity turned to head to the ship but found a few of the thieves had snuck up behind them. \u201cBarriss don\u2019t.\u201d Ahsoka cried, as the thieves drew their weapons Barriss quickly reacted using the force to send them flying off the landing pad. Anakin had finished off the rest of the thieves when he heard Ahsoka\u2019s cry and jumped over to the girls. Ahsoka was supporting Barriss who was hunched over. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Anakin asked. \u201cShe used the force.\u201d Ahsoka explained. \u201cIt\u2019s so strong Ahsoka.\u201d Barriss groaned, before their eyes Barriss swelled up like a balloon, her stomach quickly reaching overdue with twins. Barriss had a dreamy exhausted expression on her face, as Anakin felt her midriff experimentally, he came to understand what Ahsoka had said. \u201cSo that is the cost of using the spirits\u2019 power.\u201d Ahsoka nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry back to the capital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bordered their ships and set off, Anakin leading the way. Barriss gazed down at her swollen middle with a slight smile. \u201cAre you okay Barriss you grew so much.\u201d Ahsoka asked worried about her friend. \u201cI had expected the power, just not how pleasurable it felt.\u201d Barriss explained her cheeks growing darker. Ahsoka blushed too as she averted her gaze. \u201cI admit I may have let my resistance wane.\u201d Barriss sighed as she resumed piloting the ship. \u201cI probably should have warned you about that, that is why it is so hard to resist.\u201d Ahsoka explained, as she looked longingly out the window, her hand stroking her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anakin prepared the ship to enter hyperspace, he thought of senator Palpatine\u2019s request.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t long before Anakin came to get them, and led them down the hall. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that we would see Master Yoda already.\u201d Ahsoka said, which prompted Anakin to correct her. \u201cActually, you\u2019re not meeting with Master Yoda yet, the senator wanted to speak with you first.\u201d \u201cSenator, what senator?\u201d Barriss asked confused, Ahsoka groaned. \u201cSenator, you don\u2019t mean senator Palpatine do you.\u201d Anakin looked over his shoulder and replied. \u201cYes actually, and it is because of him that we could sneak you in so easily.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin arrived at the senator\u2019s office, Ahsoka was annoyed and Barriss was nervous.

He asked inspecting her turgid gut with his eyes. \u201cNo sir!\u201d Ahsoka said her cheeks flushing. Noticing her reaction the senator pried further. \u201cOh, perhaps it is the opposite.\u201d He said with a wry smile that caused both girls to blush even more, ignoring their embarrassment he continued. \u201cI have heard that it grants you strength you have never experienced before. Such strength would be invaluable to the republic it could easily be used to dissuade any support for the seperatists. Imagine a handful of chosen Jedi as strong as any army.\u201d \u201cSenator! with all due respect, we can\u2019t stay like this and it is unacceptable to use the spirits in such a way.\u201d Ahsoka said her and Barriss obviously upset by his suggestion. \u201cI was merely suggesting that we just give a show of force to avoid dragging out this war any longer than it needs to be, prevent any more tragedies.\u201d He explained trying to calm the girls down, their resolve waned and the senator decided to change his approach. \u201cBesides, what do the Jedi intend to do, reseal those spirits leave them trapped forever cut off from the force.\u201d As senator Palpatine said this he gently placed his hands on the girls\u2019 shoulders.\u201d  Ahsoka\u2019s and Barriss\u2019s lids grew heavy their focus lost as the senator\u2019s word filled their minds. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do anything that you wouldn\u2019t want to do, nothing at all right now, I only ask that you not be so eager to reject such a blessed gift, enjoy your selves and keep protecting those poor spirits.\u201d He whispered his subtle influence twisting the girls desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin was waiting when the door to the senator\u2019s office opened and he stepped out. \u201cAh, Master Skywalker it would seem that your friends have changed their minds.\u201d The senator explained to Anakin\u2019s surprise. \u201cWhat do you mean senator?\u201d Ahsoka and Barriss came out and nodded in agreement. \u201cWe can\u2019t let them just reseal these spirits again so they can be used as the Jedi desire.\u201d Ahsoka said with a determined look, Anakin was confused at his padowan\u2019s conviction but didn\u2019t see any reason to doubt it. \u201cSo, what do you want to do?\u201d Anakin asked, \u201cwe will think of another solution ourselves.\u201d Ahsoka said, prompting Palpatine to speak up. \u201cPerhaps they could lay low for a while, somewhere peaceful, I believe your friend, senator Amidala is returning to Naboo for a while perhaps they could join her.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As her room came into view Padme was just leaving when she noticed Anakin. \u201cAnakin! What\u2019s going on I received word from senator Palpatine that you wanted to see me?\u201d She asked feeling worried about what was going on, hearing her distress Anakin clarified. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong Padme, at least with me but I was wondering if you would do me a favor.\u201d Padme was relieved and told him. \u201cOf course Anakin, what is it.\u201d Anakin glanced back at the girls. \u201cWell I heard you were going back to Naboo, I was wondering if you could let Ahsoka and Barriss accompany you.\u201d Padme seemed a little surprised by Anakin\u2019s request, but she was more surprised from the realization that the large figure behind Anakin was actually Ahsoka. \u201cAhsoka is that you?\u201d Ahsoka raised her head and smiled anxiously. \u201cHello senator Amidala.\u201d Returning her attention to Anakin, Padme said. \u201cI would be honored if the young padowans would accompany me.\u201d Anakin was relieved that Padme accepted his request and looked to his friends. \u201cAhsoka, Barriss you should go with Padme, I\u2019ll see to the council.\u201d  They parted ways and Ahsoka and Barriss followed Padme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to Padme\u2019s ship, Padme decided to break the awkward silence. \u201cAhsoka, I didn\u2019t recognize you with that disguise.\u201d Ahsoka just stared at her perplexed. \u201cWhat disguise, I\u2019m just wearing a cloak.\u201d She explained, Padme turned around and faced Ahsoka \u201cNot that, this.\u201d Padme said with a chuckle, giving the large mass under her cloak a pat. \u201cWhat is it, Its huge.\u201d Padme continued grasping the mass which caused Ahsoka to blush furiously, Barriss watching the incident with perverse interest. \u201cIt\u2019s not a disguise, its me!\u201d Ahsoka exclaimed, Padme\u2019s touch leaving her flustered. Padme recoiled in surprise at Ahsoka\u2019s response and as she processed what she said Padme became confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ahsoka groaned in frustration and then looked around suspiciously, making sure there was no one else in view. When she had determined the coast was clear, she pulled back her cloak showing Padme the massive orange swell of her stomach. Padme looked at Ahsoka\u2019s huge belly in frightful bewilderment, she looked up at Ahsoka\u2019s face and then glanced at Barriss, who also showed off her smaller but still heavily pregnant looking bulge. After recovering from Ahsoka\u2019s surprising reveal, Padme regained her composure and nervously asked. \u201cAhsoka what happened to you, you look heavy with many children, but I know that is not possible because I saw you just a few weeks ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering themselves back up Ahsoka said in irritation. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story senator, one that we can discuss it when we get to your ship. They quickly made their way to Padme\u2019s ship and settled into their quarters while the crew handled the ship. Once safely in Padme\u2019s room the girls finally relaxed. Padme faced Ahsoka and said. \u201cNow that we have some privacy, would be so kind as the tell me what happened Ms. Tano.\u201d Padme gasped as she noticed something, which left Ahsoka confused as to what was wrong, until she noticed a draft on her stomach. Her stomach was protruding from her cloak slightly, exposing a sliver of orange flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re growing!\u201d Padme gasped.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Barriss took the opportunity to change the subject. \u201cAllow me to explain senator Amidala.\u201d Barriss told Padme about what had happened and how she had found herself in this state because of Ahsoka. \u201cSo, you will continue to swell.\u201d Padme asked as she stared at Barriss\u2019s middle in strange fascination. \u201cYes, until we find a way to get the spirits to leave us, which hopefully we will, right Ahsoka.\u201d Barriss said, turning her attention to her friend. She blushed in embarrassment as she saw Ahsoka, who was lounging with her robe open, her large fecund mound on full display. \u201cPerhaps you should cover up Ahsoka, in case one of the crew checks in on us.\u201d Barriss stammered, which prompted Ahsoka to roll her eyes in irritation. \u201cI can\u2019t anymore Barriss and so what, I\u2019m tired of hiding this thing.\u201d Ahsoka said slapping her gut for emphasis, Barriss looked away embarrassed while Padme was intrigued. \u201cSo, what does it feel like?\u201d She inquired taking a seat near Ahsoka, Ahsoka contemplated how put it delicately. \u201cIt feels like a great fullness, the skin feels tight and is really sensitive, the slightest touch is an overwhelming sensation.\u201d Ahsoka explained her cheeks getting redder, noting Ahsoka\u2019s expression Padme pried further. \u201cIs it a pleasant sensation?\u201d Barriss replied before Ahsoka could. \u201cIt is an unpleasantly pleasant sensation.\u201d Barriss exclaimed with a sigh, as she caressed her own stomach sensually. Padme felt a twinge of envy as she stared at the swollen bellies of the young Jedi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at Naboo, Padme helped the girls get settled in, they were given rooms of their own and Padme even offered to get the girls some new clothes. Ahsoka was getting fitted for her new wardrobe with Padme and Barriss. The seamstress had just finished taking her measurements and left the girls alone for a moment. Ahsoka stared at her reflection and was displeased with what she saw, her stomach was huge making her appear heavy with sextuplets, her waist having more than doubled her width, her limbs were still strangely scrawny and her bust and butt had barely grown making the ridiculously large stomach even more out of place. \u201cGoodness Ahsoka, you look stunning.\u201d Padme said taking in Ahsoka\u2019s appearance. \u201cYes Ahsoka, you\u2019re practically glowing.\u201d Barriss added, Ahsoka was confused by the praise until she looked at her reflection again and noticed the sheen on her skin, the lack of stretch marks or blemishes, she looked simply radiant. As she stared entranced by her own body, she felt something stirring in her heart, she felt a slight sense of pride. When the seamstress returned, she took Barriss measurements and began to make them some clothes. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to be very roomy.\u201d Padme clarified to the seamstress who nodded in agreement, their new clothes wouldn\u2019t be finished until tomorrow so Padme bid them farewell and let Ahsoka and Barriss retire for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young Jedi headed to their rooms Barriss spoke up. \u201cAhsoka, have you felt different.\u201d She asked, which caused Ahsoka to think about it. \u201cWell, kind of I\u2019m gigantic, but for some reason I\u2019m not worried about the spirits making us grow.\u201d Ahsoka said as Barriss nodded in agreement. \u201cMe too, I not as big as you obviously, but I\u2019m not worried about it, in fact I might even accept it.\u201d The two Jedi continued to wonder about their strange lack of worry until they got to their rooms. They parted ways and went in their rooms. Barriss looked at her reflection in the bedroom mirror, a lustful desire built inside her as she groped her own maternal swell. She was so lost in fondling herself that she didn\u2019t notice as her control waned. Her turgid bulge which resembled a woman overdue with triplets swell slightly larger and larger. As Barriss came she collapsed on the bed in satisfaction, her stomach having inflated to the size of quadruplets. Meanwhile Ahsoka collapsed on her bed exhausted, she looked down at the massive mound that towered over her. \u201cArgh, I\u2019m a blimp!\u201d Ahsoka growled in frustration, she slipped deep into slumber, her thoughts filled with doubts.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hands both fell to her large, 8 month pregnant belly, before she grabbed her water cannister and drank the last  of its contents.<br>\r\nRey slid down a sandbank, towards her speeder, which she then loaded up with the scrap she had found. She carefully clambered on, wary of her enlarged middle, and sped away towards nima outpost, to sell her scrap. <br>\r\nWhen she arrived she grabbed her salvage and dragged it towards a small, sheltered stand with a queue stood outside of it. When she got to the front, she presented her wares to the alien in the stand.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve brought me today is worth... one quarter portion\u201d he said, grumpily.<br>\r\n\u201cOne quarter?\u201d Rey asked desperately.\u201dplease, i have a baby on the way\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI said one quarter portion\u201d the alien said, before shooing her away.<br>\r\nShe headed towards her speeder, and in turn towards home. She cooked her meal, which was barely enough for her and her baby, and sat outside, her hands exploring her gravid sphere. She parted her robes to reveal her bump, blemish free. Her pale skin was stretched tight as she ran her hands over it, savouring the peaceful feeling. Her belly button was stretched out on the front of her belly, and she absentmindedly played with it as she massaged, causing her to shiver a little. She didn\u2019t know how she got pregnant, just that she was and that she was due soon.</span></div></div>",

Her hands caressed every inch of it, the feeling pleasurable and enjoyable. She rubbed more vigorously and felt her belly move. It wasn\u2019t a kick, or if it was it didn\u2019t feel like one. Then she felt it again. It definitely wasn\u2019t a kick. She opened her eyes and looked down at her belly. Her belly, already quite large was expanding slowly, inflating like a balloon. She couldn\u2019t stop her hands from rubbing, as if she was being controlled by some unknown force, but she felt her belly growing tighter under her palms. Her belly kept growing gently for a time, until it stopped, looking much, much bigger than it had before.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat.. was... that?\u201d She said, out of breath.<br>\r\nShe inspected her belly curiously.

If the Resistance doesn't stop them, they'll take over the galaxy. Leia sent me. We need your help,\" Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked her over. \"I can't help you. You expect me to take on the First Order by myself? I can't be the one to shift the tide. And if the Resistance sent a girl with a gut to try to bring me back, they must be in worse shape than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey got flustered, putting a hand on her bloated middle. \"I...hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke walked off down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey refused to give up. She followed him as he fished, as he milked a large creature resting on the beach, and as he continued his trek around the island. As they walked through a grassy field, Rey stopped when she heard a voice. She followed it, and was led to a hollowed-out tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rey...\" it called out. It was the same voice she heard earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done well on your journey so far. Continue on your path. The Force will be balanced in a week's time...\" it concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what do you mean?\" she asked, but the voice didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeeper into the tree, she found a shelf covered with old books riddled with dust. The room suddenly grew darker, as a figure entered the room. It was Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I've been here before,\" Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been here for thousands of years. Holding these,\" he said, placing a hand on the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The old Jedi texts. The last of a failed religion. Like me. So who are you?\" Luke asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sent by the Resistance,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's so special about you? Where are you from?\" Luke wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere. Jakku,\" Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are <i>you</i> here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, looking for an answer. \"Because...something inside me has always been there, and now it's awake. I'm afraid, and I need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke nodded. \"You need a teacher. I can't do that for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You're not busy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I came here to die. It's time for the Jedi to end,\" he said, walking out of the tree.</span></div></div>",

She left, leading back into the bright sunlight, and walked back towards Lukes hut.<br>\r\nShe stood outside the hut, looking around. There was about seven or so huts dotted about, surrounding a small courtyard overlooking the sea. She walked over to the hut on the opposite sude of the yard to Lukes, gently opening the rusty door. Inside was an old stone bedframe and a stool. Unpacking what little she had, Rey set up the hut as hers, rolling out a bedroll and putting her bag down in the corner. <br>\r\nAs she sat down, Luke opened the door abruptly.<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow, at dawn. Meet me outside\u201d he said quickly.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to train me?\u201d Rey said, a smile breaking out on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cIm going to try\u201d Luke responded, leaving before Rey could say anymore.<br>\r\nShe looked outside a small window, noticing that it was starting to get dark, and started to undress. She took of her gloves and jacket, leaving her in a tank top. She looked down, conscious of the comment Luke had made earlier. Now that she thought about it, she did look significantly rounder around her midriff, which explained why her shirt was beginning to feel tight. She undid her belt, immediately feeling relief as her belly was freed. She put her hands to it, feeling it through her shirt gingerly. She lifted off her shirt and placed her hands on it warily. It didn\u2019t feel loose or jiggly like fat did. It felt tighter, like she was bloated, but it still felt different to even that. It stuck out around 4 inches, and was very lightly stretching her skin. She massaged it a little, trying to get rid of the bloat to no avail. She then noticed that her breasts had grown a little as well, her bra cutting into her shoulder a little more than usual, and they felt quite tender. She rubbed her breasts a little, allieviating the feeling.<br>\r\nHer stomach grumbled, and she grabbed some rations from her bag. She quickly unwrapped them and wolfed them down, quickly regretting eating them so fast, and then rembering that she had more. She went back for seconds, but realised about halfway through that her bump had gotten about 3/4s of an inch bigger, pushing out further. Rey lay down on her bed, a hand cradling her belly as she drifted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Afraid that Luke might reject her. Afraid that she might not be able to bring him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled, and she grabbed some more portions out of her bag, scarfing them down quickly. Rey had no idea why she was so hungry lately. As she munched on the food, an uneasy feeling washed over her. A feeling of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw him. Kylo Ren. He was there, staring directly at her. On instinct, she grabbed her blaster and fired at him. Once the smoke settled, she realized that he was gone. In fact, he was never really there at all. But it seemed so real. Rey looked up and saw the damage she had done. The shot had created a large hole in the upper corner of the stone hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey scrambled up, surprised that she felt a little heavy, and exited the hut. Outside, the frog-like caretakers were scrambling as they attempted to clean up the mess. Blanket still wrapped around her, Rey slowly approached the caretakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" she muttered, but they were too focused on the task at hand to pay attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that about?\" Luke asked, emerging from his hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...blaster went off while it was inspecting. Stupid mistake,\" Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke nodded. \"Get dressed and be ready to train,\" he said, returning to the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her quarters, Rey removed the blanket. That heaviness she felt earlier made sense. Her stomach had grown since last night. It looked like she had swallowed a small melon, her shirt revealing a sliver of pale flesh. It pushed out nearly ten inches now. Rey gently placed her fingers on her belly and pushed in, but it had little give. Slowly, she rubbed the bump, noting its roundness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey shook her head and grabbed her bag, taking out some robes. They were dark teal, and she was upset to see that her belly was pressed tightly against it. She sighed and exited the hut, ready to begin.</span></div></div>",

She was going slower than normal and felt more out of breath, but she knew her belly was causing that, so she thought she\u2019d burn off some of it on the way up. Every time she took a step, her shirt would ride up a little more over her belly, widening the sliver of pale skin revealed to the cold breeze. It eventually rode up to just past her belly button, at which point she pulled it down in frustration, carrying on the path. The climb was long, but eventually she reached the top. She saw a cave entrance and entered, warily.<br>\r\nInside the cave was a large open room with a small pool in the middle and another hole in the wall leading to a ledge on the outside. In the centre of the pool was a mosaic of a Jedi, half dark, half light sat with a lightsaber. The room was near silent, save for Rey\u2019s own footsteps. Sunlight shone in from the ledge, dividing the room into light and dark. <br>\r\nRey walked out onto the ledge and saw Luke waiting for her. He invited her to sit on a small, flat rock on the centre of the ledge.<br>\r\nAs she sat down, she was conscious of her belly filling up her lap, reaching down her thighs and resting on them. It felt heavier than it had earlier, fuller and tighter. Her shirt had rolled up again, revealing an inch of creamy white skin. She noticed Luke staring at it suspiciously, bur choosing not to comment on it. She tugged at her shirt to no avail. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the force?\u201d Luke asked, drawing attention away from her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thing Jedi use to...lift rocks?\u201d Rey replied, sounding unsure of her answer.<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Everything you just said was wrong\u201d Luke admonished firmly.\u201dIt\u2019s more complex than that. Reach out and feel it\u201d<br>\r\nRey closed her eyes and lifted her arm, not hearing Luke sigh deeply. She felt something moving between her fingers, brushing against them softly.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I feel it!\u201d She said to Luke.<br>\r\n\u201cReally reach out\u201d he replied.<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt a smack on her hand, opening her eyes to see Luke with a bundle of leaves in his hand. Only now did she understand what he meant by \u2018reach out\u2019.<br>\r\n\u201cTry again\u201d he said dryly.<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and put her hand to the ground, waiting for something. Then she felt it. The island, everything on it, flowing with the force. She could feel every wave lapping at the rocky base of the island, and every flower quivering in the wind. It was peaceful and harmonious. Cold. She felt cold. A hole, with dark black plants growing out of it was in front of her, filling her with dread and fear. She heard a quiet crack as it got closer to her. <br>\r\nSuddenly she was back on the ledge. She saw Luke, recoiled in something akin to horror, and a large crack in the ledge.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d She said, scared of what had happened.</span></div></div>",

It does now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exited the cave and retreated to his hut, leaving Rey alone on the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey decided to return to the Falcon for now. It was raining, so she adorned a poncho that thankfully covered her belly. It was actually the first time that she had ever experienced a rainfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was covered by the Falcon as she stood underneath it, extending a hand as she let water droplets gently beat against it. She smiled, finding comfort in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewbacca exited the ship and took a few steps down the ramp He growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still can't reach the Resistance?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey nodded. \"Keep at it. If you get through, check their status. And ask about Finn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wookie growled and went back into the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to feel the rain, then paused. That feeling from earlier that morning returned. She turned around and saw Kylo Ren again. Now that she got a good look at him, it was clear that he wasn't really there. His outline was blurry, unfocused. He spoke up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is the Force connecting us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey couldn't hold back her anger that rose up just from seeing him. \"Murderous snake! You're too late! I found Skywalker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he tell you what happened? The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know everything that I need to about you,\" Rey seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do? Ah, you do,\" Kylo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over her. \"You look...fuller than I remembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey crossed her arms. \"And you look more cut up than I remember! Don't forget who gave you that scar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylo put his hand over the scar that ran down his eye. He was about to make a comeback, but he paused, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I sense eleven life forms on your end?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey raised an eyebrow. \"What...there are hundreds of animals on this island. I'm not sure why you're surprised that you can sense more than just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey looked around, expecting to see a few Porgs resting in the surrounding grass, but there weren't any to be found. She looked back at Kylo, but he was gone.</span></div></div>",

She kept having to stop and take a breath, putting a hand to her swollen belly, eventually making it back to her hut, though significantly wetter than when she had left.<br>\r\nShe stepped inside to the warm room, shivering as she shook off her drenched poncho, dropping it in the corner of her room. She noticed that it had done little to protect her clothes from the rain, so she began to strip off, starting with her shirt. She struggled a little to pull it over her belly, which looked a little bigger. She let her mind drift as she kept taking off more clothes, struggling to pull down her trousers, which felt a lot tighter around the waist and hips. Eventually all she was left in was he underwear which were thankfully dry. She inspected her body closely. Her breasts felt heavy and full, and looked a good size or two larger than her original size. She ran her hands over them, shivering as she brushed the sensetive skin. She moved down to her hips, which had widened, looking much more shapely than ever before. Her Panties dug into her skin, but only a little. She turned and inspected her rear, which had also grown, giving her an overall more feminine look to her.<br>\r\nThen came her belly. It stuck out about 13 inches, pushing down her panties. Her belly button was almost completely flat, only an incredibly shallow indent remaining. She poked her belly, feeling no give to it but only taut skin. Her belly was still blemish free, she thought, looking on the bright side. She moved her hands across her belly, caressing it curiosly. She Brushed her belly button and shivered slightly from the feeling. It was heavy as well, putting a strain on her back, so she cradled it, lifting the weight from her back slightly.<br>\r\nShe lowered herself onto her bed, sitting on the edge. Then she felt something. It didn\u2019t feel like something she had felt before, like a stomach ache. It felt like a squirm. Inside her belly. She lifted her hands away from it, scared about what had just happened. Then she felt it again, a little harder this time, lasting longer than before. She tried to think of what it could have been, eventually putting it down to her being hungry, her belly just telling her differently. <br>\r\nShe leaned into her bag amd pulled out the last 5 portions form it. She ate them, slower than before but still quickly, leaving crumbs littering her belly. As she finished the last one, she brushed as many of the crumbs as she could off the surface of her belly. Sighing, she grabbed her shirt from today, which was now dry. It hugged her belly, clinging to as much of the bump as it could. It left around two and a half inches of creamy skin exposed, and as she felly asleep she put a hand to it, rubbing it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Rey woke up, and groggily sat up, still wrapped up in her warm blanket. She yawned, throwing off the blanket as she did. She looked down and almost squealed in shock. Overnight her belly had grown, now sticking about 15 inches out from her body. Her shirt was now just over her belly button, trying its hardest to cover it. She felt her belly button, now completely flat, and her belly, feeling tighter than it did last night. She felt it squirm again, reminding her to eat. She looked in her bag and remembered, she had eaten the last of her portions last night. She sighed heavily.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to find something on the island\u201d she whispered to her belly.</span></div></div>",

She trudged over to Luke's hut and knocked on the door, but there was no reply. Rey sighed and turned around, but stopped when her she stepped on a stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was long and thin, yet sturdy. Carefully, she whittled down the edge of the stick, converting it into a spear. She thrusted it forward a few times, judging its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll work great!\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side down the mountain was where she saw Luke catch fish, and on the other was where the Thala-siren was where she could catch milk. That could definitely come in handy, but she needed food more than anything. The fish would come first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the mountain Rey went, eventually reaching a cove. Thankfully it was sunny today, and she could see many large fish swimming in the churning water. Rey caught her breath, hand resting on her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid thing,\" she muttered, slowly caressing the massive, tight mound of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey found a flat area of land that touched the ocean. She made her way to it and brandished her spear. She took a stab at the water, missing a passing fish. Then she took another stab. Another miss. A few moments later, she saw a huge fish swimming towards her. She took a wild strike, so hard that the weight of her belly almost sent her into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught herself before she fell in. \"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey panted heavily, throwing the spear to the side in frustration. \"Forget this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey stood up and extend her hand out. The water in front began to stir, and soon enough four fish emerged from the water, flopping to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. That was easy enough...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so big that she had to carry them with both hands. As she turned to go back up the mountain, she felt one of the fish resting on her belly, its slimy scales pressing against her taut middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" she grunted, walking back up the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey was predictably winded once she reached the huts. She put the fish in her hut and went back to the clearing. She looked at Luke's hut, and saw that the door was open, but he wasn't there. At least he was out and about. Once she fully caught her breath, she went down the other side of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thala-siren sat lazily on the beach, its udders exposed. The massive creature turned its head and looked at Rey, grunting. Rey slowly stepped towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...just gonna...get some milk from you...\" Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got right up next to it and grabbed her bag. She fished trough it, looking for a jar to collect the milk in. There wasn't one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...You have got to be kidding me!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey sighed and trudged back up the mountain. She felt like she could collapse once she finally reached her hut. Her hands rested on the small of her back, only accentuating her belly more. She wiped the sweat at her forehead and looked down at her massive stomach as it glistened in the sunlight. It rumbled loudly, and the squirming feeling returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the hut, she found a jar that would be perfect to use. But was it worth it to go back down there?</span></div></div>",

Her shirt, already struggling to cover her belly, rode up just beneath her breasts, revealing her round belly glistening with sweat. <br>\r\nEventually the ground evened out into the rocky outcrop, and sat in the centre was the Thala-siren. It was sat lazily, laying back in the sun breathing heavily. Rey approached it slowly, trying not to spook it. It turned towards her and grunted loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I just need some milk\u201d Rey said calmly, even though she was panicking inside.\u201djust gonna... go down here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast bucked and snorted aggressively, causing Rey to fall backwards landing on her rear.

She squatted next to it, her belly hanging between her legs, and reached for an udder, holding out the jar. She couldn\u2019t reach it and grunted in frustration, adjusted her position and tried again. She got it, filling the jar with the green coloured milk. She got up slowly and began to walk away.<br>\r\nAs she started walking away she turned to look at the Thala-siren, specifically it\u2019s udders. She glanced at her own and noticed just how much bigger they had gotten, almost busting out of her shirt. Looking down she could see a lot of cleavage, and under that, belly. She sighed, preparing herself for the long walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to her hut, she was exhausted, having been up and down the same cliff path in a short time. Her body glistened with a sheen of sweat, her belly shiny in the sunlight. She wiped off the sweat from her forehead, and crossed her hands on her belly, sitting down on the bed. Her feet felt awful, having been on her feet almost all day. She struggled to take her shoes off, her belly gotting in the way, and her feet were... swollen? Her ankles were thicker than usual, and heavier as well. She rubbed them, lifting some pf the pain from them.<br>\r\nHer focus turned to her belly, which now seemed bigger than when she was last inside. Sticking out a good 17 inches now, it felt a lot heavier and tighter. She grabbed a towel and dried it of sweat. The rubbing felt comforting to her.<br>\r\nSuddenly her stomach grumbled, rather loudly and she remembered why she had been on her feet so much. She looked at the fire, where she had lef the fish to cook when she went for milk. They looked edible, and that was all that mattered. She took them off the spit and chowed down, getting through three of her four fish in quick succesion. She grabbed the jar of milk and chugged half of ir down. It tasted sweeter than she had expected, pleasantly surprising her. She stopped drinking and took a breath. <br>\r\nShe was peeling off her sweaty shirt when she heard a knock at the door.<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d She queried.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Luke. Our next lesson starts tomorrow afternoon. Be there as soon as you can\u201d he replied.<br>\r\nShe heard him walk away to his hut and close the door, so she knew not to respond. Rey lay down on her bed, too hot for the covers, holding her belly. She felt it squirm and move, and was both scared and curious as to what it was. She drifted off to sleep, holding her belly, kicking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up the next morning feeling refreshed. She sat up and smiled little. Or at least she tried to. Something heavy was holding her down. She looked at her belly to see that it had grown overnight, gaining about 5 extra inches while she slept. Her belly button was still a flat mark on her belly. She explored her new roundness with her hands, caressing every bit of it she could reach. She couldn\u2019t see her feet anymore now. Now she was worrying, properly. If she kept going like this, she\u2019d be massive in only a few days. Then her stomach grumbled, low and loud. She needed to eat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The decision to get more portions from the Falcon was an easy one. Rey couldn't repeat what she went through yesterday. From where she was it would be a shorter walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext order of business was to decide what to wear. It was no secret that what she'd been wearing the last few days wasn't fitting her well now. In her pack was a pair of gray and blue robes. She went back and forth, and ultimately decided on her previous attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled her shirt down over her breasts, it didn't cover her belly at all, leaving it fully exposed. Rey's breasts nearly bubbled out of her top. After she shimmied into her pants, she saw that her butt pressed tightly against the brown fabric, its curves presented clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself, her hands running along the sides of her belly as those stirring movements returned. Her stomach let out a rumble that echoed through the hut. Rey sighed heavily and slowly began her trek down the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was a shorter walk, Rey was still exhausted when she reached the ship. She panted, hands on her thighs, which was difficult given the size of her belly. Once she finally caught her breath, she went up the ramp and into the ship. Her gait was different now. Slower, more methodical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey nearly screamed in shock when she entered the Falcon. Porgs. Everywhere. Chewing out the cables in the walls. Resting in nests made in open compartments. It was madness. Rey slowly made her way through the ship to find the rations. On her way, she saw Chewie sleeping on a bunk bed, a baby Porg resting on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only shake her head. She grabbed a handful of rations and sat down in the rounded booth near the chess table. She devoured the food, her appetite seemingly endless. Finally, Rey had her fill. The squirming inside her magnificently round belly had subsided for now. She slowly began to rub her stomach , getting in a bit of a daze sash got lost in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey didn't even notice as Chewbacca approached her slowly. He growled, a hint of confusion in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young scavenger looked down at her belly, placing a gentle hand on it. \"I...I don't know, Chewie. I hope I'm alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nInside her hut, Rey placed the rations she had brought back with her on the floor. She looked out the window and saw the sun. It was just beginning to go down, meaning it was time for the next lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey went to the Jedi cave, where Luke was waiting. When he saw her amble in, his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Master Skywalker,\" she said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rey...is everything okay?\" he asked, a hint of concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded quickly, trying to get change topics. \"Yes, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down she knew that something was seriously wrong. Luke raised an eyebrow, but nevertheless began the lesson as he walked around the shallow pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that they're extinct, the Jedi are romanticized. Strip away the myth, and you'll see that their true legacy is failure. Hubris filled them all,\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true,\" Rey spoke up, placing one hand on the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At their height, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise and create the Empire. A Jedi master let Darth Vader be created.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey shook her head. \"But it was a Jedi who saved him. He was the most hated man in the galaxy, but you saw that there was conflict. You saw that he could be turned back to the light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke nodded. \"And so I became a legend. There was balance for many years. Until Ben came along. With that Skywalker blood. I thought I could train him. Leia and Han trusted me. I took him, and a dozen others, and formed a temple. But I saw the darkness rising in him, and it was too late for me to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to confront him,\" Luke began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey could see it happen. She saw Luke standing over Ben inside his hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he turned on me,\" he concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grabbed his lightsaber and attempted to strike Luke, who blocked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben, no!\" Luke screamed in the vision as the hut collapsed around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must have thought I was dead, because when I woke up, the temple was burning. He vanished with some of my students, and slaughtered the rest,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke collapsed to the ground next to R2, watching the temple burn. \"It was my fault. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Legend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision ended, and Rey returned to the cave. She stepped closer to Luke. \"We need a legend. I need someone to show me my place in all this. And you didn't fail Kylo. He failed you. I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked into her eyes, then looked down. Tears welled in his eyes as he exited the cave.</span></div></div>",

She walked out of the cave, hands on the small of her back accentuating her already large belly. The breeze was cold on her belly, giving her goosebumps all over it\u2019s surface. She rubbed it with her hands in an attempt to warm it up, feeling a little difference, but not much.<br>\r\nWhen she got back to her hut, she was glad to be inside again. She warm herself up by the fire, and wrapped herself up in her blanket. Then she saw him. Ren. He was shirtless, and turned around to face her, showing off his toned body. Rey looked away a little, not sure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe force keeps connecting us\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you please put a shirt on?\u201d Rey responded, beginning to blush a little out of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem tense.\u201d Kylo stated.\u201dIs everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do people keep asking me that! Im fine, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me!\u201d Rey responded, exasperated and a little angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so then\u201d Kylo said nonchalantly.\u201d How\u2019s your training going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your business\u201d Rey snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he tell you yet. What happened that night?\u201d Kylo asked, curios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe told me that he sensed darkness in you, and when he confronted you, you turned on him, and burned the temple\u201d Rey said, venom in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he told you?\u201d Kylo said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey could picture it as he described it. He had woken up to Luke stood over him, lightsaber drawn to strike him. \u201cI was defending myself. He wanted to kill me\u201d<br>\r\nRey didn\u2019t believe a word of it. Why would he tell her the truth, surely he was lying to sway her to his side. As she looked up to speak to him again, she saw that he was gone and she was alone again.<br>\r\nShe sat on her bed, ane unwrapped herself from the blanket, revealing her swollen form. She felt her belly gingerly, pressing it occasionally and patting it, feeling where the skin was tightest. She peeled off her shirt, freeing her breasts from it, and lay back to sleep, her hands still exploring her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up the next morning, knowing what was coming. She could tell without even looking down. She had grown overnight, again, feeling heavier than she remembered. She lifted her covers to reveal her belly, now sticking out a good 24-25 inches. She gasped at how tight it felt now, and just how large it was. She heaved herself off the bed, and grabbed a pair of dark brown pants. She hiked them up her legs, straining to get them over her rear. When she did, she went to button them up but duscovered that the buttons could no longer reach eachother. Sighing in reaignation, she left it as it was, knowing that none of her other pairs would fit. She found a loose shirt that covered her ample cleavage and a small portion of belly. She grabbed a few portions before she left, wolfing them down as she walked.<br>\r\nShe knocked on Lukes door to no response. Without him there wasn\u2019t a lot she could do, training or belly considered. She wandered the island and found a small patch of beach, cut off from the rest of the island by high cliffs. It was private, and that was all that mattered. At the bottom, Rey sat, tired, taking off her clothes. Her shirt came off with relative ease, but her pants required a little more work. After a brief struggle, she managed to get them off, standing in only her underwear. She unclipped her bra and felt a huge relief as she freed her breasts from it. She attempted to slip off her panties a few times, eventually getting them off. She stood, naked and heavy, and walked into the water.<br>\r\nIt was cold at first, but she adjusted quickly. When she reached her crotch, she walked slowly, the cold making her shiver in more ways than one. The feeling if the water enveloping her belly gave her a similar feeling. The water made her feel light, lifting the weight of her belly off her legs and back. She inspected her huge belly, rubbing and massaging it, lathering it in water, cleaning the dirt from the previous few days. She massaged her breasts, cleaning them and lifting some of the strain off herself. Her body had changed a lot from when she arrived. Everything was bigger abd more sensitive, and her hair felt thicker as she brushed her hands through it. She sigged, not knowing what to do.</span></div></div>",

She heaved her heavy body out of the water and waddled towards her clothes, sitting next to them. She grabbed a towel and dried herself off, rubbing her belly thoroughly, trying to dry every part of it. Finishing, she grabbed her shirt and pulled it over her head, and over her breasts. By this point, it was more of an over glorified bra, only covering just above her stretched out belly button. She sighed as she grabbed her pants and tried to tug them up her legs. Try as she might, it was no easy process with her belly obstructing her view. Finally reaching her thighs, she pulled them up over her hips, constricting them slightly, not bothering to button them up as she would never be able to anyway. Grabbing the rest of her stuff, she left to go back to her hut.<br>\r\nAfter an arduous hike back to her hit, she had grabbed the lightsaber and headed to somewhere empty where she could train, eventually finding a plateau with some rocky formations at one end. She drew the sabre and ignited the blade, and started with some basic parries and blocks. Her belly put her off balance but she worked through it, managing to practice fairly well. She walked over to the rocks and began to swing at them, narrowly avoiding slicing them in two. She started swinging more aggressively, getting closer to the rocks a she did. Suddenly she lost her balance, one twist sending her rounded form stumbling at the rocks. She lifted her hand to stop herself from falling and cut clean through the rock. She watched as it slid down the cliff, crushing the wagon of one of the nuns of the island. She recoiled in embarrassment and lifted her form up off the floor. Tired and embarrassed, she left to go rest.<br>\r\nShe got back to her hut just as the sun was setting, and sat down to watch the sunset as she ate her dinner. Finishing quickly, she undressed and lay in bed, a gentle hand on her belly as she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey woke up in the morning to the chirping of porgs. <i>Louder than usual</i>, she thought to herself. As she opened her eyes she looked down at her belly to see a group of porgs nestled against her belly, smiling a little at the scene. She noticed that her belly had grown significantly overnight, taking up most of her frame now. She rubbed it curiously, feeling her tight skin and bulging bump. She sat up slowly, disturbing the porgs nestled in, and grabbed a few portions from her pack for breakfast. As she ate, wrapped up in a blanket, she felt something on the island call to her</span></div></div>",

Just a few days ago that she didn't have this huge belly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rey...come find your destiny...\" the voice whispered in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she knew where she had to go: the hole that she saw during her first lesson. Of course, it was the same hole that Luke warned her not to go to. But she couldn't pass up an opportunity to find out what was down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey decided to get dressed. No shirt she owned would fit her anymore. Rey put on another bra, one that left her breasts bubbling over them. Her belly was completely exposed, but it would be anyways, shirt or no shirt. For some form of cover, she put on her grey jacket. Her stomach extended far past it. She struggled into her pants and put on her boots, her swollen feet and ankles causing some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing already heavy, Rey exited her hut. She looked towards Luke's hut before she left. Predictably, he was nowhere to be found. She sighed and went down the mountain. It was cloudy, and thunder rumbled in the sky above her, so she didn't have to worry about the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the rocky outcropping overlooking the violent ocean. The hole was almost beckoning to her. Rey took a deep breath, her hands rubbing the sides of her belly. She winced as she felt some squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey really was massive now. Almost impossibly so. She could just barely connect her fingers if she tried to meet them around her popped-out belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly waddled to the front of the hole, her feet resting on the dark plants that grew out of it. Rey could make out some sort of light down the hole, as if something was shimmering. She got on her knees to get a better look, groaning as her stomach pressed against the slimy plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whispering noise came from the hole that she couldn't quite make out, followed by a brisk, cold wind. It was so surprising and strong that it completely knocked her off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey tumbled down the hole. \"Gaaaah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heavy body landed in a body of water like a rock. Then, she felt weightless, as if the weight she had gained in her belly, breasts, and butt were gone. But she didn't know how to swim. Rey quickly surfaced, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weightless feeling didn't go away as she swam towards a rocky surface that she climbed up. She looked over her body. It was back to normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was skinny again! Her stomach was perfectly flat. \"Is it really gone?\" she asked herself as she felt her now toned middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall had knocked her bun loose, so she gathered her hair in her hands and slicked it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey looked forward. The wall ahead of her was almost reflective, like a mirror. She saw her reflection in it. As she got closer, she saw more reflections of her. There had to be dozens, at least. Rey put a hand against the shattered, glass-like wall. Her reflection did as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she touched the wall, she was suddenly on the other side. She turned around, and saw that there were hundreds of her that had also turned around. Where did they lead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey raised a hand and snapped, and so did the others. They were connected somehow. As strange as the situation was, she felt oddly serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her mind, she jumped forward, attempting to take over the perspective of one of her reflections that was closer to the end. As she did that, she felt heavier. Now, she had a slight bump. Similar to what she looked like as she arrived on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey jumped forward again, and her belly was even bigger. She continued to jump forward, and she continued to grow. But she was getting closer to another wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one looked different. There was nothing there, but the wall seemed murkier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to keep going. Maybe she could find her mother or father? Finally, she had reached the front of her reflections. Her belly size was as big as it was before she fell in the hole, maybe a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, Rey lifted a hand. \"Let me see them. My parents,\" Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched the wall. \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadowy figure slowly walked towards her on the other side. They were holding something. A baby? As soon as the figure got directly in front of her. They put a hand on the glass with their free hand. The shadow evaporated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...her? Just a reflection of Rey, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey dropped to her knees, and the figure disappeared. She was back in the cave now, as the waves beat against the rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd find answers...\" she whispered, her hands cradling her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey returned to her hut, physically and emotionally exhausted. She sat by the fire, munching on some portions. She was barely hungry. If anything, she felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, she thought that she would find something in the cave, but now she was left with more answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished her dinner and put out the fire. Rey removed her clothes and lay back on her bed, pulling the blanket over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the cover, she slowly rubbed her belly, as she felt the squirming sensation under her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this happening to me?\" she whispered, trying no to cry as she fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She sighed, pushing herself up to sit back against the wall.<br>\r\nShe peeled of the blanket, revealing her taut mound of a belly. Predictably, it had grown during the night, taking up even more space, and blocking her view of any of her lower body. She let her hands explore every inch of it, caressing it carefully and meticulously, pushing against the tight skin. Her belly button was now long gone, now a small bump remained, like a tiny mountain on her enormous belly. Her breasts were bare and extremely heavy, hanging off her frame against her belly, and they had become increasingly sensitive, any touch making her shiver or making them sore.<br>\r\nAs she was exploring her growing body she felt it. One of the squirms. Except now it felt stronger, and faster too. She looked down at her belly and poked a spot curiously. A brief kick distorted the spot, pushing out against her belly. Soon her belly was becoming littered with the distortions, some small some big, but there nonetheless.<br>\r\nTired, and slightly scared, Rey heaved herself out of bed, taking several tries Before success. She waddled slowly to her pack and grabbed a few portions out for breakfast. She ate slowly, watching as her belly shifted and moved, curious as to what was going on inside of herself. The food seemed to calm it down, the kicks becoming less frequent.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat is happening to me?,\u201d Rey asked, hoping the mysterious voice would answer her, but having no luck.<br>\r\nHaving finished her meal, she sat up, deciding to get dressed. Struggling to pull her pants up her legs was made harder by the fact that she couldn't see what she was doing at all. Eventually, she managed to have them up, covering what needed to be covered. She put on one of her bras, which cut into her shoulders and pushed her breasts up, bubbling over the top of the bra. Feeling the cold even from inside her hut she knew she should probably try and cover her belly, somehow. Grabbing some spare robes she had brought, she tied them into a makeshift shirt that hung over her belly, leaving a lot still exposed, but covered most of it. She sighed at what she must look like, barely fitting into any of her clothes, but moved on and left the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Rey had found a little quiet spot to sit and watch the sea, not too far from the hut. She sat cross-legged, her belly dominating her lap and stopping her from being able to lean forward. She watched the sea and sky as she rubbed her massive belly, deep in her thoughts.<br>\r\n\u201dWhy me\u201d she whispered. \u201dWhy me\u201d<br>\r\nA solitary tear ran down her face, followed by a few more. Rey pushed herself up and ran to likes hut, knocking on the door nervously.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat is it no-\u201d Luke was unable to finish his sentence. Before him stood Rey, her belly huge, crying. \u201dC-come in then\u201d<br>\r\nRey could only nod a little as she stepped into his hut and collapsed onto the bed.<br>\r\n\u201dSo what's wrong?\u201d Luke asked, trying to sound nicer than he normally did.<br>\r\nRey sniffled through the tears. \u201dI-I don't know w-what's happening to me\u201d she managed to get out before another bout of tears.<br>\r\nLuke didn't want to be rude, especially not right now. But to him, it was obvious what was going on.<br>\r\n\u201dYou know you're pregnant, right?\u201d he said, trying to avoid causing the girl any more tears.<br>\r\n\u201dI-I\u2019m what?\u201d Rey asked.<br>\r\n\u201dYou know when a woman has a child?\u201d He said, her look telling him that she was completely in the dark. \u201dYou're carry a baby, or probably babies\u201d <br>\r\nRey was confused. Growing up on jakku, she had never really learnt much about babies and pregnancy. Sure, she had seen and even known a couple of scavengers who had been pregnant, but she never knew the symptoms or anything other than that it happened.<br>\r\n\u201dI-I'm pregnant?\u201d even the word sounded alien to her.<br>\r\nLuke nodded. \u201dYou know how that works, right? Two people get together an-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dI know what sex is\u201d Rey snapped. \u201dbut, I...I've never done it, ever\u201d<br>\r\nLuke was baffled at this point. The girl didn't realise that she was pregnant, and now she was claiming there was no fath-. He stopped. This sounded familiar. His own father had had only one parent. <br>\r\n\u201dRey, how did this happen?\u201d he asked cautiously.<br>\r\n\u201dAbout a week a-ago, before I left the resistance base, a voice talked to me and told me I was special. I-I was enveloped in some sort of light and woke up a few seconds later feeling ill\u201d she said, recalling the events of the past week.<br>\r\nLuke's suspicions were confirmed. It was the force. Maybe there was hope. \u201dRey, you've been chosen by the force and made pregnant. I don't know why, but you have\u201d<br>\r\nRey was silent. It explained a lot. The force had picked her, to carry children, but to do what else. Her mind was racing with questions.<br>\r\n\u201dWill you still train me?\u201d she asked quietly.<br>\r\n\u201dMaybe I will, maybe I won't\u201d Luke said, slightly disjointed from the conversation.\u201dI need to think\u201d</span></div></div>",

The weight in her belly was simply too much for her. Inside, Rey shut the door behind her and sat heavily on her bed. Her lips trembled as she looked at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pregnant. Was the force truly the cause of this? She knew next to nothing of pregnancy, and even less about how the baby would arrive. Rey shook her head. Even with her limited knowledge of pregnancy, she knew she was far too big to be only having one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey spend the rest of the day eating and looking at her belly. She was starting to get low on portions. Though it wasn't that late in the day, she was drained from finding out what was really happening to her. Rey lay down on her bed, somehow able to fall asleep despite the constant kicking of her offspring inside her rapidly growing womb. She didn't even bother to remove her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Rey wasn't surprised to find that she had grown. At this point, she'd be surprised to find that she didn't get bigger. Her stomach pushed her robes even further apart. The kicks were strong, too, and more frequent. Rey struggled to sit up, and grabbed her pack and scrounged out the last few portions that remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunger was back, as her growling belly displayed. She devoured them quickly, which settled the movement down for now. It was raining heavily outside. She didn't even need to look to see it, as the heavy beating of rain could be heard from inside the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most of the day, she sat on her bed, looking over her body. Rey eyed a pile of rocks in the corner. She put out a hand and tried to lift them using the Force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocks jiggled slightly. She tried again, exerting more effort. This time, the rocks floated into the air, and she moved them around the room, eventually setting them back down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to get good at this...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hours drew on, she was starting to get hungry. The kicks were returning now, and they were harder than ever. The babies, however many there were inside her, needed to eat. Two particularly hard ones to her ribs and bladder caused her to grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey rubbed her belly. \"Oof! Please, please go easy on your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her massive, shifting belly. \"Mother...I'm really going to be a mother. But when are you going to get here, little ones? I suppose you're not so little. I don't know how much bigger I can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, she was going to get much, much bigger. Her belly groaned and gurgled loudly again. She needed to eat, but she was out of portions. She'd have to go to the Falcon, but it was still raining heavily. Perhaps she'd wait for it to let up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour passed and the rain continued to fall. Rey waddled around her hut, hands pressed into her back. She was starving now and she was definitely bigger than she was when she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pounding at her door caused her to jump. \"Hello?\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Luke! Open up!\" the fallen Jedi said on the other side. Rey waddled as quickly as she could and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was absolutely drenched, but he was holding a bundle of large fish in his hands. He stepped inside and placed them on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is this for me?\" she asked, tears beginning to fill her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I also stopped by the Falcon. Chewie says hello. He said he's worried about you.\" he said, tossing some portions next to Rey's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you went out and got food for me?\" Rey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shrugged his shoulders. \"You needed help. It was the least I could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey started to cry. Her colossal belly collided into him as she pulled him in for a hug. \"Oh, thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke patted her on the back. \"It's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug ended, and Luke looked her over as he put the fish on the fire. \"You got bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey nodded, sitting down on the bed and rubbing her belly. \"It's a common occurrence nowadays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in silence for a few minutes. Luke removed the fish from the fire and sat next to Rey on the bed. He handed her one of the fish, and she quickly dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...so will you still train me?\" she asked in between large bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke sighed. \"I will. Pregnant or not, it's important that you learn the ways of the Force. Maybe given your circumstance, it might be vital that you do. But we have to be careful. You look like you could give birth at any moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey nodded, rubbing a part of her belly where one of the babies was particularly active. \"What happens then? When I give birth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked at her, wide-eyed. \"I...perhaps that's a conversation to have another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to eat and talk, sharing stories that caused them to laugh or cry. Luke told her about some of the adventures he went on with Han and Leia, and she listened on attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fire began to die down, Luke stood up. \"Okay, it's time for me to head back. I'm too old to be up this late. Tomorrow night, I'll give you the third lesson. Be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be. Thanks again. For everything,\" Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke smiled weakly as he left the hut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Luke left, Rey didn\u2019t stay up much longer. She sat for a while on her bed, rubbing her belly, feeling better about things after the evening. Before long she was growing tired, and she settled down in bed, on her side with her hands caressing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of pouring rain awoke her. <i>I guess I'll be inside today then</i> she thought to herself, wrapping her covers tighter around her body. She began to get annoyed when she couldn't cover her whole belly, leaving a large portion of it exposed. Opening her eyes, Rey looked down at her swollen belly, anticipating some growth. She was right, but \u2019some\u2019 was an understatement. Her belly now completely dwarfed the rest of her frame, completely obscuring her legs. She pushed her back up against the wall and inspected her belly. She strained to reach her belly button, only just feeling it beginning to pop out. She couldn't even wrap both hands around underneath it, her fingertips barely even meeting, which didn't fill her with hope for getting dressed. As she continued rubbing, she could feel shifts and kicks from the life, or lives, inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dit would be nice if you would stop kicking me,\u201d she said to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her bra from her bedside and attempted to put it on, straining to fit her engorged breasts into the small cups. She decided to give up on it, grabbing a shirt and using it as a bra, because there was no way it was going to cover her belly. She turned herself, dangling her legs off the bed and tried to stand up. Having no success she tried again and heaved herself up, throwing herself off balance as she stood up. She waddled to her pack and grabbed some of the fish left over from the night before and began eating her breakfast, resting a hand gently on her belly as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, she could hear movement and talk outside of the hut. Curious, she opened the door to see a group of nuns cleaning the square. They stopped and stared at Rey, and particularly at her belly, looking at it as if it was alien to them. One of them muttered something to the others and they began chattering amongst themselves, before turning to Rey and opening something on their cart. One of them pulled some large looking robes from the cart and another pulled out a basket of food and offered them to her. Not wanting to cry again, Rey smiled at them and thanked them before taking their offerings. They seemed satisfied and they may have smiled back, but they left before Rey could get a proper look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her door, Rey inspected the gifts she had been given. The basket had been filled generously with all kinds of foods, some looking less appetising than others, but most of it looked very appealing to Rey. The robes she had been given were all fairly large, in several colours ranging from browns to greys. They looked large enough to cover Rey's belly, more so than all of her other clothes. She pulled out a sandy coloured tunic and pulled it over her head, fitting loosely over her figure. It hung over her belly but covered it nonetheless. She wrapped a belt between her breasts and belly to secure the loose shirt, accentuating both slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was spent looking through her new clothes and trying them on, practising lifting different objects with the force, ranging from rocks to her bed, and eating. By the time evening had fallen, Rey was sat on her bed, wrapped in her blanket, trying to meditate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou look well,\u201d he said, monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey opened her eyes and saw him stood there. Kylo Ren. His scar looked to be healing quickly, but still red and angry across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhy are you here,\u201d she said tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI don't know. It's the force, it's drawing us together\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201dyou seem troubled?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI, I just, saw something. In a cave, it showed me something. I asked for answers and got more questions\u201d she replied, remember her profound experience in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dwhat were you shown,\u201d Ren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThis-\u201d Rey said as she peeled back the covers and her robes to reveal her bulging pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylo looked shocked. He didn't understand, she wasn't this big when they last talked, and it had been only a few days since then. He reached a hand out towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dMay I?\u201d he asked, more courteous than Rey had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSure\u201d Rey said, offering her belly to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly he lay a gloved hand to the tight surface of her belly. The first contact was electrifying. She could feel what he felt and remember what he remembered. She saw the hut where he was sleeping, Luke stood over him with his sabre ignited. So he wasn't lying. He had been defending himself. Rey felt betrayed, lied to by Luke, and felt for the lives inside her. The- the ten. She remembered. Kylie had mentioned eleven on her end once. Her babies we're the other ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was rather serene. Kylo was feeling her swollen belly, and she was calm with it. Suddenly it all came crashing down, as Luke burst in, shattering the peace. The hut shattered around them, kylo disappearing, leaving Rey and Luke in the battering rain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did you try to murder him?\" she asked, anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave this island! Now!\" Luke yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke turned around and began to head back to his hut. Rey waddled after him, her belly and breasts bouncing painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Rey grabbed her staff and swung, smacking him in the back of his head. The impact knocked him to the ground. Rey stood over him, ready to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do it? Did you create Kylo Ren?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do anything you might regret,\" Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey swung her staff, and Luke quickly got up, Force pulled a lightning rod off of one of the huts, and parried her attack. The hugely pregnant Jedi took a deep breath and continued her attack, forcing him to continue to walk backwards. He dodged and blocked most of her attacks. Rey swung and missed, causing her to stumble forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke smacked her back with the rod, and he continued to move back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh!\" Rey yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey continued to swing and thrust her staff, and Luke continued to dodge and block each blow. It was incredibly difficult for Rey to fight with this belly in the way. It was almost as if her babies were feeding off of her anger, and she could feel them tumble and kick wildly against the walls of her swollen womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey was caught off balance, and Luke grabbed her staff and threw it to the side. Rey Force pulled her lightsaber from her bag, igniting it. The blue saber buzzed as rain struck it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke stumbled back as the back off his feet hit some stairs, and he used the Force to break his fall. He grunted as he sat down, looking up at Rey as she held the saber over him. She lowered her weapon, catching her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me the truth,\" Rey said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke stared straight ahead. \"I saw darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey envision Luke's story as he told it. Ben, lying asleep in his hut. \"I sensed it building in him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke stood over the boy, his hand extended as he read his mind. \"I'd seen it in moments during his training. But then I looked inside, and it was beyond what I ever imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filled his eyes, and his hand began to shake. Luke pulled out of Ben's mind. \"Snoke had already turned his heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke pulled up his lightsaber and raised it. \"He would bring destruction to everything I loved! And in the briefest moment of pure instinct I thought I could stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignited the sword, its green light illuminating the hut. Luke looked down at the weapon. \"But it passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame. And with consequence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke saw Ben awake, a look of fear in his eyes. \"And the last thing I saw were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grabbed his lightsaber and ignited it, swinging it at Luke. The Jedi master blocked the attack. \"Ben, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hut collapsed around him, and the vision ended. Luke looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey rubbed her belly. The babies sensed that she was distressed. \"You failed him by thinking his choice was made. It wasn't! There's still conflict in him. If he returned from the darkness, that would shift the tide! This could be how we win!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not going to go the way you think!\" Luke seethed through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\" Rey kneeled next to him, her stomach grazing the wet, cold steps. \"Just now, when he and I touched, I saw his future! As solid as I see you. If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rey...don't do this...\" Luke pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey stood back up, trying to catch her balance as she wobbled. She stuck her lightsaber out to him, as if she were asking for him to join the fight. Luke only closed his eyes and turned away. Rey sighed and put the saber down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he's our last hope,\" Rey said, turning back to her hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey grabbed her things and put them in her bag. She wanted to dry her robes off, but she had to leave the island now. She had to save Ben. Any longer, and the babies could arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped briefly to rub her belly. \"Are there really ten of you in there? You can't get much bigger, can you? You must be here soon. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions, and she only knew the answer to the first question, and had a hunch that she could, in fact, get bigger. Rey grabbed the rest of her belongings and waddled out of the hut towards the Falcon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got outside, she took one last look at Luke's hut. The door was closed. Typical.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke sat in his hut alone. Deep down, he knew that the girl was right. He shouldn't still be here. He had to help the Resistance, and deeply wanted to see Leia again. He shook his head and exited his hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to Rey's hut and called out. \"Rey? You were right. I'll go with you. I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke heard no response. He knocked on her door a few times. Nothing. Slowly, he opened the door. She was gone. It was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey arrived at the Falcon, waddling up the ramp. She was exhausted and soaking wet. At least now she could get some rest and would be dry. She knew where Kylo was, and estimated that the trip would take a little over a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Falcon, she slowly made her way to the cockpit, where Chewbacca was sitting, watching the rainfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chewie?\" Rey asked calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wookiee turned to her. He growled, a hint of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll tell you about it later, but I just need some rest.\" Rey said, punching the coordinates in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and looked around. The porg infestation had gotten worse since she'd last been inside. \"What's gone on in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wookiee replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey shook her head. \"I'm sorry, but you don't need to know where we're going just yet. But trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rey exited the cockpit, the wookiee growled again. Rey rested a hand on the underside of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Luke's not coming with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe retreated to the captain's quarters, ignoring the R2-D2's beeps.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as she got into the captains quarters, Rey shut the door. She sat back on the bed angrily. Angry at Luke for lying, angry at herself for leaving so quickly. She sighed, unpacking her clothes around the room. She realised that what she was wearing had been soaked during her confrontation and began to get undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeled off her soaked shirts, and threw it to the heater in the room. She struggled to shimmy out of her pants, unable to reach even halfway down her thighs to pull down. Eventually she was able to pull them off, throwing them towards the heater. All that she had left on her was her underwear. She unclipped her bra and her breast sprung out, freed form it's constraint. Again struggling to remove her panties, she relented and used the force to pull them down, putting them away to dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey looked at herself in the mirror and sighed. Her belly was absolutely huge, dominating most of the mirror, blocking her own body. Her skin was taut and shiny, and she rubbed it, feeling every inch of what she could reach. It was large enough to block her view of between her legs, and she couldn't even reach down there anyway, her gargantuan belly too big to wrap her hands around. She could see ripples moving across her belly and felt a swarm of kicks rise and swell. She huffed as the kicks felt stronger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dplease give me a break,\u201d she said, chastising her unborn.\u201dMama could do without the kicks\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rubbed her bump trying to soothe the kicks, her gaze was drawn to her breasts, which had grown significantly since her arrival on the island. They were huge and heavy and sore, so she began to massage them to try and alleviate some of the soreness. As she massaged them she felt a wetness dribbling down her belly and watched as a white liquid dripped from her breasts onto her bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat is this?\u201d Rey said in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down with her finger and picked up a droplet, tasting it. It was sweet, similar to the Thala-sirens milk. <i>That's what it is!</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI guess I have to feed these guys somehow, \u201d she mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey lay back in bed to try and get to sleep, but her belly was too heavy for her to breathe properly lying back, so she shifted to lie on her side. However, she found I ly a little more comfort there, as her belly just hung off the edge of the bed, and dug into the edge. She grunted as she tried to roll to the other side, finding it marginally more comfortable, squishing her belly against the wall. She sighed as she rubbed her bump, drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer babies had other ideas and decided to kick up a storm inside of her, bashing her bladder. Rey bolted up as they kicked, feeling an overwhelming urge to go to the toilet. She sat on the edge of the bed, trying to calm her babies, and trying to avoid wetting herself. She heaved herself up off the bed and grabbed one of her loose shirts from the island, letting it flow over her bump. She wrapped a blanket around her legs and left to the bathroom, waddling as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she returned, barely avoiding wetting herself. She took off her shirt and sat on her bed, tired. She was about to lie down again before her stomach rumbled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhy won't you let me sleep!\u201d she growled at her belly, grabbing a few portions from her pack, wolfing them down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay on her side and closed her eyes, praying that her babies didn't need anything else. She fell asleep to the feeling of a few gentle kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey woke up to feel something small on her belly. She looked down to see her belly, predictably larger, with porgs resting around it, a few on top as well. She was about to shoo them off, but a few strong kicks woke them up and sent them fluttering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dthanks for that,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up and looked in the mirror. Her belly had grown massively during the night, probably more so than any other night. It stretched out a few feet in front of her, and she could now no longer reach the front of it, being a hands length away. Sighing in defeat, she grabbed a shirt from her pack and pulled it over her frame. Except for this time, it left most of her belly exposed, covering only the topmost part and her breasts. She pulled out a set of robes to match the shirt and pulled them up over her legs, being easier to put on than pants. She looked in the mirror again. Her belly was completely exposed to the world, and there wasn't a lot she could do to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled into the mess area to see Chewie eating a few portions and talking to R2. They both looked at her, and her bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie growled something between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI know, I can't do anything about it now, wear near were we need to be\u201d Rey replied, blushing at her exposed bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA confused growl was Chewies response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI need to use the pod. I'm going to try and bring Ben back to the light\u201d Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie gave a concerned growl and R2 made a worried beep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt sounds crazy, but I have to try\u201d Rey said slightly indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie and R2, although concerned, relented to her plan, R2 plugging himself into a socket to control the ship. Reg sat down at the table and grabbed a generous bundle of portions and began to chow down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie growled something at Rey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, I think I'll be alright. These babies are annoying though\u201d she replied, trying to lighten the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie smiled at her and growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI'm sure. I have to do this, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a hefty breakfast, they were nearing their location, the supremacy. Rey found the pod and gasped at how small it was. She lowered herself into it gingerly and closed the roof. Her belly was squashed against the sides and top of it, causing her discomfort and sending her babies into kicks if protest. She saw Chewie stood over the pod and nodded at him to pull the lever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pod shot off into space. Rey watched the falcon zip off into the dark, away from the ship. This was it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rey say in the pod, her arms crossed. In one hand rested the homing device that she'd use to get Chewie to come to her location and get her off of the ship. In the other was her lightsaber.That was, after she talked to Ben and convinced him to come back to the light. She didn't think it would be easy, especially if Snoke still had any control over him. She doubted that was the case, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of thought, the pod arrived in the Supremacy's hangar bay, pulled in via tractor beam. Rey sat there for a moment, her belly pressing against the glass covering, before she heard a few people approach. It was Kylo, flanked by four Stormtroopers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pod slowly opened, and Kylo stood above her. He looked her over, shaking his head. Rey attempted to get out of the pod, but she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could...could I get some help?\" Rey asked meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared her down, his gaze not straying from her eyes. \"Get her out of there. And be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troopers grabbed Rey's arms and pulled her out gently. They grunted as they did so, clearly not expecting her to weigh so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...thank you...\" Rey huffed, trying to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a Stormtrooper pulled out a pair of handcuffs. Another one grabbed her arms and put them under her belly, allowing the other trooper time to put the cuffs on her. Kylo snatched her lightsaber from her hand. Her other hand was able to conceal the homing beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben...what are you...\" Rey started, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet. Come with me,\" Kylo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led Rey to an elevator, and stood behind her as they rode it up. Kylo refused to answer any of her questions. She had no idea where they were going, but feared that it was where Snoke was. Quickly, Rey slipped the homing device into one of her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do this,\" Rey said, her back facing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head in his direction. \"I can feel the conflict in you. It's tearing you apart. Ben...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe utterance of the name that he had destroyed had shaken his steely gaze. He glanced at her and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we touched, I saw your future. Just the shape of it, but solid and clear. You will not bow before Snoke,\" Rey continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey slowly turned around and plodded towards him, her belly bumping into him. She sighed, then went back to her attempt to persuade him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll turn. I'll help you,\" she whispered. \"I saw it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylo Ren spoke up for the first time. \"I saw something, too. I know when the moment comes that you'll be the one to turn. Rey, I saw who your parents are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rey could say anything else, the elevator stopped. She backed up against the door, and it opened. It was Snoke's lair. He sat on a chair, surrounded by eight guards that wore red armor. Kylo grabbed her arm and took her into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, my faithful apprentice. Young Rey. It seems that you're in quite the predicament. Welcome,\" Snoke said, his voice echoing throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylo Ren kneeled, and was a few feet behind Rey as she stood before Snoke. Her shackles were unlocked, and she shook her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer, child,\" he beckoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey refused his order, standing still. She didn't want to admit that it was because she was too tired to walk anymore, but that was part of the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much strength. Darkness rises and light to meet it. And look at what you've brought us, what you'll soon bring into this galaxy. I warned my apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the light would rise,\" Snoke said, using the Force to pull the lightsaber from Kylo's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skywalker, I assumed. Wrongly,\" he continued, turning the saber over in his hand. He set it on the armrest beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this? This is much better. Closer, I said,\" Snoke seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey's heels lifted off the ground, and she was pulled in towards him, massive stomach leading the way. The babies were beginning to get restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You underestimate Skywalker. And Ben Solo. And me,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was mere inches away from Snoke. \"Oh, have you seen something? A weakness in my apprentice? Is that why you came?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed maniacally. \"It was I who linked your minds, I stoked Ren's conflict.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylo looked up for the first time as Snoke continued. \"I knew he was not strong enough to hide it. And you were not wise enough to resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her even closer. He extended a hand, and pressed it against Rey's belly. This sent the babies into a frenzy, as they thrashed and kicked wildly, so strong that it felt like they might tear through her swollen skin. Rey whimpered in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you have a choice. Give me the location of Skywalker, and join Ren and I as we train a new generation of darkside users. Or die,\" Snoke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Rey said, growing weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnoke snarled and pushed her away, suspending her high in the air. He reached his arm out and closed his eyes. \"Tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey screamed in pain, and the babies tumbled and stretched inside her increasingly cramped womb.</span></div></div>",

She quickly put her hands over her belly, and the movement told her that the babies were alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect Skywalker to be so wise. We will give him and the Jedi the death he desires. After the rebels are finished, we will destroy the entire island,\" he cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all her might, Rey got up and tried to pull the saber away. It flew towards her, then past her, smacking her in the back to the head as it returned to Snoke's possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such spunk. Look here now,\" he said, pulling him towards what appeared to be a telescope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey looked into it, and saw Resistance ships being obliterated. \"The entire Resistance. Soon they'll all be gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey turned, her belly knocking the telescope over, and pulled Kylo's saber. She ignited it, but was quickly surrounded by the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnoke smiled. \"Still that fiery spirit. You have the heart of a Jedi. And because of that, you will die like one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey plodded towards him, and Snoke flicked her away with the Force. The lightsaber clattered at Kylo's feet, spinning before him. Rey slowly sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the babies? If you kill me, you kill them,\" Rey explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You appear to be far enough along that the babies would survive if we were to remove them from your womb shortly after your passing. Face it, little girl. You are nothing more than a vessel for these bastard children. That's all you'll ever be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnoke rotated her to face Kylo. \"You know what you must do. There is resolve in your heart. I cannot be beaten. I see his mind, his every intent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylo stood up and grabbed his lightsaber. He held it in front of Rey's head. Snoke closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see him turning the lightsaber to strike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, she saw Ben's free hand doing something by his side, but she couldn't see it clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see it, and Snoke couldn't either, but her saber was slowly turning sideways on Snoke's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...he KILLS HIS TRUE ENEMY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightsaber ignited, and a blue light shined on Snoke's shock-filled face. Rey collapsed, and saw what had happened. She pulled her saber towards her, catching it as Snoke's top half collapsed on the floor. Kylo helped her up, and they soon were surrounded by guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked each other in the eye. They understood what they had to do, and both ignited their sabers as they stood back to back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fought the guards valiantly, Kylo trying his best to protect Rey. Throughout the fight, she kept a protective hand on her belly as her babies bounced and kicked from all of the activity. She was slower, and extremely slow on breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was strong with the Force, and was able to take out the attackers. Once they finished the battle, Rey and Kylo met in the middle of the room. Rey looked out of the window at the fleeing Resistance ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still time! We can stop the attack on the ships!\" Rey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard no response, and turned around. \"Ben?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylo stared straight ahead, his eyes wild. \"It's time to let old things die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked towards her. \"The Sith. The Jedi. Skywalker, Snoke. The rebels. Let it all die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylo extended a hand. \"Rey, I want you to join me. Together, we can rule and bring a new order. With these children that you carry, do you realize what we can accomplish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streamed from Rey's eyes. \"Don't do this, Ben. Please don't go this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still holding on! Let go!\" he exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey took a deep breath, putting her hands on the side of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna know the truth about your parents? Or have you always known? Go on, say it,\" he implored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"They were nobody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filthy junk traders that sold you for drinking money. Dead in a pauper's grave in the desert. You have no place in this story. You come from nothing--you're  nothing. But not to me. Join me. Please,\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't do it. If she did his, she'd be no better than her parents. If she ruled the galaxy alongside Ren, there'd be no way she could care for them as much as she wanted to. And now, aside from helping the resistance that's all she wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey reached out a hand, and used it to pull her saber from the ground. Kylo caught on to this, and pulled with all his might. The lightsaber hung in the air, vibrating violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure was just too much, and the sword exploded. A gigantic crash tore through the middle of the ship, as the Raddus cruiser jumped into light speed directly through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey stood up, using all of her effort. She looked at Kylo, and saw that he was lying on the ground, unconscious. She pulled out her homing device and clicked it, hoping that the Falcon would pick it up.</span></div></div>",

She held in her hands the remains of the sabre and her homing beavon, clinging onto both to avoid losing them. She was waddling as fast as she could, wanting to get out of the ship as quickly as possible. The resistance needed her. She found a hamgar bay that was mostly intact, but again empty. Rey sat and waited for the falcon to arrive, amd began rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the encounter with Snoke, her babies had been kicking, fluxuating between hard and gentle, but they were still obviously rattled. She rubbed hwr belly trying to calm them down, pushing lightly on the little bumps they made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down now, we\u2019re alright,\u201d she reassured, not just get belly but herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard the falcon approaching, she tried to stand up to no avail, resort g to using the force to pull herself up off of the ground. The falcon swooped i to the hanger, and the landing bay opened, revealing R2 buzzing worriedly at the top of the ramp. Rey smiled as she waddled her way uo the ramp, assuring R2 that she, and her babies were fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled into the cockpit to check on Chewie, reassuring him as well. As she was talking she felt a kick at her bladder, grunting at the movement. She excused herself and waddled quickly to the bathroom, the babies still kicking her bladder as she walked. She very nearly wet herself, but she just made it to the bathroom, feeling immense relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled out of the bathroom into the mess area, where Chewie was sat eating some portions and talking to R2. She sat next to him, pushing her belly out to the side, and gravbing some portions to eat. She began wolfing them down, the days events tiring her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie growled, asking a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot good. He\u2019s beyond saving.\u201d Rey said sullenly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Chewie and R2 made reassuring sounds, trying to comfort Rey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThanks, guys. But what's important now is that we help the resistance. They need us\u201d Rey replied thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their meal, Rey retreated to her quarters, desperate to rest after what had gone down that day. She pulled off her clothes, slowly striking down to her underwear. She gazed in the mirror at herself, thinking her belly looked ridiculous on her small frame, dwarfing the rest of her body. She rested her hands on top of it as she inspected how large she was. She was surprised that she hadn't given birth yet, given her size. <i>Maybe something was wrong, maybe she was only just at the beginning, maybe they would never come out.</i> Questions flew through her head as she tried to find a comfortable position to sleep, and tried to calm down her evidently hyperactive children, who were kicking around inside. She drifted off to sleep with a gentle hand resting on her bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey woke up to the feeling of a storm of kicks inside of her. She knew that she hadn't been asleep for long, as she woke up more tired than when she had fallen asleep. She sat up and rubbed her belly, trying to calm the young inside her. She heaved herself off of the bed and started pacing her room to calm them down as well, hoping to tire them out somehow. She opened the door and wandered about the falcon. She could hear Chewie growling at something in the cockpit and R2 responding with a few beeps and chirps. She wandered into the mess room and grabbed a couple portions, holing that food would calm down her brood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to her room, halfway through another portion when she finally felt her occupants stop kicking. Sighing as she lay down, again struggling to get comfortable, but this time without the interruptions of her occupants kicking her repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey opened her eyes slowly. She couldn't feel any porgs nestled against her belly, but she could definitely feel that it had grown. She looked down to see that overnight it had expanded massively, another few inches having been added onto the already gigantic mound of her belly. She watched herself in the mirror, her frame now almost completely obscured by her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went I'm for her usual move of swinging herself up, but was stopped before she could stand. She tried again, more forcefully, but with the same result. She was very much slightly stuck under her own belly. She tried lowering herself off the bed, only to fall on her backside, leaving her worse off than when she had started. She grunted as she tried to stand up again, unable to do so. After what felt like half an hour of trying to stand, Rey, resorted to pulling herself up with the force, her legs not used to the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inspected herself in the mirror and noticed something strange about her belly. It seemed to have dropped slightly, hanging off of her body. Rey assumed that it was due to the sheer weight of it, unaware of what it really meant for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed some underwear from her pack and put it on, struggling to hoist up her panties with her new girth providing a challenging obstacle. She grabbed a skirt and pulled them on, to try and cover a little more than the necessities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey waddled out to the mess area and grabbed a few portions to eat for her breakfast. As she began wolfing down her food, she saw Chewie walk in to grab some food for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dhow long will it be till we arrive?\u201d she asked him, concerned for her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie growled and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOkay good, the sooner the better\u201d Rey responded, hoping to arrive fast enough to help the resistance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her breakfast, she left for her room to finish getting ready. She was crouching down to grab a shirt when she felt something in her belly. It felt sort of like a kick, but softer and quicker. She stood up, concerned about what was happening. Her belly was churning and gurgling, her babies starting to kick up a storm. Rey watched her belly and was shocked to see it growing before her own eyes. The shock of it sent her falling to the bed, unable to stand both from the weight and from watching her belly expand by a couple of inches. Her skin felt tighter than before, pulled to its absolute limit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI can't get any bigger now, surely!\u201d Rey exclaimed in disbelief. \u201dI feel like I might explode now!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rey grunted, standing up with all her might. Her legs shook, straining mightily under the weight of her belly. She caught her breath and waddled back to the Falcon's cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had arrived. The stunning white-colored salt planet of Crait came into view. A blue hue glowed around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armband that Leia had given her was beeping faster now. They were getting close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull in closer, Chewie. We should find them soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewbacca nodded. Suddenly, Rey's stomach tightened, her belly becoming painfully hard as the muscles shortened. She kneeled over as much as she good, placing a hand on the side of her belly. This was different than the growth spurt that she had just experienced. Maybe her body couldn't take it anymore. Maybe she really was about to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie turned and growled, a hint of worry in his voice. Rey shook him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, it's okay. I'll get on the gunner. I have a feeling we're about to have trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey waddled out of the cockpit and made her way to the gunner turret. Carefully, she climbed up the ladder to where the turret was, almost slipping a few times. As she sat down, her belly pressed into the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly gurgled and churned once more, the babies tumbling around. Her stomach pushed forward another two inches, straining the fabric of her clothes. She was greeted by more kicks and stretches as she rubbed her impossibly huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you have any control over this, but please, please stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Falcon flew close to the surface of the planet. In the distance, Chewie spotted some TIE fighters swooping downwards. Their ship was overlooking a cliff, and down below they saw Resistance fighters defending a base using speeders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the turret's radar, three TIE fighters pulled into view. Above the ground, they were closing in on a few speeders that were heading towards First Order walkers and a giant drill. The TIEs lined up perfectly, and Rey fired, taking them all out and giving the Resistance soldiers, who unbeknownst to Rey were actually Finn, Poe, and Rose, more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo! I like this!\" Rey exclaimed, finding a rare moment of pure happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had an idea, and brought the headset's microphone to her mouth. \"Peel off from the battle and draw them away from the speeders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie growled, and did as he was told. The Falcon dipped upwards, and the fighters followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to fly, Rey's belly tightened again. The pain was too much for her to see straight, and all of her shots at the pursuing ships were off. Chewie took the ship into a crack in the planet's surface, which led to a red crystalline cave. The cave was extremely narrow, and was causing damage to the turret as it scared against the cave's walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chewie!\" Rey yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wookiee growled, trying his best to fix the situation. The ship lifted up and flipped through the cave, and the ships behind them exploded as they collided into the crystals that stuck out nearly ten feet. A wrong move caused another hit to the turret, knocking it off completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke filled the gunner position, causing Rey to back away. \"Ahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed down the ladder slowly, and waddled back to the cockpit's seat. Once they reached the surface again, the battle appeared to be done. They sped overhead, and saw that a giant hole had been blasted into the front of the base. The walkers, and the drill, were closing in on the rebels. They had to rescue them--and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the base, Leia sat alone, save for C-3PO and a few soldiers. Her attempts to call for help had failed. Nobody responded. Near the base's walls, Finn and Poe were watching the First Order slowly approach. They were trapped, with no other exit out of the base except for the front, and that would be suicide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow filled the room, and a hooded figure entered the room. Could it be? The figure approached Leia and lowered their hood. It was Luke. He sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia spoke first. \"I know what you're gonna say. I changed my hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke scoffed. She hadn't changed at all. \"Looks nice that way. Leia, I'm sorry. Something's happened to the girl you sent, Rey. Like the mother of our father, the Force has chosen her to carry life and bring it into the world. I...again...I'm sorry. That I couldn't be there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are. But I'm glad you're here. At the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shook his head. \"I came to face him. I can't save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia looked down, trying not to cry. \"I held out hope for so long, but...I know my son is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one's ever really gone,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put out a hand, and Leia took it. He put something in hers. Han's dice from the Millennium Falcon, but they felt weightless. Wait a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia looked at her brother, who raised his eyebrows. He stood up and kissed her on the top of her head. Luke exited the control room and headed towards the hole in the base, taking on the First Order by himself and renewing his status as a legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the sky, Rey and Chewie looked for any sign of the rebels. She winced as her stomach tightened again. Then, she felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was gone. She could feel that he never really left the island, and she knew that he had become one with the Force. Her heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewbacca growled, forcing Rey to come back to the situation at hand. Her bracelet was beeping nonstop. They had to be close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're right above them! R2, keep scanning for life forms!\" Rey said. </span></div></div>",

She searched along the surface of the white rocks and spotted something moving around outside. As she looked closer she saw that some crystalline wolf-like animals were squeezing through a small gap in the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dChewie, down there!\u201d she called out. \u201dthat's where they are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewie settled the falcon on top of a ridge, above the exit of the caverns. Rey was stood impatiently at the top of the ramp as it slowly lowered down. She waddled her way down the ramp, holding a hand on her belly as it tightened as she walked. She looked down and saw the steep rock face that she would have to scale to reach the cave. Sighing, she began scaling down the side, trying to steady herself as her belly contracted and threw her off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the bottom only to see that the creatures had been squeezing themselves through a tiny gap, nowhere near large enough to let a person through. Rey could sense the people behind the rocks, desperate to escape. She closed her eyes and focused, lifting her hand. She focused on the people and saving them, and she felt the force flow through her as she lifted the rocks, opening the way for the resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and watched as dozens of people began flowing out of the cave. She smiled, knowing that there was hope, and looked through the crowd for Finn. She saw him at the back, ushering people forward, and their eyes met. They both smiled and he ran towards her. Rey lowered her hand, the cave now empty, and put her arms out for Finn. He broke through the crowd to her and saw her belly. His eyes grew wide as he stepped towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell, you've certainly changed, \u201d he said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYep, \u201d she replied, smiling. She hugged him tightly. \u201dIts good to see you again, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn didn't respond but hugged her tightly, glad to see that she was Ok. Then he felt himself being pushed away by something but saw that Rey was still hugging him. She looked down and saw that her belly had grown again, stretching her skin out even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWas that...?\u201d Finn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThe force. It's a long story, I'll explain later\u201d Rey said, leading him towards the falcon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey noticed General Organa helping others up the hill and walked over to her. Leia looked at her curiously, and gestured to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat's new, \u201d she said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, it's definitely new, \u201d Rey said with a smile. \u201dThis is how the force is supposed to work, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia smiled knowingly. \u201dThe force works mysteriously, but I know that this is right, \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey smiled at her as she stepped back onto the falcon. She turned to close the airlock and saw Ben standing in front of her, dressed in deep black robes. She could do nothing but look t him with disdain as the doors closed, shutting him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe falcon was now full of people, giving Rey a difficult time moving about. She was leant on the wall when a man with black hair approached her smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo you must be Rey. Poe Dameron, \u201d he said, introducing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt's nice to finally meet you, BB8 always talked about you, \u201d Rey replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAnd Finn liked to talk about you, but I guess he didn't tell us everything, \u201d he gestured to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell, he didn't know about this. Don't ask, it's a very long story\u201d Rey said, his mouth slightly agape in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey saw Leia sat on a few crates in the centre of the room and waddled her way towards her, sitting down in a huff. She could feel her belly contracting as she sat down, and tried to hide her pain from anyone. Both women smiled at each other, not needing to say much. Poe approached Leia, looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGeneral, how are we supposed to rebuild the resistance with this? There's so few of us left, \u201d He asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia simply smiled and put a hand to Rey's belly. \u201dwe have all that we need right here, \u201d she said, putting Rey's belly gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey\u2019s children must have known what timing was because at that moment Rey felt a rush of fluids between her legs and her belly contracted again, harder than before. She looked up at Leia, scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI think they're coming\u201d was all she needed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia helped her up and took her as quickly as she could to the med bay. She called in a few others to help her and got started immediately. She got Rey ready to give birth, pulling her dress off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dRey, you're going to need to push, okay?\u201d She said, coaching Rey through it. \u201dReady? And push!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey started pushing down, screaming in pain as she felt the first baby crowning. She pushed and pushed, and felt the baby come out, feeling slightly relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dhow am I... Doing?\u201d she asked, starting to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou're doing great, the first one is out\u201d Leia said, reassuring Rey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey started to bear down again and felt the second baby starting to come out. Rey groaned as she pushed again, the second baby now out. She could feel the next one moving down and watched as her belly shifted as her babies moved around. She pushed, grunting as the next baby crowned, and another push was all it needed to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThree down Rey, you're doing fantastic!\u201d Leia said encouraging Rey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey could feel herself growing more tired, and she had seven more to go. \u201dI can't, I'm t-too tired, \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou can do this, \u201d she heard Finn say behind her. He knelt next to her and held her hand. \u201dcome on, you can do this, \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey pushed and gritted her teeth, trying not to scream. She squeezed on Finn's hand as she pushed, and felt one of the babies come out, followed by another in quick succession. She took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThis is going very quickly Rey, you'll be done in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed again and felt the sixth crowning and coming out. By this point, she could see that her belly had visibly shrunk, and was covered in a thin layer of glistening sweat. She pushed again, rushing to get the seventh out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSeven done Rey! Not long now!\u201d Leia said as she swaddled the seventh baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey smiled a little, glad to have Leia and Finn with her. She pushed again and felt the eighth come out, quicker than the others. She could feel the ninth moving around and pushed again, this one taking a little longer than the previous. Another push freed it, and Rey's belly was now only carrying one last baby. She groaned as she pushed one last time, and she smiled as she felt the tenth and final baby slip free. Before she got a chance to look at her children, she began to black out from fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey woke up later, looking down to the unfamiliar sight of a flat belly. There was still a roundness to it, but nothing like it had been. She saw Leia, Finn and Poe all in the room, fawning over the babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHow are they?\u201d Rey asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dVery strong. Four boys, and six Girls\u201d Finn replied, bringing one of them to Rey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey took the baby in her arms and smiled. She was a mother.</span></div></div>",
