            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aphrodite was sulking.<br>\r\nShe - the literal the goddess of beauty - couldn't win a Styx-damned beauty contest! It was absurd. Oh sure, she'd won in the end - but only by bribing the judge! Paris simply hadn't been able to decide which of she, Hera and Athene was the most beautiful, and she knew his judgement was fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously - what was the point of being the divine patron of love and beauty if she wasn't even the prettiest goddess on Olympus? It was unfair, and unreasonable, and, and... and probably even some other words too that she couldn't think of. Bitterly, she grabbed a cup of nectar and downed it, the sweet drink flowing smoothly down her throat. The sugary taste did something to counteract the bitterness in her belly, so she broke the habit of an immortal lifetime and had another cup. Normally she wouldn't dare - nectar, whilst unimaginably delicious, was also notoriously fattening - but today she couldn't care less. What was even the point of obsessing over her weight if even Hera was apparently just as beautiful as she was? What was the point of trying if she couldn't be the best?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay back on her bed, sighing wistfully as she took a gulp from the second cup of nectar. Before she knew it, the cup was empty and she was refilling it again from the jug - then she frowned. Why even bother with the cup? She tossed it aside irritably and grabbed the jug, pouring the sweet nectar straight down her throat. Who cared if it was indecorous? This was her house, this was her nectar, and she was upset. Why not treat herself?<br>\r\nThe nectar slid silkily down her throat and into her belly, the delightful sweetness tantalising her tastebuds. She'd drunk nectar before, of course - every day of her immortal life, in fact - but somehow it tasted better today. She tipped the jug higher to increase the flow, chugging it as quickly as she could; still not quickly enough though as a fair quantity spilled out of her mouth, splashing down her bare chest and swelling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it the jug was empty, and she flung it aside just to hear it smash. Her stomach was churning, unused to this quantity of rich liquid all at once, and looking down she saw that it was visibly swollen. She put a hand on it, groaning as she suddenly realised just how full she was. Drinking all that nectar had probably been a mistake, but she couldn't bring herself to care. She'd spent an eternity holding back, and now she was sick of it. Dieting could go to Hades - she was going to indulge, and nobody could stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid off her bed and padded to her storeroom. Here, she knew, Hephaestus stored all sorts of delicacies - she only wanted one thing though. Bending down, she searched through the cases until she found what she was looking for; a two dozen cakes baked with ambrosia. She took them in her arms and returned to her bed, depositing them in a heap on the covers. Her husband had been saving these for a special occasion, but she hadn't so much as seen him in weeks, so busy he was with his incessant forging, so he wasn't likely to notice any time soon. <br>\r\nWithout a delay she unwrapped one of the little cakes and shoved it whole into her mouth. Delicious! Truly delicious!<br>\r\nAt once she grabbed another cake, then another, gulping them down impressive haste. Crumbs scattered her bedclothes and her body, sticking patchily to the nectar still on her belly and breasts as she continued to gulp down the cakes, ignoring the building discomfort in her gut, too lost in the divine taste to worry.<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, all the cakes were gone. Her hand found nothing but bare wood inside the box, and she snapped out of her food-trance with a jerk - o-ouch! Shards of pain shot through her agonisingly full stomach, and she groaned as she collapsed into fetal position on the bed, clutching at her bloated gut with both hands. It was so swollen that she looked pregnant, filled with more than enough food to kill a mortal - fortunately for Aphrodite she was divine, and thus couldn't be killed - by overindulgence or anything else - and so she just fell promptly into a deep sleep, moaning aloud with discomfort every time her stomach grumbled and churned, yet unable to bring herself to regret her oversized feast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The speed with which Aphrodite fell into a habit of overindulgence was almost alarming. Over the course of less than a week, the good habits forged over aeons were undone, replaced by increasingly overblown indulgences. Not caring for discomfort or the inevitable impact on her waistline, she began to drink nectar as though it were water, as well as feasting on ambrosia in increasingly vast amounts. Every morning she'd treat herself with a veritable feast of ambrosia, and every evening she'd eat until she passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of this self-destructive lifestyle quickly became evident. The goddess had never been extremely skinny - she'd always been thoroughly curvy, a very paragon of femininity - but in only a few weeks her body thickened and softened until she was decidedly plump. Her thighs thickened until they brushed together as she trotted hourly to the store cupboard for more snacks; her hips widened, forming a seamless exaggerated curve with her newly chunky hips; her already-round rear swelled even plumper, only remaining so astonishingly pert through some godly enchantment; her breasts became fuller than ever; even her fair limbs thickened slightly, the first hints of flab softening her upper arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst damaged of all, however, was inevitably her stomach. A thick pad of fat had found its way there, clinging to her midsection and rounding it into a chunky potbelly that quivered subtly as she moved. Her figure, from the moment she emerged from the ocean sea-foam, had always been utterly perfect - now, however, it was glaringly flawed, and that softly sagging potbelly was the most undeniable demonstration of those new flaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this, however, Aphrodite remained almost entirely oblivious, too lost in her sulking and indulgences to consider her mirror for even a moment. As she spent almost all her time nude, as was her custom, she didn't have any clothes to wrestle with, any buttons to burst - she just got up in the morning, stretched, and returned to the feasting as though she had never even paused. She didn't even bother to tie her hair up anymore - it just hung down loose around her shoulders, scraggly from the weeks of remaining unwashed and uncombed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on one of the many indistinguishable days of feasting and eating that finally Aphrodite found herself interrupted from her indulgent solitude by a tap-tap-rapping on the door. She knew the knock to be that of Ares, her lover, and excitedly she slipped off her bed, wrapped a piece of drapery casually around herself so as to somewhat preserve her modesty, and hurried at once to let him in.<br>\r\nAs he stepped inside though and set eyes upon her, his permanent smirk of self-satisfaction quivered. His eyes raked over the soft curves of her body, so much more drastic than he remembered, before eventually settling on her stomach, swollen even more than usual from a morning of incessant feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" he asked, a dark scowl crossing his face, \"I know I should not expect fidelity from you, but this is an insult nonetheless! I know you sleep not with Hephaestus, so you must bear the child of yet another lover. So be it! If whore you wish to be, then whore I shall leave you!\"<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" Aphrodite stammered, grasping his arm in dismay as he turned to leave, \"What do you mean? I bear no child! You are my only lover, I promise you.\"<br>\r\nShe let the drapery fall to the floor, revealing her body in its entirety. She was used to this earning her any favour from any man, but Ares' scowl just deepened.<br>\r\n\"Then you be a glutton!\" he exclaimed, lip curling, \"You look as a sacrificial heifer, eyes wide and confused as it is led to the altar, unknowing of its fate; its body is swollen from the years of fattening, all for this purpose, yet is ignorant. Such is the appearance which you have adopted.\"<br>\r\nWith this he jerked his arm back, and Aphrodite fell to the floor with a cry. The door slammed as Ares left, leaving her to sob disconsolately on the tiled flooring of her husband's great house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few minutes of crying pathetically on the floor, Aphrodite's stomach began to rumble. It was used now to being fed nigh-constantly, and the delay in the feeding was causing to complain bitterly. Miserably, Aphrodite complied with its request, and that afternoon and night she glutted herself beyond any gorging she had attempted before. Lying prone on her bed, tears staining the sheets, she consumed jug after jug of nectar, as well as entire cases of ambrosia. Eventually, belly distended and gurgling, the discomfort of her immense consumption finally overwhelmed her and she fell asleep with a jug of nectar still in her hand, dripping its contents onto the already-stained bedclothes.</span></div></div>",

Engorged on ambrosia and nectar, she began to grow more and more womanly by the day. Her hips and thighs grew soft and as pillowy as the finest fleece, her derri\u00e8re taking on the animated and liquid movements of jello with every lethargic step she took. Her stomach\u2019s tan Mediterranean skin had grown slightly pale as it\u2019s comfy girth extended and stretched everyday. For many months, Aphrodite had lived like this.
