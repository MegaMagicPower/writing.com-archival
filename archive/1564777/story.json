This one looked like his bath corner in his cabin up in the mountains, but with a tighter door and smaller perimeter.<br>\r\n\"It is a time machine Mr. President,\" replied the scientist, who smiled at the hushed sounds of wonder from the rest of the President's entourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can take you anywhere in the future. I am still working on the prototype to see if we can travel back in time.\"\"A time machine?\" repeated the President. \"To the future? I think this will do quite nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it work?\" asked one of the President's guards. He had a calculated look in his eyes. The scientist was very sure that the man was calculating how to steal the contraption.<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" he replied smoothly, knowing the model was nailed to the floor of the lab - there was no way it could be lifted, he smiled. \"You type the year you want to visit here - its limited to four digits only. Then you enter the cubicle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he didnt continue for several seconds someone asked, \"Then what?\"\"Then you wait.\" this caused a chuckle to rise among the spectators, who thought it was all a joke. A time machine that made you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, the scientist got a surprise visit.\"How may I be of assistance Sir?\" he asked the gentleman. The question on whether it was possible for the President of the United States of America to go somewhere without his endless trail of Secret Service Men was answered - the gentleman was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the gentleman, smiling slightly. \"About that Time Machine, how far can it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as 9999,Sir\" replied the Scientist. suddenly it dawned on him. The President's acute curiosity had been picked by the contraption, and he wanted to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was more than that. The man was a revolutionary man, who had promised the citizens a lot of progress and continued unity. He wanted to see what the future would be like. But what if something happened to him and he didnt return?</span></div></div>",

He walked towards the bookshelf beside the fireplace. upon noticing this, the president stopped and looked at the scientist, who had a mischievous smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe president breathed finally, when the scientist pulled aside a book and a doorway revealed itself in the stone wall. he obeyed the beckoning to follow, this time and tried to hide his surprise when they entered the laboratory he had been in earlier, after under five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means Mr President,\" the scientist said, as he drew aside the tarp covering the Time Machine and pointed towards it.The President moved closer. He still could not put much stock in it than in his bath stall at home. But he used the opportunity to gather his thoughts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir,\" he began, \"May I have the honour of calling you by your first name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mr. President.\" came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you must call me Abe, James\" continued the President. \"Has anybody ever tried your invention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do go straight to the point Abe,\" remarked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Bogardus was well known for his other inventions - the cotton-spinning machine popularly called a ring flier, and the mechanized engraving machine which was now used to engrave dies for bank notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was always working on something new, and his work was of interest to the political scene because of his second invention but he had come a long way. He made money from his cast-iron architecture in Washington so he was back where he started - inventing the impossible. A machine that passes through time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to the question was simple but it brought back to his mind the tireless journey he had had to go through to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the person return? How long was he gone?\" asked Abraham Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am standing before you Abe,\" James replied, \"so that should answer the first question. As for the second, I was gone for a few minutes, but I spent hours in the year 2000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbe came closer, and began asking a lot of questions which James replied patiently. When Abe seemed to pause and let his mind assimilate all he had heard, James gave him a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you get to there do not try to change anything or bring anything back with you. You must not change the course of history because that simple act can disrupt time and the consequences can be far reaching, even beyond our expectations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know I want to time travel?\" Abe asked, looking away from the machine for the first time in that hour. he smiled back at the inventor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that is the reason you did not laugh at my joke this morning during the inspection,\" replied James. \"Because that is the reason the tour took place in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" asked the reknown gentleman, as he rubbed his chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know so,\" James replied. \"And because you believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to explore what the future holds for slavery abolition,\" President Abraham Lincoln began as he paced back and forth. \"If it is not abolished, what becomes of America? Will America still remain divided if I do not do something about it now? If I leave it to my successor? There are so many questions I need answered! I am concerned about the future of this country and will not do anything to jeopardize its progress as one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think a trip to the future will aid you in your quest.\" James interrupted as he poured tea at the little tea table that Abraham had not noticed until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed the president. \"Whatever the future holds, I can see it and plan towards it, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"against it.\"James finished off for him, as he handed over the cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbraham looked fleetingly at the fine bone china before taking a sip. James waited for him to finish his tea, trying hard to contain his own smile. There was no other decision - Abraham would get to travel to the future, if only once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Bogardus stretched his hand to receive the tea cup and saucer, and Abraham Lincoln gave it back automatically.\"Thank you,\" he murmured.</span></div></div>",

Your very existence, your family will be threatened. i cna picture it even now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not think that kind of future will be favourable for me,\" muttered James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" agreed the sixteenth president of the United States of America. \"I agree. But look at the good it will do the whole nation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of what use is this change if you do not return?\" asked James Bogardus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I shall not return?\" countered Abe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall have to promise me that you will return when the clock strikes midnight.\" said James solemnly. He knew very well how easy it was to get carried away by the sites and scenes of the future, by the various contraptions, the enormous buildings and even the people. He was willing to take the risk of allowing Abe a glimpse of the future, but only a glimpse. Nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to be back before midnight,\" Abraham Lincoln said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the decision was made, James wasted no time. As he set up the panel that contained the buttons, he issued out instructions to Abraham. He started by telling him what to expect and how to behave before stopping himself short, his fingers hovering over the panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which year do you want to go? And where?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been to the year 2000,\" replied Abraham. \"The new millenium. Let me also see what America has accomplished by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which state?\" asked James as he punched a few more dials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Illinois,\" replied Abraham, \"Let me see what has become of Chicago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then.\" said James as he punched a few more, then stepped towards the door and threw it back. Steam rose from within the enclosure, making the President hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go in now!\" exclaimed James above the noise of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sixteenth President ran into the closet - like contraption and felt the door slam shut in his very bones. He experienced momentary relief when he heard James shout above the din.\"Remember that you are to wait until you hear the whistle before opening the door! And return to the very spot at midnight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' last word seemed to echo in his head, as Abraham Lincoln lost his breath suddenly. It was then that he wondered if this was not a foolish idea afterall.</span></div></div>",

And the songs have been encouraging. We caught a glance of Oprah, of Reverend Jesse Jackson, and other people earlier. People of all religions, all job descriptions are here.\"He was interrupted by his counterpart, \"And the whole world is watching this particular elections - even Russia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole world wants to know who will be the next president of the United States of America.\"\"You should see the Kenyans\"\"Yes, I hear that this election has brought about such peace in the whole country, and people have been praying even more than they prayed when a new President was to be elected in Kenya.\"\"Its amazing how just one man can unite the whole world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbraham Lincoln stood in front of the Television and watched the repartee in confusion. He had opened the door and stepped into what looked like a tavern. There was a strange talking box with pictures right in front of him,and he had watched the pictures talk and listened for almost ten minutes before a drunk had shoved him aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerrout o' my way!\" the drunk man had shouted. \"Halloween is o'er! You still got ur costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbraham looked at the man in his sloppy attire, and down at himself in his suit and clean polished shoes and smiled. He wondered who was wearing the costume. He ignored the drunk and approached the bar instead. He noted the least drunk man at the bar and sat beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Good evening to you Sir,\" he began, giving the man his most friendly smile. \"May I make your acquaintance? My name is Abra...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course your name is Abraham Lincoln!\" the young man interrupted. \"It goes with the costume!\"Abraham stared at the man for a few seconds before he realized that if indeed he was in the future, then he was part of history. And if he was part of history then his name must be very ancient, and belong in history books about America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" he said, still smiling. \"But please may I ask a few questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on Abe,\" replied the surly young man. \"Be my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we in the year 2000?\" Abe began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been for the past 8 years?\" asked the surly young man in a shout. It seemed the man must have been angered over something. Abe did not want to believe that the youth of the twenty - first century were this rude and deaf. Abe waited patiently for the man to answer his questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we are not in 2000,\" slurred the man. \"We are in 2008. And in case you don't know it too, Americans are voting today for the next president of the United States of America.\"</span></div></div>",

All these thoughts were running through Abraham's head as he walked out of the tavern. He'd thanked the young man for the piece of information and left the place quickly, as he did not like the glances he was getting from other men in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had warned him that he would be treated as odd, and the best way to avoid a situation would be to always be on the move. He'd gotten to the streets and had been momentarily stunned at the number of people moving around. There seemed to be people everywhere he looked. No greenery, no fields of green, just hard concrete on the floor which was shaped in little bricks, and long poles that he concluded must light up the streets at night. He was glad that it seemed America had learnt to  harness electrical power properly in the year 2008. Their clothes were funny though. The people wore different colours like they were little rainbows, and the styles were inproper and inadequate. One young girl passed by him wearing what he could not even term as appropriate for swimming, he had to turn the other way to hide his gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked along he saw that more people were headed in the direction he'd chose. Most of them were wearing emblems that showed a man. His curiousity piqued, Abe asked a young man what the man's name was, and the reply he got was curt, and the look unbelieving. \"Obama.\"<br>\r\nAbe had nodded and thanked the man before moving along. He found a young girl all covered in badges and the national flag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Lady,\" He said, bowing low before continuing. \"I have been out of town for a while, please can you tell me what is happening here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stared at him, as if expecting him to smile and tell her he was joking. When he didn't she smiled instead.<br>\r\n\"I wonder where you went that you don't know what is going on in the US, but I will humour you.\" she began. \"Today America will choose between the most controversial candidates to lead her for the next four years. The Republican candidate, Senator McCain is an old army general who has the unfortunate luck of being preceded by a president that dragged the party's name in mud all through his stay. The Democrat is a black man, who's father is Kenyan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenyan?\" repeated Abe, who was relieved to find someone that was willing to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, an African.\" continued the girl. \"And his middle name is Hussein, and his name rhymes with the greatest terrorist America ever had: Osama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A black man is running for president?\" shouted Abe. Around them people stopped and stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known you were rascist,\" sneered the girl. \"Get away from me before I use my karate to break your legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" shouted Abe, before looking around and reducing his voice. \"It is just a pleasant surprise to me. I am not rascist. If anything I support the blacks more than anyone where I come from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am supposed to believe that?\" she asked him, looking at him up and down in a contemptuous way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the truth young lady,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds she seemed to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have come a long way in America,\" she continued. \"From the abolition of slavery in 1865 by Abraham Lincoln, before he was assassinated.\"<br>\r\nAbe gasped at her statement, then quickly averted his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Where did you go to that you don't know that Abraham Lincoln was assasinated?\" asked the young lady. \"That one was from history, more than 100 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please can you direct me to the local library?\" Abraham asked instead, ignoring her question. How could he tell her that he travelled to that year from the past? As James had said, they would put him in a straitjacket instead of accept and marvel at the scientific breakthrough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him directions, and he thanked her for her time, before heading off in the opposite direction. Two hours later he came out of the enormous building with a tired smile on his face. He had read up all he could on Obama and McCain. He had read up all he could about his tenure as a president, He had read up all he could about slavery abolition and the acceptance of the blacks as people. He had read up all he could about James Borgadus's future. He had learnt all he needed to know. He was ready to go back home. Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned around and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshook his head in confusion. Then he turned to the drunk beside him and asked,<br>\r\n\"Is Halloween still on?\"<br>\r\nThe other guy shook his head.<br>\r\n\"Please I asked you a question,\" James said again, this time in a pleading tone. He'd sent the Sixteenth President of the United States of America to the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwrong year, and he'd panicked and come in after him. He had not thought of how hard it would be to trace him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean the guy in the Abraham Lincoln Halloween costume, yes I saw him,\" replied the young man, who was closer to being drunk than he was an hour <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore when Abe had been with him. \"He asked me so many funny questions. Thought the year was 2000, said he didn't know elections was going on, and all <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you both due for a gig or something?\" he asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" James replied, not bothering to decipher what 'gig' meant. \"We are. Please can you direct me to where he is right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help you wi' that, am afraid.\" replied the young man. \"He went out to see the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" murmured James, now feeling panic anew. Chicago, Illinois in 2000 was extremely big, and overfilled with people of all sorts and ages. As he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmoved towards the door, he dreaded the crowd he would be seeing on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you call his cellphone?\" suggested the young man. \"Its easier that way. You can stay here and wait for him and tell me all about your gig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Sir, but I think its better to search for him.\" James said again. How was he supposed to know what a cellphone was? Was Abraham in prison?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wandering around for another hour, James had too much information: The Democratic Rally was holding in Chicago, about 5 blocks from the tavern that <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey had landed through - as if he knew what sort of blocks they were refering to; the Democratic Candidate was a black man who's father was an African; and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwho had an Arabian middle name; the Republican candidate was very old, and his vice - presidential candidate was a woman. But he could not find Abe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespairing the more as time seemed to speed by on his pocket watch, James stood at the corner of a building, pausing for breath beside a young lady overladen <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith badges that read \"Obama for President\". Where would Abraham go in this madness?<br>\r\nHe asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it Halloween is not over for you too,\" the lady said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me?\" James asked, not quite understanding what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were friends with the guy in the Lincoln costume,\" she said. \"You are dressed alike. But who are you playing as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James Borgadus\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of him,\" the lady replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stared at her for a few minutes, before remembering to use the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please I am looking for my friend, the person you just said wore the Lincoln attire,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attire?\" repeated the lady. \"Wow. Such a quaint word. Your friend badgered me with so many questions, then asked for directions to the library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The library?\" repeated James. \"Where is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him directions, and waved him off as a mob of people approached them. James hurried in the direction she had pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a little over an hour to return to the tavern and to their own time. He didn't know if the window opened after that.<br>\r\nHe needed to find the president in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was however wearing something that closely resembled a sheriff's uniform, and that meant the law, so Abraham did as he was told and stepped <br>\r\n<br>\r\naside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please identify yourself,\" the man said.<br>\r\n\"My name is Abraha..\" Abraham was interrupted.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know that is what you are dressed up as,\" the man said. \"I am asking for your real name Mister.\"<br>\r\nAbraham stared hard at the man.

He was obviously wondering where the questions were leading.<br>\r\n\"Is it still a citizen's right in the United States of America to walk around and use the library?\" Abraham asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" the man replied.<br>\r\n\"Then may I ask why I am being detained right now?\" Abraham asked.<br>\r\nThe man stared at Abraham, and Abraham stared right back. Sixty seconds later, the man stepped aside.<br>\r\n\"Sorry for delaying you Sir,\" he said. \"We are just trying to make sure that the rally remains a safe event.You know, some goofheads already tried to kill <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenator Obama.\"<br>\r\n\"Its alright.\" Abraham replied as he walked away briskly, in the direction he'd come from. He didn't breath until he was sure he was out of earshot from the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nman. He had almost been arrested. He withdrew his gold watch from his waistcoat and gasped at the time. He'd spent two hours in the library. He had only an <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhour to return to the tavern and to his own time.<br>\r\nThat was his last thought as he felt a stunning blow at the back of his neck and he crumbled to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am telling you the truth Sir!\" shouted James at the man sitting in front of him. \"I am not a criminal and I am not sick in the head as you suggest! My <br>\r\n<br>\r\nname is James Borgadus and I am looking for Abraham Lincoln.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man just sat there staring back at him. James had been asked to step aside for questioning on his way to the library. He had not hesitated when he was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nasked to identify himself, but unfortunately for him, one of the police officers that had stopped him was a history buff who recogized the name instantly and <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntold him he was lying. The resulting argument had led to his arrest, and he was now being questioned in a small room in the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wished he had turned Abraham down now, because his confidence that he would be able to return the sixteenth president of the United States of America <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto his own time was waning seriously.<br>\r\n\"When you are through with your Halloween stories,\" the man questioning him finally said as he rose. \"You'll give me the real deal. Let me leave you for a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfew minutes so you can collect your thoughts.\"<br>\r\nJames sighed in resignation. He glanced at the bare room and the thick glass wall opposite him and sighed again. He would never be able to reach Abraham now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only pray that the man's curiosity was abated in the library, and that baring unforeseen circumstances, Abraham went straight back to that tavern, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand back home as he'd instructed. At least only one of them would be missing in their own time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He believes his own stories\" the officer muttered to his counterpart as they stared at James Borgadus.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the other man replied. \"Probably some psycho that escaped from somewhere nearby.\"<br>\r\nHis partner nodded in agreement.<br>\r\nThree minutes later, another policeman came to join them at their watching post.<br>\r\n\"Funny day this is,\" he began, after nodding at the two. \"Got a guy at the library claiming to be Abraham Lincoln. All dressed up as him too, with the right <br>\r\n<br>\r\nheight and face. He started questioning me when I asked him to identif...\"<br>\r\n\"Abraham Lincoln?\" he was interrupted.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, old Abe himself\" he replied as he watched the other two look at each other.<br>\r\n\"I believe we have something going on here. Bring him in here let's see their reaction to each other.\" the policeman that had been questioning James said.<br>\r\n\"I think we might have interrupted something big,\" his partner said. \"Think we should call in the Feds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************** <br>\r\n\"James!\" exclaimed Abraham as he entered the room. \"What in the world are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"Sir!\" James exclaimed, his happiness shortlived as he realized that seeing Abraham in the police station meant one thing: He had also been arrested.<br>\r\n\"You came to look for me?\" Abraham surmised.<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir,\" replied James, \"after I realised I pressed the wrong dial last. I sent you to 2008, not 2000.\"<br>\r\n\"What dial?\" asked the police officer that had ushered Abraham in. He shook his head at their silence.<br>\r\n\"You guys better stop your games and get serious. Its one thing to plan something dangerous on a normal day, but today is not a normal day. Today's the day <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe most important event in the history of America will take place and we are not about to let some petty - minded criminals mess it up for us so you better <br>\r\n<br>\r\nconfess and make things easy for yourself or we are calling the Feds in\"<br>\r\nJames and Abraham glanced at each other and then at the police man.<br>\r\nAbraham found his tongue first. \"What is 'the Feds'?\"<br>\r\nThe man's eyes widened. He could not believe that these two men would dare him. He turned on his heel and stormed out.<br>\r\n\"Abraham, don't ask questions like that,\" James said. \"It would only increase their curiosity and anger. They obviously don't believe we are who we say we <br>\r\n<br>\r\nare, so let's stop trying to convince them. What we need to concentrate on is getting out of here in time to catch that time window in that tavern.\"<br>\r\n\"How much time do we have left?\" asked Abraham.<br>\r\n\"They took my pocketwatch, but I think we should have about an hour more.\"replied James.<br>\r\n\"For what its worth,\" Abraham began after a few seconds of silence. \"I am grateful for the opportunity you have given me.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you see that its all useless if you don't return?\" James shouted in frustration.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Abraham.<br>\r\n\"If you don't return tonight, you will never abolish slavery, America will never be united, and today will never happen!\"<br>\r\n\"Its a good thing we are recording this,\" Jack Golleunez said to his partner as they listened from the other side of the thick glass. \"I am sure the Feds <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwould find it interesting.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" agreed Godwin Letterman as he entered their listening posts again. \"The Feds are on their way.\"<br>\r\n\"But surely you would know that I could not have left it all hanging before I came to your house this evening?\" Abraham said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked James.<br>\r\n\"I left instructions that would put in motion the abolition should in case I disappear. I told my staff I wanted to lie low for a week, and made each one <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbelieve I was in another's care.\"<br>\r\n\"But with all due respect Sir,\" replied James. \"You realize that if we do not make it to the time window in a hour's time, I am very certain your absence <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwill be longer than a week.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't get upset James,\" said Abraham. \"Let us apply our thinking faculties instead, to getting us out of this dilemma.\"<br>\r\n\"Well said Sir,\" muttered James, who still felt a bit apprehensive to be arguing with the president.<br>\r\nTheir silence was broken by the inburst of two people in suits.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When they continued to keep mute, the man added.<br>\r\n\"We would like to meet you, and ask for the purpose of your visit to Chicago.\"<br>\r\nAbraham looked hard at the man as he placed a small tape recorder on the table and pressed a button, before speaking.<br>\r\n\"My name is Abraham Lincoln, and I think this conversation would be easier on both of us if you sat down at the table as well.\"<br>\r\nThe two men exchanged glances at the authority they could detect in his voice. They obeyed him silently.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" he continued. \"As I said my name is Abraham Lincoln and I was born in 1809. My friend here is James Borgadus, the inventor of the cotton ring-flyer, the mechanized engraving machine and all the cast - iron architecture in Washington. In our time I am the President of the United States of America.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that you have travelled from the past?\" asked the second man in suit incredulously. His counterpart raised a hand to silence him.<br>\r\n\"When and how did you arrive Sir?\" Gerald asked.<br>\r\n\"We arrived via the time machine that James here has invented, one after the other.\" Abraham replied. \"James please tell these gentlemen a little bit on how it works.\"<br>\r\nJames didn't see how that would help them out but he followed orders.<br>\r\n\"Basically the machine uses time pockets that exist in our world, but these pockets are extremely small and live a short duration,\" James began. \"What the machine does is locate an available pocket and use it to launch into whatever time you want to go to.\"<br>\r\n\"So you used a time machine to get to 2008, right?\" asked Gerald as he took notes.<br>\r\n\"Yes. we did,\" replied James. \"We landed in the washroom of a tavern called..\"<br>\r\n\"You mean a bar\" Fred interrupted.<br>\r\n\"That word was in the name,\" agreed James. \"True Chicago Bar is its name.\"<br>\r\nGerald tore off a note and handed it to Fred who left the room hurriedly.<br>\r\n\"Ok, you have answered the how,\" said Gerald. \"That still leaves out the when.\"<br>\r\n\"We arrived this very evening.\" replied Abraham.<br>\r\n\"And why?\" asked Gerald.<br>\r\n\"We never intended to come to 2008 in the first place,\" replied Abraham.<br>\r\n\"No?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\" replied James. \"I have been to Chicago, in the year 2000. I was supposed to send him to the same time and period but I made a mistake with the digits and typed 8 instead of another zero. When I noted my mistake I came in after him to get him. I was on my way to meeting him at the library when I was arrested by the sheriffs. They didnt believe me at all. They thought I was mentally ill.\"<br>\r\n\"That is understandable Mr. James,\" stated Gerald as he refrained from correcting James that they were policemen not sherriffs. \"Put yourself in their shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in a funny suit says his name is the same as someone who died over 100 years ago, and he is looking for Abraham Lincoln, who is also dead for over a hundred years. The man will either be a ghost, or a sick man.\"<br>\r\n\"So you had no idea of what's happening in the country at the moment?\" Gerald continued.<br>\r\n\"I did not.\" replied Abraham. \"I began asking questions from inside the tavern especially after I heard a talking box with pictures. I headed for the library  to see what information I could find.\"<br>\r\n\"Neither did I,\" added James. \"But from what I can gather the whole country is awaiting election results. One of the candidates is a black man, of African descent.\"<br>\r\n\"That should make you happy Sir,\" James said directly to Abraham, who nodded with his first smile in hours.<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed it does,\" he said, before turning to Gerald. \"That is the major reason I decided to travel. I wanted to see the future of the country if I insisted on the abolition of slavery. In our time, it has reached a defining point, and I am about to take my stand, but I was curious as to how it would all <br>\r\nend.\"<br>\r\n\"And what did you find?\" asked Gerald silently.<br>\r\n\"I combed through all that has happened since our present day and I must say that I am glad at the way things turned out.\" replied Abraham. \"Slavery has become a thing of the past, and the United States of America is still a free country. And its still one entity, and not divided.\"<br>\r\n\"So how do you intend to return to your own time now that your curiosity has been satisfied?\" Gerald asked as Fred rushed back in with two notes.<br>\r\nGerald raised an arm to stop James from speaking as he opened the notes to read. Then he nodded at Fred before looking at James.<br>\r\n\"The time pocket lasts up to 3 hours, 4 hours at most. We are supposed to pass though at midnight.\" James explained.<br>\r\n\"So how much time do you have left?\" asked Fred.<br>\r\n\"We were stripped of our watches when we got here,\" replied Abraham, \"but we had an hour before then.\"<br>\r\n\"That's long before the announcement of the results, right?\" Fred asked Gerald, who nodded in affirmation. Gerald turned to Abraham and James.<br>\r\n\"Then it appears that we have to hurry,\" he said with a smile as he rose from the seat. \"Give me a minute to arrange your transportation back to the bar.\"<br>\r\nWhen he got out of the room, he faced Godwin and Jack<br>\r\n\"Those guys are definitely sick upstairs,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"But can two people be sick together? Believe their own delusions together?\" asked Godwin.<br>\r\n\"That's what makes it so spooky,\" replied Jack.\"But their stories are straight so far, and I am talking about from the bar. Even the girl selling badges on <br>\r\nthe sidewalk remembered them,\"<br>\r\n\"So what do we do about this?\" asked Godwin.</span></div></div>",

We can just file this in a report. He can read it later, after celebrating the election results.\"<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" added Fred. \"Its better that way, killing two bir...\" he was interrupted by his cell phone ringing. As the head of the unit in charge of ensuring the safety of the presidential candidate and his family's life, he had a good personal rapor with Senator Obama so much so that the man was always quick to notice his absence, even for thirty minutes. Without a doubt his absence had been noticed.<br>\r\n\"Hello Gerry,\" Senator Obama said into the phone. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n\"At the local police station sir,\" Gerald replied. The senator was among the very few people he allowed to call him 'Gerry'. The only other person was his mother.<br>\r\n\"What's cooking over there that needed your attention?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing serious sir,\" Gerald responded. \"Just a couple of time-travelers that missed their way.\"<br>\r\n\"Time-Travelers?\" repeated the Senator. \"That is interesting. Whatever will they come up with next?\"<br>\r\n\"That's what keeps this job interesting sir,\" Gerald said.<br>\r\n\"Bring them here for further questioning?\" asked the senator.</span></div></div>",

When the would-be assassins that had made an attempt on his life had been caught, the senator actually wanted to talk to the men, to ask them why. Gerald knew the request would be the same this time, never mind that he was putting himself in danger by doing such a thing.<br>\r\n\"Gerry, where are you taking them?\" asked the senator.<br>\r\n\"To the bar they claim houses their time machine, Sir\" replied Gerald.\"We have cleared the place so there can be no issue of other accomplices in the crowd to aid them in anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"Great.\" said the senator. \"Can I come and watch? I wont be an accomplice I promise.\"<br>\r\nGerald had to smile. This man that the world took very seriously had his funny side as well. But could he actually put the senator's life in danger, three hours from his victory being announced? No way.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sir but you will have to pass on this one,\" Gerald responded. \"Its not uncommon to make an attempt on a candidate's life hours before the election results have been announced.

We are not to try to alter the future in anyway because we do not know how it will affect the past and our own time.\"<br>\r\n\"But we have already affected the future, James,\" replied Abe. \"The men that arrested us, and these men that have been so kind as to help us, will have it on record that we came here.\"<br>\r\n\"Sir they will have it on record that some crazy people claiming to be you and me came here,\" James responded. \"There is an acute difference Sir.\"<br>\r\nGerald and Fred watched in silence. Fred faced Gerald and mouthed 'delay tactic', and Gerald nodded in response. Abe, being taller than all of them, saw this however, and sighed.<br>\r\n\"They think we are stalling, James\" he said. \"Please lead the way.\"<br>\r\nJames led them to the cloakroom through which he'd landed. Gerald and Fred watched as he opened the door slightly, then pointed for Abe to go in first.<br>\r\n\"No James, you go in first this time,\" Abe said. \"I will follow immediately. Besides I hope we wont be muddling things if I went in first since you came out last.\"<br>\r\nJames nodded, then turned to the other two men. \"Thank you for believing us. I will search for your ancestors in my time to repay the kindness.\"<br>\r\nAll Fred and Gerald could do was nod in response.<br>\r\nJames closed the door, and they waited. Nothing happened. No noise, no blinding light.<br>\r\nGerald glanced at Abe, \"You sure its not broken?\"<br>\r\n\"I do not know,\" Abe responded. \"Its James' invention not mine.\"<br>\r\nAfter waiting for ten minutes, Gerald lost his patience and yanked open the door. It was empty.<br>\r\nHe panicked. He grabbed his radio and began shouting orders for his men to begin searching for James within ten miles of the area. Then he called for the experts to come and study the room more closely - it was obvious that they had missed something in their early search.<br>\r\nAbe just stared, and watched as three men and a woman came and began running their hands all over the room. After ten minutes Abe walked up to Gerald.<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon but I really need to be going now. I have barely thirty minutes left before midnight.\"<br>\r\n\"Is something happening at midnight?\" Gerald asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Abe. \"According to James, the time pocket is likely to close then, and that means I will be stranded here indefinitely.\"<br>\r\nBefore Gerald could find an apt response, a hush fell on the rest of the crowd.

I didn't need an army to follow me about.\"<br>\r\n\"Since then sir, there have been several assassinations, and attempts on very special people's lives,\" the senator said. \"These were the measures prescribed for protection.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Abe. \"I have read about them, even my own.\" he muttered to himself<br>\r\n\"Are you not jeopardizing your safety to associate with me?\" Abe asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes we are,\" replied the senator. \"But the minute I saw you I knew you were no fake.\"<br>\r\n\"I must congratulate you for your successful climb to where you are now, young man,\" Abe said to him. \"You have indeed worked very hard to get there, in a time when corruption seems to be the order of the day.\"<br>\r\nFor once, the senator had no response for such high praise.<br>\r\n\"I have also read about the current world situation,\" continued Abe. \"and while I am extremely pleased to see that the whole world seems to look up to America for guidance, the situation in the Arabian world is not a source of joy for me. And what the present president has done so far does not help matters. It is your duty as a nation to ensure that others also live in peace around you, else they look upon you with scorn which in time develops into hatred that might lead to an attack.\"<br>\r\n\"We will do our best sir,\" the senator replied modestly. Abe continued giving advice on several matters he'd read about in the two hours he'd spent in the library.<br>\r\n\"You speak as if my husband's winning this election is a foregone conclusion, Mr President,\" The senator's wife commented.<br>\r\n\"Yes it is indeed,\" Abe responded. \"His opponent is extremely weak, does not have his facts straight and is low. I do not expect any difference in the results from what I can see. Your husband is the next president of the United States of America.\"<br>\r\nGerald had been about to inform them that the coast was clear, when he caught that information.<br>\r\nAbe saw him stop midstride and asked, \"Is it time?\" To which the young man nodded. The three of them arose at the same time and walked back to the cloakroom door.<br>\r\n\"It was a great honor to have met you Mr. President,\" The senator said as Abe turned around, presumably to say farewell.<br>\r\n\"No,\" Abe responded. \"The pleasure was all mine.

How?\"<br>\r\n\"They did not believe that some trick was not involved with your departure,\" replied Abe. \"So they proceeded to search every surface area in that cloakroom  for a clue or button.\"<br>\r\n\"What did you do in the meantime?\" asked James. \"And did they find anything?\"<br>\r\n\"The black presidential candidate came to see me,\" replied Abe as he accepted the cup of tea James extended to him. \"No they didn't find anything - what would you have done if they did?\"<br>\r\n\"Filed the information away.\" replied James. \"I always wondered why the time pocket chose where it did as the end point. My early theory is that it is a random selection.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a brief chat with the candidate and his wife.\" continued Abe thoughtfully. \"It was enlightening and I am grateful for the opportunity, James.\"<br>\r\n\"The gratitude is all mine, Sir\" replied James.<br>\r\n\"It was quite an advanture,\" added Abe. \"At least I now know the date of my death and the manner in which it will take place.\"<br>\r\nHe looked at James' aghast expression and added. \"I even know who will do it. It is an invaluable piece of information, and I intend to use it appropriately.\"<br>\r\n\"How sir?\" James could not help asking, as he watched the president rise and walk toward the general doorway.<br>\r\n\"Why, I will plan ahead of course. I might not have the time to visit you again for a while, James, but I will never forget your kindness and invention.\"</span></div></div>",
