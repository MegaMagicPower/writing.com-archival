You can take in a show, visit a nightclub, dine out at the many high quality restaurants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, if you're Barbara Gordon, you can spend your evening staking out an abandoned warehouse in the danker part of the city, on one of the coldest nights of the year, wearing what amounted to a skimpy pair of long johns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call had gone out just a few hours ago. Mr. Freeze had escaped from a supposedly high security convoy, and was up to his old tricks. There had already been a spate of ice themed robberies across the city, and Bruce had called her up to stakeout a potential hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStakeout involved sitting on top of a dilapidated apartment building for hours on end, just in case the bad guy showed up. Even with the intel of Wayne Enterprises, it usually turned out to be a bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is it just me', Barbara thought bitterly, wrapping her cape around herself in a vain attempt to keep out the cold, ' or does someone escape from Arkham almost every week?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few reasons the masked maiden was in such a foul mood. The cold was obviously a factor, but as well as that, tonight was supposed to be her first night off in weeks. She'd been looking forward to kicking back, taking a load off... but try explaining the concept of taking it easy to a man who hasn't taken a night off in a decade. Also she was starving. She skipped lunch, planning to order in and pig out, but that was before the jailbreak. And then there was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perimeter's still all clear chief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim Drake, the third and current Robin. Barbara wouldn't have believed it, but he was actually more annoying than Dick Grayson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great Tim. Maybe you should check again. Y'know, just to be sure?\" Barbara replied, trying to keep the sarcasm out of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, all I know is I've gone on patrol six times since we got here and all you've done is sit on your fat butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here 'Boy Wonder', I've been on more stakeouts than you've had hot dinners!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, looks like you've been having plenty of those too 'Fatgirl!' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara flushed scarlet. \"Why you little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Barbara's retort would have to wait, as suddenly Mr. Freeze and a mob of what looked like eskimos came running down the alley below them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara quickly assessed the situation and turned to Robin. \"Okay Tim, here's what we'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was already gone, swinging down from the fire escape, before landing squarely on top of two goons, knocking them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ICE to see you again Freezy. Hope you don't mind me DROPPING in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara groaned at the lame bravado before jumping down into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in the middle of a fight, it still seemed to Barbara like she was just going through the motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunch goon, spinning kick, dodge ice blast, witty repartee, kick, punch, seemingly lose, suddenly turn it around, say clever pun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it the fight was over, Freeze was unconscious and Tim was giving a play by play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see when I dodged that last ice blast? It was like 'WHOOSH' and I was like 'ICE try!' and Freeze was all 'Curse you Boy Wonder! Curse you!' And then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara wasn't really listening. She was just imagining sinking her teeth into that doubled stuffed pepperoni pizza with extra cheese that she'd been craving all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a cry from Tim, pointing at one of Freeze's henchmen who was trying to make his escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it.\" said Barbara casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have just bataranged him, but then she decided a little showmanship would remind the kid who was the senior partner around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little swing on the fire escape, a flip and she'd land precisely on the bad guy's shoulders. Piece a cake, sort of thing she'd done a thousand times before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust up and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          ******************************************************************************** ************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth happened?\" asked Alfred, as Barbara hobbled into the Batcave, supported by Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little accident, y' know, momentary lapse of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She slipped and fell right on her ass!\" exclaimed Tim, a beaming grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred grimaced \"Language Timothy. Now then let's get you up here Ms. Gordon, and see what the damage is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as a butler, Alfred was also a trained soldier, actor and medic, and. after a perfunctory examination, diagnosed a sprained ankle, and prescribed plenty of rest and relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this Barbara smiled. Could be worse, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How long do you think I'll be out for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, well it depends Ms. Gordon. With plenty of rest, I don't see it taking more than maybe 4 to 6 weeks to heal\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I better call the Library and tell them I won't be in for a few weeks...\" Barbara sighed dejectedly. She loved her job as Gotham City's head librarian, and was a little disappointed to hear that she would be confined to sitting on her butt for a month and a half. But, still, she had been firing on all cylinders for the past few months, trying to juggle between her life as a librarian and her life as a crime fighter. A small vacation was starting to sound better and better now. At least she could finally get that pig-out that she had been planning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bruce had finally arrived home, (At around 7 in the morning no less. Being Batman took nothing less than a full commitment from him), he was mortified to hear from Alfred that one of his partners had been hurt in the line of work. Though Batman had always been painted by the public as a lone stalwart dark avenger, the truth was that he cared deeply for his partners. There was always a part of him that was terrified that one night, he would lose one of his partners, just like he had lost Jason Todd, his previous Robin, before Tim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarbara, please tell me you are alright\u201d Bruce asked worriedly. He would never have been forgive himself if he allowed one of his partners to get hurt again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine. It was really my fault anyway.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I was the one who called you and asked you to do a stake-out on your night out. This is my fault.  I asked you to patrol that night even though this was your one-night off in some time. I want to make it up to you, while you recuperate, why don\u2019t you stay here at Wayne Manor? Just so Alfred can keep an eye on you, and help you with anything you need\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to be a bother to him\u201d Barbara said shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense Ms. Gordon, it would be my pleasure\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026if you insist!\u201d Barbara exclaimed. A whole month and a half at the most luxurious mansion in Gotham, being waited on hand and foot? Spraining her ankle was looking more and more like the best thing she had done in years! <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So until you have made a full recovery, I just want you to sit here and relax. I'm here to take care of any of your needs.\" Barbara had been situated in Wayne Manor's posh parlor, plopped in a deliciously recliner in front of one of the largest televisions she had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Bruce seldom uses this room, he keeps it mostly for show. The life of a playboy is one of frivoulous luxury, and it wouldn't be a very convincing guise if he didn't live the cliche. Now then Ms Gordon, if you need anything, just anything, just ring this buzzer and I'll be there in a bustle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Alfred, you sure know how to treat a girl.\" Barbara paused as a hunger pang tore through her stomach, emitting a loud groan that begged for to eat. She had almost forgotten how hungry she was.\"Erm, Alfred before you leave, would you mind making me something to eat? I seriously haven't eaten all day and I'm just starving right now\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly. And what can I get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been just craving a deep dish pepperoni pizza today. Do you think you could whip me up one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Anything you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and do you think you could make me some hot wings? I'm really hungry. Oh and do you think you can make me some ribs as well? And maybe a few chili cheeseburgers! Oh and maybe some cookie dough ice cream, that just sounds heavenly\" Barbara salivated at the thought of so much delicious food. She wanted a pig-out and by god she was going to have one, she had already made the decision that tonight was going to be about one thing. Stuffing herself to the gills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Ms Gordon. I'll have your dinner out as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarabra's meal had taken nearly 2 hours to cook, but dinner was finally served. Babs had spent the last few hours virtually motionless, lazily watching TV in an attempt to curb her hunger pangs. When the dinner carts had finally begun being rolled into the master living room, she nearly squealed in delight. She was starving, and god damn it she needed to eat! The first course to be served to her was the deep dish pizza she had been craving all night, she had been craving it so deeply in fact, that when Alfred brought it over to her, she ripped it from his hands, just so she could dig in faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her first bite, savoring the taste as best she could, before finally inhaling the greasy treat in a matter of mere seconds. The rest of her meal fell almost as quickly. She greedily stripped the wings and ribs of their flesh,  not even caring that her face and fingers were covered with the delicious sauce. When she finally came to the burgers, she was absolutely thrilled to find that her plate was just filled with the scrumptous burgers. Almost 11 total just crowding the plate, Alfred must have known that she would devour the rest of her meal, and had made her a little extra. But, the sheer amount of burgers weren't enough to slow Barbara down, taking a burger in each hand and cramming them into her face as quickly as she could. It took only a few minutes for those burgers to find themselves disappear down her widening maw, the chili finding it's way onto her sweater and jeans, but she didn't care. The food stupor had already taken complete control of her. Barbara's stomach groaned in protest, it's capacity having already been filled several times over, but she still had one more obstacle to conqueror. Dessert. Unlike the rest of her meal, Barbara decided that she would rather savor her ice cream, rather than just inhaling it. Spoonful after spoonful of the ice cream found it's way to her mouth, her stomach screaming for her to stop at every step of the way, but she prevailed, and before long the sundae had met the same fate as the rest of her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhhh...\" was the only word that could come to mind. Her stuffed belly had swollen to that of a pregnant woman, still firm from the feast it had just undergone. Her stomach moaned and groaned as she finally released it from it's denim cage, her swelled stomach sighing in relief. Barbara's feeding frenzy had left her in a complete stupor,  she had not even noticed that Alfred had seen the entire ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Goodness Ms Gordon, I've never seen such a display of gluttony...\" Alfred muttered, as he was slightly disgusted by the whole affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara just craned her neck towards Alfred, let out an enormous belch, and quickly drifted off into her food induced coma. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barbara had fallen into a deep last night after her pig out and had slept well. It was the best night's sleep she had gotten in awhile. She moaned softly as she slowly opened her eyes after feeling the sunlight him. She glanced over at the clock and saw that it was 10am. It was then that she noticed that she wasn't in her home but then quickly remembered that she was staying at Wayne Manor while she recovered from her leg injury. All off a sudden she heard her stomach grumble loudly and she felt very hungry. Well since I am recoopering from an injury I think I deserve a big breakfast. I need to recover after all she reasoned and reached over to the buzzer, ringing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Gordon?\" Alfred replied. \"Could you bring me a plate of chocolate chip pancakes with butter and maple syrup, a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch, a box of donuts, and a glass of milk and orange juice please?\" Barbara requested sweetly. She had seen how disgusted Alfred was after seeing her pig out last night so she figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to lay on the sweetness when she asked him for more food today. \"Of course, it will be right up Miss\" Alfred replied. Barbara was relieved that Alfred wasn't still upset about last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Afred had been disgusted by Barbara's pig out last night, he was glad to finally have someone in the house who would eat what he prepared them. So for that reason he was not going to complain or make a big deal about Barbara making a pig of herself. After preparing her food and drinks, he placed them on a tray, and carried them up to her. \"Thank you Alfred\" Barbara replied sweetly with her best smile as she slowly sat up in bed, leaning against her pillow. Alfred sat the tray down on her lap. \"Bon Appetite and call me if you need anything else\" Alfred said before leaving to attend to other duties around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Alfred, I will\" Barbara called back to Alfred's retreating figure. All the food in front of her looked so good that she didn't know which to start with. She finally decided on the pancakes since they were warm. She quickly cut herself a big bite and took a bite. \"Mm, so good\" she moaned softly before helping herself to another bite, and another. The pancakes were so good that she could not stop eating them until she had eaten them all. To wash them down she took a couple sips of her orange juice. She next decided to have her milk. She poured the separate milk Alfread had left for her cereal into the bowl and quickly ate her cereal. She had always loved cereal. She was a big cereal girl.  She then washed the cereal down with the rest of her orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara was pleasantly surprised with the big box of donuts Alfred had left for her. She was not sure she would be able to eat the whole box now but decided to just eat as much as she could now and save the rest for later. She opened the box, pulled out the first donut, and took a bite. \"Mm, so good\" she moaned softly before taking another bite and another until she had finished it. Already hungry for more, she grabbed a second donut and quickly consumed it. Starting to feel a little thristy again, she picked up her glass of milk and took a couple of  sips. She then grabbed another donut and quickly began to eat it. She had always loved donuts. They were always so sweet and tasty. She had never allowed herself to really indulge in them before but she figured that now would be the time to since she was injured.  After she finished third donut, she quickly ate a fourth before washing them both down with a couple more sips of her milk. She then began to repeat this process of having two donuts and then washing them with a couples sips of milk over and over again.</span></div></div>",

Barbara's belly burgeoned out, unzipping her jeans to accommodate its larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, placing a hand on her belly. \"Seems like I ate a bit too much, huh?\" she said, rubbing the overstuffed orb soothingly. <i> Can't say it wasn't worth it, though...</i> Barbara mused to herself.

Which was good for Barbara's academics, as it allowed her to catch up on her coursework before finals. However, as far as keeping her waistline trim, there was a little left to be desired. While she normally would cook her own meals, late-night study sessions meant that Barbara would end up skipping meals and ordering fast food more often than she normally would.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another few days went by since Barbra\u2019s little inspection in regards to her new pudgy midsection, and those days were spent doing three main things; eating, watching TV, and resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne\u2019s always loyal butler, walked toward the room Ms. Gordon took in while she heals her broken bones; and upon reaching the door, she could hear Barbra laughing, the shuffling of a pizza box, and to the englishman\u2019s slight disgust, a slightly loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the noises behind him, he knocked on the door. He heard the TV go mute a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Barbra said from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me. Ms. Gordon. I just wanted to ask what you wanted for dinner, given that pizza hasn\u2019t filled you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no I\u2019m starving.\u201d Barbra responded, in a slightly dramatic tone. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to put you through any trouble; think you could order another\u2026.er, make it two large pepperoni pizzas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight look of shock came across the butlers face for two reasons: 1. Ms. Gordon must know how unhealthy this is, what it will do to her later on. And 2. How is she not full yet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr, of course, Ms. Gordon. I\u2019ll be right on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Barbra replied kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the englishman walked away, Barbra turned her TV volume back up just in time for the news. She was resting in her queen sized bed that she rarely left while laid up (half because of her leg; the other half simply because of laziness) and was clad in her favorite purple PJs which \u201cironically\u201d had Bats on them (She grew to have a fondness for the animals; as long as they weren\u2019t half man). Despite just requesting her dinner, she had a bag of chips resting comfortably on her side, her slightly wider side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the eating and lazing around continued to add up on her body, mostly in her belly area; which was now poking through her PJs, revealing her snow white skin and tiny innie belly button. Beyond that, her face and cheeks had gotten slightly plumper (not to the point where her cowl would fit uncomfortably tight, but still plumper) and her breasts and butt were ever so slightly expanded. All together, since she was laid up, she must\u2019ve gained at least 25 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan. This is the life.\u201d Barbra moaned as she absent mind-idly stared at the TV, which seemed to be focusing on an annual singing contest, and the current first place contender, a man clad in purple with odd looking goggles and orange, bushy hair. \u201cYummy food, comfy bed; no school, and the freedom to be lazy without Bruce tiring me out.\u201d She continued shoving more chips in her gaping mouth, resting her hands behind her head giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit was during a commercial when Barbra\u2019s eyes moved down to her slightly protruding stomach. She knew she had put on a few, but she was slightly taken aback by the size of her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish junk food didn\u2019t make you fat.\u201d She said placing a hand on her stomach, beginning to rub it in a small circle, \u201cIf that were the case, then I\u2019d be a selfish pig forever.\u201d She continued toe rub her little belly, causing her to giggle over how ticklish her midsection was and oddly enough\u2026how good it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen again-\u201c she thought, \u201cthis feels\u2026kinda nice. I mean, my skin is as soft as a babies, minus some cuts and sores from crime fighting, and a layer of chub makes it feel\u2026.sooooo goooood.\u201d She hit a sweet spot of pleasure on her belly, now only rubbing in that area as her head fell back on her pillow, slight drool coming from her mouth. She originally intended to work off the weight she was gaining, but now, she thought she could keep a few pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, she happily played with her belly, rubbing it, shaking it, jiggling it, all making her feel so good; she even began to blush as she lifted her shirt slightly to continue her belly play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more minutes went by, when her playtime was interrupted by\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMs. Gordon? Are you awake? Your pizza has arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbra immediately put her shirt back down and her blush intensified by the sudden voice at her door. \u201cThank God he\u2019s a gentlemen, or else he might have walked in on me.\u201d She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind then quickly travelled to the food Alfred had. \u201cYes, Yes! Come in!\u201d She said trying to hide her excitement and hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butler opened the door, holding the pizza boxes like a platter neatly and well-balanced, walking over and setting them on the bed next to Barbra. Alfred was always good at hiding his looks of digest or fear over the years of taking care of Bruce and three generations of Robin\u2019s, but it took all his might not to cringe at Barbra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it wasn\u2019t a lot of weight, it was definitely noticeable, mostly in the young girls belly, which was ever so slightly peeking through her PJs. He knows that if she keeps eating like this, she\u2019ll slow down and get tiered too easily, a dangerous thing for someone with her \u201cjob\u201d. Not to mention no doubt being mocked by her peers because of her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything else you want.\u201d Alfred said beginning to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, actually one quick thing.\u201d Barbra said quickly. Alfred turned his head to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you, uh, lock the door on your way out? I\u2019ll be heading to bed soon so, just don\u2019t want to make you do the trip later.\u201d She said smiling shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred smiled back calmly. \u201cOf course, goodnight Ms. Gordon.\u201d Alfred said locking up and walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, Alfred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door was shut and Barbra was sure Alfred was gone. She proceeded to lift her shirt back up, revealing her pale pudge once again, before staring at her pizzas in awe and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Time for a good meal.\u201d She said rubbing her belly and opening the box; the smell hit her nose and she smiled wider. \u201cSmells delicious.\u201d She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbra grabbed a plate Alfred brought in with the boxes and grabbed a slice, laying it in her lap as she went back to her TV, turning on a cooking show, which only made her hungrier. She then grabbed the pizza slice in her hands and began to munch on it, groaning in delight. \u201cYummy.\u201d She said between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first slice was gone in 40 seconds, and a new slice took its place. Barbra felt the soft dough, the gooy cheese, and the tender pepperoni move through her tounge, down her throat and in her gut, which she was still rubbing slowly. Every bite was followed by a groan in delight, it sounded as if Barbra hadn\u2019t eaten in days, when in reality she last ate ten minutes ago. But that didn\u2019t stop her from eating a box and a half of pizza!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shoving the last bit of her last slice, she put her other hand on her stomach, which was now protruding farther than it ever has before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cooooohhhhh.\u201d Barbra moaned her head slowly moving to the side, her eyeslids drooping, cheese covering the area around her lips. \u201c*Hic!* So much\u2026.*Hic* pizza\u2026\u2026..So\u2026*Hic* full.\u201d She continued pressing her fingertips against her belly, which was no less soft and jiggly than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m such\u2026..a pig.\u201d She groaned slowly lifting her head upwards to get a good look at the damage. Her belly was resting on her upper legs, noticeably larger and emitting slight groans and gurgles. Despite the pain she was in, she couldn\u2019t stop touching and rubbing it and noticing it still felt good. In fact, it felt much better when full. She couldn\u2019t stop the smile on her face and warm feeling inside her. Why did she feel like this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026.this is so\u2026.weird\u2026.but, I kinda like it. I mean, what is it about having a belly that\u2019s full that feels SO GOOD!\u201d She said jiggling it as hard as she could, letting her belly bounce all over the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know what? Who cares! It feels good, and I like it!\u201d She said lifting her shirt up to her chest and continuing to play with her belly like a child with play dough. She couldn\u2019t believe how fun being a little chubby was and how fulfilling it is. Being able to eat as she pleased and stuffing herself until she was ready to pop was the best feeling she ever felt, and she wasn\u2019t about to stop eating if this was what resulted from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to play with her belly until she fell asleep, happy and full and hands on her belly, which was digesting the food into fat, spreading a thick layer of chub through her body and weighing her down further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to sleep, and started to dream about\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Batgirl was on a grassy hill. On this hill there was a tree, and underneath the tree was a table. Batgirl took off her cowl, revealing Barbara Gordon's face, and walked towards the table. Barbara felt her flat, toned stomach grumble hungrily. She pulled up a chair and sat down. Before her was a hamburger. Barbara picked it up and quickly ate it. She leaned back in her chair, stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I wish I could eat some more,\" she said aloud, cradling her stomach. \"But I'm so STUFFED.\" On the table appeared cake. A delicious, double-chocolate layer cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Who am I to say no to dessert?\" Barbara reasoned. She tucked in, not even bothering to cut out a slice and just eating the cake itself. Soon enough, she was done, and her belly was quite bloated. \"Man.... That hit the spot... Still wish I had room for more, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara noticed that the table was loaded with all kinds of food. Pizzas, burgers, ice cream, pies, donuts\u2014all of Barbara's favorites, right before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It'd be a shame to have all of this food go to waste,\" Barbara mused. She pulled up a box of donuts and dug in, finishing off each glazed confectionary with gusto. Barbara felt a great pressure on her midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara unbuckled her utility belt. \"Don't want you bursting on me, now.\" Setting it down beside her, Barbara clasped her hands together and resumed her feast, pulling up a large pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is going to be fun,\" she said before devouring the pizza. Barbara felt her belly tighten, expand, then soften and shrink. Her legs became a tad thicker, her hips a little wider, her bosom a bit fuller, her derriere a bit softer. Her costume expanded to fit her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is really fattening,\" Barbara observed, jiggling her belly. \"But I don't care\u2014I LOVE IT!\" And with that, Barbara dove in, inhaling plate after plate of food and adding pound after pound to her frame. She went from 126 pounds to 146 after a few plates. By the time she reached 160 pounds, Barbara was making her way through a tub of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do this all day,\" she said. \"I really could. Now let's see if I can get to 180...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred quietly unlocked the door. It was midnight, and Ms. Gordon's room had been quiet for a few hours, meaning that she had fallen asleep. And that meant that there time to clean up the food scraps Ms. Gordon had left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred walked in and picked up the empty pizza boxes. There were many, quite a few more than he would have thought. There was a slight disgust that he felt when picked up the boxes. He knew Barbara had gained weight, but the sheer gluttony involved... Alfred shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left the room, Alfred heard a moan from behind. He turned to see Barbara reposition herself in bed. Her hands rested on her newly developed potbelly, which she rubbed in contentment. But the most interesting thing about it was the smile she had on her face. More than anyone else in the Bat-Family (aside from maybe Dick), Barbara was the one who had suffered the most and had come out the happiest. It was an admirable quality that even Superman respected. And while many in Barbara's position would be disappointed or saddened by a widening waistline, Barbara seemed... Content. Happy, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all traces of disgust vanished from Alfred's mind. Perhaps her job would be a bit more difficult. Perhaps she would have to deal with jeers and insults. But if anyone could conquer those challenges with a smile on her face, it was Barbara Gordon.</span></div></div>",

Barbra groaned as she clenched her eyes and covered her ears, still desiring to sleep after her long night. But as the alarm drowned on, Barbra decided it was impossible for her to go to sleep now. She uncovered her blanket, sat up, and turned off the alarm on the clock on the side table, all before feeling\u2026something soft resting on her upper legs, the young ginger smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you feel a lot softer now.\u201d She said rubbing her belly, feeling the new fat shift around when her fingers pushed into her pudge; and sighing in a great sense of pleasure. \u201chehehe\u201d She giggled reaching that pleasure center on her belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had her fun, Barbra had one thought course through her mind, \u201cHow much do I weigh now?\u201d She knew the obvious side effect to this gluttony was weight gain, and being the slightly OCD, little geek she was, Barbra wanted a number to work of off. She knew before all this she was 125 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll check\u2026after breakfast.\u201d She said grinning like she had a shot of Joker Gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed the main service phone in Wayne manor, a direct hot line to Alfred, \u201cBet there\u2019s one of these in the bat cave\u201d Barbra thought as she picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlfred? You there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould I be anywhere else, Ms. Gordon?\u201d Came the voice of the Englishman. \u201cI\u2019m sure your calling for breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, and I\u2019m feeling like\u2026cereal and bacon\u2026mmmm, maybe some juice on the side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s too simple for me, Mrs. Gordon; I\u2019ll add pancakes on top of it, given your sudden appetite.\u201d The Butler said smiling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbra meanwhile, had her eyes wide in wonder, mouth drooling in hunger, and free hand on her belly. \u201cYes please! Thanks Alfred.\u201d She said excitedly. \u201cOh, and thanks for cleaning up for me last night.\u201d She said looking around her clean bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for a guest, Ms. Gordon.\u201d Alfred said hanging up, and readying the baking pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbra licked her lips and rubbed her belly in excitement for her coming breakfast. She could practically feel the taste of pancakes running through her taste buds and into her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer food filled daydream was interrupted by her cell phone ring. Barbra reached over and grabbed the phone, seeing that it was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her recovery has been even slower than she could have imagined, and only just now has she been able to get up and around a little bit more without waddling like The Penguin. But now that was she was up, after so much time sitting and eating without much movement, Barbra\u2019s new weight was showing it\u2019s effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all this time, Barbra had ballooned up to about 155 pounds, a thirty pound weight gain in inly a few weeks (a feat she secretly congratulated herself on last night with a \u201cbelly party\u201d for herself), and now, those pounds put her to the text as she made her way to the bathroom. Sweating a river, heaving and huffing, and constant breaking for breaths, one would think Barbra would now see this weight gain idea as backfiring, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026.so hard.\u201d She thought to herself during another breathe break. \u201cBut it\u2026actually feels oddly good. All the sweating, that tired feeling, the knowledge that my awesome belly is doing this, meaning it\u2019s getting bigger and heavier.\u201d She was actually shaking at her own inner monologue turning her on, wanting nothing more to lay back down in her bed and enjoy her unfit body, but she really had to do her business before calling in a snack form Alfred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Barb.\u201d She said slowly and softly. \u201cYou can do this, you fat pig.\u201d She smiled at her self-mocking as she gripped her crutches and set off to the bathroom, her belly bouncing freely in her tight PJ's.</span></div></div>",

She giggled at the sensation of her big belly jiggling with the force of impact, before giving it a good, wobble-inducing smack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just can't stop jiggling, can you?\" she taunted herself, an electric shiver coursing through her spine with every word. She kneaded her belly in circles. \"Not with all this soft, gluttonous, bulging fat.\" Barbara lifted up her shirt and began to rub her belly--slowly, methodically, feeling every ounce of newly grown pudge weighing down and rounding out her midriff. Her hands made her way to that pleasure spot she'd grown so fond of since gaining weight, and soon she was in absolute bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, man,\" she moaned, panting. \"That was intense.\" She laid there for a bit, lazily running her hand down her thick  tummy. Occasionally, she'd give it a good wiggle or a jiggle, but at the moment, she was waiting for her personal favorite method of belly play--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Gordon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--stuffing herself to the brim with rich, delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's open!\" she called back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up in her bed and pulled her shirt down to cover her belly (a sliver of which bulged out nevertheless) just as Alfred wheeled in a cart of food. She clapped in delight as he entered, getting a good whiff of all the delicious aromas now wafting through her room--pancakes and pizza and so many snacks, all for Barbara and her burgeoning belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brunch, Ms. Gordon, as requested,\" said Alfred. \"I've taken the liberty of also including a few treats I know you'll enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure know how to treat a girl, Alfred,\" Barbara purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kindly butler smiled.

She then grabbed her breasts and they too were soft and moved. She then heard her stomach rumble. She went to the fridge and found a large chocolate cake. She took it out, barely able to carry it.

When will you ever learn!\" Supergirl shouted as she arrived on the scene taking in the carnage and destruction sprawled out over the small industrial park Lex was currently tearing through. Lex was ripping through the chunks of wall inside one of the rounded buildings. Piping and concrete were being thrown around as if they were nothing. Behind the building Lex was currently uprooting bit by bit, was a row of devastated, and now twisted remains of buildings clearly showcasing his destructive path. Supergirl gasped and quickly maneuvered herself out of the way a large chunk of concrete spiraling quickly at her. She sighed at the close one and regained her focus on the emerald suited Lex getting into a fighting stance after that close one. \"This ends now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl used her heat vision to burn through some pipes located directly behind Lex, which once hit, burst creating a small series of explosions behind the armor-clad villain. It momentarily distracted him, and shifted his balance causing him to break his stance, which was just the distraction Supergirl was hoping for. With her arms out she sped downward creating a path heading straight for Luthor who didn't see what was coming. Tackling him with a force that slammed him through the ground several meters, she floated backwards to regain her momentum and to gather a better visual of her surroundings. Lex was sprawled out in the crated that the impact of Supergirl's heroic tackle had left and was slowly easing himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the villainous, bald billionaire that had caused her and Clark so much trouble in the past, start to rise to continue the fight, Supergirl was wise off to know her work wasn't done yet. \"Luthor, whatever it is you're doing it stops now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuthor smirked at the blonde's persistence, \"Yes, and you're threatening impositions would indeed be more imposing if Superman were here to have your back. You...heh, you I can handle.\" Luthor was now back in a standing position and cracked his knuckles, which were also armored up and covered in the metal that adorned the rest of his suit. Pulling his hands back revealed pneumatic hisses as small metallic plates started to shift around his knuckles revealing a dastardly version of brass knuckles, only Luthor's came equipped with eight different pieces of molded Kryptonite, one for each knuckle. Supergirl's eyes widened as she saw the various pieces of alien rock decorating Lex's fists. All of a sudden the tables had shifted and she realized she was going to be in for one of the toughest fights of her life. She couldn't give up though, it just wasn't in her to tuck and run when up against a larger, stronger, and more dangerous foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl grunted and screamed out as she flew downward as fast as could at Lex, all while rearing her fist back to get ready to land a heavy blow to Lex's exposed face. What Supergirl wasn't expecting was Lex was rearing back to land an equally devastating hit. The two were seconds away from impact and both simultaneously let loose with their swings. Supergirl landed her hit full impact into Lex practically breaking his jaw, she could feel the shattering of his jaw and even heard the fractures with her super hearing, but she wasn't quick enough to dodge or defer Lex's blow. His powerful blow to her gut managed to send her reeling backwards into one of the walls Luthor had yet demolished. Supergirl's momentum from Lex's swing was enough to the trick, however, and Supergirl was sent plowing through it leaving only a puff of smoke and rubble. Supergirl felt every bit of force from the punch and the painful throbbing in her stomach wasn't getting any better, most likely due to the green Kryptonite within such close proximity. She slowly stood to her feet, holding her pained midsection and looked at Lex who too was slowly rising to his feet, massaging his jaw. He began to laugh a slow and deep chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hit like a girl,\" he muffled, blood slowly starting to stream down his chin. Lex quickly cracked his chin and practically leaped at Supergirl, who at the moment wasn't expecting any quick movements from her enemy. She tried to move out of the way but Luthor was just too fast for her this time and pinned the lithe vixen to the ground. Luthor could say her writhing in pain from the green Kryptonite and knew she was going to be mostly powerless to what he was going to do next. He pulled back his right hand, complete with the practical rainbow display of Kryptonite and punched the helpless superhero in her rock hard stomach as hard as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say hitting girls is somewhat of a faux pas...\" Luthor reared back and slammed his fist into Supergirl's side once more, this time creating a piercing cracking sound. Lex pulled his hand back and examined the Kryptonite adorning his knuckles. It seemed like a piece of the orange Kryponite had shattered and was left sticking inside Supergirl's abdomen. He just shrugged it off, and prepared to strike the heroine once more, but not before finishing his rhetort. \"...So I'm just going to have to pretend you're Superman and enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess you'll just have to settle for us.\" Luthor's attention was broken and he looked up to see who dared to speak to him like that. Zatanna and Black Canary were standing off to the distance poised and ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't usually enjoy beating women, but for you three...I think I can make an exception.\" Luthor said standing and shifting his focus from Supergirl to the female duo standing to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try that. I'd like to see you TRY!\" Canary's sentence ended with a loud scream which caused a huge surge of sonar energy to send Luthor flying backwards only to be hurled through another one of the remaining walls of the building the four of them occupied. With that last wall crumbling, a loud rumble and quake was sent through the building, which was losing the support it needed to remain standing. Zatanna looked at Canary signaling her over to Supergirl. Black Canary nodded and ran over and inched the nearly unconscious heroine over her shoulders. Zatanna floated over to where Lex had landed and looked down at the balding millionaire struggling to his feet. A few loose hoses and some steam momentarily blowing out of openings indicated his suit was starting to fail him. Zatanna smirked to herself seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ezeerf sxeL teeF!\" The sorceress said as ice started forming around Luthor's feet holding him in place despite his struggling. \"You wanted destruction Lex...you got it. Gnirb Eht Gnidliub Nwod!\" The last remaining support keeping the broken and twisted building standing upright started buckling into itself. The entire area began furiously shaking and Luthor looked around helplessly knowing what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just going to leave me here to die? Isn't that against the 'Superhero' way?\" Lex asked hurriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna started floating away backwards. \"We both know you'll find a way to survive this. If and when you do we'll be waiting...if you're lucky you won't make it.\" Zatanna let out before disappearing from Lex's sight. All he could do was scream and thrash his arms around as the building came down upon him. The three heroines outside watched as the building fell and just stood there once all that was left was a huge pile of concrete, pipes, dirt, and a large cloud of dust encircling the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl sighed as she knew she was going to be okay. She looked down at her stomach which was starting to heal over now that she wasn't in the immediate presence of the green Kryptonite. The cuts and scrapes from the hits from Lex started sealing up, and unbeknown to her a sliver of the orange Kryptonite was now completely embedded in her stomach. Little did she know the effects that the orange Kryptonite would now have buried inside herself.</span></div></div>",

Kara's ears pricked up.  It was still hard for her to pick out individual sentences sometimes out of the constant thunderous din...she usually just had to tune them all out.   But ever since Siobhan had introduced her to the strange brown earth mineral \"chocolate\", she'd been in love.  It must be the most delicious substance in the universe!  How could anyone <i>ever</i> have too much of it?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mystery, all right, and it's one that Kara intended to solve.  She banked right, headed for the outskirts of the city, and swooped low over a crowd of people gather in a large, open area filled with strange smells and odd, colorful machines.  <i>Metropolis County Fair</i>, read a banner near the entrance.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" she asked.  \"Is someone in danger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy clutching a huge stuffed Gorilla Grodd plushie in one arm pointed with the other.  Supergirl turned to see what looked like a castle made out of brown clay.  She looked closer.  No--not clay.  Ice cream.  Another wonderful Earth substance.  And by the look of it, <i>chocolate</i> ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go on a tour,\" the boy said, \"but I think it melted or something and there's people trapped in there--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl launched herself into action, trying to activate her x-ray vision.  Hold on--almost got--there we go!  Sure enough, five people were trapped near the edge of the structure, with the walls oozing in on them.  Eventually, a way to the outside would open, but they would be buried under ice cream before that happened--she had to get them out of there, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a wicked little thought struck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd always been kind of curious about how much she could eat now.  She didn't <i>need</i> to eat at all anymore, or breathe, or sleep unless she really wore herself out.  She didn't seem to have many physical limits at all.  She could probably eat anything she wanted, but you had to exchange paper for food on this planet, and she was a little short on paper, so she'd never really tried.   Well, what better chance than now?  That ice cream castle was coming down anyway, and it's not like she'd get in trouble for eating it if she saved lives in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lightning speed, she whipped through the castle, burying herself in the walls and burrowing through, slurping down the delicious frozen dairy goodness by the gallon.  It took her less than five seconds to gulp down the entire structure, countless tons of ice cream.   She touched down next to the shocked, suddenly-freed tourists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" she said, licking her lips and patting her belly.  She was pleasantly stuffed--<i>that</i> had taken less than a millisecond, at the rate she was going--but after a certain point, she just stopped feeling fuller.   Her stomach was a little distended, but nothing to reflect the amazing amount of internal pressure it must be under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd downed the castle so fast most people hadn't even seen what happened.  As world spread, the crowed burst into applause, claps, and cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Supergirl!\" one of the tourists said, wiping a little sweat off of his brow.  \"Gee whiz, you're amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could eat like that and look like you!\" his wife added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled stickily.</span></div></div>",

No one on the Justice League could figure out a way of removing the curse with one hundred per cent safety and Batman had refused to let anyone try, reasoning that it was safer to do without Wonder Woman on active duty for the next three months, rather than try a risky curse removal ritual and possibly kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Fate could possibly have removed it, but he was off in another dimension for four months. Luckily for Diana, the curse was a relatively harmless one, and she would still be able to perform monitor duty. However, Batman did insist that she should stay in the moonbase for the duration, since the process of becoming obese could possibly leave her vulnerable. So here she was. Gorging on chocolate pudding, since she decided to take advantage of the fact that she was going to become obese soon anyway, whether she ate anything or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she'd 'replicated' a gallon of chilled chocolate pudding and started eating it, lying on a couch in the lounge area, watching an American movie.

She went into her closet and inspected her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I just got this costume,</i> Diana thought to herself, referring to the navy, red, and gold armor she had recently received as a gift from Hephaestus after the Donna Troy incident. <i>I don't want to ruin it yet.</i> Picking out a pair of comfortable blue sweats, a white T-shirt, and a red jacket emblazoned with her logo, Diana wrapped the clothes up in her magic lasso. The clothes disappeared, having been absorbed into the lasso. Diana stepped away from her closet, raised her lasso over her head, and began to twirl. As she did so, her costume faded away, the clothes that her lasso absorbed taking their place. Soon, Diana had changed completely out of her Wonder Woman costume and into her civilian outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. Now,\" Diana said, pulling the waistband of her sweats out in front of her, \"you have room to grow.\" She patted her belly, which seemed to have softened up a bit in the intervening minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her outfit, Diana returned to the lounge.

Since then, Diana had done little more than sit around, watch monitors, watch TV, and eat. In conjunction with the fattening nature of the curse, this meant that Diana had gained about 7-10 pounds in the intervening time. It wasn't very noticeable, especially in the sweats that Diana was wearing. Her legs were a bit thicker, her hips were a bit wider, her derriere was a bit softer, her bosom was a bit fuller. Most of the added weight settled in a soft little paunch that was quickly on its way to becoming a big, round potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna Zatara, sorceress extraordinaire, had found out about Diana's condition and, after a bit of research, contacted Batman with the possibility of having found something that could at the very least ease Diana's predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three heroes were walking down the hall to a safe room on the JLA moonbase. Knowing that they would have to deal with threats and situations of a more supernatural variety with decent regularity, Batman, with the help of the Justice League's magic-based members, built a room that would allow the Justice League not only a safe zone against magical threats, but also potentially solve them. Diana's curse fell within those guidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Zatanna said as she drew a magic circle on the floor beneath Diana in the safe room, \"I can't promise that this will work. At the very least, it will depower the curse. If we're lucky, it'll completely remove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do whatever you can,\" Diana said encouragingly. \"Thank you for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my pleasure. Though I wish tall, dark, and brooding over there would've thought to call me earlier,\" Zatanna replied, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it over with,\" Batman retorted. While his voice was quite gruff, both Diana and Zatanna could tell that he was trying to hide his amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna smirked. \"Ready?\" she asked Diana, pulling out her magic wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nodded. \"I'm ready.\"</span></div></div>",

The room reverberated with power, the colors shifting from red to purple to green to yellow. Batman was knocked off his feet as the ground beneath him shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana could hear Zatanna struggle to maintain the spell. It was incredibly powerful magic, given the fact that Zatanna had to recite the incantation completely in reverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana herself felt a strange warmth. A purple mist silhouette of Diana rose out of her body, swirling up and around to the middle of the circle before exploding away, knocking the two superheroines down. The lights went out, and the room and dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman stood up steadily. \"Backup generator,\" he commanded. The lights turned on in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana picked herself up off of the floor. Almost immediately, she noticed a change: her sweats were looser. Sure, she still had a bit of belly pooch and hadn't quite gotten her muscles definition back, but she was thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" Zatanna groaned, sitting up slowly. \"Did... Did it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana beamed. \"I think it did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna sighed. \"That's good.\" Shakily, she lifted herself off of the floor. \"I am BEAT,\" she said, stretching a kink out of her back. \"And kinda hungry, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still need to make sure that it worked properly,\" Batman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't it wait until after lunch?\" Zatanna complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana looked at Batman. \"It was quite an effort, Bruce. Besides, iI could go for a snack, myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman sighed. \"Fine. But I still want to be sure.\" There was a beeping, and Batman pulled out a communicator. \"I have to go. There's trouble in Gotham,\" Batman explained before leaving. \"Make sure it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna and Diana nodded happily. \"Done,\" Zatanna said, although she and Diana both knew that they had no intention of coming back to go through Batman's tests. Without further delay, the two superheroines made their way to the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lot tighter than I remember,\" Diana heard Zatanna whisper under her breath. Diana turned around to see the young enchantress fiddling around with a button on her vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana hadn't noticed it before, but Zatanna seemed to have put on some weight. It wasn't very noticeable, but her belly and waist seemed to be a bit thicker and softer, straining against the tight fabric of her costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana shrugged. <i>Poor thing. Her stress eating must have made a comeback. I'll have to ask her about it later.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at the mess hall and grabbed trays. Zatanna immediately started piling platefuls of food onto her tray. A couple of burgers, a large serving of fries, and a generous number of chocolate cake slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The spell must have taken a lot out of her,</i> Diana thought pityingly, unconscious of just how much food she put on her own tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna and Diana found a table and sat down. Zatanna started devouring her food almost as soon as her tray hit the tabletop. She couldn't explain it, but she was REALLY hungry. She wanted food, and she wanted a lot of it. She felt her belly strain against the button of her vest. Zatanna paused in her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dnapxe tsev,\" she said quietly. Her vest grew around her belly. With no other noticeable hindrances, Zatanna proceeded along with her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana watched Zatanna while absentmindedly eating her own food.<i>Poor thing,</i> she thought sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half-hour or so, the two superheroines were finished with their food. Zatanna lay back in her seat, soothingly nursing a food baby. Diana felt rather stuffed, herself. Her belly was rather bloated, though not quite as much as Zatanna's. Strangely, though, she didn't feel full. Physically, she was stuffed, but she wasn't satisfied. It was more as though her hunger was abated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man,\" Zatanna moaned. \"I needed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserved it,\" Diana said. \"You put in a lot of hard work today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna smiled. \"Thanks, Diana. I can always count on you for not making me feel badly about eating like a cow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course, my friend,\" Diana replied.</span></div></div>",

The cookies that she didn't eat with the pudding were used to scoop morsels of ice cream into her mouth and down to her gullet.

One of the world\u2019s most intelligent criminals and one of the few who could ever hope to rival Oracle in computer expertise. One of the world's most intelligent men, and he's a complete wreck. Collapsed on the ground of his dark apartment, his thoughts had been completely hi-jacked by one singular thought, the one riddle he could not solve, the query that kept him up at night, that had left him a broken nervous man, \u201cWho is Oracle?\u201d The question had plagued his thoughts ever since she had locked him out of Luthor\u2019s spy satellites, and continued to viciously consume his subconscious ever since. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to focus in 2 years,\u201d he whispered to himself, \u201cYou\u2019re all I can ever think about, when I sleep all I can ever see is the green mask you hide behind... taunting me, laughing at me, mocking me\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear to God I will find out who you are Oracle, and when I do I swear I will\u2026\u201d he cut himself off. It had finally dawned on him the toll that his actions were taking on him Revelation struck, and he had finally accepted that he had lost this particular fight. Noah Kuttler slowly rose to his feet, and a devious smile spread across his face. \u201cIt seems I have been bested.\u201d He had finally realized that the countless hours he had spent trying to uncover the identity of his archrival had been wasted, hours that he could have spent destroying her rather than revealing her. \u201cI may not be able to figure out who you are or where you operate from, but I will destroy you. And not only will you die by my hand, but it will be in the most humiliating way fathomable. You will pay for what you've done to me... \u201d Kuttler's grin began to grow into a wide pitched smile as he erupted into a maniacal laughter, whilst  the vast array of computers behind him slowly booted up, illuminating the pitch black room. \u201cTime to get to work\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All Ivy cared about right now was satiating her monsterous hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Red, ya sure are packin' it away t'night...\" Harley Quinn commented from her side of the table, \"You skip breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy let out the smallest, most ladylike burp she could muster. \"Sorry Harley, I just can't seem to stop eating lately.\" the green skinned chloropath apologized awkwardly, \"You can head back to my place if you want, wait for me there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbly blonde shook her head, \"Nah, you ain't hooked for cable, what's the point of goin' back to your hotel room if I can't catch up on Tiny Toons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy shook her head, disrupting her leafy red locks, \"You and your cartoons, Harl...\" she mumbled through a forkful of lasagnia. A dribble of sauce fell on one of her green tinted breasts. Without hesitation, she wiped it off with a slender finger and plopped the remains in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're alright, Red?\" Harley asked, watching the odd show that was sitting in front of her, \"I mean, I don' think I've ever seen you eat this much before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy blushed (if one could call turning a slightly darker shade of green blushing) \"Of course I'm alright, I'm just a little hungry is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a little...\" Harley parroted as she put a lithe chin in her palm, examining her floral friend's figure. While still a downright sexy member of the B-Man's Rouge's Gallery, Harley couldn't ignore that her redheaded friend seemed to be spread out a little. She couldn't see any pudge on Ivy, she just seemed to be getting... wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, it may have just been Harley's imagination, being a homicidal clown-themed supervillain tended to give a girl a wild imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarleen stole one last look at Ivy, \"Yeah... jus' my imagination...\" she said quietly</span></div></div>",

The girls got in and drove back to their home. Once at home, Harleen went to feed her two animals as Ivy went to attend to her plants. Due to their being villains with not alot of money, their home was an old abandomed apartment building but they made it a home with their furniture, personal items, Harleen's pets, and Ivy's plants. Of course they were not satisfied with this, they wanted a nice placer and more money and were determined to get both. Being villains though, in no way were they going to do this the honest way by getting a job and earning their money. They were both lazy and loved the thrill of stealing money. Plus, they were villains and robbing was what they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking care of a few things, the girls meet in the living room and sat down on the old couch. \"So where should our next robbery take place?\" Ivy asked Harleen thoughtfully. \"Well Mistah J and I usually robbed banks to get money and we were quite successful at it\" Harleen replied as she remembered foundly of her days with the Joker when they constantly comitted successful bank robbery after another. It took Batman and his partners (Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl) a long time to catch them. \"So I think we should try a bank\" Harleen finished. \"I think the bank learned from all of the robbieres you and the Joker committed against them and they are now better repaired for robberies. I don't think a bank is such a good idea\" Ivy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine! What's your idea?\" Harleen asked, a little annoyed and hurt that Ivy shot down her idea. \"I was thinking of something easier like robbing an armoured truck or hacking into an atm\" Ivy suggusted. With her powers, those two options were quite possible and easy. A mix of the banks getting tougher to rob and her being lazy caused her to prefer to steal from an armoured truck or an atm rather then going to the bank. She had started to get lazy recently. She wasn't sure why but didn't think too much of it and didn't think it was a bad thing either.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley sat on the apartment's couch, fiddling with some GameBoy that she had hocked from some kid during some heist some few odd days ago. \"Yeah, stupid little-- Oh sweet!\" she grunted as she repeatedly pressed the buttons. Never having owned many as a child, Harley had a natural tendency to explore the world of toys and electronics; not just for criminal purposes, they were a true hobby of the ex-psychiatrist nowadays. She was dressed and ready to go, her checkered jester suit form fitting as always and her clown makeup was applied neatly, domino mask in place; the only thing left to do was put on her hood and walk out the door. Of course she would have to wait on 'Red' to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer innocent face squinched up in dissappointment, her pixilated avatar had just gotten attacked by some weird, floaty, sucky octopus. \"Why I aughtta...\" she mumbled, trying her best to get the beast from her suited friend's helmet. However, not officially knowing the controls, she was pretty much just lost in the dark. \"Damn!\" she whined, defiantly pushing the off switch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Harley was bored again. Ivy hadn't gotten around to 'convincing' the Gotham Electric Company to taking a swing by her place; so she couldn't watch TV, get on the computer (not that she was technically allowed on a computer, as far as the law was concerned) or even plug up the blasted hair straightener, it'd give her something to do, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to take it, the insane clown villain sprawled out on the couch, arm drooped lazilly over the couch's shoulder. And, after repositioning herself several times in less that a few seconds, her hyperactivity couldn't take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Red?!\" she whined from the living room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the thumps from their shared bedroom, \"-ugh- Hold on a second, Harl!\" Ivy grunted. Ivy tilted her head, dazed and confused (well, no more than usual) at her friend's strange behavior lately. \"Weird...\" she said to herself, \"Usually Red prac'ticly hastah drag me out on a job, what's up with 'er?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever hard she tried to wrap her thoughts around Pamela's strange behavior, she practically had ADHD, and soon found herself looking at Gotham by Moonlight. Late; it seemed to be an unspoken tradition that all of Gotham's Criminals struck while the iron was figuratively hot and the sky was literally dark. You'd think that the criminal population would learn eventually, down in Metropolis they robbed day and night and things were a lot more successful down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a nice view of Crime Alley, where everyone said that the Waynes were shot. On the left, she could see the Zero Hour, \"Prob'ly why Red chose this place...\" Harley mused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the window, Harley saw Ivy's reflection staring her down coldly. \"You ready to go Harl?\" she asked, obviously perturbed. Harley may be a sick, hyperactive, sociopathic clown, but she could still tell that her friend was upset about something. \"You alright, Ivy?\" she snatched the hood from the couch, starting towards the door energeticly. \"Nothing at all.\" Ivy sighed, following her friend and making sure to lock the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their room, in the trashcan neatly placed in the corner, was a pair of ripped pantyhose that Ivy's legs had grown too wide to fit in....<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nHarley and Ivy could practically walk down the streets of Gotham. No one was stupid enough to come out after three a.m. whether it be the civilians too afraid of the criminals, the criminals too afraid of the cops, or everyone just a little bit too afraid of the Batman; things were calm and easy for the devilish duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut experience teaches even the slowest subject, and these two supervillainesses were far from the slowest. Had they merely strolled the concrete jungle of Gotham, Batsy was sure to catch them and throw them right back into Arkham, ending their fun for, more than likely, quite some time. This meant that they had to be sneaky about their prowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery ATM in Gotham was a target; half the time Ivy would wrap a few roots around the housing of the machine, and get them to destroy the device from the inside, leaving the sweet currency inside ripe for the picking. Should that fail, or on an odd turn, Harley would just smash the machine with her overly sized mallet, her signature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley Quinn giggling delightfully as she rubbed the money all over her face, \"Ooh!\" she squealed, quite satisfied with their recent plight, \"Ain't this just great Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy wheezed, \"Yeah, you're -pant- you're telling me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead bent over, hands on her thighs to help keep her balance. \"You alright Red?\" Harley folded up her winnings and placed them back underneath the breasts of her costume, \"Ya need to lie down or som'thin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite simply put, Ivy was exasperated. Having to sneak around all night with a jittery jester under her thumb was quite the challenge. It was never easy, but it just seemed so much harder on her lately. \"Nah, No I'm fine...\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long, almost comical silence. \"You sure?\" Harley finally asked</span></div></div>",

The last thing she wanted Harley to know was that she had gained a little weight lately and was a little out of shape. It was embarassing for any female to admit that she had gained but especially for Ivy because she was known for her good looks and perfect body. In her mind though, she still had the perfect body and hoped others thought so too. Ivy then began to quickly lead the way down the street, heading for the next atm. Harley picked up their sack of money and her mallet and happily bounced along with her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two villinesses repeated this process of extracting money from atm with Ivy's roots while Harley grabbed the money and put it into their bag. After about 4 more atm attacks like this, Ivy was feeling really tired and worn out. While this was a little embarassing for her, she decided not to think about it. She rather think about how successful they were tonight, hitting up 5 atms and getting a bunch of money from all 5 of them. She was grateful that had gotten enough money from those 5 atms that Harley wouldn't be suspcious if she called it quits for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we got enough money for tonight Harley, Let's head home\" Ivy said to her friend with a smile. \"Great! Say since we are all finished and everything, how about we stop for a bite ta eat? Carrying this bag will cause a girl to work up an appetite\" Harley said. Ivy was secretly glad that Harley had suggusted they get a bite to eat. She was feeling really hungry but didn't want to suggust they get something to eat as she had been suggusting that alot lately and had noticed Harley getting suspicious. With Harley being a former psychologist, Ivy knew that she was smart and not much got past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds good to me\" Ivy agreed with a smile and a nod. \"How about we back to Zero hour?\" she suggusted.</span></div></div>",

It never seemed to change much, except maybe the amount of elbow room at nearly 6 in the morning. Most sane people (using that term loosely here, it is Gotham City) were in bed by now, even most super criminals were safely tucked away under their bedsheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Harley Quinn, noted for her hyperactivity and seemingly endless energy, was half asleep on her end of their usual booth. Her chin nestled weakly in her gloved hands, resting her head limply in her fingers. Harley's painted lids were only just barely open, her beautiful blue eyes were hazy, and her mouth agape; allowing a small trickle of drool to roll down the corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy, however, was only just now beginning to feel the effects of sleep deprivation. For nearly an hour, Ivy had stuffed herself silly with the most appetizing courses on the menu (nothing too meaty, of course) Since the girls' spending range had just increased by a good three thousand dollars, Ivy didn't have to worry near as much about running up a huge bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut every stomach had their limits, and just because Pamela was part plant didn't make her an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beginning to feel drowzy, whether it was just plain lack of sleep or a miniature food coma, she hadn't decided. Ivy was somewhat embarassed, she had never felt the need to indulge so much as she had these past few weeks. And normally, she and Harley would have kept on looting the ATMs long into daylight, probably getting caught by Batman in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Harley let out a tiny yawn, \"Gee Red...\" she bat the sleep from her eyes futilely, \"Can we go yet, I'm startin' to drool over here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy grunted through food (it was either a philly cheese steak or a sub sandwich, she was too tired to really notice) \"Mur, just a minute, Harl.\" she forced the rest of the meal into her mouth, causing her cheeks to bulge outward. Even sleep deprived, Harley had to laugh at that, \"You look like a green chipmunk.\" she managed, fading deeper and deeper into her slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floral female huffed, swallowing defiantly, \"Let's go Harl.\" she said, slamming the bill back down to the table. They grabbed their illgotten goods and headed out the door, Harley nearly passing out in Crime Alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, the two stumbled home either half asleep or so bloated they could barely move. And almost immediately, each villainess proceeded to pass out. It was a job well done, they had avoided etting caught by certain big Bat or any of his playmates, and they had rewarded themselves with a feast fit for a queen. </span></div></div>",

After washing all the makeup off her face and freshning up a bit, she changed into a pair of jeans and a yellow t-shirt before heading out of her bedroom and down the stairs. She then went into the kitchen, poured her babies a bowl of food each and carried it outside. \"Come and get it babies\" she called to her animals before returning inside the house. She went into the living room where they had left their bags of ill gotten money. She sat down by one of the bags, reached her hands into the bag, and tossed it into the air, screaming for joy like a kid at christmas. Her celebration of tossing money up in the air was a tribue to her puddin the Joker who did the same thing after a successful money heist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was awakened from her slumber by Harley's shouts for joy and moaned. She rolled over and tired to fall back asleep, placing the pillows over her ears but she could still hear Harley. After a couple of minutes, she sighed and gave up. When Harley was excited, no one around her was going to be getting any peace and quite. She slowly got up and padded into the bathroom. She went pee, washed her fans, and then washed her face. After combing her hair, she headed back into her bedroom where she changed into a pair of sweats that said juicy on the back and a white t-shirt. Since she was at home she didn't feel like dressing up all nice. Even a woman with green skin and supernatural powers didn't always want to go into the trouble of getting all glammed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy headed into the living room and found Harley, predictably sitting by one of the bags of money, tossing it into the air much like the Joker had done. While she shook her head, she was smiling a little to herself as it was a little amusing how much like a little kid Harley could be. \"I hope you are planning on picking that all up as I most certainly am not\" Ivy said as she placed her hands on her hips. \"Aw, c'mon on red, can't a girl celebrate?\" Harley asked with a cute little pout. \"It's fine if you celebrate, I just want you to clean up your celebration\" Ivy replied with a soft laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Red\" Harley replied. She then turned thoughtful for a moment before asking, \"Say Red, how should we spend this money?\" she asked her friend. \"Isn't it obvious? Let's use it to get some furniture and other things for our apartment. We can even get a tv and a computer\" Ivy said, knowing just how much Harley wanted both of those items. Ivy wanted them as well as they were nice amenties to have.  \"Great, let's do some shopping today\" Harley shouted as she jumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we clean up and go?\" Harley asked.</span></div></div>",

She was never one to adopt too many electronics, but a modern girl like herself required a little bit of technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yippee!!\" Harley squealed, bounding up from the floor to hug her friend, \"Thanks Red!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was a little preturbed at the younger girl leaping up and wrapping her arms around her, and almost pushed her aside. But even Ivy's heart was touched at Harley's obvious joy. She merely pat her on the shoulder and eased her off gentley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure Harl, right after we hit up the Electric Company...\" she smiled akwardly, realizing that Harley hadn't unclenched herself from Ivy's form, \"I got it Harl, I got it... let go, Harl.\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------<br>\r\nDressing casually was an easy task for Harley, she was a naturally good looking girl with a body to be proud of. Unlike many of the supervillains of Gotham City, she had no distinguishing features outside of her jester getup. Underneath that spandex outfit, Harley Quinn still looked exactly like Harleen Quinnzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dressed psuedo-formally, her best clothes piled on in a very tasteful, if not somewhat drab fashion. As usual, she tried her best to stay away from too much red and black, someone might get suspicious. So today, she put on a purple zip-up hoodie, which was open enough to reveal a white top under it with matching hair bows to hold up her blonde pigtails, all held up by a simple pair of nothing-special jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's disguise wasn't exactly as inconspicious. She didn't exactly go out into public light dressed as Poison IVy, world famous eco-terrorist. But she definately had a certain challenge to her civilian disguise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, she was green. And with the small cash flow she and Harley had come into recently, there wasn't enough blush or base in the whole apartment to cover all of Pamela Isely, not that she wanted to go that route anyway (\"Don't you know what that crap does to plants?!\") But another challenge was that a good bit of her out-on-the-town clothes decided to get sufficatingly tight all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pamela managed; she had found a white blouse, a pair of heels, a halfjacket with the matching skirt that she hadn't outgrown, and to top it all off she had the classic 'blonde wig with sunglasses' disguise among the rubbish in the apartment. All in all, Ivy looked like a normal, somewhat distinguished woman on a budget, albeit with a slight skin condition... who had enjoyed just a few too many sweets lately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley kept up with her friend's pace, \"Come on Ivy, you're walkin' so slow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy snorted, \"You're just too wired, everything seems slow to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you hadn't guzzled down breakfast t'is mornin'...\" Harley trailed off, only halted by a quick yet lethal glare from her cohort. There was a silence between the two, until Ivy composed herself long enough to respond with a simple, \"What, I was hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbley blonde girl's attention was elsewhere, long bored of Ivy's short steps through the parking lot and had bounded up to the biggest department store they could find. Poison Ivy gazed upward at the sign, \"Seriously, here?\" Pamela queried, pushing the sunglasses down the bridge of her nose, \"This place is such a shill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do ya have ta protest everything, Red?\" Harley asked sarcastically, already waiting for her friend at the entrance.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------<br>\r\n\"Alright, so we got tha computer, tha microwave, tha toasta'...\" Harley continued to mark off the household appliances with a comicly oversized pen that wrote in pink. Ivy, who had not only been dragged all over the blasted store due to Harley's lack of navigational skills, was also talked into lugging all of these items into the shopping cart, let out a single puff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...So how much more?\" she wheezed, her face heavy with a green blush of exasperation. Harley mulled over the list, tapping each item with her large pen. \"Only tha TV and we're good to go!\" she said, clicking the pen triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy drooped over the cart, \"Oh thank God...\" she gasped. Pamela Isely, the woman who had singlehandedly scared so many citizens all over the world, the woman who had spent probably millions in schemes to sent plant life to the top of the food chain, the woman who had eluded Batman so many times, was tired from a simple walk around her local department store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Red, I nevah knew you were such a lightweight.\" Harley ribbed her redheaded roomie. \"Shut up...\" Ivy narrowed her eyes in aggrivation, \"Whatever, I've got to use the bathroom.\" she huffed, walking off.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nLeaned up in the corner, a stiff body of some creep who had followed her into the lady's bathroom. He wasn't stealthy and certainly didn't sneak up on Ivy; she was completely aware that she had been followed into the lavatory. She just let him think he was cool for his last few seconds of conciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she zapped him with one of her toxic kisses, sending him into a very painful paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy washed her hands casually nevertheless, being careful to get the foam soap instead of the typical oily stuff (\"That oil gets under the plant's skin you know, it's really bad for it.\") Suddenly, something that Ivy had been trying to hide all morning sprang up on her once again; her stomach let out a growl; she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cradled her poor stomach. \"I guess breakfast didn't exactly fill me up...\" Ivy patronized herself inwardly, \"Hope Harl picked up those Fig Newtons I asked for...\" she couldn't help but pat her poor stomach. \"Hope she didn't drop that TV either...\"</span></div></div>",

While sure it was a little annoying to Ivy, she wasn't that upset about it either though as it was something had come to except from Harley. Also playing a role in Ivy not being upset was the fact that she was in the mood for something more tasty then Fig Newtons. She was so glad they had done a food shopping spree earlier and now their place was stocked with food. Ivy was pleased that Harley had flirted with one of the teenagers working at the store to put the tv into their cart. After they had paid for their items, Harley got the same guy to load their purchases into the car. After the car was all loaded up, Harley blew the guy a kiss before they drove off. \"Wow, today is the first day in a long time that I have paid for anything legitly, No wonder that I got away from it, so boring\" she commented with a giggle. Ivy could only smile and shake her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long they arrived back at their place. Ivy was still feeling tired, having done more heavy lifting today then she had in recent memory, so she had her plants bring in all of their items and set them up. Ivy walked over to the couch, laid down on it, and relaxed as she watched her plants bring in the appliances, directing them to where to put things, and watching as they put in some things. Harley bounched into the kitchen, grabbed some food, and then headed outside to feed her animals. When she returned a couple of minutes later, she saw that the computer had put set up. \"I call dibs on the computer\" she called before racing over to the computer and logging off. Yes she was not supposed to be online but this was probably the least of the crimes she had ever commited or ever well. Plus she had been legit enough for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy had actually made sure that her plants had set up the computer first. She knew that the computer would keep Harley preoccupied and thus quiet for awhile. After seeing everything was set up, she sent her plants back to their places and was able to fall asleep when her stomach grumbled in hunger. It was louder this time and she blushed for a second, but heard nothing. Never had she been more happy to see Harley wearing headphones to listen to music on her computer then now. She gently patted her belly while telling it silently, okay, momma is going to feed you. She then got up and walked into the kitchen. Now that she had a toaster, she could make some poptarts. She opened a packet of cinnamon sugar poptarts, put them in the toaster, and started warming them up. She then got out a carton of 2% percent milk and poured herself a big glass which she set down on the table. She then grabbed a plate when she heard the toaster ding. She used her hands to pick up the poptarts, place them on the table, and return to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy sat down at the table, picked up one of the poptarts and eagerly took a bite. Mm so good she thought to herself. She took another bite and then another until she had finished the first pop tart. She then drank some of her milk before starting on her second poptart. Before long she had finished her second poptart as well and washed it down with the rest of her milk before letting out a girly burp causing her to blush slightly. She was glad Harley was not in the room to hear it after all of the times she had harped on Harley for her lack of manners. She knew that Harley would never let her live it down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And then; Ivy collapsed onto the somewhat lumpy bed that had been left in the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, content to catch up with the few hours that Harley had robbed from her. While she wasn't angry in the slightest with her peppy roomie, Ivy couldn't help but think of how many Z's she could have caught since early this morning. 'This is truely a lazy saturday morning...' Poison Ivy mumbled to herself as she nestled further into the covers, too tired to even pull the quilt over her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next room over, Harley was taking full advantage of the new services that had been bestowed upon her, simultaniously ceasing the apartment's silence in a matter of seconds. With full electricity, some awesome headphones, a new computer, and a good sized television, Harley's attention was completely occupied for the first time in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMad beats flowed from her earbuds and the TV blared just as loud, tooned to whatever station she could pick up with basic cable that broadcasted cartoons. Her eyes were lit not only with a child-like excitement, but also with the incandesence that FaceBook gave off. Harley slurped her soda and munched on a candy bar, completely lost in a technological daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I's been so long since I updated t'is thing...\" she said aloud, her fingers clicking away at the keys rapidly. Harley couldn't even remember everything that had happened since... \"April 23rd?\" she said aloud, doing her best to recall everything that had happened since then. \"Ah well, I'll fix it later.\" she clicked to her messages, unaware that that was exactly what she said on April 23'rd. She clicked on the next song, all prepackaged stuff that came with the computer, but still pretty listenable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley skimmed over her messages, mostly from either her fellow inmates at Arkham or cohorts in the Crime Underground. \"Hey Harley, here's hoping you get ou--\" Harley stopped herself, Matches Malone? Who was that? She deleted it. \"I hate creepers.\" she said, a little disturbed. But then again, she couldn't blame them. Harley knew she wasn't exactly bad looking. 'Harleen Quinnzel would you like to sign out?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'course I would, ya stupid... why else would I click the link?\" her slender fingers guided the mouse as it rolled over the screen to 'YES'. She gave a rare scowl, she hadn't been able to go online for pleasure in the longest time, and now she had already done everything she had set out to do. She sighed, clicking off the music and removing her headphones. She decided to retreat to the couch to enjoy their brand new television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrand new TV, lots of food, and a nice computer; things were really looking up for Harley lately. Since she unwedged herself from under the Joker's thumb, she had discovered a lot about herself. Mostly that she was bad at money management, but also that she rather enjoyed to act like a normal girl her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Joker it was all business, Batman, and gut busters (both jokes and literally busting some guts), and she never realized just how much she enjoyed to just pull off a simple heist. No intricate plots, not having to listen to a sociopathic clown make morbid jokes, and most importantly she could fly under the radar to avoid the Big Bad Bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped the channel, she didn't get that many since Ivy hadn't gotten the place hooked up for anything other than basic cable. BASIC cable. That severely limited her programming to anything other than saturday morning cartoons and the news. Harley took another bite of her candy bar, finishing the chocolatey morsel off. She settled on the one channel that was clear as a bell; the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slumped, \"Great.\" she whined. The news was never Harley's favorite programming block, it was what seemed to be an eternity of pointless, depressing stories that didn't concern her in the slightest (unless it actually DID concern her, as it usually does with super criminals...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Superman halted yet another failed robbery attempt by local metahuman Livewire, who will be transported to...\" Harley mocked the anchorman, moving her thumb and forefinger to mimic the anchorman. \"Blah blah, blah blah...\" she faced the hand with a displeased and bored look on her face. But then something caught her attention. \"Speaking of robberies, Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy were spotted looting from local ATMs last night, hitting up at least five around what has been dubbed 'Crime Alley', anyone who sees these two should report the proper authorities immediately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, most people go into a panic after a crime that they've committed gets let loose to the public; but Harley was absolutely giddy. She grinned like the true psychopath that she was. \"Wow!\" she was already on heels, \"I'm on TV!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieve it or not, this was the first time (As far back as she could remember) that Harley had been on the boob tube without either being confined via straight jacket, restrained via Batman, or tackled via policemen. She immediately burst into Ivy's quarters, \"Hey Red!\" she said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she stopped. Ivy was sound asleep. Even the outspoken Harley Quinn couldn't bring herself to wake up her cyan colored cohort from the deep sleep that she had fallen into. Plus, she was really cute with her full lips open just enough to allow a little bit of saliva to peek out of her mouth. \"Aww... she looks like a li'l green angel...\" Harley cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn noticed that Ivy wasn't covered up, so she draped her hoodie over the chloropath's frame. Harley giggled, still giddy that she and Ivy had scored some minutes on prime time. The blonde tiptoed out of the room, shutting the door behind her ever so quietly with an unavoidable creak; just quiet enough to let Ivy remain sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Harley wasn't present for Poison Ivy's pale green stomach to give out a faint gurgle of digestion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy enjoyed a couple weeks of laying low. Harley spent her time mostly on the computer and watching tv though the computer mostly. She would snack occasionally but nothing major. She had really gotten behind in all of her online activies like social networking with all of her friends and fans, playing some games, and of course doing online shopping. She now had some money so of course she wanted to spend it. Whenever Harley got money, she spent it as fast as she could, not unlike the Joker. Her fans by the way were a mix of guys and girls. Poison Ivy had spent the past couple of weeks, watching tv, laying out in the sun (she was part plant so she needed the sun), and indulging in more sweet and fatty foods. She had lost touch with how much she was starting to eat even though she realized that she had put on a little weight and had already ripped a pair of stockings. She felt like she hadn't gained that much which was true but she also didn't think that she was eating that much more and that it would case a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that they were low on money one morning, Poison Ivy realized that another heist was in order. She was in the living room looking over the last a couple bags that contained money and not much was left in either of them. \"Harl, get in here\" she called. Harley who wasn't hearing headphones at the time quickly bounced from the computer room into the living room. \"Here\" she announed giddly with a smile. \"What's up red?\" Harley asked. \"Low money, we need to do another heist\" Ivy explained as she showed Harley the bags. \"Oops, I guess I went through the money a little quickly\" Harley admitted. \"Well it's not all your fualt, I did too. We are girls though so it's okay\" Ivy replied with a smile. \"We need more money now though so lets get started planning our next heist\" Ivy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was feeling even lazier then she was two weeks ago when they did their previous heist. She had also put on a little more weight since then as well though she hadn't realized it yet. Still not wanting to do another elaborate heist, Ivy suggusted, \"I think we should hit up the atms again. They were so sucessful the last time it should be the same this time as well. Of course I think they will be a little more guarded with some more policemen around them since the police are aware that atms are our next target but that shouldn't be a problem. I have a way with men after all and will easily be able to take care of them\" she said as she pushed back a few loose strands of her red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley thought about this before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The streets of Gotham City always seemed dark, no matter what time of day it was. It was a gloomy city by nature, if not downright shady. Unlike the stark white buildings of Metropolis, the general color scheme of Gotham rarely strayed from shades of gray; this meant that even by daylight, Gotham City seemed cold and unfeeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn said streets, Poison Ivy tailed behind the comedy capering criminal, struggling to keep up with Harley's pace. She lugged the heavy sacks of money at her sides, poor muscles who had been underworked these past few weeks were certainly not used to the burden of lifting money bags. She wheezed, her green face flushed with exertion. \"Phew... we must've hit, what, seven ATM's Harl?\" she kneeled over, dropping the bags at her heels, \"What do you say we.... we call it a night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, who was casually manhandling bags even heavier than 'Red' (and even her mallet) turned around. \"Why Red?\" she asked, reluctance clearly present in her voice, \"Don't tell me yer t'red already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's face scrunched up, expressing that her cheeks had gotten ever so much fuller in the past couple of days. \"No I'm not... tired!\" she managed, \"It's just... I think we've pretty much emptied out every machine in this part of town...\" the plant woman trailed off slightly. \"No way, Ivy!\" Harley said, energetic as usual, \"We've still got a few left, gotta keep up wit' th' 'lectric bill, y'know, can't hit up Facebook wit' no powe'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy grumbled, \"Of course not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe UV-soaking supervillain stood up straight, stretching her stiffened muscles, and inadvertantly revealing the few extra pounds that she had picked up. Her stamin-thin body had certainly rounded out; her stomach didn't quite bulge, due to her spandex, although where her bikini line had been very definate before, her abdomen had swelled to meet that old line. Whenever her stomach wasn't forced behind the strict confines of her 'uniform', Ivy's belly looked quite soft and inviting. Her breasts had swelled outward, made obvious as a bit of her boob spilled just slightly over the cup. And Ivy was supported by new, fuller legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed herself off, she hadn't really collected much filth while scouring the streets, she just wanted an excuse to give her stinging fingers a rest. Cracking her knuckles, Ivy grumbled again, noticing that Harley hadn't stopped for her \"Geez...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, above the streets and a good number of buildings, the pointy-eared gaurdian of Gotham stood, ever viligant in his quest to rid his city of crime. Behind the lenses, his eyes scanned the labyrinth that was made up of Gotham's streets. Recently, Oracle had informed him that Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn had restablished their long-term alliance and were hitting up ATM machines all over town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too simple, Harley must be calling the shots.\" his deep voice rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo, his eyes caught sight of Harley and Ivy making their way down main street. Immediately, he released a Bat-Grappling Hook onto a nearby skyscraper. He swung into action, as his intensive training dictated him via muscle memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy struggled to keep up, Harley had really picked up the pace. \"H...Harl!\" she did her best to remain quiet, lest you-know-who catch wind of her sultry pipes. The only response was a shrill scream, \"Harl?!\" Ivy snapped to attention, running somewhat akwardly towards her friend's cry. And what else did she see; Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Ivy wasn't exactly happy to see Batman, he sounded like a handsome man and certainly had the body to be one. It was what Batman did that cured the fire that he struck in Ivy's belly. Always ruining her ecosphere-based schemes and almost always roughing her up a bit certainly caused Ivy to lose a lot of interest in the caped crusader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckilly, Batman was too preoccupied with Harley to hear Ivy's trodding, 'Must be a long night, he's usually much more aware than this.' she told herself. From around the corner, she watched as Harley ran away from Batsy, who skimmed through the air easilly due to his para-cape, frightened like a child. She couldn't tell if she was playing it up for a laugh or if she was really this scared of Gotham's Dark Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the corner, Harley led her pursuer down an alley. The very alleyway that Ivy was hiding out on. \"Harley!\" she hissed, instinctively trying to focus the botanical toxins in her body to her fingernails, ready to strike at Batman. Or maybe she'd try the lips, plant a big wet one on the only unprotected part of Batman's battle tank of a body. Or maybe--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late, a large mallet whack to the head on a weak point in his cowl proved to upset Batman's balance long enough for Harley to regain hers. It was quite a show, watching the extremely acrobatic Harley Quinn battle the hardhitting Batman. He landed one good punch, but the Princess of Punchlines wrapped her legs around his neck. She then proceeded to launch herself from Batman's chest with a power kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Ivy whispered, completely star struck by Harl's killer moves<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley dashed to the money bags, grabbing them without losing momentum. \"GO! GO! GO!\" she chanted, Harley had a strong sense of fear in her voice, she knew she got lucky; and in a few seconds Batsy would be up and on the prowl. It was best to get out now. Needless to say, Ivy's accumulated pudge slowed her down. </span></div></div>",

With Batman now on the prowl for me once he woke up and it going to be daylight soon, Harley realized it was time to end for tonight. They had made a good haul so she was feeling good overall about the night with the exemption of the Bat interference. In a way, Ivy was kinda grateful that Batman showed up so they could quit for the night. She was really feeling tired and so now that Batman was on the prowl for them, she now had a good excuse for quitting for the evening. Like Harley, she didn't want to be caught by Batman. She could just say that Batman was on their tail and so they should quit tonight while they were ahead. Also she was aware it would be daylight soon and knew it wouldn't be wise to still be committing their crimes then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Ivy didn't need to say anything because Harley said, \"Okay Red, you win, we've robbed enough for tanight\". Ivy breathed a sigh of relief. \"Let's head home\" Harley said. \"No, after lugging all of this money I am starving. Let's go to Zero Hour\" Ivy said. \"Okay, I am feeling kinda hungry too\" agreed Harley. They two villanesses started to head towards Zero Hour. Both were musing two different things. Ivy was thinking that they should use her car for their upcoming heists as it was just getting too hard for her to carry all the bags. Harley was starting to wonder why Ivy was getting more easily and often. They arrived at Zero Hour about 10 minutes later and took their usual booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls knew the menu by heart and didn't need to look at the meanu so when their server came over they promptly ordered. Ivy ordered the chocolate chip pancakes with butter and maple syurp with a glass of both milk and orange juice. Harley ordered a bowl of oatmeal with some buttered toast and a glass of milk. Their food was brought out shortly and they both dug in. Ivy though dug in with more gusto. She was really feeling hungry from carrying all those moneybags. She greedily dug into her pancakes, cutting up bite after bite and stuffing it down her throat. She moaned a couple of times in between bites as they were so good. She did pause occasionally for sips of milk and orange juice. Harley ate at a normal speed and enjoyed her meal as well. Though she was enjoying her meal, Harley couldn't take her eyes off of Ivy as she (Ivy) continued to pig out. She had never seen her eat like this before. It was kinda surprising to her but she didn't have a problem with it.</span></div></div>",

She rather enjoyed chocolate chip pancakes, she would be sure to ask the bartender for the chef's recipe. She dabbed her mouth with a napkin to get the unsightly syrup off of her mouth. She then proceeded to lean back, hands resting on a full stomach, and gave a satiated sigh. Ivy was full for now. Although, she couldn't help but think that she'd just be hungry again in a few hours, that seemed to be happening a lot lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley Quinn had gotten used watching Ivy stuff her kraut by now, it didn't come as that much of a shock when Ivy pat her stomach lightly. \"Ya full?\" she asked, a hint of sarcasm in her thick accent. She had long since finished her meal and only had the common curtousy to wait for her green friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, Harl.\" Ivy quipped back, \"I was just hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown themed villainess giggled a little and immediately sat up, eager to get home and update her blog. She couldn't believe that she'd gone so long without so much as a Dail-Up connection, how had she made it through her days without the internet?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy however, was not so easy to spring up and took just a few more precious seconds to lift her softer frame from the seat; Harley couldn't help but notice that as Ivy stood up, the motion made her boobs jiggle as they spilled from her outfit. \"You seem happy to get out of here...\" Isely finally managed to grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ivy dropped the check on the table, she heard the bell above the door chime. It was no one special, he looked just like an ordinary thug. A local wannabe henchman-for-hire who just about everyone was familiar with, since he came down to the bar every night to boast about his ametuer crimes; when no one listened or cared, he got violent. Though he was no big shot in the crime underworld, a few of the criminals actually booed and hissed the young man as he strut his way into the bar. \"Get outta here!\" even kind old Mr. Dini, the barkeep, shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley wretched, \"Ew, gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy had to agree, \"What a twerp, he could at least pull his pants up around his underwear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scrawny white boy had a cocky stride, which he rode all the way to the counter. \"'Ey Mistah Dini, just got back from mah latest heist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portly, balding man snorted. \"No seriously, I just hit major payday!\" he flashed an obviously fake grill. \"Go siddown, Johnie.\" Dini grumbled. He turned away indignantly, \"Pssh, man, no one listens.\" But then his eyes caught sight of Poison Ivy, her tight outfit driving him wild. He smacked her behind, \"Hey Baby, you'll listen to my stories, won'tcha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy felt her stomach churn. \"I'll give you five seconds to apologize.\" she narrowed her eyes at the young man, \"Before I feed that hand to my plants.\" 'Johnie' wasn't daunted, \"Aw shoot Baby, you know I couldn't resist dat ass.\" he took a better look at it, \"Maybe instead'a jus' my hand, you could take th' rest'a me back to yo' place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley tugged at Ivy's hand, \"Let's go Red, he ain't worth it.\" Harley knew when she was pushing her luck, there was no way that she'd escape Batman and the cops in one night, if this got violent, someone was sure to call the police. \"Why don't you just get your food and go choke on that ridiculous grill, do everyone here a favor.\" Ivy ignored her clown-clad friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnie was either stupid or persistant, \"I'm just sayin' Baby, I'm into th' green chicks.\" he flashed another dopey grin, \"And maybe after I put you on a li'l diet, we could get bu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy snapped, \"DIET?!\" she hollered throughout the bar. Everyone got silent, except for Harley Quinn who let out a giddy \"Oooooh.\" Poison Ivy and Harley were the biggest villains that ever came into the Zero Hour, they were already a little afraid of what they could do. Let alone when a low-life thug wannabe had just called Poison Ivy, Queen of Plants, fat. She clenched her fists, clenched her teeth. Ivy was ready to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah Baby, don--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy slapped him across the face, the echo reverberated for a few seconds throughout the silent tavern. Then, while he was dazed, Ivy locked him into one of her deadly kisses. Everyone whispered, everyone knew about Ivy's Kisses of Death, even newbies to the Gotham Underground. After a few seconds, Ivy broke away, and the thug fell over, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDini broke it up, emerging from behind the counter. \"Hey, hey, come on Ivy.\" he grabbed the body, \"I can't have you comin' in here and killin' off my regulars.\" he shooed both the redhead and her jester companion out the door. \"Aw come on Mistah Dini!\" Harley pleaded, she really did like the food here, \"We can't come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDini always had a soft spot for Harley and she knew exactly how to tug at his heartstrings. The three grew deathly silent, until finally, the kindly old man gave into Harley's big blue eyes. \"Alright, alright, but only because Johnnie was a pain in th' ass.\" he tossed them a doggy bag, \"Here, free biscuits on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy smiled, showing off small dimples. \"Thanks Paul.\" she caught the bag. Harley sniffed it, \"Smells good as always, Mistah Dini!\" she playfully blew the old man a kiss.</span></div></div>",

They then watched the 11 o clock news to see if there was any more news on them either for their robberies or the kiss of death that Ivy had delivered to that annoying thug.  Harley got all excited seeing their pictures on the screen as she loved the attention. \"We are celebrities! Everyone is scared of us now that you killed that guy so I think our robberies will be ever easier\" Harley said excitedly as Ivy shut off the tv. \"Well good, I hope so. I am all for anything that makes our robbieres easier. Unfortunately Batman and the cops will be after us more but luckily we know how to handle them\" Ivy said before yawning. Since yawns were contagious, Harley yawned too and both girls headed to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley woke up about ten the next morning. She made herself a bowl of luck charms and toasted a strawberry pop-tart and then took her breakfast over to the tv. She sat down on the couch in front of the tv, turned on the tv, and began watching her favorite saturday morning cartoons while eating her breakfast. When all of her shows were done, she took her empty dishes to the kitchen, rinsed them out, and went over to her computer. She got online and started facebooking and chatting with her friends. Ivy on the other hand slept in till 1. She was sleeping now more so with her getting so tired from the heist night she really slept alot over the next 24 hours. She woke up at 1am to hear her stomach grumbling. Knowing that Harley and her planned to stay in today and take it easy, she decided to stay in her silly black nightgown. It hadn't fully dawned on her that it was much tighter on her and revealing a little bit more of her then usual. After freshing up a bit, Ivy headed into the kitchen. Since it was 1pm, she decided to skip breakfast and go straight to lunch. She warmed up the rest of the macaroni and cheese which there was a good amout left of, cut some slices of white bread, and got out a soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ivy sat down at the table, she eagerly dug in. She began stuffing bite after bite of the creamy rich delicious macaroni and cheese down her throat. It was so good and she was so hungry that she couldn't get enough of it. She only paused occasioanally to dunk the bread in the sauce and take a couple of bites of it before washing it down with sips of soda after every couple of bites. It didn't take her too long to finish her meal and patted her full belly gently. She could tell that her belly was bloated but she wasn't concerned since she knew it was only temporary. It didn't seem to register with her that her belly was even softer then before. She rested at the table for a few minutes as she felt kinda full before getting up, and washing her plates. She then headed out into the backyard to attend to her plans. She nursed them with some water, food, and of course some motherly love that only she could provide with her special powers as their creator. It was after they had beed fed and watered, the plants began to show off their talents to Ivy. Since she was their mother, they could read her thoughts. They showed her how along with her, they had evolved and now could do whatever not only what she told them but imagined. This made her smile as it opened up a new possiblity. For their upcoming heists, she could just wait in the car and let her plants do all the heavy work along with Harley. This would definitely make things alot easier for her. \"Thank you my babies, I will be sure to let you fully show off what you can do when Harley and I do our next heist\" she said to them all as she gently patted them on their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy next decided too..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy started back towards her room, fully intent on resuming her snooze, when a sudden craving hit her. Underneath the silky black lingerie, Ivy's soft stomach gave a yearning rumble for something sweet. She looked down to face her gullet, a dissapporoving look on her face. \"Now now, I already fed you.\" she teased, fondling her belly lightly. It gurgled again, still begging for a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy gave a mischevious smirk, a single red eyebrow raised as her eyes travelled slowly to the fridge. She knew that there was a little bit of cake left in there that Harley had stashed away, wary of Isely's new eating habits and wanted to save it for later. Ivy moved her hand to her hip, letting the other one hang limply at her side. She gave let out a devious, sultry purr; Ivy wanted that cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe elegantly lifted her hand to pull the refridgerator door open, it's light much brighter than the single hanging flourescent bulb. The chilly air wafted slightly outside the confines of the  fridge, brushing against Ivy's stomach and stiffening her nipples slightly. Quickly, she moved the apple juice, the milk, the thing that LOOKED like milk but was actually a deadly toxin that needed to be refridgerated, assorted sandwich meats, and whatever remained of the twelve pack of soda to reach her prize; Harley's last slice of chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer green fingers wrapped around the edge of the paper plate and pulled it out, setting it on the nearby countertop. Ivy quickly, yet quietly rummaged through the silverware drawer to pull out a single fork. She placed her untensil and her winnings on the small, circular dining table. Her barely covered legs resumed their seat on the still-warm plastic chair, spreading out slightly as Ivy's accumulated weight pushed her fat out slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, she began her work. She cut the first chunk of cake off of the main body, getting both the chocolate and the icing on a good forkful. She popped it into her mouth. She could see why Harley was saving this; It was wonderful. She didn't even bother to savor it, she swallowed and went in for another bite. She got another forkful, inhaling the pleasant morsel like oxygen (or carbon dioxide?) Again and again, she took off large bites of food that was only her's through the law of 'finders-keepers'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, long before she wished it so, Ivy was done. The plate was empty and her belly had been satisfied. Her lower lip formed a scowl, dissapointed not that she had given into her appetite yet again, but that there wasn't any more cake left to eat. It was probably best, Ivy's stomach was actually pretty stuffed. She leaned back further in her seat, a recoil from her appetite, and then placed her hand back onto her belly. She belched ever so slightly, a sign that Ivy's tank was filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure to get rid of the evidence, recycling her plate (\"Better than ending up in a landfill\") and washing off her fork diligently, making sure not to leave a single trace of her betrayal visible to Harley's eye. With that done, it was time to get back to bed. Ivy gave one last pat to the closest one of her botanical buddies, and made her way down the hall, back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed back under the covers, rested her lovely red locks on the goosedown pillow, and quickly fell back to sleep; dreaming of a world that was a better place for all of her plants.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nHarley was up for a full four hours before Ivy, not doing anything productive. As usual, Harley's schedule for Sunday was very much like her schedule for Saturday (Friday and Monday too, for that matter), eat brekkie, watch TV, scour the web, download a few songs, etc. All in all, Harley had settled into a rather lethargic lifestyle, no one suspected the ONE abandoned apartment in the middle of Gotham's biggest apartment complex, so the two didn't have to relocate as much as Harley was used to. She definately liked that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around two in the afternoon, Harley sat on the couch, fondling Bud while Lou watched his hyena brother, eyes filled with envy at being stroked. She heard a few footsteps reverberating through the cheap apartment flooring; Red was finally awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the green pigmented redhead stretched her arms, making her way slothfully down the hallway. She had terrible bedhead, and her nightgown so tight that Ivy's belly could be seen clearly stretching the black fabric, if there was a pattern on her nightie it would definately been distorted by that green pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy smacked her lips letting out a sleepy, \"Good morning, Harley.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Red!\" she smiled at her cohort, unsettling her hyena, \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plopped down on the armchair, resting her lips in a very seductive pose by instinct. \"Like a baby, that bed has gotten so comfortable.\" she cooed, stroking Lou's furry head as he grunted in delight. Harley squealed, \"Aww, you always said my babies wer' gross, slobberin' monstahs!!\" Ivy snorted, \"Pheh, they rubbed off on me.\" she narrowed her eyes and raised an eyebrow coyly, \"And speaking of babies, I had a great idea for our little ATM scam, Harl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Poison Ivy explained her plan; Harley could take her plants out into the city and guide them to the nearest target. They would destroy it, Harley would take the money, next target, repeat. All the while, Ivy would stay at the 'base' and 'hold the fort' in case anyone caught onto their scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley was quiet for a little while. \"Aww Red, it won't be any fun without you!\" she whined, her baby blue eyes welling up, \"Do ya not like pullin' jobs wit me?\" Ivy sighed, \"Of course not Harl, but we'll get a lot more done without me slowing you down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Harley sniffled. \"I need comfort food!\" she cried, rushing to the refriderator. Ivy blushed, remembering her little slip last night. She covered her ears for the upcoming shriek...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO ATE MY CAKE?!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley had definitely been upset about Ivy eating her slice of cake but she quickly got over it. Ivy was her best friend afterall and had saved her life once. She couldn't get another best friend but she could get another chocolate cake. She eventually did get another chocolate cake but this time divided up evenly between them so they would each get a fair share. After a couple of days of lounging around, Harley was getting bored and ready for some action while Ivy was perfectly content the way things were. Harley had thought more about the idea of her and Ivy's plants comitting the crimes and it had grown on her. Ivy had been getting slower and not like she enjoyed comitting the crimes as much, she just wanted and needed the money, maybe it was better for her and the plants to commit the crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was laying out in the sun as was per usual of her afternoon now, relaxing, and working on her tan as the plant that she had made her personal attendant fanned her. She was enjoying a snack of choocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk as she tanned. She was always feeling like snacking these days it seemed. \"Hey Red\" Harley came as she bounched over to her friend. Ivy sat up a little, causing her shirt to ride up to reveal her soft tummy, and she pulled her sunglasses up over her head. \"Yeah Harl? she asked her friend. \"I'm getting bored so I ws wondering if I could take some of your plants and try a heist with them?\" Harley asked her. Ivy thought about this for a second. They still had some money left but she saw no harm in finding out now if this new system would work. Plus they had lyed low for the past couple of days which was okay. \"Sure Harl, that actually sounds like a good idea\" Ivy said. \"Yay!\" Harley shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ivy called her plants over. She instruced them go to with Harley to complete some atm robberies. The plants were too happy and excited to serve their queen and headed out with Harley. They all got into Ivy's car and drove to the first atm on their list. Harley was quickly able to see how perfect Ivy's plans was. The plants were very easily able to get the money out and put it into Harley's bag which she held for them. They were able to get through robbing each atm quicker then ever before. This is going to work well Harley thought to herself. Back at home, Ivy finished off the rest of the cookies which she could not get enough of and then washed them down with some sips of milk before falling asleep as her plant attendant continued to fan her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy lay in bed, the silence in the room only broken by her occasional snore. Her pretty red hair spread over the sheets and flopped lazilly over the pillows, some of which were cast aside because of an earlier insomnia. On the dresser, one could see her old sweatpants, a giant rip down the right thigh that extended through the crotch, courtesy of her fattened thighs, evidence that Ivy truely had been growing wider these past few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy incoherently mumbled something in her sleep, her hand travelling down to her stomach. She was so lost in her slumber, she didn't notice the footsteps rapidly approaching her door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY RED!!\" Harley excitedly burst into her roomie's quarters, landing on her bed. Isely woke up quickly, needless to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" she looked around, still quite far off in the land of Nod. \"WE HIT THE JACKPOT!!\" Harley wrapped her arms around Ivy's plump frame, \"YER A GENIUS!!\" While Harley bounced around, Ivy just sat in place, obviously perterubed at being woken up so prematurely. \"Slow down, Harl.\" she growled, forcing the jaded jester back onto the bed, \"Now, repeat slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's these plants!\" Harley was still quite excited, \"I told 'em to go afta an ATM, an' whadda they do, they go afta ALL of them at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Ivy could see her precious babies hauling sacks of stolen money into the apartment, she had only assigned three plants to Harley's group, and even she had to admit that they were bringing in a lot more than she ever did. Ivy smirked proudly, \"And you expected anything less?\" she haughtilly gestured towards herself, \"These are my plants after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not even all of it!\" Harley continued to rave, \"I brought in, like, five'a them myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Harley kept giving more and more (mostly unwanted) details about how well her heist had gone; but Ivy had just been awoken from another fit of sleep. She calmed her friend down one last time, \"Harley, Harley, Harley.\" she touched clown's arm, \"I'd love to hear how well you did with my babies, and I'm very proud of you; but I have to get back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned, \"Fine, lazybones...\" Harley couldn't help but giggle herself back to normal, \"I'll jus' go give a head count an' head to bed myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Harley had left, Ivy called her back in to turn off the light, and Harley had left again, Ivy rested her head back on the soft pillow and re-adjusted herself within the bed; Ivy was immediately back to sleep.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAnd so, after a month of heisting and hedonism, both Harley's wallet and Ivy's frame began to fatten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, as per her schedule, was online. She wasn't doing much, just updating her Facebook, checking her MySpace, editing her article on Wikipedia, downloading a few songs, looking up cheatcodes for that blasted game, and watching funny videos on Youtube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit into her breakfast, her last chocolate chip waffle folded up and stuffed into her mouth. She chewed delicately, despite her stuffed cheeks, and swallowed the morsel. \"Wish Red hadn'ta eaten all my other ones...\" she mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her earbuds and pat her Hyenas on the head, swivelling in her chair to face the TV. Another peice on their atm scam. Harley just couldn't believe that the Batman hadn't caught onto their scheme, he must have been out dealing with some big time baddie. But, never the less, Harley was fully content in furthering this plan. However, now Harley was hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jus' because Red's hungry all the time doesn' mean she hasta eat my waffles...' she mumbled. She wasn't MAD at Ivy, just a little miffed was all. She'd get over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall, into the kitchen, a vastly different Poison Ivy sat; the fat on her ass completely filling up her chair. She was in a newly purchased but already tight nightie, much tighter after her third pancake, that exaggerated the width of her gullet. Sure, it was big, but black wasn't always slimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire frame seemed to swell quickly over the course of this past month. Her pale stomach had grown from simply soft with a bulge to a blown out tummy. It stuck out now, whatever didn't stick to the front went to her lovehandles or her back. Her arms had become jiggly and her wrist less defined. Ivy's breasts swelled just as much, forming much more than a handful as her apidose moved to her bikiniline. Above her swollen sweaterpuppies, Ivy's neckline had puffed out, a second chin quickly blossoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Red.\" Harley greeted the corpulant chloropath, sticking out her behind as she delved in the bottom-most drawer of their fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Harley.\" Ivy greeted, actually sounding perky for once. She had been getting a lot more sleep lately, so her hours had regulated to almost that of a normal Gothamite's, \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I wish...tat job took longer than I though it would.\" Harley popped the tab on her soda, \"An' on toppa everythin', Bud and Lou wouldn' leave eachothah alone las' night, they kept wakin' me up!\" The jester sat down opposite her friend, \"I had tah put my babies outside so I could get some sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy frowned, \"Yeah, I'm quite aware.\" She pointed outside her bedroom door, where a piddle stain ruined the carpet. \"You really need to start taking those... things... outside.\" she shot a dirty look to the onlooking Bud, who lowered his head knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah whateva, he'll behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a certain conversation struck up between these two female furies of Gotham...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, a certain conversation struck up between the two female furies of Gotham over possibly moving to a new place. The idea had come to Harley recently and with all these sucessful atm robberies lately, it seemed likely they can afford a nice place, not that was opposed to stealing a nicer place as well though if they legally paid for it then Batman would have one less reason to be after them. \"So Red I was thinking that with all of this cash we are bringing in we can afford a nice place. Like a luxary condo or something\" Harley suggusted. \"What do you think?\" she asked Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving grown up as a rich girl, Ivy had lived in the lap of luxury and loved every minute of it. She had missed those days greatly and had always wanted to get back to that lifestyle. Now she had an opportunity to move one step closer to that goal and in no way was she going to let it pass her by. \"Harley, that's a great idea. It's surprising but we have been stealing more money then spending it so we are due for a big purchase. In fact, I just saw an ad for the perfect place for us to move into\" she said. She picked up the gossip magazine she was reading and showed Harley the ad for the new Wayne Towers. \"I say we buy a condo here\" Ivy said with a smile. After seeing the ad, Harley quickly agreed. Since both sirens were hungry, they finished their breakfast before getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took turns showering before getting dressed up in their disguises and putting on their makeup. Harley then fed her hyenas and Ivy fed her plants before getting into Ivy's car driving over to the newly opened Wayne Towers. They met with one of the agents and after talking for a bit, they quickly signed the necessary paperwork, made the first payment, and were given the keys to their new condo. A couple days later after spending previous getting ready for the movie, they moved into their new condo. Ivy had gotten a nice greenhouse for her plants installed out on the patio behind their house. Harley of course wasn't supposed to have her hyenas living there with them but she brought them anyway and they just made sure the people working for the building never saw them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Poison Ivy made her way around the greenhouse, green body wobbling as she casually watered her babies. Today she was dressed in a rather casual sundress that expressed her apple-esque build rather nicely, even her spandex refused to fit around her curves anymore. She walked around the room barefoot, letting her chubby toes sink inbetween the mulch. As she moved the watering can from plant to plant, she hummed a casual tune with a slight smile on her face, watering her plants always made Pamela Isely smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit the last one, finally. Time for the next row, her carnivorous 'children' stared at her with non-existant eyes, hungry for the special plant food that their mommy had created just for them. \"Oh hush, you.\" she said, tossing an average sized, geneticly modified Pitcher Plant a large chunk of her special organic food. It made an odd sound, like a clicking combined with a hum. Ivy knew that this was a sincere sign of gratitude. The smile spread wider across her rounded face, \"I know, babies\" she cooed, scratching the underside of a Little-Shop-of-Horrors sized flytrap, \"Mama's gonna feed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a small bit of food from the bag and popped it into her mouth, telling herself she was just testing it. She could almost feel the collective glare of her unfed plants. \"Right, sorry, won't happen again.\" she sheepishly grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rooms over, Harley Quinn sat at her usual spot, in her own room with the most upgraded technology that came standard in Wayne Towers. She was really enjoying herself, new flatscreen computer moniter, fancy desk, comfy office chair, and a big fluffy bed to fall back on when a hard day of scouring the web was over and done with. The blonde girl took a sip from her straw, icy soda seeping into her mouth and travelling down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley hummed along with the lyrics that blasted from her headphones, eagerly clicking away at the keys. She was so excited to be in Wayne Towers, Wayne Towers of all places! The clowness had hardly left her room, let alone the apartment, this past week; it was just so cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother development that had gone unnoticed this week was that \"BatWing\" sightings around Wayne Towers had increased somewhat, even Batman's stealthiness had it's limits when in a multi-billion dollar jet. As predicted, the Bat was keeping tabs on these two villainesses, aware that these funds had been acquired illegally. However, Batsy had only seen them do it once, about a month and a half ago. God knows in Gotham how many other crimes could have happened while he was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, the Dark Knight was going to try a much more different coarse of action...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang on the newly rented apartment, and then again when neither of it's residents answered. It took a third time before Harley finally heard it through her headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMIN'!!\" she answered, quickly shoving Bud and Lou under the bed. \"Hold up!\" she called again, making her way around the large apartment, tripping over the couch; another impatient ring. \"I SAID I'M--\" Harley stopped herself as soon as she opened the door; Bruce Wayne, world renowned billionare playboy, the Prince of Gotham, was standing at her doorstep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mistah Wayne?\" Harley couldn't help but be a little starstruck, Brucie tended to have that effect on even the psychopaths of Gotham<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Quinzell.\" Wayne smiled courtesously to his sociopathic tennant, \"May I come in for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure, of course ya can!\" Harley gushed a little, \"IVY!! WE GOT COMPANY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two waited for the pudgy plant woman, Bruce simply stood at the doorway politely, two large boxes gripped under his bulging arm. No one seemed to question why Mr. Wayne worked out so much, and most of the women in Gotham didn't seem to care. \"Oh please, why don'tcha siddown?\" Harley pleaded the luxurious landlord. \"Oh no, I couldn't.\" Wayne answered modestly, actually a little wary to sit down in a room that could have been modified in any way by these two criminals. Getting out of something like that would surely blow his cover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall, from the designated greenhouse, Ivy's footsteps could be heard as she plodded down the hall. \"Alright, now who's so important that you-\" she herself paused, not quite ready to gush as much as her partner in crime, but still just a little excited to see Bruce Wayne in her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wanye.\" Pamela Isely greeted her guest in a rather husky tone. She was sweating a little because of the heat required to keep her plants comfy, persperation dripping down her corpulance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce himself couldn't help but be a little shocked, \"M-Ms. Isely.\" he greeted just as calmly as he could muster. Granted, he hadn't seen Poison Ivy in quite a while, but Wayne, along with just about every other socialite in town, knew that she was an eco-terrorist who took her looks proudly. To see the mighty Ivy weighing in at about 200 pounds was quite a shocker; even to one so stoic as Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eerie silence blossomed between the three, until Ivy broke the silence. \"You just gonna stand there, Brucie?\" she asked, leaning in towards him, \"What's in the boxes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWayne regained his composure, \"Oh, it's just a little welcoming present for our two... newest guests here at Wayne Towers,\" he grabbed the packages from his underarm, \"Chocolates, for both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the girls eyed their prizes greedilly, if Bruce Wayne had bought these chocolates, they must have been good. Ivy stared hers down, nothing she couldn't eat; that was rare. Harley immediately opened her box up, \"Thanks a lot -pop- Mistah Wayne!\" she embraced the muscular benefactor in a quick hug of gratitude, \"These are -chew- great!\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n\"What a nice guy,\" Harley mused as she chewed on one of her caramel nouget chocolates, \"Makes me wish I hadn't tried tah kill'im a few yea's back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy slouched on the couch, flipping the channel on the absolutely massive TV that dominated left corner of the apartment. \"Meh,\" she responded, taking a little time to pop another candy into her mouth, \"Ew, peanut butter.\" she wretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, give those tah me!\" Harley rubbed her stomach, \"I love peanut buttah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy mulled it over for a second, but ultimately decided to devour those morsels last. \"Aw come on, Red!\" Harley whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe teased Harley with a long glance, feigning deep thought. She simply fed the chocolate to her mouth much more dramaticly than usual, just to irk Harley, who immediately retreated to pouting on the couch with her hyenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, and I was gonna give you the chocolates that I didn't eat, too.\" she huffed, pushing a bon bon past her lips</span></div></div>",

Bruce was a rich and powerful man so he very concieveable assigned a private detective or one of his works to watch them. In no way did they want their villeness identies to be found out and be kicked out of the apartment. For the next couple of weeks, Harley was pretty much playing on the coputer nonstop while Ivy sat on her fat ass continuing to eat lots and be lazy. It was after a couple of weeks that Ivy fet like it was safe to start commiting crimes again. It was also around this time that she came up with another new scheme. She had been playing around with it in her mind for a bit now but finally felt like it was completed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her now typical lunch of two cheeseburgers, fries, and a large chocolate milkshake one day, she decided to reveal her plan to Harley who was on the computer as always. She made her way over to the computer room and smirked as she saw her friend playing games and listing to her music. Knowing that Harley had her music up loud and wouldn't be able to hear her, she stepped over to her and montioned for Harley to take off her clothes. Harley was deep into a game and didn't like to be bothered but pressed stop and took of her headphones. \"Okay Red, what's up? This better be good as I was in the middle of a good game and I don't bother you when you are in your snacking trances\" Harley said. She instantly felt a little bad about the dig at Ivy's weight but considering how Ivy had been a little rude to her in the past, she didn't feel too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy blushed a little but shook it off. She still hadn't realized how much weight she had actually gained so that is why Harley's comment didn't upset her too much. \"Oh it is Harl! I have a brilliant idea for our nest heist\" Ivy said with an evil smile. \"Well  lay it on me, I am all ears\" Harley said, perking up considerably. \"Well I have been playing around with my powers on the pizza delivery boy and I find that if I give men a kiss on the cheek I can control their minds. Wouldn't it be great if I could just give one little kiss to each of the arourmed truck guards and get them to deliver the money to us. Wouldn't that be just fabulous and so much easier?\" Ivy asked. While Harley did love the thrill of robbery, she had become addicted to being online, and so Ivy's new way would allow her to be online more. \"Ya know Red that does sound a whole lot easier. We should totally try it. Plus I love seeing what you do to men\" Harley said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! How about we start this afternoon?\" Ivy suggusted iwth a grin. \"Sure\" Harley agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The same dark, dreary city that seemed to be eerilly awake at all times, yet with it's eyes closed that it always was. The whole concept was a little new for Mark, who had recently made the shift from Metropolitan to Gothamite just a few months ago. He had scored a sweet job working the armored trucks that transported money back and froth from banks; unaware of the upcoming events (as most unsuspecting victims usually were)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned into the docking area, they were literally just supposed to throw the money in the back and he could drive off, back to his stark white home of Metropolis for the night and come back on Friday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing a little bit, brushing his unkept hair from his eyes, the young man stepped out of the armored car, dropping his keys under the plated vehicle. \"Oh geez...\" he grumbled, tonight hadn't exactly been the best night of his short career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning his neck to avoid the foot catch, he felt his shoulder brush against the suspension; but there was something else. Something... soft. There was soon a hacking coing from under the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... -kaff-, \" Harley Quinn soon emerged from under the van covered in soot, \"That's so -hak- Nasty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was only a little bit familiar with the scum that scoured around Gotham, Mark knew very well how dangerous a woman who had apparantly been clinging onto the bottom of his company car, that held probably more than a few couple hundred thousand dollars for several miles had the potential to be; very.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Who are you, man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley held up a finger to excuse herself while she coughed, \"Ho--Hol up a secon'.\" she said politely. Oddly enough, Mark didn't take this opportunity to run, probably the testosterone convincing him that this chick was probably good in the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stood up and brushed some soot from her spandex getup. \"Harley Quinn, suga'.\" she shook his hand firmly, which he limply reciprocated. Then he felt a few thousand volts surge up his arm, courtesy of Harley's joy buzzer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" Harley feigned concern for her shaggy-haired hostage, \"Shouldn' be sleepin' on tha job!\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\nInside the very warehouse that was supposed to house the docking personel, Poison Ivy had several other drivers tied up to chairs; Mark included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in all her pudgy glory, resorting to covering her more private areas in hand crafted leaves (except her crotch, Ivy's gut made quick work of covering most of that). She applied her special lipstick, designed to release pharamones designed solely for manipulating men to do her bidding, however a single batch was made just in case they ran into the odd female driver (Gotham didn't seem to have many)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe purred, raising up an elderly black driver's head to deliver a quick peck. The man awoke immediately, eyes widened to a very zombie-esque manner. The next was the lanky redhead next to him, nametag reading Paul. She smooched him lightly on the cheek, his demeanor also shifted dramaticlly. And another one, making Mark the odd one out. Who, as of this moment, shifted in his seat. He was waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... where...\" he looked around through his hair, only to see a heavy-set green chick ready to kiss him on the cheeks. \"Woah!\" he jumped back as much as his bindings would let him, \"What is this, some kinda freakout?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy pouted, \"Oh come now...\" she took a sly glance at his nametag, \"Mark, it'll be over in just a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark realized what was going on quickly; another girl had heard of how much of a football stud he was and she kidnapped him. Granted, none of them had been green before. \"Sorry baby,\" he said nervously, \"I think a few other girls gotcha beat.\" he glanced at her gut, \"But you definately hold the heavy weight bel--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy silenced his impudent mouth with a quick peck, every driver on shift today was under her complete control. She untied her captives, confident in her pharamone manipulation. \"So, men,\" she said, dropping her the sultry demeanor, \"Get to work, get down to the warehouse and drop off the money to Harley, you all know Harley, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediantly, of course, every man in the room nodded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy paced nervously around the apartment, her tummy jiggling with every footstep. Normally she would have felt self-conscious about her portliness being on display, but all thoughts were on the plan. It wasn't foolproof; any one of a number of things could go wrong, but it all depended on those men doing what they were told. How ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing on her lower lip, she nearly jumped when her cellphone started ringing. Taking a deep breath, she checked the phone. It was Harley. Here's hoping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IVY! HOLY CRUD, IT'S WORKIN', THEY'RE ALL COMIN' BACK WITH CASH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's heart soared into her throat, but she kept her composure. \"All of them, Harl? We can't let anyone slip by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, two...three...five...yeah, they're all here!\" Harley said excitedly. \"Holy crap, Red, we gotta get ourselves a money vault like Scrooge McDuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in good time, Harl. Keep things safe, I'll be sending over some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, more of your plants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, I'll text you and let you know,\" Ivy said as she hung up the phone. Almost immediately afterwards, it buzzed again, and a selfie of Harley in front of bags and bags of money popped up on the screen. Ivy rolled her eyes and pocketed the phone. Stomach rumbling, she retrieved a pint of ice cream from the freezer and a large spoon to bide the time, rewarding herself for the flawless execution of the plan. Perhaps she didn't realize how hungry she had been, because before she knew it her spoon scraped the bottom of the carton. Letting out a little moan of disappointment, she patted her ice-cream stuffed tummy and set the empty carton aside. Before she could open another carton, there was a sharp knock on the door and Ivy crossed the room to open it, revealing a short, portly man in a top hat and tuxedo, adjusting his monocle to glare at a golden pocket-watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Mr. Cobblepot.\" Ivy said in a sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This had better be worth my time, Ms. Isley,\" the Penguin said tersely. \"I risk missing <i>Mefistofele</i> to see you over this matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure this will be worth your while.\" Ivy replied warmly. The Penguin scoffed, his good eye glancing at Ivy's portly figure before he shuffled off to take a seat at the table, Ivy sitting across from him. \"I will be brief for your sake, Mr. Cobblepot. Me and an associate have come into a substantial amount of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it through less then legal means? I'm aware of your recent ATM tomfoolery with that dreadful Clown's lady companion.\" Penguin's face twisted in disgust at the very thought of the Joker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Ivy continued. \"And I was hoping we could use some of your contacts to help us out with our sudden wealth. Make sure we're all set up for the foreseeable future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly how much are we talking, Miss Isley?\" Ivy quietly slid her phone over to him, showing the selfie that Harley took with the cash. Penguin's monocle fell with a clatter to the table as his eyebrows shot up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my,\" he said, a hint of bluster in his tone as he retrieved his eyepiece and returned the phone. \"That's quite a haul, as you say. But sadly, I do not think I will be of much use, considering my current financial predicament...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" Ivy said with a wide smile. \"The DA investigating your activities, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their accusations of embezzlement and fraud are spurious!\" the Penguin squawked. \"When my lawyers finish clearing up this matter I intend to counter-sue them for besmirching my good name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's what I was getting to,\" Ivy said, glancing down as her phone buzzed again. \"The DA has been trying to get the Gotham National Bank to surrender their financial records regarding your businesses right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of it?\" Cobblepot sneered. Again, without a word, Ivy slid the phone towards the diminutive villain. This time, Harley had sent a photo of herself smashing up a computer server with her mallet, her pet hyenas in the background devouring a stack of documents. Cobblepot glanced at Ivy suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid the DA's office is going to have a hard time doing that,\" Ivy explained. \"It seems all records of your financial activities were...misplaced. Quite a shame, really.\" The Penguin's eyes darted back and forth as he pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my records?\" Penguin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All your records,\" Ivy confirmed. \"I imagine the DA is going to catch a lot of fire for harassing an upstanding citizen of Gotham with false charges, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Penguin thought for a moment, then laughed, a sharp squawking laugh not unlike his shout of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oho, you are a crafty one, Miss Isley!\" he said delightedly. \"I think we could work together on your finances from your sudden windfall after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pleased to hear that,\" Ivy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I can send some men to help your clown friend,\" the Penguin said, getting up to leave. \"Then we can begin to look over your financial straits, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy smiled as the portly criminal walked out the door. It was all going perfectly; Harley had the money and in return for her record vandalism the Penguin would help cover their tracks. At last, it was the perfect crime, and she and Harley were going to be up to their eyeballs in green. So to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, Ivy decided, calls for another carton of ice cream!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sadly Harley's desire for a swimming pool of money wasn't feasible even with the haul they had, but besides that the heist had gone about as brilliantly as the two criminals could have hoped for. The guards had no memories of their mind control once Ivy's toxins wore off, and by sabotaging the bank records to muddy the waters, Gotham PD couldn't hope to track the heists back to Ivy and Harley. It really was the perfect crime, and thanks to the Penguin's connections all that money was just going to keep making more money for the girls, meaning they wouldn't need to knock over another ATM ever again. And while the world's greatest detective might have been able to connect the dots, Gotham headlines were abuzz with news that their resident Dark Knight was spotted in Kahndaq with the rest of the Justice League, so by the time he was reported to be back home fighting Two-Face's goons, there was no longer really a case to solve; the Federal Reserve kicked in to replace the stolen funds and although Batman had his suspicions regarding the two, there was nothing he could do except watch them until they slipped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths later, the Dark Knight sat at his hi-tech computer, glaring at the side-by-side files of Pamela Isley and Harleen Quinzel. \"What about offshore enterprises,\" he pondered. \"Isley has funded Eco-terrorists before, have any groups gotten an influx of cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Bruce, none that I can find,\" Oracle responded over the secure comm channel. \"I can try to breach the Unternet and see if any of the other villains are talking about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see we're persistent as ever, Master Wayne?\" Alfred remarked coolly as he strode up behind Batman's seat. \"How many months has it been now, since you've returned from Khandaq? Two, maybe three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure it's three,\" Oracle answered. Bruce rubbed his temples, frustrated at the appalling lack of evidence in front of him. \"Bruce, are you sure these two are worth the trouble right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They committed a crime,\" Batman said flatly. \"And knowing Isley, she has to be planning something.\" Alfred gave a little sigh as he read over the criminal records.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure, Bruce,\" Oracle said. \"I didn't find anything incriminating, but I have found something that could be relevant.\" Immediately, news headlines filled the screen on the Batcomputer filling up the space around the two villains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GOTHAM BOTANICAL GARDEN PLANS MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>ENVIRONMENTALIST GROUP SCORES BIG LEGAL VICTORY AGAINST POWERS TECHNOLOGY</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GOTHAM GREATLY EXPANDS FUNDING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense a bit of a pattern,\" Alfred said with a hint of sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the only stuff I've been finding related to these two,\" Oracle explained. \"I don't know what Harley is up to, but I can tell you that someone has been super active in giving donations to environmental groups. If that's not Isley at work I'll eat the Batmobile's tire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you haven't found anything suspect...\" Batman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a thing. The money came from reputable sources, and everything is documented and perfectly legal. And not even the shady kind of questionable legality we deal with, whoever's doing this is being downright charitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may be so bold, Master Wayne,\" Alfred interjected. \"Perhaps so long as Miss Isley is doing some good, it would be prudent to let her keep doing what she is currently doing?\" Batman frowned, but he had to admit, Alfred had a point. Perhaps for now it would be best to take a step back and let the charity work continue if only because there were other matters that needed his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoop, someone just turned the bat signal on Bruce, I can see it from the tower,\" Oracle announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Oracle,\" Batman said, standing to head for the Batmobile. \"I'll be in touch. Keep your ear to the ground for these two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Miss Isley! With your donation we'll be able to keep the Arboretum funded for the next five years, how could we ever repay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is enough to know your darling plants are cared for,\" Ivy said with a smile. \"I'll make sure your organization receives the money by the end of the week.\" The intern on the other end of the phone squealed with delight before hanging up, leaving Ivy to bask in yet another wonderful cause supported. Perhaps the Pamela Isley of several months prior would have been appalled to see her doing anything less then wiping out humanity to save her precious plants, but even she would have to admit it was worth not getting pummeled by Batman. Yes that was it, she was being smart about it. Certainly not being lazy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she had every right to be in the opulent new penthouse she rented with her partner in crime. Designed in elegant marble and gold highlights, the new location was practically a mansion, complete with a kitchen fit for a platoon of chefs and several bedrooms with the biggest beds you could ask for, to say nothing of the brand new perfectly built greenhouse she kept her darlings in. Yes, Ivy was living the high life, with every luxury and elegant offering a girl could hope for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd some she could have done without, Ivy grumbled as she waddled into the hallway outside the bedrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, waddled. Already portly pre-heist, her newfound extravagant wealth did nothing to slow down her weight gain; if anything, it accelerated it. Her blown out tummy blew out even more now, swaying back and forth with each ponderous step and hanging over her waistband when it wasn't stuffed taut, and even its impressive girth couldn't hide Pamela's thunder thighs and wide rear end, which needed two of the old chairs she had to sit comfortably (Ivy had upgraded her furniture to double wide and reinforced, just in case). That was to say nothing of her impressive knockers, which had swollen close to the size of her own head, including the thick double chin quickly being chased by a third. Despite her impressive size though, Ivy was still dressed in a pretty black nightgown that looked close to snapping off her corpulent form, perhaps a last ditch effort to convince herself that she had self-control that hadn't been sapped away by her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Ivy still had some work to run by Harley, and she wanted it done so she could go eat. Making her way to one of the bedrooms, Ivy hip checked the door and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had little interest in the luxuries and charitable foundations that Ivy did, so she had used the new money mostly for one purpose; updating her computer system from a high-tech gaming rig to a state of the art system. Nowadays she spent all day in the bedroom she converted to a PC room, playing games and surfing the web in between snooping around security systems to hone her tech skills, and the last few months have been good to her in that regard. Harley could be the villain equivalent of Oracle if she wanted to, if only she could tear herself away from Runescape to do anything productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, there you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else would ah be, Red?\" Harley quipped, slurping her soda and letting out a belch before turning around in her chair. All that computer time had taken a toll on Harley as well, taking her from a little tubby to properly fat; the belly that once poked out of her shirt when she stretched did it all the time now, growing so wide that it filled her chair when she sat down. That feat was also accomplished by her butt and thighs, straining to be contained by her tight shorts, the whole effect making her look like she was fitted into her seat like play-doh. Ivy still had a hundred pounds or so on the tubby little jester, but she was rapidly catching up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needed somethin'?\" she said innocently, resting her burgeoning second chin in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"</span></div></div>",

The investments and the eco-stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've been wonderful at that, darling,\" cooed Ivy. \"But as much as I enjoy funding those who care for plants, I think it's time we put our vast fortune to a much more noble cause; winning the war between man and nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shucks,\" Harley moped, sinking a little into her chair. \"Can't the destruction of mankind wait? I don't wanna rob another ATM or somethin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no Harley, I don't intend to interrupt our lavish lifestyle for this endeavor,\" Ivy explained. \"I have a more...subtle approach. Come, let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy tugged herself out from between the arms of her chair and bounced on her heels in excited interest, her belly bouncing up and down with her movement. Pamela led the jester through the foyer and out to the greenhouse, a new addition to the suite and quite an elaborate one at that, with so much plant life that you couldn't see in from the outside. Just as Ivy liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley looked around at the plants with growing curiosity before the portly plant lady stopped in front of a large bush, dotted with bulky looking mustard yellow flowers. Upon seeing Ivy approach, the plants shook off some of their green and yellow splotched leaves, letting Ivy collect them and bring the plant material to a work bench, where a plate of cookies was stacked high alongside her chemistry equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" Harley said, reaching towards the tray of cookies, only to yelp and withdraw her hand when Ivy smacked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Harl, patience,\" Ivy explained, turning back to her chemistry setup. Harley eyed the plate of cookies as she waited for Ivy to finish turning the leaves of the weird bush into  a bright yellow tincture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, whatcha got there Ivy? Another hypo potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try it and find out?\" Ivy encouraged, getting a triumphant look on her face as Harley, being the ditz that she was, guzzled down the chemical without a second thought. Hiccuping softly, she placed a hand over her stomach and pondered the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, tangy and sweet!\" Harley said approvingly. \"Now I wish I had something to go with it though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help yourself, then!\" Ivy said, pushing the tray slightly towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cookies!\" Harley exclaimed before grabbing onto stray baked goods with both hands and beginning to feast. \"Man, if that's a mind control formula, I'm glad it goes great with meals now, haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not merely mind control Harl. Addiction. An addiction that will finally end man's crusade against Mother Earth.\" Ivy explained as Harley kept eating. \"Give this compound to a human and they will be too busy stuffing their face with processed foods to try and cut down trees or murder the flora with their polluting habits. But they will need to consume this formula first, and for that I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmf?\" Harley said through a mouthful of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we need to do is buy our way into the corporate offices in Gotham and get everyone who serves food to prepare meals with this compound,\" Ivy explained. \"One dose is enough for the addiction to take hold, and from there it will do all the work.\" Ivy grabbed onto Harley's hand gently, who whimpered as the cookie she was trying to eat was delayed. \"Do you think you can do that for me, Harley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley gave a salute. \"You can count on me Red!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley put in an astounding level of work for being a ditzy airhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out no one in Gotham wanted to work with Ivy. Supposedly reformed or not, few of the corporate fat cats wanted to work with someone who had mind controlled large parts of the city, repeatedly broken out of Arkham and once turned the botanical garden into a carnivorous nightmare during a gala. Those few who did were eager to get green PR points working with the photogenic botanist until they say they once dainty woman in the flesh. Once a short, svelte hour glass able to get the attention of most men and women, Pamela Isling was now head turningly fat, blitzing towards 300 lbs with the drive of the Red Army closing in on Berlin. Her fat habits were putting her into a new dress size every new Sunday and given that meetings were on Fridays, the potential sponsors sat through her food pitch watching green tinged belly flesh quiver through the gaps of her stretched buttons and her leg fat pour through unnoticed stocking runs. She rarely stopped eating during the pitch, twice she and Harley ate their own product before she could even offer a sample, not that anyone took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Wayne is a swine! I tell you a swine,\" Ivy fumed as she and Harley rode the elevator down from Wayne tower, \"back in the day when I dated Harvey he couldn't keep his eyes off me! The nerve to say my product is unmarketable, just due to my past!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Red, he said it was because of yer fat! Not yer past!\" The chunky ex-clown said beside her, poking a finger into Ivys jello gut<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Harley, it's five pounds max,\" the obese villain denied, swatting away her hand, totally unable to fully admit her stunning expansion, convince a pair of spanx would hide her hundred pound weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion caused a rip to run up the side of her skin tight grey dress, from hip to breast. Ivy was wearing a size twenty gown totally inappropriate for a business meeting even if it hasn't been skin tight. Although it did flatter her pale breasts, it also had been stretched over her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! I just bought this! Goes to show you why mankind needs to change, lest cheap crap like this fills up the dumps!\" Ivy ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddled out of the elevator, drawing a few snickers from onlookers at Ivy's wardrobe malfunction. Once they'd been figures of fear, but now? Both had employed acrobatic fighting styles, now ones that they were obviously incapable of even attempting. Ivy's ferocious plant powers were still at play and Harely might have a gun, but to see the one agile sirens huff, puff and waddle across the streets of a city they'd terrorized was beyond cathartic. Especially as Ivy was ranting about the flimsiness of modern disposable clothing while trying to hold her ripping dress together, until the coat department gave them both their outer garments, out grown suit jackets tat couldn't fit if their lives depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And that is why hemp is a preferable alternative to cotton,' Ivy finished as they left through the turning doors, their atrophied muscles having to push pretty damn hard against its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarely wasn't paying attention but knew her friend's ranting time down pat. As Ivy finished, suddenly woozy on her feet from the effort, Harely pulled a king sized candy bar out of her purse and handed it over. Ivy started Kuching immediately, while the psychiatrist stuck out a thick, but curvy leg for a cab. A faint buzzing was heard as they shoved their tubby bulks into the cab and Harley managed to pull her cellphone out of her breast pocket just before the call ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy glared at her as the conversation took the entire ride home, less than half a mile. It was as sin to use so much fossil fuel, but the distance was beyond the uber zaftig redhead's wind. After laboriously hauling tier weak, heavy bodies from the car (which involved several more rips to form on Ivy's dissenting rating dress, the two managed to get inside their building and into the elevator where Harley hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great news Red, we've got a buyer who's real interested in your pitch,' Harley squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who? We've tried every legitimate businessman and most illigetimate ones in Gotham,' Ivy huffed, trying to hold her clothes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh not in Gotham, across the river in NYC,' Harley quivered, 'a big female head honcho wants to try your health food.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't leave me hanging here Harley,' Ivy demanded, even though her left breast literally was hanging out now, 'who is it?'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'So, who is this fat cat?' Ivy asked Harley in the back of an electric, self driving limousine on the way to meet Karen Starr, in between chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perhaps a little late to ask such questions, but Ivy had been preoccupied finding a dress that fit her ballooning, gut heavy form. Nothing she had did, her hunt resulting in a dozen trash bags of clothes to donate to good will, and all she could find was a size eighteen pants suit that had been nearly outgrown two weeks ago. Two pairs of spanx and an honest to god corset used when the two super criminals felt amorous were required to squeeze the obese vixen into her dress. They gave her waist an odd, overly smooth shape that was still well into the overweight range and pushed her green tinted tits up to her budding third chin. As her gain was Apple shaped her pants kind of fit, if one assumed she chose to wear slacks tight as leggings. Still the seams were only on the verge of breaking and the rubber band holding its flaps together wasn't even that stretched, so she might as well treat herself to some chocolate for going down a size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, she's not exactly a fat cat,' Harley told her, flicking through her phone, 'she's in as good a shape as I used to be!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Harley, you're not fat. I keep telling you, you're body is just detoxing from all of that consumerist crap,' Ivy lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ya keep saying that Red, but when we met I was a size two and yesterday my ass ripped out the seat of pair of size ten sweats when I was picking up a controller!,' Harley whined, 'I'm pretty chunky nowadays.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once energetic clown had developed a bad case of screen addiction, be it to phones or video games her ADD couldn't pull itself away. A case of carpal tunnel was coming with it, and she winced as she flipped the screen and adjusted the brace on her right arm. Harley was only kind of fat, a toneless and flabby 165 lbs, dumpy with a chunky ass and a  floppy lower belly not flattered by her snug size twelve pant suit. Her blonde hair was drawn back in a bun, which didn't do much but show off her double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the once athletic crown princess of crime had gotten her was an easy store. Her new legal but unhealthy video game habits had robbed her muscles of any tone prior to her addiction and put the foundation of her gain across her plump butt, but thirty of that had come in the last month since getting addicted to Ivy's substance. For every pound the ballooning redhead put on, Harley had put on two. She ate all the time now, even when she was asleep sometimes she'd wake up in front of an empty. The only exception was when she had sometime to work on, some attention to focus her snack grabbing fingers upon. If it hadn't been for the mission from her green girlfriend Harley would have surely been even porkier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's all for the greater good Harley, just imagine all those green house gases stored safely inside your body,' Ivy reassure her, trying to grab another box of chocolates but stymied by being unable to bend, 'but go on about the fat cat.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's a big up and comer in the tech industry, quantum computing, green energy, electric cars, you name it her company is into it,' Harley said, flipping through her phone as the car pulled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good she'll be easy to win over then,' Ivy laughed, 'help me out of the car.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute. Harley's arms, once strong enough to punch out a bat brat with one swing of a hammer were now more suited to using a joystick. Everyday they got weaker and Ivy got heavier, making hauling the increasingly rotund plant hybrid from the car a growing struggle. A couple pops sounded faintly from Ivy's restraining garments, but she managed to get out  of the car with her dignity intactish and Harley was only mildly sweaty when they were  ushered into the stylish sky scraper by a waiting intern and guided to an express elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, I'm guessing we're going to see a frumpy, nerdy tech geek,' Ivy preened on the elevator ride up, 'easy to over awe for someone of my stature?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, if she's awed of green marshmellows' Harley grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving become a frumpy, video game playing nerd who's 20/20 vision had been ruined   By screens to the point of needing coke-bottle frames, the once agile gymnast didn't like the second hand dig. Especially as she was usually awed by Ivy's increasingly spherical physique. Only 5'1, the pixish Eco terrorist was a gross parody of corporate greed, stuffed inside a far too tight red and white pantsuit like a ripe tomato. Harley loved how funny her huffing and puffing sounded, as well as how soft, squishy and sensitive Ivy was getting in the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And I keep telling ya,' Harley said as the express elevator slowed, 'she's not fat she's...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors dinged open, into the executive office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Isley, Dr. Quinzel, I'm Pleased to meet you,\" their host greeted standing up from behind a desk and offering a hand shake, 'Karne Starr.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot as shit,\" Harley whispered unnecessarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvys third impression was of well muscled curves, perfectly balanced. By her corded legs and sinewy arms, shown by a short skirt and tight blouse, the woman she'd derided as a fat cat must live in the gym's weight room and sprint track. By her rounded hips though she didn't seem to miss a meal, but the way her skirt sat against her hard stomach suggested there weren't a lot of deserts in them. Both were an expert in getting punched by very fit people and both agreed that a punch from Karen Starr would fucking hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's second impression was of height. Most people were taller than the short bio botanist, even Harley's blonde curls were six inches above Ivys red hair, but Starrware's CEO had a foot on her. She was taller than almost any woman she'd seen in Gotham and most men would look up to see her ivory face, big green eyes behind stylish but thick glasses and curly red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's third impression was tits. Tatas. Boobs. Bazookas. Cantaloupes. Melons. Hooters. Mammary mounds. Bounce meat. Jugs. Front butt. In a word, Breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villains weren't flat chested by any means after all their poundage: Harley had gone from a firm B to a floppy C and Ivy had inflated from a trim C to a pillowy set of sensitive F cups. But the CEO had as much cleavage on her chest as both chunky sirens did together! Ivy consoled herself by thinking that there was no way those could be real, they had to be silicone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nudge from Harley made Ivy take the hand, which was like a vice grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So pleased to meet you,\" Ivy stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion caused a lot of bouncy. Gaia, they were real. Crap, how could one woman be so perfect? This wasn't fair in Ivys mind, not with her getting a 'little' chubby! Seeing those hard bodied bimbo blow up would be sweet vengeance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially as the tall CEO was eyeing Ivy up like a lioness watches a chubby gazelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Drs, your email claimed you had a new miracle, women's health food to pitch to me,' Starr said, patting her flat belly, 'As I have worked up an appetite this morning, I'll eat while you fill me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley handed her the cooler, filled with carefully packaged cupcakes, cookies and streusel and the women retreated to a set of couches. Karen had opened and examined one excellently crafted cupcake on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good presentation ladies, whose work?' She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be me,' Harley beamed, 'well, the packaging actually. Dumplin here came up with the food.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich puzzled the beefy psychologist criminal. Ivy couldn't boil water, yet where had she gotten so many and so many high quality baked goods without <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You should be proud of yourself for your dedication, I've always thought you were creative,' Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's brow crinkled, why did this woman sound familiar? Other thoughts were banished as Starr inhaled the cupcake. It was like a magic trick, in her hand one moment and then she was swallowing the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm, these are excellent. Real sugar, real butter cream, yum. Let me order something for you,' the CEO smiled, wolfing down another cupcake and tapping her smart watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen kept eating from the rapidly dwindling box, a door opened and a white plastic android rolled out on tracks, bearing a tray with a steaming basket of truffle fries and two very large sodas which it sat down in front of the two sirens. Ivy started eating right away but Harley's attention was on the bombshell across from them. She looked back and forth, amazed that the hoggish botanist and the ripped CEO were eating at the same rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sighed and sat back as the last cupcake disappeared. She undid her belt and unsnapped her button, letting the zipper slide down under a small food baby. Her smile was for a moment perfectly content, then she sat up, predatory and business like again. Ivy had mostly finished the fries and her quart of soda and fraying sounds were emerging from her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Those were excellent and I'm going to need either a longer workout session or much bigger skirts,' the CEO joshed, 'now ladies, these cupcakes are a bit too good to be true. So I've got some questions for you...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy frowned, shoveling in fries. The formula was supposed to make anyone who ate it an obedient slave to her, dumb and pliable. What was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I ran a diagnostic on the sample you'd sent earlier,' Karen went on, pulling out a folder, 'and the frosting on these contains several compounds not known to science but that appear to be more addictive than crack cocaine and meth combined.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You sent a sample?' Ivy huffed at Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seemed like a good idea...' The clown quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And there are approximately 2000 calories per cupcake, unlike the twenty calories you claimed,' the CEO went on, 'and your sole residence doesn't have the energy usage indicating baking.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can explain,' Ivy stammered, angry to be removed from her post meal euphoria...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Explain how you're trying to market an addictive cupcake of pure calories as a health food?' Starr put in, jabbing a finger into Ivy's constrained midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its' that we have,' Ivy began, shoving another handful of truffle fries in to give herself time to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Plans about body positivity?' Harley tried to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right,' Ivy' said swallowing, interrupted by a long rip of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund botanist looked down, trying to crane past her swollen cleavage to see anything and feeling the first layer of spanx go completely. With a glurge, her contained stomach expanded out and further strained the remaining spanx and corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Body positivity?' the CEO huffed, 'you can't sell with that when you've gained two hundred pounds!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Listen you! You and your plastic, gym honed body,' the once nymphish woman hissed, waving an arm, 'you don't have any idea what real woman put up with!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion caused another long rip as the second layer of spanx failed. Ivy winced as her gut rammed into the steel rods of her corset, which began to groan as its ties frayed. Gaps formed on the buttons of her shirt and suit jacket, spreading apart with tectonic pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have an idea that no one will buy food made by someone who's as fat as you are,' Starr countered, poking at Ivy's belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I will not sit here and listen to someone so crazy as to say I'm fat!' the plant hybrid spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy went to stand up, to indignantly declare they were leaving, but the small motion of rolling her hips forwards and letting the inertia of her gut carry her off the couch destroyed the sole restraining garment's desperate holding action. Laces failed in ten places, the corset snapped apart and for one horrible second Ivy's pale, slightly green stomach was tight against a dress shirt and jacket four sizes too small. The three women stared in blank eyed astonishment as Ivy's horribly atrophied stomach muscles tried to suck in the mound of fat but they failed and shirt buttons shot across the room like the opening bombardment of an amphibious landing. Karen's wine glass shattered, a snow globe cracked and Harley was saved from an eye injury only by the thickness of her coke bottle eye glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now this is what I was referring to,' the CEO said, leaning over and kneading the mound of greenish lard spilling over Ivy's lap, 'its too obvious you're trying to fatten people up with these things when you're carrying around all of this. Your plan needs refinement, so its a good thing you came to me before trying it yourself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You...you knew what we're planning to do?' Ivy asked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, what are we trying to do?' Harley asked, never having been fully told, 'how are these gonna save the world like you said Red?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Simple, Ivy makes plants that suck green house gas out of the atmosphere at an extreme rate, turning them into junk food,' Karen explained, picking up a triple stack of cookies, 'people eat the junk food, which gets stored as fat. A chemical Ivy put in them makes them addicted, they eat more of the junk food and don't spend money on anything else, all while getting fatter and fatter, storing more and more pollution. People get too fat to have kids or drive cars, there's no more fuel or land being used for agriculture, the amount of pollution falls etc etc the world is saved and humanity is too fat and happy to know the difference.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis knowledge did not stop Karen from eating the treats, moaning aloud as she did so, 'Holy shit these are good.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, if you knew that, then why are you eating them?' Harley asked,a bit indignantly,  'if I'd known I wouldn't have eaten them!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because I want to help you, I'm an environmentalist and electric cars alone can't save the environment, humans should carry some of their polluting sins with them and I've always wanted to get fat,' the CEO groaned, shoving more of the treats into her mouth, 'but before these there was never any thing dense enough energy wise. Now I can finally retire from the superheroing circuit without feeling guilty.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sirens looked alarmed at each other as their host polished off the last of their samples.A heroine in front of them, with full knowledge of Ivy's plans? Neither knew they were in any condition to fight even the weakest super hero and going by her height and muscles whoever Starr really was could easily kick their ass. Hell, the CEO without being a heroine could do it given her muscles. Yes her belly appeared to contain a small bowling ball now and her fascinating cleavage looked ready to pop her top, but Ivy and Harley were in far worse condition while being full themselves. She was like Christina Hendricks, but younger and with an address inside a gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hehe, kinda funny,' Harley ventured, 'almost sounded like ya said...super hero...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm Power Girl, Harley,' the tech CEO groaned, polishing off the last of the baked goods and rising up in the air, several feet off the ground, 'were the tits not enough of a hint?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy almost shit herself. Power Girl was an all star in terms of physical prowess, some sort of relation to superman via some weird quantum mumbo jumbo, she was essentially invincible, faster than speeding bullets and capable of punching a train into Lunar orbit. If she wanted them in jail or defeated both she and Harley would be down for the count no matter their fatness. And how did she know Harley?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside the mushy botanist, Harley shook her head (second chin wobbling), unable to believe her eyes which was true of most things anymore for the near-sighted former gangster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But, Power Girl doesn't have red hair!' the clown gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red headed tycoon took off her wig, revealing short blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And she's tan!' the clown objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Power Girl wiped a hand across her forehead, smearing away makeup to show tan skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But Power Girl doesn't wear glasses!' Harley objected, causing the tall woman to remove her specs, revealing her eyes to truly be a brilliant blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How do you see without those?' the now short sighted villainess gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I see that you haven't changed one bit since we last hung out,' Power Girl sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know her, Harley?' Ivy asked, feeling jealous of the much taller, fitter, more powerful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah! She got hit in the head and got amnesia, so I made her my side kick! Then we got sucked through a portal at a mall and into space where I fought a robot that sewed up people's buttholes, then we got high and fought Sean Connery in a speedo! Before a bird pooped on her head, she got her memory back she left me tied naked in france!' the ditzy blonde explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy blinked her eyes, knowing she'd never get the truth, 'Alright, Ms...Girl I assume, what can you do to help us?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I can use the full infrastructure of my company to help create nationwide production chains and carbon neutral distribution services to feed 300 million people nothing but your food, state of the art labs to help you perfect your formulas and avoid the FDA,' Power Girl explained, 'as well as access to professional marketing teams.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, that's a fair amount,' Ivy shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can also make sure the league is off our back,' the flying woman said, 'some of the vainer leaguers might object to gaining weight for the good of the planet. When Hawkgirl or Wonder Woman get big, they are not going to be happy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I suppose that's agreeable,' Isley agreed, shuddering at having to go up against angry heroines in her current condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And i can give you advice on these. For one thing, you've gotta tone down the calorie amount, if people double in weigh the first month its going to be noticed,' Power Girl advised, patting her own hefty temporary belly for emphasis, 'its gotta be gradual. If people see someone looking like me after one meal they won't buy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And what do you want in return?' Ivy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Besides a new skirt,' Harley chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unfettered access to this stuff. Unadulterated, original formula, pure and uncut,' Power Girl said, pointing at the empty boxes, 'Like I said, I want to get fat. You're making it look good Ivy and I want to get up to your size.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy flushed, both at the compliment and being called fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think we can agree on those terms,' Ivy said, 'right Harley?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah,' Harley said to the fuzzy blob in her blurry vision, trying to get the button out of her glasses lens, 'sure.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great then,' Power Girl smiled, putting her wig back on and fixing her makeup, 'Let's sign some legal documents and get started on the marketing push. We can't have anyone link it to you, your past and new fat would drive people away. And once I start getting noticably fat we can't use me as a model either, but we want someone famous though, probably a super, we're trying to sell an image of unbelievable food.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've got a few ideas,' Ivy offered.</span></div></div>",

Ivy scoffed, 'there's no point if they're not bulking up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And if people start ballooning at the first bite no one will eat it,' Karen reminded, patting her now protruding stomach, 'what we need is an addictive food that helps people lose a little weight at first.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day of the shoot dawned, finding one of Starware's office space fitted out with as a modeled apartment building and gym. In the background the photographer was testing out the lighting while assistants got the lighting right, while off to the side the make up technician powdered the nose of a somewhat orange woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Friend Pow-er, er, Ms Starr,' the alien model said, almost spoiling the secret identity, 'there are a few things I don't understand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh? What, *crunch*, what do you mean?' Power Girl said through a full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You said this is for food? Right?' Koriand'r asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, the best diet food in the country,' the CEO said, while pulling out another cookie from a paper bag, 'trust me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, well it seems to be not much the food and much more the sex,' the red haired woman brought up, looking at the notes, 'It says here I deep throat a cone of creamy ice? And flick my tongue through a doughnut's hole? Why so much of sex in a food ad?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh...,' Karen thought for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn obvious answer would have been: because you're sexy as fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Teen Titan was an almost impossibly gorgeous specimen of her near human species. Impossibly long graceful legs, each flawlessly tan and perfectly shaped, went up to a vavoom hour glass figure with womanly hips, a washboard waist and spectacular DD cup breasts. Her face had a pointy chin, blindingly white teeth and insanely green eyes that lacked whites. Her curly red hair hung down to her ankles and at the bottom seemed to flutter as if on fire. The tamaranian super hero/model lacked any sort of modesty, she wore instead a miniscule black miniskirt and a white blouse that seemed to have been vacuumed onto her torso, showing off the deep valley of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh...so people know eating the food will make them sexy?' Power Girl dodged, shoving another cookie into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh! Sense is made by that!,' Kori smiled, 'That is why I get into a bikini?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, we've got to show out what the food does to you,' Karen nodded slowly, hoping starfire would buy her idiotic explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh good!' Kori nodded, 'but I have another of the questions. Why are you all bulgy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tamaranian puncutated the question by poking a finger into Karen's stomach, where rippling muscles used to bulge beneath the flat surface. Kori's fingertip met flesh four inches past where Power Girl's stomach used to be and instead of hard muscle her finger touched soft, buttery pudge peek-a-booing out over Karen's waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just some ...well, you know you get near thirty and uh...' Power Girl tried deflecting, filling her mouth with cookies that made her cheeks bulge, 'you know...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because you look like the fat has gotten to you...,' Kori mentioned, fingers idly pinching Karen's now doughy midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks of constantly shotgunning Ivy's calorie laden miracle food had laid low the Kryptonian's magnificent figure. All of her shocking, impossible muscle tone had been disappeared as she chubbed up, minute by minute, snack by snack. When she'd met Ivy Karen had been in a size six skirt suit that had been tailored to her busty, muscular physique but now she was pouring out of a size ten pant suit that was coming apart at the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, I've put on a few,' Power Girl admitted, 'five or six pounds...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSky blue polyester pants were stretched to the absolute limit by newly chunked thighs, the fabric badly chafed where Karen's thigh gap had filled in by lazy bulk. Her steely superhero butt now sagged heavily, having lost its heart shape as it dissolved into the doughy buns of an office worker seated ten feet from the vending machine and Karen's svelte hips had become messily wide and child bearing. Distinctly beefy ankles were seen above her pumps, which were stretched by her puffed up feet. Flawless abs had been the first to go, layered over with fat taken from twinkies and ho hos and ding dongs and donuts and cookies and pies and all the other chemically altered goodies Ivy's plants could cook up. Karen now sported an incredibly sloppy beer belly, several inches of sloppy dough coating her rapidly atrophying abs whose raw mass had declined alarmingly, and a meaty set of love handles that formed her ultra fluffy muffin top. Power Girl's blubbery midriff had bulked out so big two inches of pale fluff were visible between skin tight slacks and overloaded blouse. So outsized were her clothes that her button hung undone, supported only by her dress belt which was running out of holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did five or six mean something different on Krypton?' Kori asked, taking in all of the flab coating the Kryptonian, who seemed to have put on at least ten times that amount in a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh...let's get you onto set,' Karen said, filling her mouth with cookies and gesturing, grabbing the redhead by the arm and leading Kori over to the set, 'times a wasting!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori noticed that something seemed to be wrong with Power Girl's stride, realizing her legs were too thick to walk past each other. And the seam across her butt was straining and groaning with every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gesture was made with a very soft looking hand and the small flick led to a wave of little jiggles that traveled up her completely untoned arm and made a few seams pop in her sleeve. The big gunned blonde had always been tough on shirts but her once dazzling guns had been thoroughly beaten into plow shares. Once spectacular muscle had completely evaporated over the past weeks as the heaviest weight Karen lifted was a pound cake. Although their diameter was noticably bigger, her biceps had totally deflated, when Karen flexed literally nothing happened beyond fat bunching. Even more shocking, her strikingly cut triceps now hung deflated, having become a nascent set of lunch lady arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uf, and here...here we are...,' Karen sighed, 'get the photos started up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vivacious model began...well, modeling highly suggestively, Karen took a seat. Standing up for long periods of time was getting tiring these days, it wasn't that she was that out of shape, she was a measly 213 pounds, but her tits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl had always had the immense pair. She'd been famous for it, more than her immense strength, invulnerability or impossible speed, she'd been known for those monster boobs. And they were truly monsters now, having plumped up so much they'd outgrown every bra in Karen's extensive collection. A free hanging grand canyon of cleavage that prevented the buttoning of her top three blouse buttons and top suit jacket button, they had to have found at least three new cup sizes even as they'd dropped four inches of perk. High pointing nipples were pointing at the ground now and had stretched significantly, even as stretch marks collected on their sides. She looked sloppy enough to have had at least three kids and looked like she was on the verge of surrendering to the baby weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Craft services, get me a new plate,' Karen sighed, new triple chin starting to show, rubbing a sore set of boobs and finding that lefty was pulling ahead of righty by a cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be hours until she could get more of Ivy's food, until then she'd just have to sit here, eat craft services bare and watch Starfire deep throat an ice cream cone while wearing a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly it was a horrible fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked over at one of the mirrors, seeing a soft faced woman looking back. Her cheekbones had vanished, replaced with apple cheeks and a set of dimples now. A meaty second chin was at its peak growth, tomorrow would see a third crease start to form...unless she had a big midnight snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only dimly recognizable now, her employees frequently did double takes to see her rapid transformation caused by the constant over eating. Karen woke up fatter than she went to bed, went to work fatter than when she got up, got to work fatter than when her growing butt had settled into her car, got into the elevator fatter than whens he'd gotten into the car and left her office fatter than when she'd sat at her desk. With the red wig on she no longer resembled a Christina Hendricks who lived at the gym, but a Christina Hendricks doing oscar worthy method acting on a role as a desert chef. Her skin tight Power Girl leotard would have ripped apart if she could even get it fastened up, it had survived so many villains to be destroyed by snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of snacks, she had one AAA, full calorie, hyper addictive cookie left until she had to get refills...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karen really wanted that cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA perfect mix of sugar and butter and flour, studded with a constellation of white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. It made her mouth water just looking at it, even before she thought about the unique mix of retroviruses, power suppressants, appetite stimulants and mind soothers Ivy had filled it with that would make her gain weight just like a regular human woman and not an invincible alien powerhouse. Cookies and treats like this (sixty or so of them that day) had taken her from having a rippling, gym honed six pack to a doughy beer belly that rested in her lap and she wanted more of them and more of them. She wanted her already chunky body to grow bigger and bigger,into an enormous pile of fat rolls too big to leave the house even if she could still walk, so big that she needed dedicated feeders to keep her belly sated just because her arms would be unable to reach past the swollen mass of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso it would help the world and what not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking over at Starfire doing the shoot made Karen reconsider. The Tamaranian read head looked so miserable in that tight bikini working that stair master, her scrawny smooth ass bouncing up and down with each step and her pitifully small DDs barely jiggling. And her stomach, it wasn't as bad as Karen's had been, a revolting mess of abdominal definition but it was almost as bad. Flat as a board and just as hard, K'ori's waistline didn't even have an inch to pinch. Even her legs were awful, so long and smooth and firm, they glided past each other without even touching! How miserable she must be, she had to be freezing without any insulation and feel so exhausted all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to gain weight, to see that tiny body bloat up with protective, warming fat. Of course K'ori might object to that, she was likely brainwashed by the western fashion industry, but once she hit three hundred she'd surely thank Power Girl. Karen would have to trick her friend into being what she really didn't know she wanted. What the flabby blonde was about to do wasn't wrong or lying or insane, no she was helping her really. She'd just have to ...bend the truth a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her admin access, Peej grabbed one of the photos being sent to the photographer's computer. It showed the pathetic roundness of Star's rear, the ass shot that would leave straight men and a good chunk of women comatose. A moment or two in photoshop using some skills honed in lonely hours on the computer and Karen was ready to help her friend see the light of immobility. Two plates from craftservices that required her belt being let out another hole sated her, the siren song of the Anonymous cookie dimmed a little, until the shoot was at a pause point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great job Kori,' Karen told the svelte Tamaranian, who was stretching her back in a way that caused several accidents among the crew, 'you look like you're having a blast out here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The thanks is yours friend Po--friend Karen Starr!' the modelesque heroine smiled, 'I've always liked the bi-kini, it makes me feel full of power and quite sexy! I feel so free and happy and confident.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh the poor thing, she must not realize how starved she looked. Karen would fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's the the thing, well...maybe I shouldn't mention it...but...nah, I wouldn't want to ruin your day...,' the disguised Power Girl dragged out, 'best not to bother you...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, is the matter something?' the english challenged alien asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...I know I'm not one to talk about this sort of thing but you're looking a little...well...,' Karen hesitated, 'I know being the den mother to the next gen of Titans is stressful but...have you been slacking working out lately?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, no I do the same sparring every day!' the perfectly fit red head said, 'what the getting are you at?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...and its fine really, only someone with super vision would notice, but you're looking a little...big in the back,' Karen hinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?' K'ori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've got some junk in the trunk,' the blonde said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't understand,' Starfire said in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're looking less Tamaranian and more Kardassian,' the frustrated Power Girl said, wiping some sweat off her fore head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'From the trek through the stars?' the red head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, its ...your ass has gotten fatter,' Karen said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh? Really?' Star said, trying to look at it and endlessly circling in the air in a fashion that made her tits nearly fall out of their top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, not too much but I started the same way and then I got way bigger than this before I knew it,' Power Girl said, gesturing at her disintegrating wardrobe and flabby curves, 'and I know how important your figure is for a model, I'm sure your agency pressures you to stay thin...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no, they say that they want to encourage healthy life styles so I do not have to maintain a set weight,' Kori explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh...well I know that you don't want to slow down when flying,' Karen said, holding up the cookie, 'so eat this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But, does not fat come in cookies?' Kori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, just eat the damn thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not this kind, its a special diet cookie. Within a couple months this thing changed me in ways you wouldn't believe,' Power Girl didn't quite lie, 'trust me, your figure will be absolutely ideal.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, okay. You must have been quite the fat,' Starfire said, taking the cookie at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green eyed woman's face lit up like a lamp with joy as she bit into the cookie. She gobbled it down and let out a happy, almost orgasmic sigh, while her stomach let out a painful gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oof, I am the hungry now,' Star stated, 'ow, why does the diet cookie make me want to eat so much?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because its raising your metabolism higher,' the portly power girl lied, 'you need to feed it though. Eat as much as you can as quickly as you can and you'll be skinny again in no time!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Karen watched the slender heroine go over to the craft services table, fill her plate with food and then rapidly demolish it, 'Hooked you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the shoot didn't go as well. For one thing, Starfire kept eating all of the prop food as fast as it could be given to her. For a while her bizarre nine stomachs handled it but after a couple hours her washboard stomach began to bulge with a food baby that sloshed as it advanced across her lap. Four hours in and the shoot had to end, because the model looked ready to give birth, her glutted waist sticking out past her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great job Kori, that cookie is already changing you,' Karen promised, rising out of her chair with a fat girl grunt and walking over as fast as her tubby thighs coudl take her without her skirt disintegrating, 'soon there'll be no going back!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But my stomach is so big, I do not feel very sexy,' the sick looking red head groaned, 'and I am still having the hunger...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh that means you've got to feed it,' Power Girl lied, 'you need to eat as much as possible for the diet to work. I'll have some more diet food shipped over to you but for now you need to eat as much high calorie, high carb and high fat food as possible to stay fueled. There might be a little bloating in your stomach and hips and thighs and chin but its all just temporary.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, okay and I will do the exercise more too!' the red head promised,  one hand behind her back and the other supporting her gut, 'thank you Karen, I would have become the ass fat for sure without you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No problem K'ori,' Karen promised, 'don't do any unnecessary exercise though, once you've eaten Anonymous food, you never need to exercise again to get into perfect shape...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overfed heroine collapsed back into her directors chair, smiling as she watched Starfire try and button a skirt that had fit perfectly that morning but was now hopelessly unable to fasten around her food gut. In the end, the redhead had to wear her bikini bottoms out, still firm orange ass peeking out beneath her blouse.The blouse had been tight to start off with, but now none of the buttons up to her chest could be fastened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled as her super vision took in the slowly softening cheeks and knew it was going to be a wonderful future ahead...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley popped out of the water with a gasping wheeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown princess of crime had been swimming laps in her new penthouse' salt water pool for the last twenty minutes and while she hadn't exactly been shooting through the water like a shark (more like a bloated pale whale) it had been more than enough to put her horribly out of shape body into the red zone of its endurance. Atrophied muscles trembling with effort, Harley pulled herself out of the pool and flopped onto the paving as she desperately tried to suck in air. Recovery took nearly as long as her work out did and the former jester winced slightly as a pang of hunger hit her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn, I'm turning into a regular lardass!' the pear shaped ex-supervillain whined to herself as she sat up, floppy belly forming into sloppy rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's hard, agile body had won her a full ride gymnastics scholarship and made her one of the most feared criminals in Gotham but being reformed had rendered her out of shape and chunky before Ivy's superfood completed her transformation. Sloppy saggy C cups trembled in the too tight bikini top with her still gasping breath, a size the normally petite topped psychiatrist would have loved if they'd still been remotely pert. Beneath them was an equally droopy gut earned from bags of doritos, bottles of gamer fuel and three breakfasts of Ivy's goodies a day, a cute little pooch she'd honestly preferred to her old four pack that was now turning into a big old gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Geeze, why'd I ever bother with all those damn sit ups,' Harley grunted, giving her grumbling stomach a pat and pushing herself up with her soft, puffing arms, always irritated wrists giving a twinge of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying video games sixteen hours a day had wrecked her wrists just as it had blown up the rest of her body. She waddled over to a pool chair beneath the trees, the whole deck wrapped round in beautifully maintained plants Ivy had grown, and bent down to pick up her coke bottle frames, the world getting far less blurry as her vision was corrected sixty points. A small pop sounded as the porcine woman did and she rolled her eyes to feel that her bikini bottom had come undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell Harley, this is a size eighteen!' she grunted, pulling the string back together and hastily hauling them up, 'ya used to be a regular stunner! Only way your stunning people now is with the size of your ass.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had always had a big butt and all of her outfits were crafted to show off the steely buns. Now of course instead of steel they were bags of pure, drooping fat studded with cellulite and completely swallowing the thong she wore. The once graceful woman was now clumsy as a clown trying to be humorously clumsy, immense ass knocking things off tables every day as she waddled along. The lithe woman had blown up into a full on pear, her fat clumping to thigh and cankle while she crashed on the couch and played video games all day, her cellulite covered legs flopping and wobbling whenever she waddled along. She'd been getting soft over the past months and knew she'd never do an acrobatic flip again but hadn't thought of herself as being that fat until a chance snack run had shown a wobbling, red faced, panting fat woman with coke bottle frames and a forty eight inch ass waddle in dressed in Harley's clothes. The clown princess had hurriedly weighed herself to find that her just fat 170 lb body had blown up with an extra seventy pounds in only a few weeks, something that explained the underwear and t shirts that ripped off herself with frightening regularity. Knowing that a drastic change was needed, and that dieting was as impossible as gymnastics or running, the horizontally challenged woman had started taking up swimming once she'd found a nice plus sized thong. The week of swimming hadn't really made a dent in her spectacular gain but at least she felt better about it, even if she'd outgrown her swim suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That swim had to burn what, twenty thousand calories?\" Harley wildly over estimated as she reached up to one of the special fruit trees, ripping down a steaming fresh twinky and munching down on it as she waddled in to the main apartment to find Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeeze, did Peeg have to give them so a long apartment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Harley was panting again as she waddled into Harley's laboratory, plopping her ass onto a groaning school as she watched her girlfriend stare painstakingly into a microscope. Ivy was doing that 'paying attention' thing she did, totally focused and it gave Harley a good view of her own growing body. The photosynthetic woman's gain had slowed a bit as she was working on new strains of her food, letting Harley close in. But she was still a waddling whale of a plant hybrid who'd just cleared three hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready somewhat sloppy Fs had expanded out into G cups that were really starting to droop, especially after the hippie scientist had gone on a diatribe about how bras were a way to reduce and control femininity after a Victoria's Secret store had said they didn't have her size anymore. Her belly was so big it had split into upper and lower halves when sitting and Harley could barely remember when Ivy had been a size zero. Although her hips didn't have the same womanly girth as Harley's and her legs weren't disproportionately fat, her lower body wasn't exactly slim either. The only thing besides panties she was wearing was a lab coat of sustainable hemp, that was too small to button up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley waddled up stealthily and then as Ivy went to write her notes, leaned in and grabbed Ivy's immense gut, flopping it up and down like a mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Heya Red, how about we go stuff?' Harley said in a gruff voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, not now Harley,' Ivy said, 'I'm at a crucial point for these.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand at a collection of flowers, mutli-colored and beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ooh, what they do?' Harley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, these might be my master piece,' Ivy smiled, 'you see their pollen...'</span></div></div>",

By the end of the year she expected her to be wider than she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've gained ten pounds or so but its just vanity weight,' the immense, nearly three times as fat as she'd been red head grunting as she waddled, 'and you...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy looked over at Harley's sausage thighs and swollen ankles, at her squelchy pot belly and saggy boobs and the little double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...are just shaking off unrealistic societal standards,' Ivy decided, 'no I've made myself immune and it only affects meta humans and a few species of aliens, a cocktail of crispr genes and metamagic and synthetic kryptonite that'll change sexual preferences.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your saying it'll give em a fat fetish?' Harley asked, eyes beaming, 'you're gonna turn all the supers into chubby chasers?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well yes, Power Girl is going to deliver it...,' Ivy said with a smile, 'she'll carry the flowers up to the JL watch tower and unleash a plague of fat fetishes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's gonna deliver it?' Harley asked, 'aren't they gonna notice her getting fat? She was eating fit to beat the band when we had that meeting last month and I doubt she was working out setting up that shoot.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please Harley its been a month, maybe she'll have to suck her stomach a little bit but on her frame it won't be that noticeable yet,' Ivy said with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pure muscular gorgeousness of the Kryptonian got on the short stack botanist's chlorophyll. It wasn't fair that another woman could look like that, much less have super human powers. Tall, ripped, stacked and bullet proof? It wasn't fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the door to the apartment was thrown open and heeled foot steps clicked on the tile, followed by the pop of a champagne cork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where's my partners in crime at?' Karen Starr yelled at them from across the hall, 'because our sales figures are in and they are sky high!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kryptonian CEO burst into Ivy's lab for the first time in weeks, having been otherwise too busy and the two ex-criminals saw she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karen Star's stylish skirt suit strutted into Ivy's lab, a designer, mid thigh black skirt stitched perfectly to show off long legs, a red jacket that showed her supple waist and strong shoulders and a tantalizing white blouse that hinted at her delightful cleavage. The whole ensemble was a size eight with a slightly relaxed waistline, an item made for the CEO who's had a few too many power lunches and too few gym sessions, but who's slight padding would go all but unnoticed. Especially as Karen's red wig was already off and her glasses set aside, showing PGs golden mane and dazzling, inhuman blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm thinking a five star restaurant with ten courses each, ending with one of those gold leaf cakes,' Karen declared to the agape Harley and Ivy, popping open another bottle of champagne, 'and then this rather...exclusive ladies club down town. What do you think?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Karen Star's size eight outfit, Power Girls size twelve body had been shoved into it. Some false tone was lent to her chubby legs by her high heels, but nothing could hide how her plump thighs rubbed together. The black skirt was so stretched it had become a mini-skirt and its side button was a gaping hole bridged by a rubber band and a paper clip, the squishy pot belly that had been frighteningly ripped abs oozing over it. Diamonds of soft tan flesh puffed through the gap in her dangerously tight blouse, buttons a single box of chocolates away from becoming a danger to everyone in front of her.The top three buttons would never close even in dreams, showing that her phenomenal cleavage had entered the realm of unreality. Twin peach, head sized orbs of jiggling glory split with bright blue veins, the lacy white bra that cradled them starting to come apart at the seams, never designed to handle tits of that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cat woman got your tongue, ladies?' Karen asked, rubbing her back as even a kryptonian's back got sore from hauling around G cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You...you...you're fat!' Ivy stammered, seeing her plan to infect the justice league with a fat fetish go up in chubby smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, only a little bit by BMI. You can't trust that though, it doesn't count for muscle,' the well fed, gorgeous alien laughed, patting her fluffy tum as if there were still a six pack on it, 'so are you thinking steak or salad? Actually, for you is it wrong to eat plants?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You...this was just in a month! You were in perfect shape, no one would have suspected anything!' Ivy gasped, 'how did you get so fat so fast?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ivy, we've both been getting a little bit uh, voluptuous,' the pear shaped Ivy pointed out, patting the cellulite stuffed bean bags she hauled behind her while prodding Ivy's beach ball belly, 'one month on this shit does a number on ya. I'm surprised she ain't bigger!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I tried but I ran out of your food around the time of the commercial and between getting this whole hyper addictive, super illegal, quasi ethical obesity pandemic causing super food blitz thing going and a few heroing things here and there, I kind ran out of time to gain more than forty pounds or so. You should be proud of me for  gaining so much so quickly and keeping it on,'  PG bragged, jiggling her own gut with pride, 'oh this fat feels great. You've got no idea how awful it felt having a body like that. My tits were always surging out of bras and if I flexed too hard I'd rip jacket sleeves or pant legs, it was awful.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sure,' Ivy said with an eye roll, 'but I only expected you to get a little starter belly at best from the five bags Harley was supposed to give you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, five bags. Right,' the pear shaped, 98% naked clown blushed, 'that's what I gave her...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well they were bags. If you count a shipping crate as a bag...,' the overweight heroine giggled, shirt button flying off and getting lost in Ivy's own green tinted boobs, 'but come on girls. This is what we want! Look at me, trapping fossil fuels inside myself. I already feel myself getting lazier and less polluting.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy growled in annoyance. Having to deal with Harley's ADHD was annoying enough, if tempered by the mild tranquilizers in the food that were making the hyper active clown into a stark white couch potato most of the day. She'd expected an entrepreneur like Karen Star, or Power Girl which when she thought about it should have been obvious, to have been a fellow professional with her head in the game. A little over eating and a couple pounds of vanity weight like Ivy had gained was understandable, although the 300 lb hybrid botanist was sure hers was mostly water weight, but the other two couldn't hold onto their own appetites at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is a disaster Karen,' Ivy lectured, clumsily hauling her morbidly obese bulk from the stool and waddling over to poke Power Girl's bullet proof gut, 'because you still have to take the fat fetish pollen up to the watch tower to turn the Justice league to our side.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not a problem, that's a one minute flight at minimum power,' Karen said, 'we can order at the restaurant and I'll be back before the appetizers are served.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And if someone asks why Power Girl, the buffest heroine on the planet has suddenly become the chubbiest in less than a month?' Ivy asked, drawing herself up to her full height of 5'0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, Starfire bought it,' Karen said lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Starfire is the byword for ditzy dumb heroines. She'd believe anything!' Ivy told her, 'what if you run into someone with brains like Wonder Woman or Zatanna or God forbid the Bat?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, who'd been munching fresh caramel pop corn from a modified ear began coughing at the last word. She hadn't thought of the Bat since she'd gone straight. Well sort of straight. In terms of criminality straight. Kind of. Not really. But the last time she'd fought a bat or a bat brat she'd been a 120 lb acrobat with a six pack who could do a triple back flip from standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she couldn't stand up without using her hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Red, ya said the word! We don't say that word here!,' Harley choked, spitting and gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy stammered, trying to help but unable to even get her arms around her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry, JSA and JL policy means i have to know how to do this,' PG informed her, picking her up and squeezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley found her face being swallowed up from behind by the comfiest pair of pillows on the planet, the cuddly boobs and comfy gut pressing into her upper back making her feel warm and cozy while the mighty arms pressing into her chest made her feel utterly safe. If her swimsuit hadn't already been damp it would have been soaked by the time she coughed up the pop corn and PG gracefully set her down, plump paunch rubbing into her back. Harley quivered, the bisexual clown had always had a bit of a thing for the alien blonde but now that she was all cuddly she found herself head over heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You okay there?' Power Girl asked, patting the flabby clown's soft shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ya ya saved me...,' Harley asked, eyes metaphorically turning into hearts and noticing that all of Karen's buttons had come undone, showing off her softened torso to the fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And we still haven't solved this little 'our mole is too fat to ever be believed to be innocent' problem,' Ivy reminded, own heart thundering in shock at the close call and angry that power girl had saved the day when she couldn't, 'can you even shove this gut into your costume?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe if I suck in?' Karen offered, sucking her stomach in as far as she could, still looking a little pudgy, her barely hidden stomach quivering for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'oh you look great, fantastic even Betty!' Harley swooned, using the fake name she'd dubbed PG a few years earlier, 'I mean you look better with some more to love but...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe if they don't notice your thigh fat or double chin,' Ivy huffed, 'either you go in claiming ...I don't know, a wizard puffed you up or there was a lab explosion...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A lab explosion?' Karen asked with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That happens to people all the time, I wasn't always lime and Harley wasn't always...Harley,' Ivy explained, 'either that or we find someone else to help us.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unfortunately there is no one else to help us,' Power Girl countered, 'world's not exactly full of super heroines with fat fetishes. Believe me I checked twice.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe not a heroine, just someone who can get in there undetected and sneak around,' Ivy mused, tapping her stylish nails against her lips, 'who can sneak in through the air vents, get in and out without anyone noticing...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ooh, I'll do it!' Harley volunteered, 'Betty and I can go up together and she'll be a distraction.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy blinked, feeling a head ache, 'Harley you can go if you can touch your toes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Harley tried that Sisyphean task, gold medalist body now stiff as a 2X4,  Ivy and Karen thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'd need someone who'd work with you,' Karen pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But who can risk getting caught by the league,' Ivy brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And is sneaky,' PG added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And is okay with becoming obese most importantly,' Ivy ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So...cat woman then?' Karen said, 'I still think I could do it. Its not that big of a deal.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step forwards, skirt getting caught on a piece of heavy lab equipment and ripping right off to display her ripe lower half: meaty FUPA, buttery stuffed thighs and plump packed navel, all wrapped in a disintegrating pair of lacy white underwear that was two sizes too small at best. Only the blind would think them the same as the toned thighs complete with wide thigh gap, verging on eight pack abs that began right above her pelvis and tight, firm navel. Ivy dope slapped her forehead while Harley began drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Might need to let my costume out a bit,' she giggled nervously, pinching her FUPA, 'I'm just a bit bloated right now. Been eating a lot of dairy...'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Heads turned when Selina Kyle entered the room and in a good way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catburglar was tall drink of cold water. 5'10 without her high heels, more of it graceful, agile leg than could be believed. Strong ankles, shapely calves, smooth knees and long, perfected thighs leading up to spectacular back side, her round hips and full chest the only fat on her graceful body at the moment. Although she'd been raised on the streets, her delicate facial features and vivid green eyes seemed to reek of old money and elegance, fitting for the wife of Bruce Wayne. Every step of her stilletos was perfectly placed, making the black fabric of her dress shimmy and shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garcon of the restaurant, a high end gotham one that was mostly empty at the early hour, was skilled enough to not give her a once over. Taking in the diamond ring on her finger and jewels on her neck rather than her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm meeting some people here,' the now retired Catwoman purred, 'a hyper skinny blonde and a curvy little red head. Trust me, you'd know em if you saw em.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There's no one of that description here, please give me a name,' the host asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat raised an eyebrow. Even out of their crime costumes Harley and Ivy were noticeably stunning. Could they be in disguise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Either Isley or Quinzel,' Catwoman offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, they have a private room,' the garcon nodded, 'right this way.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina prowled after him, eyes flitting over the diners: wallet loaded up with gambling cash right there, engagement ring on a second wife there and an heirloom necklace there. Catwoman stopped herself from looking, now that she was engaged to a billionaire vigilante she had no need to steal anything ever again. Still, her kleptomania wasn't just a funny quirk and a small fortune in looted jewelry was in her purse by the time before she could realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, hold on,' Selina said when they reached the door, sounds of smacking and chewing from the other side, 'thank you for this but I need to powder my nose....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the jewelry back in the right place without being noticed was harder than snagging it. Selina welcomed the challenge, for though she loved Bruce fighting crime was far more boring than doing crime. While she was a dangerous fighter, stronger than her slim body looked, she preferred infiltrating to fighting and bluntly busting up mobsters and supervillains bored the shit out of her. Bruce had a flood of orphans to do that alongside and to be honest she wasn't sure what to do with the rest of her life. Enjoy being impossibly rich? Become an alcoholic? Get pregnant and breed a few more Waynes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she really wanted was to steal something. Something no one else could steal. If she could do that, just once, then she could retire in peace. But what could you steal when you had everything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still thinking when she opened the door, seeing a tall plump, blonde haired woman in business attire over eating next to a fat blonde woman gorging next to a spherical red haired woman glutting herself. Selina balked, clearly this was the wrong room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh pardon me,' Catwoman said, going to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Selina, come on in,' the blob said in Ivy's voice, waving over a sausage fingered hand that was on close examination, lime green, 'we ordered a few appetizers without you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman's eyes widened until her pupils disappeared, 'Ivy? Harley? You're....you're...looking ...swell...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd seen a picture of Ivy at her parole meeting when the mad botanist had been teeny, a hundred pounds soaking wet. She had to be triple that now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, thank you. New diet and all that,' Ivy said, with difficulty rolling to her feet and standing up by pressing both hands on the thankfully well made table, waddling over, 'come on and sit down!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShell shocked, Selina let herself be guided to the last seat at the table which was groaning under bread baskets, shrimp cocktails, mussels, cheese trays, game sausage samplers, friend mushrooms, onion rings and one tiny, untouched side salad sat next to Ivy, hidden in the shadow of her swollen tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're looking so good Selina. Married life is doing good for you, eh?' Ivy asked, 'you looked so radiant as a bride, you must have dieted so much to fit into that dress.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, just a few pounds,' Selina told her, putting her hand to her stomach which, wasn't quite as flat as it'd been then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wonder Woman is one of the brides maids, you go on a crash diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, probably real easy to stay skinny doing all that cat burglaring,' Harley spoke up from her shrimp, 'running around on them buildings. Say, what ya stolen lately?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'well, nothing,' Selina admitted, 'girls, what this obviously isn't just a friendly meeting, what's going on?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we're trying to save the world and want you to be part of it,' Ivy explained, going into her turn everyone fat plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...well, that is... a plan,' Catwoman blinked, 'so why am I part of this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was debating either calling Bruce, kicking their asses herself or just letting them fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I've put on some appreciable weight,' the tall blonde woman admitted, patting a fully belly, 'so I can't exactly get into the watch tower unquestioned. Power Girl by the way, so great to finally meet you. Wedding looked lovely.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, charmed,' Catwoman blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd never met Power Girl but would have struggled to connect this plumper to the woman who's heavy boobs and ripped waist graced so many dorm rooms. Her pants were fully opened to allow her gut to pool out and the main courses hadn't even arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you are the best infiltrator we know,' Power Girl kept going, 'so, we need you to bring some pollen into the watch tower that will make everyone inside prefer...larger women.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And why exactly would I want to do this? I'm not really large,' Catwoman observed, pointing at her flat waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, now you're not,' Ivy said, 'but come on Selina, you're spectacular but for how much longer? We're all on the wrong side of thirty dear.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm only 29 red,' Harley pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And I'm twenty eight,' power girl offered, 'and i don't really age after adulthood so...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's eyes quivered with the hate of a 32 year old but she kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But the point is, it gets harder and harder to keep a heart breakers figure every year, right, especially when you can't exercise. All three of us have put on the Arkham 15 before and had to lose it before we could get back in the game,' Ivy went on, 'we both know they make newer, younger and thinner villainesses every year to catch the paper's attention. And now that you're not thieving every night and surely going to have a few litters of bat kittens...well, how long can you stay at the peak of your game?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its not that important,' Selina denied, crossing her perfect legs but feeling a bit of insecurity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much longer could she stay this fit? She and Bruce had talked about having kids, could she really squeeze into the old cat suit after that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But what is important is that while you're getting older and heavier, there'll be ageless size 2 airheads like Wonder Woman or super girl zipping around for you to compete with after the old middle aged spread hits,' Ivy explained, 'wouldn't it be nice to knock em down a peg like our friend here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl looked up from a pile of impossible ribs, not a heart throb but a slob. She could compete with that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And really you should think of this like a job,' Harley pipped up from her pre-meal ice cream sundae, 'but instead of stealing money, you're stealing Wonder Woman's waist measurements. Whenever you see the big amazon balloon floating around, you can know that you did it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman's waist line. The theft of the millennium...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And this powder, will it affect me any?' Selina asked Ivy with a purr, hesitation forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can tweak it to prevent it from working on you,' Ivy bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then I'm in,' Selina purred, standing up, 'I've already got the blue prints, call me when you've got the formula ready.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strutted out, pointedly not eating any of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still think I could do it,' Power Girl muttered as she began cutting into a mountain of boneless wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Wayne Manor, empty given its inhabitants crime fighting focus, Selina started researching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbing a space station on the Moon was difficult. Just getting there would mean either a space walk or a teleportation, then she'd have to infiltrate a place filled with mind readers and supers, some of which knew her. The way she saw it there were two ways, an easy way and a hard one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard one was disguising herself as a worker, one of the faceless drones who kept the machinery of justice running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe easy one was dosing someone who was going there. She looked down at her phone, turning it on to show the background of herself and Lois Lane. She hadn't expected to become best friends with the ace reporter, but the street kid and the army brat, the jewel thief and the reporter had a similar mentality. While Lane hunted stories and Selina hunted valuables, both were after prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd both were also mortal, if gorgeous women. She couldn't believe Lois was 35 with her figure, but she knew her friend had been fighting the battle of the bulge for a while. Really it would be inevitable, she'd be doing Lois a favor putting her ahead of the curve....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dosing a friend seemed much, much easier. A simple phone call to Ivy to whip up her little plague and then another one to Lois to schedule a lunch date and things were already half way done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne easy week later and on Monday morning, when Bruce was still sleeping off a night of punching clowns, Selina stopped her morning jog along the misty perimeter of Wayne Manor as a well fed shape dipped out of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is that costume...wise?' the woman who wore a skin tight cat themed body suit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wise? No, but I like staying on brand,' Power Girl told her, breathing heavily despite the short flight from NYC to Gotham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perfectly muscled, dare say rippling, woman was red faced and sweaty in her attire. Apart from being a size twelve-Long instead of a size six, the costume was PGs classic long sleeved white one piece with a boob window, expose hips and red cape. It's cut hadn't been altered to take in account her now over rounded hips extending to the sides or over beefy FUPA bulge sagging out on each side of her panty strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not one to judge, but are you comfortable wearing that?' Selina asked, taking in meringue hard thighs squishing together, their cellulite on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It is a bit...snugger than I'd expected,' the double chinned Kryptonian admitted, lowering herself shakily down to the ground and plopping her butt on a bench, 'but I was thinner when I ordered it. Maybe I shouldn't have eaten so much after the product launch.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPG was still panting, famous chest rising and falling with piston-like rapidity. Her breasts were swollen and in the early stage of settling, no longer standing tall and proud in her bra cups but beginning to hang. Beneath them her rounded gut, slightly swollen beyond its new roundness, was going in and out as well, each breath drawing a sighing *creak* from the skin tight white fabric. Fat mushroomed around her far too tight red belt, which cruelly pinched the invulnerable blonde until Selina's nimble fingers undid the clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ohhh thank Rao,' the sweaty super moaned, 'man, that'll teach me to try and deliver this after second breakfast.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Second, it's only six forty five...never mind. Where's the package?' she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hold on,' Karen muttered, beginning to dig around through her boob window with one hand, 'its in here somewhere.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You put it in your boobs?' Selina asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where'd you store stuff when you were stealing?' Power Girl returned, finally hauling a small packet of sugar from the mushroom hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In my pockets,' Cat woman told her, looking at the slightly damp packet, 'so what's the instructions on this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its a crystallized retro virus. Just dump it in her drink and in a few hours she'll have a cold. Anyone she comes in contact with, or came into a person who came in contact with her, will contract a retro virus that'll rewrite their minds to like fat girls and if they're a woman, want to get fat. As well as boosting their appetites, lowering their metabolism etc,' PG explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh, is it supposed to be sweaty?' Cat woman, who'd run three miles and was barely sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Probably not, but I didn't expect to get so out of shape,' the very plump, very sweaty blonde admitted with a pat on her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paragon of muscle looked like she needed a cold drink and a long rest. She was still breathing a bit fast and her sleeves were loose, as her mighty biceps had completely deflated under the influence of Ivy's food and hadn't yet been replaced with muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you still like this?' Selina asked her, 'Like, you wanted to look this way but you were so strong and fast and now you're...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Happy. Trust me, I've always wanted to be like this. Soft, decadent, lazy, relaxed, heck, hedonistic,' Karen smiled, 'being fat and out of shape is <i>amazing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hop she took off into the air, turning and letting see Selina see the heavy marshmallow cheeks hanging out of her outfit. Selina had already buckled on the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is crazy,' Selina muttered as she looked at the packet,'but at least I won't have to worry about eyes wandering after all this. My ass will be the smallest in town.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, she was at a dinn er half way between Metropolis and Gotham, setting her designer jean clad buns into a booth and looking through the menu, mostly fried egg, pork or carbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Selina!' Lois chirped and the slightly retired thief grinned as she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois Lane was one of those women who seemed to spit in the face of aging. Guessing she was thirty seven and a mom would have been difficult, she had a thirty year olds face and a 20 year old's figure. Only the faintest lines were around her big purple eyes and her black hair still sparkled, even put in a pony tail, while her white mini skirt showed off slim, fit legs that were a testament to skilled running. Her torso was a perfect hour glass, 34x23x34 and a skillfully chosen bra hid any sag in her Cs. Selina almost regretted ruining it, but given how hard she knew Lois worked to stay skinny it would be easier in the long run...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lois, oh its so great to see you!' Catwoman grinned back, easily rising and hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first  things turned to married life, discussing the stresses of a husband who dressed up in a suit to punch people, even though Lois' was bullet proof and of having kids who did the same. Selina had found herself step-mom to a brood of adopted children, ranging from 13 to 25, all of whom were dedicated crime fighters of one stripe or another ranging from Bruce's biological son Damien, a stubborn, over weening ass with a heart of gold, to Cassandra Cain, a mute super fighter who'd always made Selina uneasy, to Nightwing who seemed waaaayyy to old and waaaayyyy too hot to technically be her step son. Lois was struggling to reach Clark's adopted cousin, a fellow survivor of Krypton who wasn't adapting easily to earth life yet. Gradually, the two fell into conversation, focusing mostly on Lois' journalistic work as the prize winner was going through an important story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Talking about work makes me feel weird, being part of the idle rich now,' Selina admitted as Lois finished off her coffee and asked for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina had had a whole pot ready and knew the snoop would soon have to use the powder room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't look like your laying around,' Lois told her, eyebrow at Selina's prima ballerina physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I climb a few walls every once in a while, but mostly I'm just bored. Before long I'll be one of those society lushes with a big gut, I'm already getting rusty,' she said, handing back Lois' watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I doubt it, seriously though you look great,' Lois said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, takes one to know one. You look twenty,' Selina told her, 'what's your secret?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I've gotta admit this isn't all me. Since Jon started joining his dad crime fighting I've been stress eating some and started growing the hips Lane women traditionally get pining for their husbands to come back from war. I'd started wearing spanx to stay in single digit sizes, until...,' Lois grinned conspiratorially, pulling a small box of cookies out of her purse, marked with a red A, 'these things. They taste amazing and they super charge your metabolism to the point you can eat anything else you want and still lose weight as long as you have a pack a day, I've lost almost twenty pounds since I started eating them and haven't had to change any thing else. I feel twenty years younger and I haven't been this skinny since college! And my sex life...its never been better, I'm horny as a teenager anymore.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, I'll keep their name in mind,' Selina promised, making sure she'd never, ever eat any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy had said that there was less than a week until they switched the formulas out for the full fat, hyper addictive, laziness inducing variety. In a few days Lois' metabolism would slow to a crawl, she'd be constantly hungry and lethargic. Strangely enough it made Selina feel better about it, at least now Lois would enjoy it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pardon me, I've gotta go powder my nose,' the coffee addict said, getting up and letting Selina see her hard, firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina knew women in her family tended towards heavy asses as they got older and her own butt, even at maximum tone, was always on the large size. She was a little jealous of how trim Lois looked, even if it was temporary. She pulled the fake sugar out of her purse and paused, feeling a tickle on her nose that made the stealthy cat burgler sniffle, blink and then give a cute kitty sneeze into her elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, getting sick was the last thing she needed, then sneezed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Selina got the fake sugar mixed in before Lane returned. The reporter looked extremely thin, maybe too thin on further reflection. Women were supposed to pad out as they got older, not cling to being skinny. Lois could do with a burger or four...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food had arrived and the two talked over a long, well fed brunch. Eggs, an omelet, toast, bacon, sausage, waffles and french toast went down each of the gorgeous brunette's mouths. Lois was always hungry thanks to the diet food and thanks to it she never worried about her weight anymore. Selina was feeling herself get congested, while her forehead burned with a low fever. She sneezed several times into her arm, the fits growing worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You okay?' Lois asked her with concern in her purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, think its just a cold. Ugh, should probably get home,' the bleary eyed thief said nasally, 'we should do this again soon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Totally,' Lois smiled and the two parted ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like shit, Selina went to Wayne Manor, bathed and passed out, by accident sneezing on several door knobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling refreshed, Lois went to pick up her new adopted daughter from school. As her car pulled up, she sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'ACHOO!' Lois sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, hope I'm not catching what ever gotham crud Selina had,' Lois prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Selina had had red eyes and an immensely bloated belly, stylish red belt unclipped as she'd left. Maybe the other brunette wouldn't be pulling off any heists anymore, Lois thought, if she keeps eating like that that catsuit is gonna bust.  Sneezing again, she pulled a tissue out of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tissues in her purse. Along with painkillers and bandaids and spare head phones. God when had she become such a mom? Well she knew that answer: March 3rd, 11 years ago, the first time they'd had sex after Clark had admitted the secret identity she was 99% sure of and decided that condoms weren't needed given being different species. Somehow they'd made it work, despite her mortification at being a hurried bride like every girl on the army bases she'd grown up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blonde alien walked to the car, posture slumped and head wrapped in immense head phones, Lois felt a little pang of hunger despite her heavy meal, one that had left Selina looking ready to birth a litter. Her own had already digested and she was a little concerned at just how fast her metabolism was getting. The twenty pounds she'd gained since thirty had all been evaporated off, now that her target of her high school size 2 was attainable. She had a washboard stomach and a thigh gap again, maybe it was time to slow down, skip a few workouts and have a few beers after work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can I quit?' Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We talked about this Kara, not until after the season ends,' Lois sighed, munching on a diet cookie to calm her stomach and sniffling, 'you made a committment to your team.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't make it wantingly,' the blonde girl huffed, scrambling the English again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark's cousin had arrived on earth at the start of the summer and despite already having a kid, Lois and Clark had done the right thing and adopted her on the spot. With league help she'd had a fake identity set up and been enrolled in a magnet high school for exceptional students, where most teen heroes were being steered. On paper things should be easy street but Kara was proving....unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...you wanted to do something to make friends and you still quite aren't able to control your powers enough for sports,' Lois reminded, 'maybe in a few months...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its just standing around, cheering leads!' the alien said in her new language, 'and the learning, its like small childrens learning!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We know you already know it Kara, this is all about socializing,' Lois went on, pulling onto the high way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara crossed her arms, looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eighteen year old Kryptonian had arrived fresh from Krypton's destruction and was still understandably upset about it. Lois had to remind herself that earth was strange and primitive to her niece, everything was like the stone age for her, but the Kryptonian was...much more alien than Clark. She might have the rail thin, little above short body of the girl next door, but Kara was from a very long way away, in a world where most of the inhabitants only met in small groups amid glittering crystals and wore hermetical body suits. Regular clothes were annoying to her, evidence by how her size zeros had been worn backwards for a two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois sneezed while she thought, feeling congestion build in her sinuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you sick?' Kara asked in disgust, germs having not been a thing on Krypton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just a cold, don't worry you can't catch it,' Lois told her, '...I think. How's the powers today?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here and there,' Kara admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supergirl had made her public debut without permission, kicking the shit out of a rogue government robot in a display of glorious ultra violence. However her solar based powers were still coming in at fits and spurts. It'd taken two weeks for her to start demonstrating super human abilities and even now they vacillated between 'strong for a string bean' to 'lift a 777' Whenever she grabbed something Kara didn't know how strong the hand that picked it up was, hence Lois driving after Kara had put her foot all the way through the floor at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I know its tough but you can...ugh...,' Lois sneezed again, feeling hungry and put a hand to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, was her belly really that flat? Maybe she should ease back on the diet, this wasn't healthy to be so skinny. What example was she setting for Kara? This was a sensitive time in her life and Lois was fretting about her own weight! What if she gave the girl an eating disorder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA signal flashed and the car was suddenly at the back of a long line at a fast food chain, Lois' purple eyes peering over the display hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why are we stopping? Bad for us you said it was when Jon asked,' Kara asked, looking past her, 'made you... fat?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kara, a little weight is a good thing,' Lois said sagely, then sneezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnluckily for Kara, her super reflexes weren't on that afternoon and a little spray landed on her nose. Ivy had engineered the retrovirus to work especially on Kryptonians and the busy little microbes were already going to work, invulnerability or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A good thing?' Kara asked, unconvinced for it seemed every girl in her school was on a diet, most of them munching on those red cookies her adopted mother ate religiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found it baffling, it was easy for her to balance her diet out with her Kryptonian science academy training. Could humans not count calories? Even without a super metabolism Kara wouldn't have gotten fat easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, a little bit of roundness is good,' Lois told her as the car inched forwards, 'honestly I was at my best a few months into my pregnancy. I was all soft and round and sensitive...but that's neither here nor there.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ace reporter was feeling worse and worse, but also hungrier and hungrier. Ignoring Kara's mortified expression, she ordered an immense array of disgusting junk and topped it off with two heavy milk shakes with extra whip cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not hungry,' Kara denied, electric blue eyes wide as the figure conscious reporter tore into her first triple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least take this, you'll thank me later,' Lois insisted, forcing the whip cream heavy shake into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara found her super strength unfortunately absent and couldn't deny the taller woman, still she pouted, 'I don't like ice cream, its cow sweat...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its not real ice cream anyway, its made from eggs or something. I did a story about it a while ago,' Lois told her, burger tasting better every minute, 'Oh wow, they changed the sauce on these...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara frowned and the skinny blonde took a sip, nose wrinkling in disgust. But it was interesting enough she tried another and found it tasted better. The next one was amazing and soon Kara was sucking in just air, the whole shake gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can...can I try a burger?' Kara asked, not even noticing her sniffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Try five,' Lois insisted with a ketchup stained grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached home, both women were feeling like shit and divine simultaneously. Nose and food baby stuffed. Kara's size zeroes were unbuttoned, 20 inch waist bulging out an extra half foot of turgid, groaning mass, while Lois' skirt was unzipped down to the hip and still snug. The virus had lowered her metabolism down to normal and she groaned at the unaccustomed consequence of over eating after a month of eating whatever she wanted without bloating or weight gain. Still, despite the discomfort and stuffy noses each wore a secret smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That might have been my favorite thing about earth,' Kara smiled, patting her stomach, 'although some people might not like seeing me like this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Forget them, a real men like a woman with curves. I can promise you that,' Lois grinned, thinking of some plans tonight a mere cold couldn't hope to derail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later that night, after a late dinner of oven baked pizza and garlic bread and soda and some more garlic bread, Kara snoozed the sleep of the dead, her first cold wiping her out. She didn't hear her cousin sweep back in, rubbing his jaw after a hard fight over the south china sea. Clark hovered silently upstairs so as not to wake anyone, only to hear the bed room door close behind him. The superman, 6'4 of sculpted muscle and pure 100% goodness turned to see his wife standing gorgeous and proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois' nose might have been a little bit red, but even super senses wouldn't notice that past what Lois was wearing. The city slicker reporter had finagled her way into a pair of size 2 cut offs confiscated from Kara, the ultra short shorts just barely fitting over her hips and fully unbuttoned, no x-ray vision needed to show she wasn't wearing underwear. A plaid shirt had been turned into a tube top, showing firm cleavage and a strangely swollen belly, while Lois' long hair had been worked into pig tails. The stylish reporter looked very much a young hay seed just starting to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey city slicker, you said you couldn't knock me up,' Lois cooed in a bad rural accent, 'but I'm two months late and getting fat! You dun knocked me up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark blinked at the role play, able to hear Lois' heart thunder with anticipation, 'Oh ma'am, let me make that good to you...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour of hot, sweaty groaning later and Clark was fast asleep. Lois smiled at herself, pregnant drop out hit every one of her kinks, and slid out of bed into a robe to pad down and find a midnight snack. She frowned to find the ice cream and half her frozen snickers gone, grabbing the two that were left. On the stairs she bumped into Kara, hovering down with an empty bowl and looking sheepishly stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know what this means?' Lois asked, grabbing the chocolate sauce and taking a long chug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh?' Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That you're healthy enough to get into some sweats and buy us some more ice cream,' Lois grinned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At eight in the morning, Lois Lane was back flat on her bed with her hips in the air, zipping her skirt up past her hips and sucking in her stomach mightily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a position familiar to any woman who found herself eating too much and jogging too little, and Lois had certainly been fitting that description. Her tennis shoes were only used to take out the garbage anymore and her running shorts worn only for comfort. What was different was Lois face wore a look of triumph as the skirt felt tight and a look of disappointment when the size six zipper slid closed, followed by the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn, it still fits,' Lois glowered, noticing Clark staring at her from the hall again and smiled, 'for now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its friday, give it the weekend,' the archtype hero grinned, eyes running up his curvy wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks off the diet food had reversed Lois weight loss, ridding Lois of her boniness as she her loose on Monday size fours became well fitted on Tuesday, tight on Wednesday morning, painted on on Thursday and unbuttonable by Friday. A weekend spent in leggings and shorts, eating heavily, had seen her size sixes pulled back out of the closet and the process repeated, until now only her loosest fitting pair could be hauled up her hips. Her size eights were prepped and ready to go, while size tens were already in the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its a shame though, I was hoping it wouldn't fit. Give me an excuse to show off in front of you,' Lois grinned, like a teenager instead of a woman in her late thirties as she looked over her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDitching that diet was the best idea she'd ever had. She didn't have so much annoying energy to burn off, and her horniness was through the roof along with her appetite. Food tasted better and sex felt better, ideas for positions and role play she'd never before thought of coming into her head and she was sending sexts when she should be working. It was like a two week ovulation cycle on turbo mode and it was dollars to doughnuts she was already knocked up considering she'd ditched the pill and had sex to completion fourteen times in the last week. Lois hadn't really wanted kids before their happy accident and not long ago the thought having to grow a big pregnant gut and lose it would be a nightmare, but now she was looking forwards to it. Except the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't need an excuse,' Clark smiled back, eyes drinking her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois face had filled out a little, cheeks looking healthy. Her hips had a seductive wiggle to them at all times and her chest had puffed up and firmed up, bra needing an upgrade to a D. She had a little venus mound pushing at the front of the snug skirt and her crossed legs were more soft than muscle now. If Clark had any thought worry about Lois putting all her weight back on just as fast, he didn't know it. The extra curves were just what he wanted, after all he'd always liked Lois' fierce drive more than her frankly too skinny body. 36 X 26 X 37 suited her better than her old measurements by far. He could barely keep his hands off her anymore, she was way better at this weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pretty sure at least. He got odd sensations this was wrong on occasion but mostly was enjoying his wife's new attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, if we did...how about we see if we can feed me out of this skirt,' Lois smiled, tapping the tight button with one purple painted nail, 'kids flew off to school, you can fly me into work in plenty of time...so, how about it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easier than expected. Well, given how the Kent-Lane freezer was full of ice cream and Clark had heat vision it was easy. Spoonful after spoonful was sucked down, half hot/half cold slurry bloating out Lois faster and faster as she ate and ate. One tub in the trash can, two and three and four...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'More,' Lane groaned, mouth a mess, top a mess, gut stuck out well past her breasts and button hanging on by a thread, 'I'm almost there...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're out of ice cream,' Clark told her, 'and the stores don't open yet.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Use the chocolate sauce,' the horribly stuffed Lois demanded, 'do I have to do all the thinking Smallville?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was shoved into her mouth, a funnel? For a minute Lois was horrified at the indignity but then the chocolate sauce hit her tongue and her mind shut the fuck up and left things alone. By 8:45 they were finished with the skirt, the button having popped off half way through the chocolate sauce, and Lois was just plain finished. Purple eyes were painfully crossed and her torn, stained clothes were thrown on the floor as she licked her lips, sweat coating her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Holy shit...,' Lois groaned, trying to sit up and failing, 'holy shit...can you get me some anti-acid?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure, oh dang,' the never swearing superman noticed the time, 'I've got to get to work...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blur Clark was suddenly dressed and clean in his 'disguise' which Lois still berated herself for not seeing through always. It would clearly take a lot, lot longer for the better reporter to get up and ready...after she managed to get awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tell Perry I'm sick,' Lois grunted, 'I've got three months of off time saved up before any other leave...and I think I'm gonna need it if sex keeps feeling this good.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick kiss on the lips and Clark was gone, letting Lois sip some stomach soother and snooze, wrapped around her belly. A bit before noon the stunning, super curvy woman managed to get up, drowsily shower and eat a big, big bowl of sugary cereal. It was a beautiful fall day outside, perhaps the last of the high 70s they'd see and it struck Lois that she was a bit more alabaster than she'd prefer. Should she go tanning? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, why not?' she asked, yawning and rubbing her still slightly swollen belly, 'not like I have the energy for anything else after all.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois found to her dismay that she didn't have a bikini at hand. She was a reporter not a beach goer after all, she hadn't taken a day off in <i>years</i>, not even a sick day, having gone in every day during her last round of sniffles. Nor was she going to lay out in her somewhat snug undies either, she might like the knocked up white trash role play but she had class. Snooping around found the daisy dukes used in that role play...which got stuck at mid thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God, was I really so damn scrawny I could fit into these?' the hour glass woman giggled, sliding the doll clothes off her much healthier legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of size six blue jeans were soon found though and guessing she'd never wear them again, Lois cut them so short the pockets hung all the way out and shimmied them on. Occasional tugs got them up her thighs and over her hips, but they were tighter than the size twos had been two weeks earlier and barely hid that Lane wasn't wearing underwear, held up by the fight between wider hips and slightly dipping, heavily swollen gut..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Looking sexy as hell,' she giggled at herself, feeling happy as a clam when she stepped on the scale and found it reading 144lbs, one up on her pre diet although most of that was bloat, 'I was nuts thinking I should get back to my high school weight. Can't wait to see what its going to be when I'm full term.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of herself with a big, 9 month gut was so sexy that she moaned. Shrugging tender breasts into a now very snug sports bra, not trashy if its shorts and a sports bra right?, she hurried down stairs to the now well laden fridge. She and Kara were growing girls after all and the extra food was worth the money she knew and the two cleaned out anything as soon as it was put down. Lois grabbed a couple bags of chips as snacks and a six pack of soda (she left the beer for Kara) as a drink before she headed outside, slid on her shades and plopped down onto a lawn couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her stomach was topped off, the busy body snoop was soon fast asleep. Snoring faintly in the warm, delightful, <i>yellow</i> fall sun. If anyone had been watching, and seen beyond the shapely soft legs, curvy hips, pert boobs and very round stomach of the Pulitzer prize winning MILF, they'd have noticed that her skin sparkled as it drank up the rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that Lois was floating an inch off the chair...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clark was asymptomatic but his every breath still spread it through the satellite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was a brilliant botanist but viruses were a different matter and her work had sloppy. Immuno response just within humans could vary, to say nought of different species or magicians. Ivy and humanity were extremely fortunate that, save for one case currently snoring despite far too tight short shorts pinching her womanly hips, nothing too extreme happened to the infected. But responses did differ person to person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of those struck with the fat fetish plague was currently flying over D.C., pursuing a fleeing group of bank robbers. Princess Diana or Wonder Woman shot up a street of apartment buildings, the inhabitants marvelling at the feminine blur hurrying a little erratically after a roaring pair of cars. Normally the Amazon princess would have caught mere heavily armed thugs in seconds but today she was fighting a much, much more dangerous foe: herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018By Bacchus! They\u2019ve got fritters!\u2019 a voice shouted in Diana\u2019s perfect ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No! Fritters are for the weak and lazy!\u2019 another voice roared in the other ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Come on, she\u2019s skin and bones! How can she be the both beautiful woman in the world without some real hips!\u2019 the first voice countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Shut up, shut up, shut up!\u2019 Diana muttered under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon, 6\u20192 inches of long legged athleticism that made gold medal olympic sprinters seem couch potatoes, blended with E cup, hour glass curves that made 50s pinups seem board flat and a face that made supermodels look like lepers. Diana\u2019s gorgeousness defied belief, people found it difficult to actually look at her for long, the too symmetrical face, too bright eyes, too soft lips, too white teeth, too long legs, too drastic a hip/waist/bust ratio, too firm a muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hey a pizza place, order now and we can have ten pies by the time these crooks are booked!\u2019 the first voice insisted, taking the form of a ghostly pink woman in a short dress that showed of chubby arms, plump legs, big round hips and a pot belly past her small breasts, sitting on Diana\u2019s broad left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Pizza will give her a flabby ass that couldn\u2019t squat a single container ship!\u2019 the second voice yelled, another ghost woman, but blue, in ancient greek armor, an athletically stacked doppleganger of Diana herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Stop distracting me!\u2019 Diana snarled, zipping forwards to pull a small child out of the path of the cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting the child down safely on the side walk, the Amazon paused for a moment as she say an ice cream truck drive past on the other side of a park. Perfect lips hung open and drool poured down her flawless jaw line as the temptation surged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Go get some!\u2019 the plump spirit insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Resist, you\u2019re an Amazon!\u2019 the fit spirit ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bullet broke the impasse, leaving a cut across Diana\u2019s bicep. Her fist snaked out and grabbed it before it could hit anyone else, throwing the flattened round aside and jumping at the fleeing robbers, her arguing spirits following after her. 170lbs of fit Amazon landed on the hood of the second car, unbuckled driver and machine gun toting passenger shooting up through the wind shield. Diana caught both by the collar, gave them a quick smack together and dropped them for the onrushing police to cuff before jumping after the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt swerved off road, smashing into a bollard and the thugs ran into the building as Diana was distracted by a mental argument over whether to go after the ice cream truck and eat everything in it. She shook off the shouts to see the robbers disappear through a door...and into a pie shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Pies! Cherry and lemon meringue and peach and strawberry and black berry,\u2019 the plump ghost listed off, \u2018order three of each and get nice and tubby! Pad over those muscles and get that soft, sensual look!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Resist! Think of your breath catching in your lungs, of your armor refusing to buckle around your gut, your muscles too weak to save anyone!\u2019 the fit ghost demanded, \u2018all because you were too weak Diana!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman\u2019s existence was complicated. Daughter of the mythical Amazon Queen, she\u2019d been raised to be a warrior but had been granted boons by the Olympian gods. One of these was the wisdom of Athena, personified by the glorious little warrior on her right shoulder that kept rightly pointed out why the demi-goddess had to stay strong, fast and fit and hadn\u2019t been influenced by Ivy\u2019s virus. And another was the beauty of Aphrodite, which had been so infected by the botanist\u2019s plague that it had morphed from lean to succulent plump as Diana's new fat fetish grew in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demand to nibble, snack, indulge, gorge, glut and above all eat had been rising faster and faster in the Amazon\u2019s mind, matched by louder and louder demands to stay lean and fit. So far Diana\u2019s will power was holding firm but at horrible cost. She didn\u2019t trust herself to sleep, her blue eyes were red veined, nor to eat, her chiseled abs rumbled with hunger, and she\u2019d begun hallucinating on this, the 14th day resisting the infection's urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one would ever break that record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've got to save those people...,' the princess mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you go into that shop you'll get fat!' the daimon of Athena promised, trying to haul at Diana's mental reins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you don't they'll die!' the daimon of Aphrodite assured, 'and you won't get any yummy pie!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Got to save them...can't get fat...,' Diana murmured, stomach rumbling in hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the three thugs were tying up the baker and his assistant when suddenly the door was thrown open. Diana's magical lasso shot thrice into the room, whipping round the robbers and hauling them out without her having to set foot in the temple of chub. The slightly unhinged super heroine breathed a sigh of relief and gave her statement to the police, retrieving her lasso and ready to fly off when a voice stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you Wonder Woman!' a syrupy sweet voice yelled, the baker's daughter hurrying out with a steaming fresh strawberry rhubarb pie, Diana's personal favorite, 'please, take this for saving us!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana's eyes twitched and her smile was first kind and then frantic, 'Whyyy...thank you, so very much...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips, ignoring the spirit of Athena demanding she throw it away and hearing the siren song of Aphrodite's spirit tell her to chow it down and start filling out to her proper weight in the upper 200s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll...come back for more later,' she heard her self say and shot off into the sky, cooling pie steaming as the earth fell away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't eat it!' Athena's spirit yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eat it!' Aphrodite insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I won't eat it...,' Diana promised and then realized that the pie tin was empty, her lips tasted of rhubarb and strawberry and her tight fitted armor was just slightly snug, 'I ate it...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It'll go right to your thighs!' the angry spirit claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It'll go right to your thighs!' the happy spirit claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled, wanting more and she knew she couldn't resist it. Giving in once meant she'd have to give in again and again, finding excuses. Weight was going to be inevitable and so much of her wanted it even as so much of her feared it. She had to find something that would slow down her gain...some miracle food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anonymous!' Diana yelled in realization, remembering the diet cookies that a jubilant Black Canary had credited with letting her fit back into the leggings she'd debuted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sonic boom sounded and Diana was soon landing in front of a grocery store, startling shoppers as the towering, gorgeous woman pushed a cart through the main doors. Hard legs set a quick pace, the woman hurrying through the baked goods with her eyes set to the floor until she got to the diet section which was being restocked. Filling her cart the flawless warrior was soon in line, the slim young cashier amazed to see Diana's spectacular bra at her eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess you gotta keep that perfect figure somehow?' the woman drooled, amazed at the foot of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something like that,' Diana said, pulling a credit card from her belt and ignoring the demanding shrieks from Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, those work great. I've lost fifty pounds on them!' the skinny woman bragged confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great for you,' Diana said, picking up her receipt and bags and flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk watched the fantastic ass and bit into a cookie of her own, finding that this new and improved formula tasted even better. Meanwhile Diana was already back at her house, kicking off her boots and throwing off her armor. Clad in just panties and tiara, the beauty's muscular arms began shoveling cookie after cookie into her mouth as if performing a grappling drill. In half an hour the Amazon had eaten half the pile and her eight pack abs had the tiniest little bump at the waist, insane muscles holding in an otherwise colossal food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPure joy on her face, Diana collapsed into slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe tomorrow she'd stop by that pie shop. After all, with this diet food she could eat whatever she wanted and not get fat? Have her cake and eat it too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank Hera...,' Diana groaned, voices quiet and slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles, imperceptibly, became less defined as she digested, Ivy's new edition and fully fattening cookies going to work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lois Lane was already late. Once getting up at five on the dot for a morning run and getting the kids ready before driving in at 7:30 to arrive by 8:30, Lois yawned at 7:00 and hit the snooze until 7:30 before taking a thirty minute shower. Kara, quite the home maker anymore, had left her a big stack of butter infused, syrup drowned pancakes that Lois ate with actual speed before fighting herself into the last size eight skirt she could hope to fit: her old, line in the sand you need to hit the jogging track now fat skirt. It was with slight disappointment she got the zipper done and the button closed, the stretchy fabric doing more than its part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten use to Clark zipping her to work, she didn't leave until 8:40, taking immense care in her outfit of the day to show off her 154lb body, up thirty pounds.She did her best to ensure a pound a day average by stopping at a starbucks at 9:12, ordering a mostly cream cappucino and two of the most sugar and calorie heavy fritters they had. The dazzling reporter got out of her car with a small grunt of effort and a sigh of fabric and walked right past the stairs and too the elevator, finishing the second fritter in the elevator while she leaned her 39.5 inch hips on the hand rail and walking out at 9:29 am, half an hour late. She'd driven 5 miles under the speed limit the whole time and grinned like an idiot still, because in addition to being late she was also <i>late.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois used to march through the office,  stylish heels clicking, complete business. Now her march was a sedate sashay, hips twitching and productivity falling. Lane had drawn attention from her youth, growing up into a slim, fit, leggy hour glass with purple eyes will do that and her gravely voice only accented it. But since her unknowing infection she'd begun drinking in the looks like they were lattes, helped by the fetish she'd helped infect everyone with. Most male and half the female eyes locked on the star reporter as she sashayed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois' change started at her ankles and calves, always strong from running and wearing high heels they'd started thickening up from the bottom, the smooth muscle rounding out with a cushion of chub and a tiny amount of swelling, lent definition by the heels she was wearing. Her narrow runners thighs were bulking out, getting delectably soft and full, widening out and starting to brush each other at the top, her proud thigh gap all but filled in. Tights covered them, hiding the new stretchmarks unintentionally and stretched transparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExact and trim 34 inch hips had widened and rounded by a half a foots addition, making the seams of her skirt groan. Every step made them shake, a dance only Lois knew, and they were verging from round to 'childbearing' which suited her find. Lois only ever had an ass when she was above 140lbs, and her borderline badonkadonk was impossibly round, a soft double handful of flesh that had broadened and deepened without falling much although she was starting to pick up some cellulite. She really didn't mind it and was wandering when it would blow out her backseam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpfront was just as tight, Lois' venus mound had puffed out into a starter belly when empty, which it very wasn't. Pinchable FUPA made a little gap between button and zipper, spreading the zipper's cover too tight to close. Above it, Lane's proper belly was causing gaping in her white blouse around the waist, a soft, slightly tan puff most women would shoe into spanks, and when stuffed big enough her red suit jacket's buttons were strained. At 146, love handles had popped out over her skirts edge, and they'd earned their name twenty times since, earning carbs as a reward to now hang a full inch over Lois belt, out five notches as her waist had gone from 23 to 27.5 dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plopped down at her computer, adjusted her too tight waist and started typing sedately, purple nails and softer fingers going as easy as the rest of her instead of her old frantic pace. The drop caused a considerable bounce above her belly, one that made Lois adjust her self after a button uptop threatened to go. Lois had never been busty, a B most her life and had only gotten up to a C after a bit of pregnancy weight stayed. New weight changed that, the reporter suddenly counting herself among the busty and sporting a heavy DD edging into E. She needed to buy new bras but the packages had just arrived and they were expensive so she was trying to make them last despite having gone from 34C to 38E.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I don't even need a bra,' Lois mused, tugging at the cup, easy as she couldn't button the top three snaps of her white blouse around them, 'didn't think they'd get that perky.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the craziest thing, at 36 years old, Lois' new heavy cleavage was somehow higher and firmer than the B cups she'd had on the college track team. It made absolutely no sense, gaining that much weight so quick at her age should have been sag city but she'd never been firmer and the slight asymmetrical most women had had vanished, tits drawing even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting settled, Lois wrote some more and pulled out a bag of donettes. She popped the powdery treats into her mouth with her main hand and typed very slowly with her left. By noon the bag was empty and Lois was bloated enough her FUPA and upper belly were joined by one bulge, skirt button hanging on for its life and her suit jacket gaping. Her lips had a ring of powdered sugar on them, highlighting a fuller face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDulled cheek bones and a softer jaw looked good on Lois, making her seem ten years younger. Fine lines had vanished, her hair sparkled richly and despite not dying her roots that week the little dots of grey she'd been getting hadn't returned. She looked more like Lois Lane's well fed younger sister than the pullitzer winner herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved every new pound and every new inch, the changes making her horny as a school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food critic, a rotund woman named Sandra Lee, was retiring and the office threw her a party. Lois had never had much time for her but she had one hell of a big sheet cake, so the thick reporter ambled over and cut herself a brick after hitting print.  She sashayed to the printer, grabbed her work and headed to the editor's office munching greedily on more sugar. She knocked as she came in, action reverberating through her full boobs, and plopped down without waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe venerable editor gave her a once over, caring more about the thick bundle of papers and expression of relaxed mischief on her face than any curve, as he hung up his phone. Lois Lane had earned a 5th of the century old paper's pullitzers in just ten years and drew in adds and donations like nothing else save a superman story. But she had a nose for trouble age and mother hood hadn't dulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What now Lane?\" he asked as she tossed the thick stack of papers onto his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Another pullitzer and a constitutional crisis, Luthor is bribing a supreme court justice to back his latest court case,' Lane smiled, eating a towering forkful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's libel. You sure?' White asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Case is tighter than the button on this skirt,' she tapped her waist, the button pulling an inch away from the fabric by ever growing pressure, 'I want something for it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh God, are you going to cover another war? Clark's an easy guy but he'd kill me. Or Apokalips? Are you going to go there again?' White asked, feeling for an anti-acid in his desk that he'd never needed before Lois started working there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I want Lee's job,' Lois said, eating a forkful of icing, 'for at least a year with options for renewal.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The food critic? For you?\" White was floored, food critic was the easiest job in any paper, being little more than paid to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm in a family way,' Lois said, rubbing her stomach, 'or will be if I'm somehow not. Its time to stop and smell the cheesecake, take things easy for me. Is it mine?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pfft, sure,' White, one of the only people immune to Ivy's plague said, 'you do know that Lee...she used to be a twiggy little thing until she started that job, just filling in for someone who was sick...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I'll handle any weight gain just fine,' Lois grinned, new dimples showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis star reporter going to food critic might hit reader ship a blow and given how Lois had picked up years of middle aged spread in a month. Only her inflated boobs and refreshed face were a positive, but he'd hired Lois for her drive not her looks and if she wanted to be a food critic and get fat after three pulllitzers let her. There were plenty of skinny girls in the building, any office padding picked up having evaporated over the summer thanks to that new diet fad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was already changing of course, the rebounds just starting but largely unnoticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, well there's a new 5star steak house on 5th and Downs opening, I want a full review tomorrow,' he said as Lois walked out, butt almost knocking over his coat rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, Lois wasn't just wider. Used to be when she'd charge in she'd only come up to the fifth knob, but now her head was a few inches above it...must be new heels. No way a middle aged woman was getting taller...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the break room the crowd had cleared out, letting Lois have another shot at the cake. She carved off a brick and found the fork box was empty, unwilling to eat it with her hands in public, she went over to the cabinet and found she easily reached the top shelf. Unfortunately her wrist watch, a gift, clicked off and fell behind the fridge. Cursing and unwilling to ask for help, Lois put a hand on it to start nudging the heavy machine forwards, but it tipped to the front with the slightest push. Mouth widening in shock, Lois unthinkingly reached out her free hand to grab the five hundred pound appliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd easily caught it, holding it steady, although her sleeve ripped as her bicep flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay...I'll admit I didn't expect that to break,' she admitted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'What the hell is wrong with me?' Lois asked herself in the privacy of the family restroom at the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing looked wrong at all to Lois' exacting eyes. Everything looked better than ever actually. Her hips were round and curvy, growing into the proper childbearing thickness they should have. Her belly had a more than decent bulge pressing comfortably tight against her skirt, a preview of what would come. Her suddenly huge boobs were pressed tight in her bra but had a girlish good health to their bouncy bulk. Her long black hair seemed to sparkle with vibrant color and her skin had a healthy glow, looking both younger and tanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois stripped off her jacket, seeing the tear had gone all the way through her blouse sleeve. Drawn by curiosity the snoop took her clothes off, looking at herself in the mirror in just her lilac underwear. Skinny college runner Lois Lane was long gone, replaced with soft, sensual MILF Lois. Out of her heels everything was soft and thick, her legs chubby and underused now that she'd stopped her daily runs. Well earned stretch marks on her soft hips, thick and pliable, and her extra soft butt pressed tight on the girlish thong she wore. She gave it a slap and it proved harder than expected, having picked up a good deal of tone somehow despite her exercise equipment resting under dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Must be all the screwing,' the reporter guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not so little love handles hung over the sides of her purple panties and she gave them a soft squeeze to reassure herself everything was fine before going onto her belly proper. The food and bloat made it round, although its skin was plushly soft. Right now her hips were still wider but as the months went on Lois knew her gut would accelerate its growth. She couldn't wait to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up, she noticed her bra was fraying against her breasts. Lane's now immense rack seemed to be continuously growing and the once enormous seeming DD cup bra was dwarfed by what sat within it. Each breasts was more pert than it'd been when she was a twenty year old, without seeming swollen. She was at a loss to explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to explain how...beefy her arms were. Lois had never been muscular up top even before her hand weight rack became a coat rack. Getting thick had made her biceps surprisingly large and not like the floppy arms of a lunch lady either, they looked...vaguely strong. She flexed and they actually moved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same result came from her thighs, which while thick and soft had some tone under the blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is so bizarre,' Lois said, shocked by how strange the muscle slumbering beneath her pudge felt to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sort of firmness that wasn't a full stomach was alien to her now. What was she doing wrong? Clark liked her like this, yet she was getting muscly? Was she moving too much? Not eating enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You need to get back in shape Lane,' she told her youthful reflection, 'drop the walking and really dig into the eating if you want to stay thick. Otherwise you might wind up...skinny.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing she was becoming a food critic. Just thinking about all of the 5 star cuisine she'd soon be sucking down made her mouth water and her full belly growl. Best be off to that steak house....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly got dressed, buttoning up her damaged blouse and then going to put on her skirt. As expected it was very tight on her hips and belly, perhaps it would be best to drive home and get a looser replacement if she was going to go full five star for lunch. Lois fought with the button a moment until a loud rip sounded, she looked around to see she'd ripped the offending garment in half down the back with a slight tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, I've got to do something about this,' Lois sighed, tying her jacket around her back to hide how her ass was showing and then stepping into her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe increasingly tan reporter found them a tight fit, not that strange. She supposed her feet would get fatter too, but it seemed to be a length issue. Once the pumps were on she went to look back in the mirror and found her forehead cut off by the mirror. Which was very odd, Lois was 5'7 and no where near that tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh, did they move the mirror?' the snoop asked, only to realize that everything looked shorter, 'Or am I getting taller?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing huge boobs was one thing. Getting super strength it appeared was another. But getting taller?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, I need to talk to Clark,' she decided, taking out her phone only to find that she got the signal that meant 'urgent league, world saving business'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damnit,' she muttered, 'well one Kryptonian is as good as another, right?' she said, calling Kara's phone number.</span></div></div>",

Kara asked, squirming with anxiety against her seat belt, which made the by now chubby sprawl of her lower belly press into the stiff belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course we should be here, its Gotham. Crime central, and we're crime fighters,' Cassie grunted over the growl of her own stomach, 'here, have my fries. I'm not hungry. And my soda.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl might have said that her friend hadn't even finished her salad from the fast food restaraunt but salty fries and sweet soda were nothing to sniff at. Even after she'd had a hamburger the size of her head, a heap of fried potato straws the size of her now considerable left boob and enough sugary corn syrup to make someone without a Kryptonian stomach sick. The long car drive had made her very hungry and as Lois, said she was a growing girl after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutwards and to the sides that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara had gone from size zero lean to full on chubster since her infection. Her breasts now fully filled her B cup, but most of her growth was in her thighs, hips and lower stomach as she went from stick to lush pear in record time. Her cheer skirt was drawn see through tight around her dumpy saddle bags and cheese cake thighs, while her food swollen gut pushed half a tan roll between her cheer skirt and cheer sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shouldn't we be in our super outfits then...and flying in instead of being in your car?' Supergirl asked her captain again through her new fries, 'and why are we at a school?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're...under cover. Remember that,' Cassie said, 'this school is a hot bed of crime...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Supergirl it didn't look very crime ridden. It just seemed like a normal upper class college: brick buildings, marble columns, lots of ivy, with nothing out of the ordinary to her virus altered mind. Mostly fit athletic young men and entirely plush, lazy looking young women, with cankles stretching their plaid uniform socks, chubby thighs with cellulite dimples on full display, the hint of newly sagging butts hanging from their underwear, zippers that wouldn't go up and buttons fastened with rubber bands and paper clips against the pressure of wobbling new muffin tops, heavy boobs mushrooming out of their bras and facial features disappearing beneath a rising tide of roundness. Watching the class leave and there wasn't a single 19 year old who could be described as any thing smaller than plump, each having gained at least forty pounds since being infected by either Tim Drake or Stephanie Brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It doesn't look like that, it looks normal,' Kara burped, 'are you sure this is a hot bed for crime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, they're all...mafia members,\" Cassie said, \"now, I need you to use your heat vision to find this one particular girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie reached over, the slightest bulge of a starter belly hanging out of her own overloaded skirt to elicit a growl of rage from her. The badass jock had been infected with Ivy's fat virus like the rest of her school but her half-Olympian nature had further mutated the unstable pathogen. While Cassie's metabolism was slowing down and her appetite rising, which had resulted in the five pounds over her once hard four pack, the blonde part Amazon wasn't oblivious to it like everyone else infected. She was aware of it, she hated it and she needed to make everyone else way fatter than her before someone pointed out that she was looking a little soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she a criminal?\" the rookie heroine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, the very worst of the worst,\" Wonder Girl smiled, \"and once you find her, I'll need you to...grab her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you grab her? You're almost as strong,\" super girl questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...she's got anti-Amazon weapons on her, we can't risk it,\" Cassie lied, sucking in her stomach so it wouldn't ride over her belt and handing Kara a picture, 'here we go, you're looking for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a picture taken by a rookie photographer during Gotham's little alien invasion a week before, of the climatic battle against the horny/drunk Maxima (who was currently nursing a super hangover and sporting a new paunch on her own planet. But it was focused not on her but against the much smaller shape of Batgirl standing alone against the alien invader on top of a truck, looking determined, brave and very, very fit without an ounce of fat on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Cassie, I don't know how to find this person. I can't X-ray through her mask on the picture,\" Kara explained, \"she could be anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone that's...a girl,\" Cassie said, almost saying skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to say skinny. Because it implied that she wasn't skinny anymore. And it might make blubbery Kara realize what a wide load she'd become. A sexy, buttery, wobbly wide load about to pop that skirt button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do girls love?\" Cassie went on, hoping the naive alien wouldn't say something about Krypton and start crying, \"their boyfriends. So we kidnap Batgirl's boyfriend and he comes right to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't seem very heroic. Kidnapping someone to lure out a superhero,\" Kara began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its for a test, Kara. If Batgirl is really heroic, she'll come stop us in time and then we invite her to the Teen Titans,\" Cassie lied again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real plan was almost simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone of the infected, Cassie had guessed where it had come from. The rail thin weirdo cousin of her boyfriend had suddenly come in one day stuffed to the gills and constantly eating, with every other girl in school from M'gann to Raven starting to over eat? Easy to figure out that it had been something contagious from Kara. And easy to figure out now that she'd have to get the now porky Kryptonian to infect every super heroine they could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her heart of hearts, Cassie knew it was a batshit crazy plan. Judging by the 100% pork status of the female student body, anyone who went to Tim Drake's school was already overweight. But somehow Batgirl had avoided it and if Cassie was going to get fat, then so was everyone else, no exceptions. Even Diana was falling out of her armor anymore, the Amazon Princess' figure going full American. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow arrogant was one little Bat to think she could escape the epidemic that had claimed the daughter of Zeus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it'll be easy to find her,\" Kara observed, \"she's so under nourished. I just have to look around for the skinny girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, you fat dumb alien, just find the skinny bat bitch and infect her. Make her too fat and useless to remind Cassie just how chunky she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there she is,\" Kara pointed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a small thump on the hood of Wonder Girl's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around from the backseat with its load of junk food and rolly polly Super Girl to see her target staring down at her. Cassandra Sandsmark had, in her short couple of years as Wonder Girl, grown into a tough, confident young woman and although her steely abs were getting a layer of rust, she was still a dangerous fighter who could bend steel I beams with her bare hands and fly faster than a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still gulped at the Batgirl standing on her hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman on the other side of the windshield was so spectacularly ripped her six pack showed through her kevlar armor. Usually the Bat clan's uniforms looked ridiculous in the day time, but the blank black eye lenses and stitched shut mouth of the Batgirl's mask were unsettling. Wonder Girl nervously patted down her skirt, seething at the little bounce of her stomach as she did and flexing her arms to reassure herself that although she was losing some definition she was still plenty strong, Cassie did the smart thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there she is,\" she told Kara, \"Go get her Supergirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of them, when Kara's powers were working, the blondes had enough super strength to move the moon out of earth orbit and every bullet in every gunstore in Gotham would bounce off them. But neither of them were about to get out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, that you should go out there,\" Kara said, double chin quivering as she fear ate some KFC mashed potatoes and gravy, \"and talk her into joining the team, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silent Batgirl continued staring at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no remember the plan was for you to try and fight her and then I'd tell her she could join the team,\" Sandsmark insisted, \"so, go get her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would,\" Supergirl said, putting up the emptied mass potatoes and pulling out a box of potato wedges, \"but I'm kinda full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped her bulging belly, whose wobbling jello surface bounced, making another stitch in her cheer sweater go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna need to nap this off,\" Kara yawned, shifting her heavy bulk in the seat as her usually low energy levels moved towards a post second lunch nap, \"you should handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra Cain, Batgirl, was slightly confused. She'd been bored, having finished her training ahead of schedule and had gone on day time patrol to find some crime, only beating up a few drug carel dens and decided to spy on her team mates at college. Both to look at the life she couldn't have and to spy at the rather succulent female population. Gotham U had once lead the state in girl's athletics but now the only physical competition it could win was a pie eating contest. Big bellies wobbled and jiggled as their owners waddled along, chafing thighs and quivering butts testament to a freshman fifteen that had come earlier and four times more than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she'd seen something strange in Gotham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo people on a clear stake out, that were well fed college age blondes. The deliciously plump one in the backseat radiated a mix of grief and satiation as she gorged from a pile of junk food. A cheer leader uniform was disintegrating off her body, the size two clothes clearly unable to contain the size fourteen blubber pouring out of them. She was eating with a veracity that shocked even the fatty obsessed Batgirl. But the one in the drivers seat was thinner practically boiling with anger and envy over a core of ravenous hunger and desperately sucking in an only slightly puffy belly like she was ashamed of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat really confused Cass. Every woman she knew except for Starfire was fat, happy and getting fatter and happier. Stephanie might complain about getting slower and slower but she was flaunting her growing belly and surging boobs at every chance, while the recently retired Catwoman's clothes were shrinking with every added pound. And although the former assassin was loving all the growing fat around her, the partially immune girl was getting slightly concerned. Her solitary existence led to a lot of time to think and things were starting to add up in her head that shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire would eat like a piglet and complain about growing. Shouldn't she be happy about the growth like everyone else? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra herself felt no compunction to gain weight. She was proud of her skills and didn't want them to fade, she wanted to protect all of her new friends and family which she couldn't do if fat. But...everyone around her acted like she should be. Suggesting she eat more, suggesting she not train so hard...it was strange...they hadn't always acted that way. She'd realized that no other woman in Gotham seemed to still be thin and for all everyone seemed to love fat women now, that hadn't always been the case, had it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman seemed to love the ex-catwoman's ever inflating curves: her wobbling, globular thighs that smacked and rasped on each other, her door jamming hips, her sagging, near double belly, heavy breasts and doughy chin. But...when they'd fallen in love Selina had been a lean and fit super criminal. And Dick, while he loved feeding Starfire up, had been dating her as a rail thin model, not the chubby woman who's sagging breasts and expanding hips were pushing her towards the plus sized. Then there was Barbara, who Cass always remembered complaining about how hard it was to stay thin in her wheel chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl might not be able to speak more than a few sentences, but she was still a detective. And there were questions piling up that this blonde girl might be able to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" she said, pointing a black clad finger at the driver, who in surprise relaxed her stomach, miniscule paunch oozing out in the gap between skirt and sweater, \"why aren't you...fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the car, Cassie Sandsmark felt her blood start to boil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis crazy, weird costumed batgirl was asking her why she wasn't fatter? Which meant she was saying she was...<i>fat</i>. This skinny bitch was judging her! Did she know hard it was to find a good workout when you could lift a building?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...saying that I'm fat?\" Wonder Girl growled at the ultra ripped Batgirl, who's quivering abs seemed to be mocking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little?\" the other superheroine said, \"but why aren't you, fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandsmark's anger burst through her last restraints, the tiny insult to her softening figure setting her off. A tap of her fist sent her car door slamming into the side of the alley and she broke the seat belt into pieces as she stood up, fast enough her head dented the roof of the car. She was so pissed she didn't care what her aunt Diana would say about the loaned vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me fat, you stupid skinny bitch, I'll show you!\" the half olympian growled, floating off the ground, her slight pot belly bulging over her skirt, \"you don't even have any powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl set her feet, reading the rage off the metahuman's body and considering her options. Fighting Metahumans without careful preparations was dangerous but then again...this wasn't just a metahuman. This was a fat girl in the making who was ravenous with hunger. And dealing with that really was her super power....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Girl's shoulders tensed, giving Batgirl just enough warning to jump out of the way, dodging just in time for the slightly chubby blonde to crush her own car. In the back, the sleeping Super Girl burped, shoved a potato wedge in her mouth and fell asleep. That would be the key, Cain knew, get the girl trying to kill her eating and she'd be down for the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you who's fat!\" the enraged Wonder Girl yelled, whipping a lasso out that Batgirl barely dodged, its looped wrapped around a dumpster and cut it in half, \"I'll turn you into the big sack of fat you deserve being!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could stay alive long enough.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a straight fight, fist against fist, Batgirl knew she'd lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCain's amazing martial artistry wasn't worth much when her hardest hit would only break her own hand against Sandsmark's jaw. And unlike her big gutted Kryptonian friend already napping off her afternoon binge in the back seat, the demi-Goddess didn't have any exploitable weaknesses. All it would take was one hit for the Wonder Girl to put Batgirl out of the fight permanently...which was why Cain pulled a grapple gun out of her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch me then,\" Cain growled and shot away towards the nearest roof top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCain was running before she landed on the roof, mind finding a way to win. A punch wasn't going to do it and the enraged blonde couldn't be talked out of her anger by anyone. Fortunately, the little paunch hanging over Sandsmark's size four skirt band told Batgirl her enemy was already on the path to obesity. She was a fat girl who just didn't know it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thank to Catwoman's ravenous reaction to a negative review of one of her soirees in the Gotham Time's high society gossip section a month ago, Batgirl knew exactly what a fat girl needed to calm down. She just needed to find a way to survive the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna tie you to a chair, rip a mouth open on your suit and pump you full of heavy cream!\" Wonder Girl promised, shooting after the black clad bat in the air, her rage only going higher as she felt herself breathing heavier after such a short chase, the first hint that she was getting out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCain popped a tear gas grenade atop a high roof, jumping down towards the street far below. Sandsmark coughed and spluttered through the fog, losing track of her for a minute as she tried to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready on street level, Cain ducked inside a store, with one hand pulling a wad of hundreds from her utility belt and slamming it onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide,\" she ordered the clerk, glad the increasingly rolly polly girl students of Gotham U would be quite a while before they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the other, she pulled a smoke grenade and stuck her head outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandsmark was still floating in the air, drawing a few glances as she floated. The short cheer skirt Sandsmark was wearing really showed off how toneless her thighs were getting, enough to distract Batgirl for just a moment. It wasn't that she was unfaithful to her new girlfriend but a plumper thigh was a plumper thigh. Promising herself to keep her eyes on the prize, Batgirl made herself give an unaccustomed shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got cellulite!\" Cain kind of yelled and tossed the smoke grenade down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandsmark turned around in the air, more paunch oozing out over her waistband. Her breath, already going hard enough to make her bra creak, turned into a shriek of rage and she dived down at her infuriatingly thin target. She burst through the door in a flurry of glass, finding herself floating in the smoky interior of a frozen yogurt shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dumb bitch, you picked the perfect place to make a real fat ass out of you!\" Sandsmark wheezed, watery eyes and stinging lungs ruining her concentration, \"Hope you enjoyed walking in because you're never walking again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice Batgirl move silently behind her and pull the lasso off her belt until the golden rope was looped around Sandsmark's beefy arms. In a moment, Wonder Woman's niece was pulled to the ground by her own unbreakable rope, her super powers neutered. Batgirl expertly knotted the rope around her wrists as the blonde kept struggling...and made her think of trying out the same trick with Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you bitch. You won't stop me forever, I'm Wonder Girl, you can't just, ugh, tie me up,\" Sandsmark snapped, uselessly struggling against the now much stronger Cain, \"I'm way stronger than you and faster and this was just a fluke! This lasso doesn't even make people tell the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Batgirl said, dragging her towards the whirring tanks of soft serve, picking out one that looked like peanut butter cup ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what Selina had gorged on when angry over the gossip column. Cass, her fetishes barely awakening, had marveled at how the still thin Selina had downed bowl after bowl of the stuff, gorging until her clothes had ripped away and she'd been too ill to do anything but be dragged away by her amazed step-daughter. When Bruce had returned from Wayne business well...Cass had had to go on patrol early and alone. Sandsmark though, wouldn't have nearly as much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you doing?\" Sandsmark gasped, mouth watering and slight stomach rumbling as she looked at the ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since her infection and the destruction of her metabolism, Wonder Girl had been on a diet. There'd been slips and cheat days, the starter belly bulging out of her Metropolis U cheer sweater and her soft thighs bulging out of her cheer skirt hadn't come from nowhere. But she'd been painfully aware of her slow softening, not nearly as much as everyone around her but the loss of her athleticism had made Cassie Sandsmark do the unthinkable: stop eating her favorite comfort food of peanut butter cup ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calming you down,\" Cass Cain said, easily but gently shoving Wonder Girl's face under the spigot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even had the good graces to pull Sandsmark's blonde hair out of the way. Wonder Girl stopped struggling, her hated gluttony taking over and her mouth plopping open the moment Batgirl pulled the switch. A long stream of frozen yogurt fell into her mouth, filling her cheeks wider and wider. The blonde inwardly seethed...but couldn't make herself not groan in pleasure as the beloved taste soothed her anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl released the switch, her keen observational skill letting her guess exactly how much her attacker could hold in her mouth. Smiling inside her mask, Cass let Sandsmark swallow and then pulled the switch again. And again. And again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...more...,\" Sandsmark groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks were stained with partly melted frozen yogurt. Her stomach was swollen with over a gallon of soft serve, pushing out over her cheer uniform. The zipper was down, the button strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, more,\" Batgirl hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frozen yogurt machine churned again. Cain watched the stream of frozen deliciousness pour into her attacker's mouth, an almost painfully wide grin stretched across her face. Fighting and feeding were her two joys in life and today had mixed them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the glutted Sandsmark slide to the ground. Wonder Girl's stomach was immense, a beach ball turning her sweater into a bra. It was taut to the touch and groaned audibly. Once it started digesting, Cass guessed it would go right to her opponent's thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeus, Zeus...I'm gonna get fat,\" Wonder Girl moaned, unable to remember why that made her angry, \"Fat's good right...I need to eat more...why was I angry over that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice cream machines all bore a large red A for Anonymous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Batgirl said, pulling loose the knot on the lasso, \"Why are you here?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour previous, the gorged Wonder Girl would have set the second part of her plan in motion: getting this infuriatingly ripped Batgirl onto the Teen Titans where she could spend as much time next to the still infectious Super Girl as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, Cassie Sandsmark was tied up with a magic lasso, drunk on a couple gallons of frozen yogurt and and thoroughly sexually confused. Getting her ass so thoroughly and surprisingly kicked and then getting stuffed to the brim had turned her on in ways Super Boy never had. Right now she couldn't tell up from down, much less stick to a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to get you infected,\" Wonder Girl groaned, \"like me and Kara, so you would get fat too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her mask, Cass raised an eyebrow. Someone wanting to fatten her up was a strange turn of events, but the word \"infected\" made wheels turn in her mind. Her mind went back to a couple months earlier, when she'd gotten sick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infected with what?\" Bat Girl asked, flicking the turgid dome of Sandsmarks balloon belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I look like? Dr. Wonder Girl?\" Sandsmark whined, \"A few months ago every female hero was skinny, then Super Girl had a cold and started over eating. Every other girl at the college got sick for a couple days and then started over eating too. And no one but me noticed! They just ate and ate, it was like they enjoyed getting fatter and fatter and all the boys and gay girls turned into chubby chasers over night. I was the only one who noticed it! People keep calling me skinny even with this gut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemory flickered in Cass' mind: Damian daring to insult Stephanie in front of her and saying every one but Cass was getting fat. The weeks she'd spent joyfully fattening up Selina and Steph and Barbara. The happy feeling she'd had at seeing flat bellies turn into bulging muffin tops, at seeing toned thighs grow lazy and beefy at breasts drooping far ahead of schedule. It had been so new, so gratifying and she'd thought it had just been a new discovery from within herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was this?\" Cass asked, mouth going dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I didn't write it down. A couple months ago,\" the blonde prisoner grumbled, \"Didn't you notice when all the gotham girls but you got fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl remembered the windy night when she'd felt miserably sick. The night that she'd started seeing Babs and Steph and Selina as scrawny. The night that Stephanie had also gotten sick and started overeating to her and Tim's delight. Cass realized she'd been one of the initial infected. That while she somehow hadn't gotten fat, she turned Stephanie, the girl she'd been crushing on for two years so chubby she could barely fight crime anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome villain had pulled off a scheme startling in scope. How many heroines could be fat by now? Could she stop this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she even want to stop this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from crime fighting, Cass had been miserable for years. It was only after she'd started bulking out her girlfriend and adopted mom she'd started feeling happy outside violence. Her days weren't just dull training until it was time for patrol, but had interactions she actually looked forwards to. Without the oomph from her fetish, she'd have never had the courage to kiss Steph. What would it be like if she lost that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who would she be if she just let it happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Batgirl said, \"and I'm going to find out why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl might primarily be a martial artist, yet she was still a member of the Bat family. Near illiterate she might be, but she was still a detective at heart. She'd find out who'd done this to everyone and stop them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it meant she had to lose what she enjoyed most...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the city,\" she told Wonder Girl, pulling the lasso loose and guessing the stuff woman bulging out of her skirt was no threat, \"We'll solve this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finding evidence of the infection, Cassandra went to the best Detective she knew for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone got sick,\" Cass said awkwardly,trying to explain with her hands as much as she could, \"and then, the girls got fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Batgirl, thank you for bringing this up,\" Bruce Wayne told her that night in the cave, the impossibly muscular Batman having just finished a particularly violent patrol alongside his proteges, \"Now, let's get you examined for a concussion. You must have taken a hit in the fight against those kidnappers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the quiet vigilante asked her adoptive father in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassandra, you must have taken a head injury,\" Bruce chuckled, \"I've always liked fat women, remember? And Selina's always been kinda heavy set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl blinked. She could remember when Selina could run up a building instead of getting winded up the stairs and it hadn't been that long ago. If there had been a virus, it must have rewritten everyone else's memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I'm the Batman, I'm pretty sure I'd notice if I suddenly started liking fat women from nowhere,\" Bruce said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruce, we're out of ice cream!\" Selina yelled from the top of the stairs, the ultra pear socialite leaning in, creases of hip fat pushing against the door, \"Can you get me some more rocky road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been immune to this effect too, so she'd have to go find help from somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying I used to be *munch* skinny?\" Barbara Gordon asked, shoveling a handful of sweet potato fries into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butterball ex-Batgirl filled her chair to the limit, rising higher and higher on her inflating buns. The redhead gave no sign of ever having been an award winning gymnast, her lean face having ground round and chubby while her modest breasts had ballooned into saggers bigger than her head, resting on a newly doubled belly. Totally inactivity and being surrounded by snacks from the brilliant feeder Cass had ballooned Barbara faster than any other heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" the frustrated Cass said, pointing at a framed picture of Babs looking athletic and trim by her computer, \"you were Batgirl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was before the chair,\" the nearly obese master hacker shrugged, causing a tidal wave of jiggles to break out beneath her under sized t-shirt, \"as soon as I couldn't exercise, all my bad habits caught up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you were skinny,\" Cass sighed despondently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a photographic memory,\" Barbara insisted, shoving more fries into her mouth, \"I think I'd notice getting fat out of nowhere. Now excuse me, Dick wants to ease things over between the three of us at a buffet. You should come, you look thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, Dick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Starfire used to be skinny,\" Dick Grayson said at the pool behind Wayne Manor, the first lithely muscled Robin flipping a grill full of burgers in his civvies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she...wait!\" Cass yelped in surprise, \"You believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, someone listened to her story. Someone believed her! Now with Dick's help, she could trace this back to its source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do,\" Grayson nodded, \"She was always super skinny and fit, but she was always so sweet and fierce that I liked her anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" Cass said, \"no. She...you liked skinny girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personality is what's important when dating,\" Dick reminded her, flipping another thing of sizzling meat, \"I've always liked bigger girls but the way she acted is what drew me to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dick, is this bikini the flattering?\" Starfire asked, walking from the manor in a tiny purple bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect legs rasped together in a sensual promise, jiggles going up them with every step. The floss-like scraps cut deep into her buttery hips, the aliens buns big enough that each sway brought their cellulite studded flanks into view. Despite her daily started diets, the low will powered alien's paunch was large enough it had begun hanging over the front of her panties in a tangerine tide. More australian cleavage poured out of the undersized triangular cups than Cass had and Star's once muscular arms had started to sprout bingo wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a billion bucks, babe!\" Dick whistled, \"I'll have your burgers up in a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Cass knew now that she didn't really feel attracted to the plus sized pile of curves almost waddling out of the manor. But she still had to close her mouth and make herself sit down. Star just looked so good, so soft and pampered and lazy and perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad she's getting a good figure finally, but I've always loved her,\" Dick smiled, \"I'm glad her agency wants her to go full plus size now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass rubbed her head trying to get the image of the plus sized tamaranian out of her head. She'd have to do this on her own, a case no one else believed in. Without help she couldn't use any tech, so she'd have to do this with what she knew. She and Supergirl had been infected at the same time but she'd never met Super Girl, wait, Super Girl's step mom and her step mom were best friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karen Starr barely got into work on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs CEO that really mattered, especially with all the work they were doing fueling Anonymous' growth. The company was making money hand over fist just from the diet food, having remade its initial investment in marketing and transport in weeks. It helped that Karen had done a lot of the heavy lifting, using her kryptonian super powers and the help of her geomancer friend Atlee to create a vast series of caverns and bunkers filled with Ivy's hungry plants and fueled by solar powered lights 24/7. The quick growing diet food variety were all harvested already, their seeds preserved in case they needed to get thin in an emergency, but they'd been replaced with the full fat versions already. Aside from that, she'd had to sign endless amounts of paper work, under go inspections that had to be dosed with Ivy's mind control serum...which was a bit evil she had to admit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was all worth it: because she was <i>fat</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered her building wearing a new size fourteen pant suit that fit her perfectly. Snug across the bulging gut that had covered up her hated abs and was starting to sag over her underwear when standing. Tight enough around her thick, toneless thighs that the red fabric went 'schwish-schwish' with every almost a waddle step. Spread thin over her heavy, sagging, bouncy shelf of an ass, a big addition even though her hips hadn't spread that much unfortunately. Skintight over beefy lunch lady arms that looked pathetic compared to her old cut guns. And of course, cradling her now head sized and very bra dependent I cup gazaongas that would soon be putting her buttons to the test giving that her rounded face was already munching this morning's third doughnut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture on the badge she flashed through security showed a woman with cheek bones sharp enough to shave with and a jawline of shocking thinness. Karen's new face were round as a moon, her disguise's glasses looking more natural and she seemed less a lifetime jock than a cute, chubby nerd girl. Finishing her breakfast on the elevator the pleasantly plump heroine walked through the executive floor of her building, passing her slender workforce who'd gone from soft to lean and fit thanks to the diet anonymous snacks. Of course they were now all eating the full fat hyper addictive versions expecting to keep losing weight and the rebounds were already starting , her super hearing could actually detect thickening thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd have to work hard to stay the fattest woman at the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone buzzed while she thought and she pulled it out on the way to her office. Usually she'd be there by now but the amazing plant based food combined with not enough time in the sun was making her really out of shape and she loved it, her top flight speed and stamina dropping noticably as when she'd given the modified fat fetish plague to Catwoman. Monitoring social media showed it was already ripping through the daily planet, Gotham and justice league like the plague it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your new secretary is weird,' the text from Atlee said, the geomancer having decided to spend some time in Karen's office as an 'advisor' and earn a pay check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...what?' Kara responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have a new secretary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying as fast as a fat girl could, the beefy heroine approached her office's waiting room and found seated behind the desk not her efficient secretary Brenda, a rail thin older woman, but instead a whale of a pale blonde with an ass so fat it lifted her off the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Quinn,' Karen hissed as she recognized the obese ex-villainess, 'what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why making sure you're all taken care of,' the mega pear beamed, showing teeth whitened by the same goodies that had turned her from gymnast to land whale, 'can't do that from the apartment! Want a candy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was enough chocolate on Quinn's desk to give every woman in the eastern sea board an acne outbreak and Karen scanned them quickly to ensure the insane clown hadn't poisoned them or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where's Brenda?' she asked, ensuring she was unseen and pulling the doughball ex-con from her chair, 'I swear if you've...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Relax, she won a cruise...that I rigged,' Quinn grinned, 'come on, we're friends, aren't we Betty?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Quinn, we're business partners, and you used me to try and become a super hero side kick when I had amnesia,' the kryptonian hissed, 'now you're going to leave my office and...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Karen, these new bars of yours are pretty damn good. Way better than hybrids,' Atlee announced as she left Karen's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer side kick was a fairly short, dark haired girl who was from the center of the earth and had immense powers over tectonic movements. Karen viewed her like a younger sister and a protege. Living on the surface with its junk food had chunked her up a little bit, from a lean 110lbs to a chunky 152, heavy in the thighs and belly. The diet bars had cut three fourths of that off, giving her a trim, fit shape back for the first time in a few years, but right now she had one of the non-diet cookies in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh...good to hear,' PG said, lowering Quinn down, 'you look great...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she thought Atlee was better at one fifty and would soon see her bigger than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, how much ya lost?' Quinn questioned with an evil look in her eye, 'I've been looking to drop a few hundred pounds...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'About thiry pounds, I'll be back to my old self in no time,' Atlee smiled as she walked bye, 'thanks Karen!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...no problem,' PG said stiffly, Harley getting wickedly happy as the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So she doesn't know she's back on the one way train to fat-ass town with no return ticket?' Harley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're leaving now,' Karen told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Leaving? When I'd have to yell out to your pal that you were fattening her up knowingly?' Harley said, 'Are you really even a hero anymore?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shut up Quinn,' Karen told her, only for Harley to grab her in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I'll shut up...if you do what I say...,' Quinn smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What...what do you want?' Karen asked, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Simple, roomy...,' the mental patient said, piggy blue eyes gleaming, 'you and I are gonna have some fun...'</span></div></div>",

I wonder what that Atlee chick would think of it...,\" Harley teased, \"might think that you're trying to fatten someone up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, its the best thing I've ever seen,\" Power Girl said, crossing her arms over her chest, beefy limp bouncing up engorged tit flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to try it out, when you're dressed for it,\" the ex-super villain giggled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm dressed for relaxing,\" Power Girl said, pointing at her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen not in her business best or super suit, Karen preferred a pair of athletic shorts and a tank top.Right now the shorts were blue and the tank top was white and both needed to be up sized two or three times. Long muscular thighs were looking lazy and plush,  cuddling together for warmth and her calves had gotten scrawny, while her deflated ass had begun to fall out of her shorts. Karen had always shown her midriff, but while once firm abs were hinted at now she had a rather large beer belly on display. Soft as a marshmallow, it was starting to tilt downwards under its own weight. Famously large and firm hooters had gone from round and firm to tear drop and clearly were going to continue to sag as they started to outgrow her K cup sports bra. Her sharp face was fuller and softer, looking nerdier and more cute than pretty. Her arms were a strange outlier, their muscle tone had evaporated and Karen's fat hadn't quite grown back to the same level, making her look kind of wimpy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"nah, you're dressed for relaxing, I'm talking about relaxing,\" Harley said with raised eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sighed, not that deeply though. Harley might be three hundred pounds of infuriatingly crazy ex villain but she was still a three hundred pound pear whose build and phsyique were exactly what the over plump Power Girl liked. She could even be kinda fun to be around when she wasn't being psycho. And Karen's vibrator needed a new nuclear battery to work on her. But still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not having sex with you,\" Karen said, \"that's a flat no...for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex? Who said sex?\" Harley laughed, \"nah, you're just gonna get changed and we're gonna give you a little snacky snacky while we watch tv. The delivery guy's already been called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley shoved a package into her hand and pushed Karen toward's the bathroom, or at least tried but moving 285 lbs of Kryptonian that didn't want to be moved was beyond her. Her center fold body had already gotten fat when she'd delivered the diseased sugar packet to catwoman, but now the out of shape heroine was packing on a pound a day or more due to Quinn's demands and feeding schedule, while the pale clown was barely gaining. She really had to hand it to Harley, she was a superb feeder, helping Karen gain faster than she thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you order?\" Karen asked, not remembering over hearing any calls while she'd laboriously put the couch together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chinese...,\" Harley smiled, \"and pizza, mexican, thai, korean, big belly burger, cup cakes. Relax Betty, you're rich enough to afford it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, just leave me plenty of crab rangoon,\" Karen said, waddling towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door with her over padded rump, PG started carefully stripping. While it had been a while since shed done it, the blonde had torn many an outfit from undressing too quick. The last thing to go was her bra and she winced when her huge boobs flopped out, back twinging at the lack of support. Extra fat wasn't being kind to the CEO's cleavage, she now would fail the pencil test easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't be sagging no matter the size,\" she grumbled, rubbing her sore lower back and tearing open the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a very, very small white bikini and a pair of heeled sandals. Sighing, PG pulled the very tight string bikini up and tied it on, the crotch basically vanishing beneath her beer gut and the bra nowhere near supportive enough for her tender chest. She patted herself, more than pleased with her rapid accumulation of bulk but felt that something was slightly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a second to guess that she was looking a little pale, her deep tan having faded out quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, need to hit the sun,\" Karen said, turning to leave and not noticing she was down a couple inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left the bathroom the entire room was filled with the aromas of greasy takeout and the beaming Quinn had changed to a bikini of her own, mouth full of wonton and hands holding fuzzy handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat tons a fun, we gotta chain you up and punish you,\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPG sighed, but knowing she could crack the cuffs with a twitch complied. She sat down onto the immediately groaning couch and automatically opened her mouth, Quinn shoveling in crab rangoon. For a while Karen almost dozed off, automatically eating and feeling warm, happy and safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow tubby tubby, you polished off four orders of them,\" Harley giggled, slapping Karen's stomach, \"better be careful or you're gonna wind up fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl winced at the slap, then raised her eyebrows in confusion. Wait, that had hurt? She opened her mouth to say something only for a taco to fill it, Harley filling her up with mexican food until the thought left Karen's mind. She lay back and groaned, Harley gently rubbing her stomach and then collecting the bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna let ya digest a bit, let's turn on the news,\" Harley said, pressing the button, \"that's always fun!\"</span></div></div>",

Gorgeous redhead Vicki Vale sat behind a desk, low cut blouse showing off freckled DD cups pushed up to her chin, while the desk showed that she'd had to use a rubber band and a paper clip to get her skirt buttoned up as the real deal Anonymous foods started bulking her up, already pushing the reporter out of her fat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as the CDC announces that as the average American woman is thinner than ever,\" Vicki smiled, \"things aren't quite the same up in the skies. Look out, its out of shape, its over weight, its...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, my favorite segment!\" Harley giggled, with difficulty crossing her stiff, swollen legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A super fatty! Brought to you by Anonymous Bakeries,\" Vicki announced as a graphic of various female heroines bulging out of their costumes cut across the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl's paled further to see her own doughy physique shown a couple times, notably thinner than she was now. She loved being fat, chubby and out of shape but getting mocked for it...oh shit she was ready to go right the fuck now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this Harley?\" Karen asked, breaking into a sweat, \"since when are we sponsoring this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh from day one, it was Ivy's idea. She said she wanted people to get used to fatty heroines,\" Harley said through a full mouth, \"watch though, its the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And our subject today is almost unexpected,\" Vicki said, while the TV began showing archival footage of Wonder Woman, the camera panning up the Amazon's muscular curves, \"Wonder Woman has claimed to have been gifted beauty by Aphrodite herself and to be a trained warrior but it looks like those days are over. She might be from a hidden island of warrior women but her physique and diet might be all American these days. The upcoming footage is taken from the coveted Best Pie in America contest in Washington DC, where the hundred best bakers in the country compete to see who is best. They snagged the famous warrior princess as a surprise judge. She's been increasingly camera shy recently and now we get to see why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footage wasn't particuarly good, taken on a phone camera as it was. But Karen Starr didnt need super human vision to see that Wonder Woman's once flattering armor was now a decidedly bad fashion decision. How the brunette heroine had gotten into the armor was a damn mystery, there were gaps between all of its plates with fat pouring through, the straps and laces of the cuirass stretched to the breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroine walked down a long line of tables bearing steaming pies, nose sniffing in the heavenly aromas. Each step sent a jiggle up her toneless thighs, which slapped loudly together. Her perfect ass hung out of its starspangled metal panties, a red line on each bun where it pinched. She had a clear belly slopping under and occasionally through her armor and her always large boobs were pouring out of her bra. Warrior biceps had deflated,although her arm circumference had grown due to bountiful lower arm fat, and her famous bracers had mushrooms of fat around their too tight circumference. Diana's perfect face had taken a bad blow from the fat, taking on more than its fair share of adipose as she grew fat apple cheeks and jiggly second chin starting to split into thirds. Her blue eyes were locked onto the pies and her mouth hung open, a steady stream of drool pouring onto her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haha, there goes the perfect woman!\" the ultra pear Harley giggled, her own small breasts wobbling in their cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana always said she was going to change Man's world but it looks like the opposite has happened!\" Vale laughed, stopping suddenly to the mystery of her audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the desk, her impromptu button had snapped off, but the reporter covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did that paragon of female fitness turn chubby, you might ask?\" Vale smiled, \"well, let's see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video restarted, showing Diana sitting on a cheap metal chair at a judging table. Stacks of completely clean pie tins rose on each side of her, her face currently buried in another, her long black hair tied back. Wonder Woman pulled her face back from the licked clean tin, licked her lips and gave a dainty, lady like belch that made her swollen body jostle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see they picked their judges well!\" Vale laughed cruelly, \"usually multiple judges only eat very small slices from a few pies each but Blubber Woman apparently insisted on eating every single pie herself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana's stomach was just big, not huge. Her superhuman abs were compressing the fifty or so pies she'd already downed into a mere volley ball of a  food baby. The Amazon's armor was tearing apart, the articulated plates around her belly hanging on for dear life, the wide gaps between them letting Diana's tan stomach fat mushroom over and under her belt. As she dug into another pie one of her breast cups failed, letting a head sized hooter flop completely into view, unfortunately blurred on the TV. The warrior woman was too engrossed in lemon meringue to notice even as a shocked organizer tried to cover her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man she is in hog heaven!\" Harley cooed, \"look at that stomach capacity! Hey, how come you can't eat like that? Ain't ya supposed to be just as strong? She's eaten half my old body weight in pie and is going strong while you need a break after ten or twelve measly bags of take out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out of shape,\" Karen groaned, the obese Kryptonian's stomach rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say so!\" Harley cooed, squeezing Karen's arm, \"I remember back when you were a walking gun show, now you got these little stick arms. Put that with your nerd girl cheeks and I kinda wanna beat you up and steal your lunch money. Gotta feed you up and get you that mass back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen, Wonder Woman was digging into pie number one hundred. Her stomach was the size of a beach ball, armor plates wrapped around it and held on only by her near unbreakable belt and a black bar had been super imposed over her exposed breasts. Her eyes had the look of madness in them, an obsession well out of her control. Finishing, Diana leaned back in her chair, raising up her chubby finger and burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pie number 67, the cherry one,\" Wonder Woman's posh voice came through a full mouth, \"Pardon, but does anyone have an anti-acid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed and the cheap metal chair gave a shriek of abused metal and collapsed, spilling the obese Amazon onto the ground. Chubby legs kicked up, giving a brief panty shot, and as they recoiled against the ground, Diana's belt buckle snapped. A storm of shrapnel from her shattered armor shot out, the belt buckle breaking the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVale swallowed something quickly as the camera cut back to her, \"And Wonder Woman has found her Kryptonite, just one hundred pies in two hours. All of the injured viewers are expected to make a full recovery. The Warrior Princess had apologized and stepped into pay for their medical bills, probably from her new sponsor, Lane Bryant. Thank you all for watching Super Fatties, stay tuned for a message from our sponsors...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley gave a hyena cackle, \"Oh man, its great seeing all those smug supers get fat like regular people. Don't ya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren gave a minor glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be like that, you're even more of a perve than me,\" the barely clad obese ex-criminal laughed, \"You're only regret is that you didn't get asked to judge the pie eating contest huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen, the commercial featuring Starfire erotically eating donuts played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little,\" Power Girl admitted, going to cross her arms but stopping when the chain between her fuzzy cuffs went tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, time for your desert...and then Pizza,\" Harley said, rocking forwards a couple tries to finally stand up on her weak, trembling legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to the bubbling tank of fondue, bending over to give Karen a view of her continental ass cheeks wobbling back and forth as she hooked up a hose. Karen's attention was removed from her fullness by the swaying sight, trying to kick her brain into telling the clown that perhaps sex wasn't off the table, when Harley finally popped back up, a hose of melted chocolate already pumping into her mouth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karen heard the buzz of her phone over the heated hiss of melted chocolate, but she heard most everything that happened within a couple states and was used to ignoring what was less important than the situation at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the hose full of hot fudge was about the most important thing in the world to her. Power Girl sucked and sucked, not as fast as her superhuman body could but at a low steady rate. Her eyes rolled back into her head from just the glorious, decadent taste of it all. The pressure of it flowing into her engorged belly made her legs shiver and shake, moans coming out the side of her mouth in between sucks. Harley\u2019s fingers jabbed and pressed into the naked flanks of her paling paunch, the obese clown\u2019s eyes huge as she watched the heroine grow increasingly gravid, her own excitement building and her tree trunk thighs pressing in tight in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, suck it down Bette!\u201d Harley giggled, small nipples pressing tight against her own bikini top, \u201cGet bigger and fatter and weaker! We need to get you bigger than me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kryptonian groaned and moaned at the faint sensation on her stomach. A human would be screaming in pain at the touch, but although her lack of sunlight was sapping Karen\u2019s power set she had enough solar energy stored in her cells that Quinn\u2019s jabs just felt like a pleasant massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u2019s stomach kept flowing, marching slowly towards her knees, pressing down on the tiny panty portion of her bikini. The shoe-lace knots on her flanks stretched, the one on her left side untying. The hose started slurping, running out of fondue and her body gave a brief spasm of joy, her skinny fat arms flexing and the chain links of her cuffs stretched, deformed and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley\u2019s nerdy, obese, short sighted, asthmatic and carpel tunneled body might be a far cry from her old murderous form but she\u2019d kept enough instincts to duck just in time. The all state gymnast\u2019s 326lb bulk hit the floor with a heavy, graceless thud, her own bikini bottom breaking but what little dignity the semi-reformed psychiatrist possessed was saved, her mountain range ass cheeks had a deathgrip on the back of her bottoms.  Quinn let out a whistle when she got up, seeing that the TV was shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna need a new one of those!\u201d she giggled, picking up a box of buttery Anonymous biscuits and dunking it into a tub of gravy, \u201cgood thing we\u2019re making a few billion every day, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl could only respond with a groan. The heroic blonde had already been trending towards the gut heavy already, her limbs\u2019 evaporating muscle mass making them comparatively thinner, but with a few gallons of solidifying chocolate on top of several armfuls of greasy, salty fast food, the Kryptonian looked ready to pop. She licked some chocolate sauce off her lips, lifting a trembling arm and rubbing her stomach gently, trying and slowly failing to not fall into a food coma\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she heard her phone ring again.<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d she sighed, trying to stand up and failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was less a matter of strength, Karen still had plenty of that, but will power. Stuffed to the brim with junk food as she was, all she wanted was to pass out and sleep. But the phone kept ringing and ringing, leading to the alien slowly levitate herself off of the couch and slowly fly towards the counter where her phone hummed incessantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley could have helped but the hefty, biscuit gorging woman was watching fascinated as one of the most powerful heroines in existence slowly hovered towards her phone. Rubbing her back against the pull of her heavy, sagging breasts, Karen began her slow, airborne journey roughly standing but the plunging bulk of her gut began slowly pulling her forwards bit by bit, until by the time she was at the counter she was almost laying down, her beach ball belly hanging turgid towards the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl fumbled for the phone, putting a few cracks in her marble counter top, before she grabbed hold of the phone. Blearily standing up and rubbing her gut, Karen saw the contact picture of an ultra skinny blonde girl with nervous, sad smile and the title of \u201cOther Me\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s on the horn?\u201d Quinn asked, eyes locked onto how Power Girl was unthinkingly resting her gut on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sensitive stuff do you mind waiting in the other room?\u201d the Kryptonian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might let Harley Quinn crash in her apartment and feed her chocolate through a tube while wearing thong string bikinis and maybe if there had been some alcohol heavy enough to cut through her immunity it might have led further, but she wasn\u2019t going to have super talk with a villain in the room. Even if she was working with her to turn the world\u2019s women obese to suit her own fetishes and also save the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn for once, chortled, \u201cOh, one of those talks, then. Heh, enjoy em while your superfriends are small enough to have em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese anti-heroine waddled and wobbled towards the bedroom door, hips brushing against the door way and then closing the door with her hips. Karne sighed, wondering what her life was coming too, pulled a slice of 500 cal per slice anonymous pizza from a box and started eating as she answered Super Girl\u2019s call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...you,\u201d Power Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer relationship with the rest of the Super Family was...weird. They weren\u2019t really \u201cher\u201d family, she was from an alternate reality where things had gone a little different, but it was still nice to see them at Christmas even though that holiday didn\u2019t make any sense to her. Super Girl though was her, the her from this reality, even though Karen was pretty sure she\u2019d never been that skinny and it just felt weird to be around another you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Karen, can you come to Gotham and give me a hand?\u201d the high pitched, slightly fragile voice of her doppleganger asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotham? What are you doing in batcountry?\u201d PG asked through her pizza, finishing it, taking another slice and dipping it in garlic butter, \u201cand aren\u2019t you supposed to be in class on fridays?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that a Kryptonian science guild member needed to be in a crappy human college. What were Lois and Clark thinking insisting she go? Karen was a CEO saving/taking over the world, successful enough she could take a day off just to get stuffed and she didn\u2019t have a real diploma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a friend of mine and I were doing a... crime fighting project...,but she ditched me! What a bitch!\" the other her swore, her anger showing through and not knowing that at that moment Cassie Sandsmark was being interrogated by Batgirl via frozen yogurt, \"and could you come get me please? This whole city is gross and creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can but, well do you need someone to pick you up?\" Karen asked, dreading figuring out how to get dressed, \"Just you know, fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ivy's virus rampaging across the cape community and the full impact Anonymous foods restarting the obesity epidemic in overdrive it wasn't that uncommon to see a woman walking around bulging out of her clothes. But while she loved being fat, Power Girl was well aware that she was a rather big girl by any standards,the hundredish pounds of fat she'd put on pushing her past chubby and into full on obese before her gorge session that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't my, powers aren't working right now,\" Kara muttered, \"and if Lois finds out I ditched...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, Karen knew how it was when your abilities were kicking in. One day you were on top of the world and the next you couldn't do a push up...and given how her step-mom had been patient zero for the infection, Supergirl really couldn't do a push up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it'll take me a bit,\" Power Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she wanted to do was sleep this off but while she'd happily doomed her alternate self to eventual immobile obesity, Karen wasn't enough of a jerk to leave her in Gotham powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some...wardrobe issues lately,\" Karen said, looking past her heavy boobs at the immense sprawl of still hungry belly, \"it might take me a bit to get out the door though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was putting it lightly. It was a friday, which since the start of her rapid weight gain had traditionally been her day to upsize her wardrobe, both super and professional. But since Harley had butted her fatass way into her life, she'd told Karen she'd have to go every two weeks before getting new clothes, even if she'd spend a whole week with gaping buttons, straining seams, uncomfortably sucking in and inevitable, humiliating rips, breaks and button popping. Yesterday she'd been sucking in through an entire marketing meeting, losing several buttons on her gaping dress shirt hidden inside a very snug suit jacket. With all of this feast inside her, and damn but she was most of the way through this XL pie wasn't she, there was no way she'd get anything closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just please hurry. This city is weird and scary, there was a creepy batgirl running around with a stitched up mouth,\" Supergirl whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hurrying!\" Power Girl insisted through a full mouth, slowly lowering herself to her feet, eyes bulging when she felt the immense weight of her stomach settle onto herself, super powers or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started waddling towards her bed room, feeling her sloshing stomach sway side to side, threatening to pull her over. Shit, Supergirl wasn't exactly twiggy anymore, how was she even going to pick her up? It wasn't a strength issue so much as a volume one, would their mutual curves even fit together for long distance flight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, make sure you're safe,\" Karen said, tugging off her bikini, \"where are you at?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm right by the university. Please hurry, its cold. I had powers when I woke up this morning and didn't put on a jacket, then Cassie broke the car,\" Kara whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, don't have a heart attack I'll be right there, fifteen minutes max,\" Power Girl sighed getting to her bedroom door and trying to open it, the doorknob thudding into her turgid gut, \"okay, thirty minutes tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was too big to open a pull door. Sighing and more than a bit turned on, the Kryptonian turned off her phone and painstakingly turned to the side, opening the door with her left hand and waddling it open, the door jab poking into her gut. She waddled into her room, her once fantastic legs slapping together and saw Quinn drinking gravy while sitting on her bed. The sight of the obese, milky blonde spilling out of her bikini made Karen's jaw drop open for a moment but she shook her head, chubby girl cheeks jiggling, and set her mind on rescuing her...she decided to go with sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, that tummy is looking mighty fine Betty,\" Quinn cooed, her pet name for her a giggle, \"Lay down and I'll rub it with some cocoa butter, wouldn't want you getting stretchmarks would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was getting stretch marks, pink striations flanking her currently outie belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that but there's a little emergency I've got to deal with,\" Power Girl sighed, going into her closet past the bags of rapidly outgrown business and leisure attire on its way to goodwill, a few pieces of which had been outgrown before being worn, \"I need to suit up and pick someone up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn snorted, \"You sure that's a good idea in your condition? Aren't women in your stage of pregnancy supposed to take it easy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl started to say something but a near orgasmic quiver shot up her torso. The thought that she was so big she looked pregnant appealed enormously to her and she almost fell down. But with a display of will power, she made it to her closet, twisting her stuffed, sore torso to open the sliding mirror door after only mildly pausing at the sight of herself in the mirror. Gone was the ultra fit, imposing Power Girl with her threatening muscles and deep tan, vanished was even the chubby but still strong looking Power Girl of her early gain. The woman in her reflection was flat out fat, a big girl to her soft, squishy core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince starting her Anonymous diet five months earlier, Karen hadn't done the daily tanning needed to keep up her powers and her body was changing in consequence. Her bronze tan had faded to office worker pale, while her brilliant blonde hair was fading towards dirty blonde. Her diamond face shape was fully rounded out, puffy cheeks starting to merge with her double chin. Strong, square set shoulders slumped inwards, defensive and weak, while her flabby, jiggly arms looked barely capable from floppy underarm fat down to her chubby fingers. Her gigantic K cups had fallen out of her unsupportive bikini top, the massive hooters plunging downwards and resting atop her swollen stomach, a far cry from their perfect perkiness. Now wide stretched areola were moving down towards the bottom of her breasts, lazy nipples pointing at the floor and stretch marks on their sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's six pack had been an early casualty of her gain, fat seemingly drawn to the prideful muscles as a kind of karmic comeuppance. They'd softened from the bottom up, a FUPA gnawing at the muscle and she'd popped her first skirt button a few weeks after her first bite of Ivy's super food and Power Girl had thought the little paunch she'd had to suck in when announcing she was going inactive at her last JL meeting had been noticable. In comparison to this enormous food stuffed monstrosity, with inches of fat thick enough to give it a soft feeling even stretched out to this degree, she'd still been fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have a point, but its important,\" Karen said, sliding open the door and going to push the button that would open the secret costume compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button was up high and Power Girl frowned when she couldn't reach it. Before her gain she'd been a whopping 6'2 but the extra weight combined with sun deprivation weakening Karen against her own fat load had compressed her down to a hair under 6'. She had to hover a little bit off the ground to hit the switch and gave a little \"Oop' of surprise when the spring loaded secret panel popped open and smacked into her sensitive tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you can even help? I'm serious here Betty, you ain't exactly in top condition anymore,\" Quinn said with real concern, \"when was the last time you even did super stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl frowned again as she pulled her largest costume from the hidden closet, a size 16 relaxed that was a bit old. She'd helped out at some wild fires and search and rescue but that had been a while ago, she knew she'd been getting considerably weaker as she was too busy to tan properly but well that had been a while ago. It used to be she spent more time in the white leotard than as her secret identity, but anymore Power Girl was an after thought to Karen Starr who spent her time on her butt with a donut in her hand. She really hadn't squeezed into the spandex since her last trip to Gotham three months and seventy pounds ago had left her winded and sweaty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" Karen said a little nervous, shamelessly undoing her bikini and slowly, painfully bending down to step into her leotard, difficult due to her not being able to see her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really though Betty, we're big girls now, not super heroes,\" Quinn reminded her, \"you gotta be pushing three hundred after that feast and you were kinda sweating carrying that couch up the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Power Girl,\" the obese CEO wheezed, dragging the suit up her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat part was easy, Karen's had always had big, toned, muscular legs and the extreme atrophy her new life of laziness had induced mixed with her apple shape meant her new flabby thighs weren't much bigger than her old hard ones. Her once strong calves were even easier, having become soft and scrawny. It was around her crotch she ran into problems, flabby, cellulite dimpled ass cheeks hanging out of the thong like back and the suit complaining as she dragged it over her doughy hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on,\" Karen said, straining to get the size sixteen suit over a stomach that was a size twenty before three gallons of chocolate sauce had been sucked into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suit buttoned up the left side and it was clear to the enraptured, concerned Quinn that PG's costume wasn't going to meet that. She was able to get it over her paunch due to stretching the fabric to the max and was struggling to get her floppy boobs into the overloaded cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a sports bra to support those?\" Quinn asked, \"wouldn't want the girls flopping around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its got a built in bra,\" Power Girl gasped, shoving one arm into the sleeve and wrestling her tits into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeve fit her perfectly, the spare space on her vanished bicep letting her underarm fat spread out. The same couldn't be said of the bra, pale, veiny boobs mushrooming out of a mere I cup. Harley pressed her thighs even tighter to see the titty volcanoes build towards blowing but despite her rampant horniness, had to voice concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might get ticketed for indecent exposure in that, PG,\" Quinn observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me button it up,\" the super hero wheezed, twisting to awkwardly pull at the buttons on her flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a one of them, even the comparatively narrow ones on her hip were going to close. There was too much love handle and flank and side boob and underarm fat for Karen to even try it more than once. The garment might be made of Kevlar and she might have fallen out of the top 100 strongest heroes but if it ripped she'd be out of options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe civies?\" Quinn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My civilian clothes are even tighter,\" the sweaty Karen said, looking at the foot wide gap between the sides of her costume, \"shit i should have worn underwear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll order size twenty fours for you tomorrow,\" Quinn told her sheepishly, \"you'll grow into them I'm sure. For now...I've got an idea...where's your belts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost the last one that sort of fit...about seventy pounds ago,\" Power Girl said, not knowing that the offending belt had been snagged by the then skinny Selina Kyle and worn for a few weeks before being outgrown and left in the closet, \"there's some older ones but they won't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you're thinking like a skinny girl still Betty,\" Quinn said, rocking to her feet a couple of times and waddling to the closet, \"you gotta learn to act fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn took two belts and clicked them together, making one immense garment. She waddled closer, feeling the heat rising off Karen's waist and handed her one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll both need to do this,\" Quinn said and together the two ran it around Karen's widest point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn took the ends in both hands, pulling them as hard as she could while Power Girl did her best to suck in. She was digesting the food fast but given the amount she'd eaten that didn't help much. Harley hadn't lifted anything heavier than a pizza box stack in half a year and started sweating as she fought the fabric, heart thundering and breath coming heavy. But at last there was a resounding click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, all good,\" Harley wheezed, flopping onto the bed, \"I need a break...and a snack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked at herself in the mirror: her flabby ass poured out the thong, pale love handles and white backfat and milky side boob poured out the still wide gap, her boobs were pressed up to her chin and the belts holding it all on were trembling. It was as good as she could get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing on a red, fluffy bathrobe to kind of cover herself, the corpulent Kryptonian slid on her gloves and had Harley help her with her boots. Then started waddling towards her skylight, hoping she could move fast enough through it that no one would see her. She hit the automatic release, sucked in her stomach a little and started rising to the sky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a Kryptonian, flying was as easy as breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Karen Starr, she was so fat and so engorged that her breathes were pathetic little pants. She was so weak, so out of shape and so heavy that she was distracting herself with the sheer sexiness of the situation, not helped by how the crotch of her panties was digging deep into her sex. Power Girl needed an orgasm, a belly rub, an anti-acid, a hot bath, another belly rub, a snack and a nap not flying across a couple cities but she was still a hero in her blood, even if her blood pressure was starting to increase. She rose very slowly into the air, at about the same rate as Harley's immense thighs wobbled past each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not exactly faster than a speeding bullet anymore, why not call her an uber?\" Harley asked, popping popcorn chicken into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just taking it slow,\" the obese Power Girl said, flabby butt jiggling as Harley reached out a hand and slapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you even go any faster? Seriously Bette you're more \"Normal Fat Girl\" than \"Power Gir\" right now,\" Quinn asked, \"I left a hand print on your ass for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" Karen said, rubbing her sore butt, \"its just a short trip and then tomorrow I'll start using the tanning bed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure its gonna close on a girl big as you?\" Harley giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll figure something out,\" Power Girl said sheepishly, a quiver of pleasure going through her at being so fat and weak, \"what are your plans the rest of the evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish eating this and then nap it off. Its been a bit since I've seen Ivy, might go see her if the snow ain't too bad,\" the immense pear yawned, wobbling to the fridge and pulling a stick of butter out, tossing it to Power Girl, \"Catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" Karen asked as the skylight opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see!\" Harley giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold air shot into her apartment through the skylight, earning a surprised yelp from the mostly naked Harley. It had been quite a while since Power Girl had shot through that skylight and there was a lot more Power Girl to fit through it now. Her shoulders fit easily but her boobs came worryingly close to touching the rim. She sucked her stomach in as far as she could but full of chocolate as she was, the Kryptonian wasn't surprised when her bloated waist fit snugly into the rim. Not wanting to rip a hole in her roof, she looked left and right, stuck tight like a bottle in a cork until a giggle from beneath her got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you think its funny Quinn,\" she grunted, trying to suck in anymore and failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not that, its just your lower body does look real flabby when your big gut and giant boobs aren't there to compare it too. Girl, you're getting a butt!\" the mega pear giggled, \"But really though, use the butter! If you haven't eaten it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh haha, just remember to clean up when you're done eating,\" Karen groaned, using her heat vision to soften the butter and then rubbing it around her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped out like a cork, tossed the half stick of butter into her mouth without thinking and shot up into the air as quickly as she could, pausing at ten thousand feet to try and not have a heart attack. Her vision was blurred, hot sweat poured off of her despite the cold winter winds and a stitch didn't describe what she felt in her side. Horribly out of shape, Karen was near hyper ventilating and the tit earthquake that caused popped a boob right out of her top. Struggling to get her breathing under control and her boob back in, it took her a minute to realize she was slowly falling towards the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I'm running on empty, I've got a few minutes of power left at best,\" the pale heroine wheezed, \"I'm going to have to do this quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren shot towards Gotham, leaving a trail of sweat. A winter storm was coming right behind her and that the high altitude air was starting to become a bit chill to her was a bad sign. As the gothic, horribly polluted bat-city stretched out before her, Karen started descending, having to put in effort not to plummet. She scanned Gotham as quick as she could, super vision and hearing blinking in and out as she ran out of solar energy. Power Girl swore, she couldn't find her alternate self anywhere and bad scenarios shot through her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it kid, I told you not to run!\" she gasped, wiping sweat from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and involuntarily descending from the skies, Karen pulled her phone from the pocket of the undersized bathrobe that kind of covered up her costume. She'd missed a call in the struggle against her new skylight nemesis and then a follow up message. Beneath the outdated skinny photo of Kara was the message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Met my friend Stephanie, staying with her for tonight. Sorry about bothering you, maybe breakfast tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, well at least I can go home,\" Power Girl sighed,  looking up and realizing that the gothic skyscrapers of the city were getting really close, her body falling a few feet every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting she made herself rise back up...but failed, going nowhere but down. A further attempt earned her nothing but cost her another hundred feet and made spots appear in her vision. The chill air was getting actually cold and Karen knew she was running totally on fumes. In about a minute she was going to be a grounded three hundred pounder falling out of a superheroine costume in the worst city in America, she didn't have enough juice left to get out of Gotham, much less to New York.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karen was falling fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoose pimples were shooting across her shivery body and her nipples were poking through her snug outfit. She needed to get inside, get warm and rest but she didn't have any property in Gotham and in her haste hadn't grabbed a wallet for a hotel. That meant staying with someone in the cape business which narrowed her options to two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina Kyle was in on the Anonymous conspiracy and Wayne Manor was surely cozy but Karen was nervous as all get out to be under Batman's roof. From everything she could tell he'd been infected with Ivy's fat fetish virus just like the rest of the league and wouldn't blink an eye at her being the size of a car but Wayne's creepy intensity always disturbed her. If anyone was going to bust her and Ivy's little world saving/fetish indulging conspiracy it would be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that her other option was much better. There was some bad blood there but well...she didn't have much choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering, Power Girl shot towards Barbara's clocktower. First at the speed of a car above the roof tops, then of a moped on the fourth story, then of a runner two stories above the street, then of a normal walking speed with her feet nearing the pavement. Sweat poured off of her from the exertion and the obese heroine steamed in the cold, a genuine blizzard was slamming into the city and howling snow was obscuring her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" the bulbous alien groaned, setting down rather than fall unexpectedly a hundred yards from the clocktower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets and sidewalks were deserted and already covered in six inches of snow. Karen's blue boots sank deep into the drifts, the cold powder hitting her starter cankles as she forced her thin, weak legs through the drifts. Power Girl wheezed, arms crossed across her chest as Barbara Gordon's home and head quarters loomed ahead of her, her atrophied muscles shivering in a failing attempt to keep her warm, endless ripples of jiggle showing through her pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving was getting harder and harder, Karen was basically at human standards as she made herself walk and although she'd been depowered before this was the first time she'd been depowered and obese. The once uber fit blonde's muscles were mush, they weren't used to supporting her much less moving her! Her immense weight hauled at her, belt groaning as her slumping stomach pulled at the belt holding her outfit together, and knees whining from holding up all of her. Pain began in her lower back as her unsupported tits pulled at her shoulders, making the shrinking Karen hunch.It was barely a hundred feet to the base of the clock tower, but Karen's body was quivering with the strain of pushing herself through the snow. She looked like the abominal snowman after a boob job, teeth chattering and body shaking as she started up the tower's wheel chair ramp. The normally brave, confident woman was shaking from anxiety as well as the cold, what if she died here? Just because she forgot to tan? Was this to be her fat, to freeze to death in Gotham having never cracked 300 lbs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling over ice in front of the tower's steel door, Karen hit the intercom, trembling and rubbing her arms, trying to get warm. It didn't buzz back, oh god was Babs gone? Was she going to die? She hit the button again and again, knowing she had no recourse and desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised to see you here,\" Barbara's voice told her, out of breath and through a mouth clearly full of food, \"why didn't you use the cape entrance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background, Power Girl could hear something that sounded a lot like orgasm moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babs, I'm in a bad way,\" the shivering CEO moaned, \"Let me in please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara and Karen had once been friends, both were genius computer whizes after all, but a bad mission that had unluckily coincided with a down turn in Karen's powers caused by random multiversal shifting had turned them against each other. This would be the first time they'd spoken in years and Starr just had to hope that the slender redhead would let her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some company over,\" Barbara said, clearly taking a bite of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babs, please, I'm depowered and its cold, I'm not dressed for this weather,\" Power Girl whined, humiliated and cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just stay down stairs, I\"m uh, having game night,\" the redhead's voice came over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a buzz on the heavy steel door and Karen grabbed it. Her eyes widened at how heavy it was, her evaporated muscles struggling to pull it open. Gritting her teeth she pulled back, weak arms struggling to get it open. She had to step back...and felt the ground slide out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl fell flat on her ass, unfamiliar pain shooting up her tender posterior. She let out a gag of pain and tried to push herself up, but between heavy, hanging belly and her weak muscles she just fell again onto her gut. Groaning she scrambled for the door, barely stopping it from closing and dragging herself inside through the narrow slot she could push open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWheezing in the warmth, Karen found herself trembling on a your welcome rug. A pair of men's shoes and a large size pair of women's high heels sat by her and the obese heroine wondered who they could belong to. Someone gave a very pleasurable scream upstairs, up a long twisting stair case that wove between banks and banks of super computer consoles. Karen was glad that they were warm at least and after a few minutes tried to stand...only to fall again, hard on her stomach driving the wind out of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd dragged in snow melt that had pooled beneath her and her weak, trembling arms were exhausted from actually being used. Power Girl recalled what she'd thought about Supergirl's tempermental teen powers, one day you could lift a mountain and the next you couldn't do a push up. She hadn't expected to ever feel that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to rise, Karen's swollen stomach kept defeating her. She was full and exhausted, her muscles trembling from exertion and she might have hypothermia. She wasn't going to let that stop her though. Snarling, the big bellied blonde got herself into a push up position, belly and freed boobs brushing the cold melt water on the ground. Power Girl might be too fat, too out of shape and too tired to stand up the normal way but damn it she wasn't going to lay here and take it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to the start of the staircase, and reached one quivering arm towards the handrail. Her other arm shook to hold her up, making her tits quiver jello like as they hung, but she got a gloved hand onto the handrail and pulled! Skinny nerd girl arms trembled and flabby thighs shook, weak abdominals screamed but bit by bit Karen got herself standing up at last. She was a hero and powers or not, fat or not, she was going to stand up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything on her hurt and was sore, Karen could feel bruises forming on her back, butt and belly. But the important thing was, she'd manage to haul her fat, weak body into the vertical. Smiling at that small triumph, the pale, frigid, flabby heroine looked down to see that in the commotion her uniform had ripped half way across the midriff, letting her heavy boobs flop free. Her belt had fallen off, letting the costume spread wide and leave her basically naked under her soaked bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be horny if I wasn't so cold,\" Power Girl sighed, patting her stomach and finding it less turgid than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever power she had left was clear being spent on rapidly digesting her feast into fat. Her already floppy belly was getting floppier, what could be pinched limited by her hand size. She patted it with a tired chuckle and tried to stand up, feeling her flabby K cups bounce.That sent a spasm of pain shooting up her back. Karen's blue eyes watered as something major pinched, fire shooting up her nerves. She took as deep a breath as she could, which wasn't much, and decided that sitting down on the ground again would be a very good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she started lowering her self...only for a wet boot to slide and the ground to come rushing up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren woke up to pain and the smell of frying bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain made her groan which was good, she tensed her body, feeling ripples of wobbling fat undulate but she could feel all of it. She went to sit up, balked at how heavy her own body felt, and made herself rise anyway, a sore head wincing at the pain. The super hero was on a couch in a small apartment, a blanket drapped over her, her eyes were focused on an open bathroom door where a tent like, shredded Power Girl costume was hanging dripping in the shower. The Kryptonian looked down at herself, seeing that beneath a blanket she was about three hundred pounds of wobbling apple curves, her giant sagging tits drooping over her multiple pale rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta say, you gave us quite a shock when you fell over,\" Barbara Gordon told her, rolling into the room, \"but after you woke up the first time once Kori pulled you up here, we figured you just needed sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl covered herself a little, looking over to the computer hacking genius who was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Babs hadn't been able to stand for almost five years, Karen had only seen her on her own feet precisely once before the Joker had shot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow the former Batgirl was standing up, walking towards her while carrying a tray covered in a steaming full english breakfast. Okay, less walking and more waddling because despite being fully vertical for once, Oracle had to be about two fifty. Unlike the apple shaped Karen or the pear shaped Harley, Babs was just fat all over, plush and jiggly from head to toe, although she had particularly bulgy arms, a floppy jowl and a fairly heavy set of loose mom boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babs, your walking!\" Karen stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no I'm not walking,\" the hacker shrugged, carefully putting the heavy tray onto her coffee table, \"not yet at least, even with the stem cell shots I need to rebuild some muscle tone, these braces are doing the walking. Don't you recognize your own handiwork?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren turned her eyes away from the cleavage pressing at Babs' t-shirt, looking down to the snug pair of blue jeans the redhead was wearing. For a moment she considered the meaty FUPA that made them into mom jeans but her eyes were drawn at last to the carbon nanofiber braces on Babs' outer legs and the plant-polymer fiber muscles wrapped around her doughy legs. Starrware branding was on the outside and Karen recognized a supportive exoskeleton she'd had her engineers design and wheedled Ivy to breed a plant who's fibers could work as artificial muscles, knowing that an increasingly bulky, out of shape work force would need help staying mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things have been so hectic, I didn't even know we were past the drawing board,\" the obese CEO admitted, coaxing her stiff, weak body into sitting up and inadvertently spilling out in full view of Babs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPG had been spent ten years as a G cup and had thought those mighty, firm jugs got in the way. They were nothing compared to the milk pale, blue veined K cup giants that spilled across her blanket and flopped almost to her waistline. There was total silence for a moment as the immense hangers finished bouncing, Karen's pale, chubby face going beat red. Despite her fat fetish she was a bit ashamed of how floppy she was anymore, especially in front of Gordon who's photographic memory would surely remember every square inch of sloppy boob fat pouring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing in Gotham?\" Oracle asked, not missing a beat despite the giant tits in front of her, \"especially when you were so low on solar power you literally crashed onto my couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's say that a relative of mine got stuck her depowered and needed a pick up,\" Karen admitted, \"and I drastically under-estimated how out of shape I'd let myself get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her beer gut for emphasis, blanket falling further to reveal a stomach beginning to split into upper and lower shelves. Barbara's green eyes traced over the exposed acreage of bulges, fat and stretch marks looking anything but disgusted. The redhead genius wasn't exactly straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Supergirl? She and a protege of mine stopped by, I sent them up to crash at the manor as I was having some, company. But Yeah, you're looking pretty pale,\" the computer genius said, her own virus affected mind seeing nothing wrong with the once muscular woman being a three hundred pound dough ball, \"I'd offer you a tanning booth but well, my complexion doesn't favor that. If you want your powers back you'll have to go lay out and well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look outside showed deep snow and more falling from a grey, overcast sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forecast is snow and clouds over the NE for the next two weeks, so unless you're in for a road trip you seem to be stuck on the ground with the rest of us,\" Barbara yawned, \"gotta admit I'm surprised you came to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I needed someone I know I can trust,\" the CEO said, awkwardly shuffling her blanket over her body, eyes drifting down to the heavy breakfast: soy sausage, hashbrowns, soy bacon, pancakes, waffles and eggs, \"and well...despite all the bad blood there's nobody I'd rather have watch my big butt than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm flattered,\" the fat woman yawned, \"but go ahead and dig in. I already had my first breakfast this morning and you look like you need to get your strength back, you're wasting away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sane human being would say the three hundred pound bulk was wasting away, especially via eating fifteen hundred calories worth of breakfast. But Ivy's virus had turned the genius into someone who saw gaining a pound a day as just another natural part of life. She watched Karen wolf down the breakfast with something approaching her old superspeed with plenty of approval and no small amount of arousal. Gordon had never been fully straight and the same virus that had made Cass a virtuoso feeder had also bent her that way as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta say, you are looking pretty good besides the super power loss,\" Babs told her, \"what's your diet? I'm on the six meal a day and a jug of milk and its done wonders for me. I'm on track to hit three hundred by thirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm just kind of a snacker,\" Karen said awkwardly, not wanting to admit she had a clown feeder and an unending supply of high cal super food, \"you though, gotta say the weight suits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a matter of time once I hung the suit up,\" Barbara said nonchalantly, eyes twitching between the disappearing food and Karen's obese bulk, \"those of us who aren't normally bullet proof have to hold back when we're crime fighting. I always admired how you could over eat without having to worrying about the fat slowing you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...slowing me down?\" Karen asked, clearly having very different memories of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you could rock a beer gut and fight crime just as well as if you'd been buff,\" Barbara said, not realizing that her guest hadn't always been fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's virus was doing a number as it rampaged and mutated. While most of its victims were aware they'd gained a lot of weight, none were able to realize how rapid it had been, assuming it was just a little extra on an already portly body. Photographic memory or not, Babs assumed she was only up twenty pounds from her Batgirl days. Apart from the current Batgirl, Wonder Girl and partly Wonder Woman none of those infected even realized they'd gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren guessed at the weird delusions she'd helped unleash and nodded, chin fat wobbling, \"Yeah, that's true. Gotta say that its pretty weird having to feel myself lugging it all around. I'm constantly short of breath now and, I hate to admit this, but I've got a hell of a back ache from these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your belly?\" Barbara asked, leaning forwards, \"how's that feel? Something that big has gotta weigh you down now that your powerless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I'm empty-ish?\" Karen asked, putting her chubby hands under her lowest roll and jiggling it up and down, a bouncy castle of lard, \"Let me try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl rocked herself to her feet, rising up on her third try as weak muscles whined under her lazy fat. Her boobs sagged a little farther as their resting place, her gut fell towards her knees. Her double belly was crotch covering in length and hip eclipsing in width, forming what looked like a smile. She had to adjust her footing to not get pulled over, finding she now stood with a stoop. Barbara was practically drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it pulls a bit. Guess my ass hasn't grown enough to balance me out,\" Power Girl admitted, \"might need to either start doing some squats or wear a back brace. Say, I know I don't have anything you haven't seen before but do you have any well, clothes I could borrow? I think I broke my suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I buy a size ahead so I don't get caught in emergencies,\" Babs said, licking her lips, \"you might be able to squeeze into them, but you should probably shower off first. Don't want to show up to Wayne Tower with bedhead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's hair had also grown, her normally short locks getting shoulder length, framing her fat, nerd girl face and she was immensely askew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea,\" she said, waddling to the bathroom, \"say, how did you get all of me upstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Babs turn to blush, \"I had Starfire carry you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you hate Starfire!\" Karen exclaimed, more alarmed to find the ex-gymnast was spending time with the alien who stole her boyfriend than her being obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She grew on me,\" Babs shrugged, her own heavy boobs bouncing, \"she's got a very firm whip hand and if you feed her enough she doesn't mind sharing. She even invited me to a cruise next week.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A cruise, you don't seem to be one who takes a vacation,\" Power Girl said, feeling the strain of her weight on her joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sedentary PG was 300 lbs of dead weight. Her shoulders slumped under the pull of her sagging breasts, making the once towering blonde alien stoop.Her belly pressed against the top of her thighs, shortening her once lengthy stride to a shorter waddle. She walked slowly, carefully towards the bathroom, afraid of falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I figured its been a few years since I cut loose,\" the pudgy redhead said, her leg brace whirring as she walked along, \"its two weeks from Gotham to Jamaica, a little tropical sun will be nice compared to this murk. I'm going to try and drag some of the proteges along, gvie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave the depowered Kryptonian pause. Far too fat to fit into a tanning bed, the obese woman needed time in the tropics, letting her sprawling acreage soak up sunlight to kickstart her super powers. And until she could fly again, she could rest her aching joints and ever spreading curves in a pool while munching on plate after plate after plate of buffet food. All surrounded by women who'd eat themselves out of the clothes they waddled on in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds lovely, I wonder if they have tickets left,\" Karen smiled, wobbling towards the bathroom, Barbara's eyes on her jiggling back fat, looking like rolls of vanilla pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how girthy she was, Karen was lucky that Barbara had had her living area refurbished to accommodate a woman of size. It was plenty wide to not bump Karen's sensitive hips and had hand rails to let her support her weak, over burdened legs.PG was not only weak, she was clumsy and nervous about a fall in her weakened condition. It made getting into the extra wide shower easier and with a sigh her hips spread across the reinforced shower seat, thinking about how<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really going to need to update my house,\" the obese ex-heroine sighed, gently caressing the underside of her sensitive breasts, \"stair assists, maybe some ramps, wider door ways...how big am I going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was powerless, temporarily she was sure, Karen started thinking not like a super powerful Kryptonian or even a normal woman but like the big girl she was. Her weight gain was only going to accelerate from here on out, Ivy was working on new strains of super food that made the current brand seem like the diet version. It was hard enough to get around while completely out of shape at 300lbs, what about 400lbs, 500? When, if she was unpowered, would she be too big to get up on her own? Too big to walk? Too big too do anything but get bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren thought of herself, a near half ton blob with her features totally swallowed by pale rolls. A gut spilling to her swollen feet, tits large as a pre-epidemic adult wobbling in a bra that went past the alphabet, arms so stubby she couldn't reach past her rolls, a neck swallowed with chins, a piggish face so swollen she could barely see. The powerless woman found her breathing rising and her already raised heart thunder harder, her nipples hardening as she neared orgasm at the thought of being so completely helpless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Power Girl wheezed her way out of the shower, an XL fluffy towel not at all covering her dimpled, cellulite coated rolls. Her stomach rumbled with hunger, not helped by more breakfast smells coming from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I laid some clothes out for you on the table,\" Gordon yelled over the sizzling, \"and I'm making lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled and started getting dressed in the sweat pants, t-shirt and hoodie that had been laid out for her. They bore the purple U of the Gotham U gymnastics team and it was weird to think that the obese woman cooking had once been an all star gymnast, especially as Gotham U had announced that girls sports were now theoretical. Power Girl had been fat long enough that the tent like clothes size weren't a surpise to her, if anything she was shocked only that the sweats that went up her flabby legs went up all the way. Karen wasn't as tall as she used to be, her shrinkage putting her just a hair shorter than Batgirl who was bigger in the thighs anyway. But the t-shirt was more difficult, it was a big garment but she was a very big girl. The shirt stopped several inches above her belly button, the pale, stretch marked sprawl a deep muffin top all the way around, while the top part was so tight in the chest it kind of served as a bra for her droopy hooters, whose aereola were pressed tight against the cotton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get her chest as comfortable as it could be, Karen tried calling Supergirl to see if she still needed a pick up. When there wasn't an answer she sighed and used an app to summon one of her company's self driving electric SUVs from NYC. The estimated time was over an hour due to the snow and the powerless alien let out a sigh, what ever was she going to do in the mean time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how many veggie burgers for you?\" Babs yelled, \"they're a new anonymous kind, supposed to taste just like beef...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren wiped sweat off of her forehead, drawing in as deep a breath as she could, which was a very tiny pant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair beneath her groaned in protest, just as her stomach gave an almighty gurgle of discomfort. Karen tried to stand up but while her ankles pressed her feet down, it didn't translate to any motion in her legs. The CEO tried to speak speak but all that came out was a loud moan. She put her chubby hand on her stomach and tried to massage it, but her weak arm and food addled wits didn't allow much force to be transmitted. Her phone dinged on the table, a reminder that her self driving ride had been there for half an hour and she moaned at the effort of thinking about it. When she'd first woken up at the Clocktower, Power Girl had been afraid that the genius Barbara would figure out she was responsible for fattening everyone up, but instead Barbara had just fattened her up even more. She hadn't expected Babs of being a feeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you really let go didn't you?\" Barbara said, rubbing a relatively smaller belly, \"guess that's what its like to have a superhuman hunger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"urgh,\" Karen groaned, one hand reaching weekly towards the tenth veggie burger, not quite able to fully reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whine of supportive machinery, the recovering vigilante got up tugged her shirt over her belly where it rode right back up and waddled over. The weight limit indicator lights on the exoskeleton's harness had gone from green to yellow, for Barbara had eaten five burgers of her own, three orders of fries and two milk shakes but that was her normal meal. Of course, ten burgers was Karen's normal too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you don't have a superhuman physique to take it, eh? Man you really are a fat girl through and through, eh? You really are a fat girl anymore huh?\" Babs said, picking up the burger and holding it to Karen's mouth, the blonde automatically munching on it, \"you're sitting there green to the gills about to puke and you still want more food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...more,\" Karen whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sick as a dog, about to hurl...but she was still hungry. Usually she ate ten burgers with a matching number of fry orders as a snack, her super human durability letting her gorge past human satiation and her appetite demanded more even as she was about to pass out. It amazed the CEO to watch herself eat the burger, feeling her stomach push her borrowed sweats lower. She felt Barbara's still nimble if very plump fingers dance across her stomach's turgid surface, immensely pleasurable sensations following. Just as Oracle could hack through any firewall, the flick of her finger tips turned Karen's misery into joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, just begging for more food and a belly rub,\" the ex-batgirl went on with a smile, \"where's that alpha bitch attitude now that your powers are gone? You're so weak and cute, you need somebody to feed and take care of you don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo,\" Power Girl groaned, some measure of pride trying to deny it even as she the redhead wiped her mouth off with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chubby, weak little Karen,\" the green eyed woman grinned, waddling away, \"you're so cute, you're like the class fat girl who needs helped out, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not,\" the chair bound blonde wheezed as Barbara came back, sixteen ounces of milk shake in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then stop me feeding you this milkshake,\" Oracle teased, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's fingers kind of twitched, but that was the end of her protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, after being helped to her feet and dosed with pepto-bismol, the blonde waddled to the clocktower's elevator wearing a borrowed coat that couldn't hope to zip up. Barbara smiled to see the crack of Karen's ass over the top of her skin tight sweats, her remade friend having to lean back to avoid her gut being closed in the door. It was always good to repair a relationship, especially when you could be sure of seeing more and more of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Karen waddled to the waiting self driving car. She moaned as snow flakes landed on her exposed gut, steaming almost as they landed from the vast heat of her digestion. The obese woman practically fell into the back seat, ordering the car to Wayne Manor and then, with trembling fingers, ordering cruise tickets and slowly falling asleep as the car navigated the snowy streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis part of the trip at least should be easy peasy, in and out. Selina was another knowing fatty, all she'd have to do would be to grab one college freshman and go. Its not like there was going to be some sort of even more insanely talented feeder Batgirl waiting in ambush for her, was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Wayne Manor, the boys were already off doing various billionaire/genius college things. Stephanie Brown and Kara Zor-El were slumbering naked with extra chocolates by their sides. Selina was snoring in her breakfast nap nook, sexy nightie about to burst around the swell of her late morning sleep eating. Down in the cave, a sweaty Cass finished her thousandth pull up of the morning and felt a strange sense of anticipation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karen's car had sat in front of stately Wayne Manor for over ten minutes before she even began rolling out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo runner at the end of a marathon had ever been more tired than the over gorged Kryptonian was. PG had been a big eater for years and had been munching down Anonymous food down for months but today was the first time she was experiencing the aftereffects of at least two and a quarter immense feeding sessions. She was drunk on food, her own engorgement inebriating her to the point she couldn't even think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she could at last slide out of the car, her stomach almost pulling her to the ground via its sheer weight, Karen lumbered through the snow. Damian, as part of one assigned punishment or another, had shoveled it off and salted the walk, but the obese heroine took pathetically small steps, heart thumping out of fear of falling. Her state of hopefully temporary powerlessness was leaving the plump PG properly paranoid of pain and injury, not helped by the biting cold stinging her exposed stomach and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren thanked Rao that the door opened before she reached it, showing the proper form of the Waynes' loyal retainer Alfred. The Butler's eyebrow rose towards his bald pate at the sight of the obese, hunched blob timidly waddling across the walk, treating the treated gravel as if it was a minefield. Distaste for the young's lack of proper etiquette surged through the Butler, that the youngish woman was wearing sweat pants outside the home firstly but that it was drastically undersized was another matter entirely. That slovenly obesity was becoming so common among young women such as Mistress Selina was bad enough but the Mistress of the House was at least maintaining a proper style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is calling this morning?\" the proper Butler asked with a slight hint of disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ka-Karen Starr,\" the obese blonde wheezed, taking tiny steps lest she fall until she was blissfully in the warmth of the mansion, \"for Se-Selina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about ten degrees farenheit outside and while fat was a wonderful insulator, the sheer volume of Power Girl's barred bulk meant heat was being leached out of her. Her teeth chattered and all of her much exposed skin was reddened with cold, from her cherubic cheeks to her bulging gut rolls, while her rock hard nipples were visible through her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Alfred said, knowing that this woman was a member of the community and saddened yet another young heroine had succumbed to obesity, why couldn't more of them show restraint like Mistress Cassandra?, \"Follow me please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed much warmer in the immense mansion which combined with the rapid pace the Butler set as he went into the kitchen brought another problem: the frigid Kryptonian soon warmed up by the end of the foyer and was feeling comfortable through the cavernous billiards room, a bit toasty in the secondary dining room and beaded with sweat past the entrance to the reading room. Karen began to wheeze, wondering how big the house could be and it it would be bad form to ask for a sit down break and a soda to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after possibly a thousand miserable steps, some of them even across stairs, Karen was at last led to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina Kyle had a natural aversion to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was after all the Catwoman, even if her cat suit was now retired and too small to get past her cankle. Maritime heists were something she refused to ever do, she didn't even like getting into the dock districts. But there was an exception when the water was hot and bubbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uber-pear socialite leaned back in the manor's indoor hot tub, foaming water sloshing against the formidable boobs surging in their too tight mono-kini top top. Selina had been decently busty before accidentally infecting herself, an event the virus had erased fully from her memory, but after gaining more than a hundred pounds in just a few months was still wearing the same bras as when she ran several miles a day. Her band size might have grown as she accumulated backfat, but the Catburglar's cups had grown not an inch, even as her perfect derrier went from traffic stopping tight to so wide and thick a car might bounce off it. Catwoman didn't mind the explosive growth down stairs and thanks to her infecting most of Gotham's upper classes and her own dear Brucey neither did anyone else she knew, but did feel a bit miffed that her bust was a bit below average anymore, especially once the huge busted Starfire had begun to hang around the manor more. But the early stages of pregnancy were at last giving her a new swell, firming up her slightly droopy bust and pushing her into the E range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSipping orange juice, and already morning not being able to put champagne in it, the socialite thought about new outfits to draw attention to her growing chest while spying on her step-daughter and friends in the manor pool. Swimming was a good way to build muscle and endurance without harming the joints, something that roof top running vigilantes always had to worry about, and thus the Wayne Manor had a massive indoor pool intended for laps. The only one currently using it for that was Cassandra, powerful strokes and kicks propelling her through the water for lap after lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina frowned at that. Her step-daughter should really be resting, the poor baby pushed herself far too hard even when she wasn't wounded. Really the thought of her even going out at night to run around on the slick, cold roof tops, let alone fight ninjas and bank robbers with just her hands, stressed Selina out something fierce. She was lucky she dealt with stress so well, otherwise she might indulge in something to ease her fears, the short haired socialite thought as she filled her mouth with bon bons. Why couldn't Cass be more like her friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake Stephanie for instance. The retired Spoiler was relaxing in an intertube float, wearing a purple string bikini left at the manor when she'd been an uber fit vigilante. Its strings barely tied around significantly meatier hips, Steph's spoiled, stuffed paunch pressed the tiny triangular pantie down and her very large, heavy breasts surged out of the tiny top in every direction. The blonde girl looked pampered and lazy and wasn't even yet a real member of the upper class like Selina or Cassandra were. Selina thought that the blonde was an adorably sweet girl who'd make an excellent future wife for Tim or even Cass, she wasn't one to judge, and was happy she'd stopped risking herself through foolish exertions. Catwoman had been so happy her step-daughter had made a friend and had hoped the expanding Stephanie would rub off on her daughter in more ways than one, but while the blonde had ballooned, the Batgirl had remained as dangerously lithe and head strong as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to hurt herself,\" Selina grumbled and yelled at her stubborn adopted child, \"Cassandra, Cassandra! Stop swimming laps this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fast swimming Batgirl steadfastly ignored her, feigning ignorance as she kicked through the water. Selina huffed and considered grounding the ex-assassin, which would do nothing considering the girl had no social life at all, but she needed to be stopped anyway before she hurt herself. Ultimately the socialite didn't budge an inch except to grab more bon bons. The salt water hot tub was very warm and comfy, her knees had been complaining of late and standing up was so hard. And the pool area was chilly outside of it, the pale woman's sensitive skin would shiver and shake to be so exposed unless absolutely necessary. But she was thankfully very rich, so Selina did what the rich usually do: get someone poorer to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie!\" Selina shouted, after swallowing more chocolate, \"Stephanie! Can you please get Cassandra's attention for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghhh, I don't know Mrs. Wayne,\" Spoiler moaned, rubbing a stomach swollen to the bursting point with the absolutely massive pile of soy bacon, waffles and cage free eggs Cass had stuffed her with that morning, \"I'm so full...if I get into the water I might cramp up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Selina, the triumphant Batgirl had celebrated popping her cherry with a threesome by feeding both of its other participants to the point of bursting when the chubby blondes had at last pulled themselves from bed. Between the unaccustomed exertions of the night before and the gorge session neither Steph nor the house guest Kara had an ounce of energy to seemingly spare. Selina spared a glance at Lois Lane's step-daughter, a hip heavy pear who's fat, lazy legs were stretched out from hefty hip to chubby toe on a pink raft. She was in a white one piece that barely fit around a stomach so turgid it didn't have a single roll, a state that Selina only reached five or six times a day. The alien girl looked totally gravid, pinned to the floating raft by her balloon belly, but Selina knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, please be a dear and fetch Cassandra over here please,\" the green eyed Catwoman asked politely, \"I need someone strong to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's slightly bleary eyes opened. The blonde alien had awoken rejuvenated from her first sexy feeding session/massage/threesome of the night before, to the point that her unreliable powers had kicked back in just in time for Cass to stuff her to the point of exploding. Yawning, Kara floated into the air and the fat alien refugee bent lo to catch the rapidly swimming Cassandra up from the water. Even the world's greatest martial artist couldn't do much against against a Kryptonian, no matter how lazy. The blonde alien gave her a soft kiss on the cheek and then Cass was unceremoniously plopped into the hot tub, the assassin looking grumpy with her sinewy arms crossed over her chest, and Kara smiled and then drifted back to her raft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to relax dear,\" Selina insisted now that she had her step daughter's attention, \"I'm so glad you're making friends but you should be off floating with them instead of exercising on your injuries, especially after you barely ate anything at breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" the quiet girl insisted, \"I want to get back to patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are in no state to be on patrol young lady!\" Selina insisted, shifting one immense hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, the Batgirl was fine. Her injuries had fully healed and she was better rested than ever, but telling that to Selina would be like convincing the socialite that she had used to be skinny. Cass had tried that when she'd first been told that her current lipomania might not be natural but Selina had been in complete denial, claiming to have always been a big girl despite the size two cat suit on display in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for the rest of the weekend, you're going to wait right here and find some way to spend your time!\" Selina insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Alfred walked primly into the room, the waddling, wheezing house guest following along behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Selina, you have a guest. One Miss Starr, will you be requiring anything else?\" the Butler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More bon bons please and perhaps some donuts...its been a bit since breakfast,\" Selina said, \"and some snacks for Miss Starr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt puzzled Selina why  Power Girl's secret identity was here. She didn't know her that well, although she knew that they'd met before. It was almost like they'd collaborated on something important but she couldn't remember for the life of her what that was. Power Girl's puffing breath and heavy foot steps announced her presence, the pale immensely fat woman with her gigantic breasts immediately drawing the eye. Cassandra's eyes almost bulged out of her head, while Catwoman...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina ran her eyes over the pale, rotund mass that huffed and wobbled into the vast pool room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl had continued inflating over the last few months, going from merely very chubby and out of shape to laughably obese. She was well over three hundred pounds of toneless lard crammed into snug sweat pants and a shirt that rode up to her chest, letting a milk white, striated gut sag over her groin. The Kryptonian's famous breasts had gone from slightly saggy to floppy parodies about to pop out of her shirt. Chins bulged under her pale face as she desperately sucked in air, the walk from the driveway to the pool room having left her so winded she could barely stand. Selina tut tutted under her breath, she'd remembered Power Girl was getting chubby and out of shape the last time they'd met...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen had they met last time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen, ah take a seat,\" the Catwoman said as the alien wobbled up, her duties as Mistress of the House supplanting her rebudding memory, planting a flattened ass onto a groaning set of pool furniture, \"you're looking good. To what do we owe the pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rao, Jesus,\" the alien wheezed, fanning herself in the temperate room, rivulets of sweat turning her t-shirt black, \"just here to check in on Kara...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Karen!\" the blonde fatty in question cooed floating up again from her float and jetting over, wrapping her huge titted doppleganger in a tight, soft hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Zor-El was in a tight red one piece that her flabby ass and meaty hips poured out of, with her turgid belly tested the limits of its spandex. The wheezing Power Girl patted her shoulder, having the new and uncomfortable experience of being hugged by a Kryptonian while being a mere mortal. Back and side fat poured over Kara's skinny arms and Selina wondered whether Karen would even be able to shove herself into the costume she'd worn when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they'd met for Power Girl to give her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I didn't return your call!\" Kara said rapidly, \"I got a bit uh, tied up yesterday, and forgot to charge my phone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTied up had been a very accurate description of the Supergirl's status at the time. Tied up up, stuffed to the brim with junk food and with a face between her thighs to be more specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to make sure you were okay,\" the horribly out of shape Power Girl wheezed, wiping sweat off her forehead, \"I'm gonna...I'm gonna lay down now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren Starr flopped back against the pool chair, Australian cleavage pouring out from the bottom of her t-shirt as she gasped in and out. She was breathing just as hard from the walk as she had from flying over to her that morning when she'd given Selina the dose of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look that good,\" Kara told the near passed out blonde, \"are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone a bit too long without getting a tan,\" the once superbly fit Karen huffed poking her thin, flabby arm, \"not at my best...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a large sneeze, her very first and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be getting a cold,\" she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold...like a virus. Rusty gears started turning in Selina's mind as she remembered finishing her morning run around the manor's trails, when had she run?, and meeting the fat, sweaty alien who'd given her a packet of crystalized virus. A virus that was going too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get soup!\" Cass said quickly, springing out of the water with athletic grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina took in her step daughter's lithe, muscular physique: hard muscular legs, narrow hips, abdominals so cut they seemed jagged and hard, sinewy arms. Her normal matronly concern over how skinny Cass was chimed in her head, but jogged a memory over how her own body looked the last time she saw Power Girl: endless toned legs, a tautly round ass a coin would bounce off, a carefully toned six pack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to sit in the pool?\" Kara asked the wheezing Power Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to but I'd need a suit,\" the pale CEO said, \"unless you have a K cup bikini top at hand, I'm a growing girl anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman stood up shakily, her weak legs trembling as she broke the hot tub's surface with a sploosh of displaced water. The ex-thief looked down at herself, taking in the stuffed lower belly roll pressing her monokini taut, her hips stretching wider than her field of vision and then at last her swollen, weak, legs. Thighs so thick they were forming into rolls and swallowing her knees, cankles like jello hanging towards her feet. Not quite believing what she saw, Selina put her thick, clumsy fingers onto the cellulite studded, spongy mass of her sagging ass cheeks, gasping at the weight and at the heavy slap that sounded when she released it and it slammed against the back of her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's mouth fell open, making her new third chin pop out, and she collapsed back into the hot tub with a splash. She sat their mentally numb as the jets made her fat layers wiggle and jiggle, trying to comprehend what had happened to her lean sexy body, the carefully honed slinky figure that had made her one of the most successful thieves in the world. That agile ruthless thief was gone, months of snacking, over eating and gorging having changed it day by day into a lazy, bloated, sedate, huge assed society matron who spent her scant not eating hours fussing over her step-daughter and a broodmare for the latest Wayne heir. Selina swallowed, realizing that she'd doubled in size, turning into an engorged fatty who'd never run across roof tops again and would be lucky if she could ever touch her toes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered glutting herself, she remembered Bruce complimenting her growing curves. Their sex life had gotten better and better as she'd gotten fatter and fatter, a process that had sky rocketed as she'd spent more and more time around her step-daughter. But surely Cassandra wouldn't fatten her up, she was so sweet and innocent...her treacherous stomach rumbled, demanding more food when the smell of a rich, hearty soup hit her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra walked gracefully in, wearing only her swim suit and a pair of oven mitts while pushing a huge cart of bowls of rich french onion soup, steaming fresh bread and bubbling glasses of Sprite. It had to weigh sixty pounds or more but the lithe ex-assassin showed no sign of strain, in fact she looked to be almost skipping as she came in and stopped it next to the porcine house guests. Her step-daughter was grinning ear to ear and she dunked one loaf of bread into a steaming bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, really, I don't think I can eat another bite,\" Power Girl tried to say, hands rubbing a stomach still taut from being stuffed by the previous Batgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once mighty heroine's arms tried to fend off the bread but the depowered Karen had no chance against the world's deadliest feeder. Cass' hand artfully dodged around PG's guard and plopped the steaming fresh bread into her mouth. Karen's eyes rolled back into her head as she began automatically chewing, Batgirl grinning as the blonde's cheeks bulged. Kara and then Stephanie took up their own bowls and started feasting, Cass ensuring each of them had a steady supply of soda and bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's memories of the last months came into focus. She remembered taking the virus packet from the fat, sweaty Power Girl to dose her friend Lois with, involving herself in a scheme to both save the world and ensure she wouldn't have to worry about feminine competition as she got further into her thirties. Catwoman recalled feeling strangely ill and incredibly hungry after dosing Lois, gorging herself all night as she sweated through a fever. She remembered the little virus shooting through the Manor over the weekend, Bruce getting the sniffles and her quiet step-daughter looking bedraggled after coming home from a mission...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bread is so good, Cass,\" Steph said through a mouthful, \"where'd you get it so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew you'd be hungry,\" the lithe Assassin said, grinning at the collection of over fed blondes she'd accumulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's gut, still packed from all the breakfast favorites Cass had made sure were ready fro her, gurgled for more food even as her mind realized that Cass had been stuffing her to the brim for months. The obese Catwoman felt her mouth simultaneously water in hunger and go dry in fear. She'd become a fat, lazy, pampered house cat begging to get fatter...but now she was aware of how fat she was. Her pudgy fingers poked her flabby body, finding that she had a deep roll of hip fat over her thighs, and was both turned on and horrified by it. The rewritten parts of her mind begged her to get fatter, turned on by her soft helplessness, while her conscious mind was demanding that she start dieting and exercising now lest she be a fat house wife forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman stood up again, limbs trembling in fear and at realizing that she'd doubled in size. She started hauling herself out of the steaming hot tub, mouth open in exertion and walked straight into a loaf of bread dipped in soup and cheese. Cass was on the other side, smiling as her step-mother bit into the bread. A smile split Selina's mouth at the food, one that didn't reach her terrified green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up,\" Batgirl smiled, one nimble, callused hand patting Selina's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina swallowed, looked at the gorging trio of blondes digging into the heavy cart Cass had pushed in with all the restraint of sharks at a feeding frenzy. The previous epitome of buff, Power Girl could barely sit up. The rail thin Supergirl's ass rivaled her own. The lithe Spoiler's tits were bigger than her head. And Cass looked like the cat who'd swallowed the canary, the only thin woman left in the room looking ecstatic at being here with all of these helpless fatties to bulk up, even now refilling the other's drinks while Selina finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta get out of here,\" Selina whispered as she finished the entire loaf of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Story Diverges</b><br>\r\n<b>American Gorge Story</b>: they're trapped in the manor with a dangerous feeder<br>\r\n<b>The Fat Cure</b>: Selina gets ahold of Ivy, begging for help</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina hurried towards the door, her suddenly aware mind realizing just how slowly she was moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear fifty inch hips wove and shook, her old slinky, seductive strut slowed down to a parody of itself. A glass struck from an errant sway made her blush in embarrassment and she started moving faster because her step daughter had turned away from her trio of stuffed blondes. For a moment she thought she was running just from the effort put in, but by her progress across the tile, Catwoman realizing she was merely achieving a fast waddle. Thick thighs smacked and rubbed together, the friction drying the hot tub's salt water off in moments and causing her to chafe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFight or flight mode was kicking in, but Selina wasn't really capable of running. So plumply round were her thighs that a medium-fast waddle was all she could manage, even as her bruised and battered ego yelled at her to escape this fat trap she lived in before it was too late. Halfway panicking, Selina made it to the front door just as she started to sweat, her busy schedule of dress fittings and being a smothering step-mom to multiple kids having kept her in better shape than Power Girl even if she at twenty hours a day. Not thinking of what she was going to do besides escape, Catwoman pulled open the main doors and was greeted but a blast of 0 degree air and snow that sent goose pimples running over her fair skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow storm outside was getting worse and worse, turning into a record setting blizzard. Selina pushed the doors closed with difficulty, finding that while her super thick thighs remained at least a little strong, her once corded arms had lost all their strength even after swelling up into floppy, meaty jigglers. The wind blew hard, bringing tears from her eyes but then the door suddenly closed. Selina gave a relieved sigh and turned around, walking right into the only hard body at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're afraid,\" Cass stated, her body language ability barely needed to read Selina's blatant fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did need all her self discipline to avoid staring too much at the heavy, cold hardened nipples poking through the retired thief's monokini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass, I uh,\" Selina stammered, suddenly afraid of her step daughter again, \"mommy is just feeling a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the first time she'd seen Cassandra, then just a black shadow atop a museum roof. The then lithe and athletic Catwoman had smiled, assuming it was either Bruce, meaning a chase and a roof top seduction, or one of his brats which would mean some taunting and an easy escape. She'd spent a month in a cast before she could break out of prison then and was if anything far more afraid of the muscular girl in front of her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina had, in infecting herself, somehow turned her daughter into some sort of perverted savant. Why Cass was immune she couldn't explain but the girl's feeder tendencies in the past months were obvious now that Selina wasn't concerned with stuffing herself. And if Selina could remember that she'd done this whole insane scheme just to stay relatively skinny, then surely the ultra fit Batgirl would realize what had happened to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Cass said, wrapping her hard, sinewy arms around Selina's marshmallowy body in a deep bear hug, \"you're just hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry,\" Selina tried to deny, for food was the last thing the once svelte woman needed, just existing as a fat assed housewife was causing irreparable damage to her ego, only for her stomach to give a gigantic bear like growl that reverberated through both women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Cass smiled, dragging her by the wrist towards the kitchen, \"you're already a great mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was touched, part of the pampered and devoted house wife she'd become purring through. In her shock she'd almost forgotten being pregnant...but her shame at being so fat and lazy came back as her daughter led her through the mansion's halls. Every mirror compared the fatless, muscular, perfect save for gunshot scars Batgirl to the 251lb blob that was Selina Kyle, who'd gained a hundred and twenty pounds before getting knocked up. Fat quakes ran across her arms, her cellulite coated ass bounced like basketballs, her FUPA hung out of her swim suit and even after going up a cup size her once perky knockers seemed under sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst part was, Selina was getting turned on by her own obesity. Damn her ass was at last getting that sag to it that she wanted and the spread of cellulite under her spider veins across the inflated moonscape of her thighs drove her wild. And her cankles, damn, they were starting to droop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgh, what the hell was she thinking!? Selina shouldn't be getting turned on by the sight of her doubled body, she should be infuriated. She should be calling Ivy and demanding a cure, going on a diet, getting emergency lipo suction and strapping herself to an exercise bike for a year. Not being led into the kitchen with panties wetter than when she'd been in the hot tub and so hungry she couldn't think!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit,\" Cass ordered, plopping her step-mother down into a comfy, extra wide chair next to the little table in the manor's vast kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass sweaty, I'm not hungry,\" Selina lied, belly rumbling, \"I've been putting on a lot of weight lately and its not healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too skinny,\" the Batgirl said, opening the fridge and pulling out food, \"you're eating for two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass, I'm obese, I need to lose weight,\" Selina tried denying, only for Cassandra to plop an entire plate of gingerbread men onto the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snack, whet your appetite,\" Cass said, starting to cook the real meal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA click of switches later, when did the quiet girl become so skilled at cooking?, and half a gallon of cream was busy boiling for cocoa. Cassandra hummed the nutcracker prince to herself as her ripped arms and assassins fingers chopped, cut, mixed and stirred ten dishes at once. Selina's green eyes bulged at seeing the vast amount of food being laid out, even split with the three bulging blondes fattening up in the pool room she'd be stuffed to the point of bursting! The last thing she needed was to eat a bunch of delicious gingerbread cookies decorated to look like Batman and Catwoman with gumdrop eyes and thick, sugary icing that made her mouth water as she swallowed down her third one. These things were nothing but empty calories and she didn't need a one of them, let alone six!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina groaned, realizing that the plate in front of her was empty and she was still hungry even as her belly was swelling out, stretching the black mono-kini tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wash it down,\" Cass said, putting a small cauldron of steaming, ultra creamy hot cocoa topped with a tower of whipped cream in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassandra, dear, I can't eat like...oh this cocoa is good,\" Selina purred, carefully lapping it up, \"heavenly in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman knew she had to get out of here. She had to escape the warm kitchen, she had to stop drinking cocoa and get out of here. It would take weeks to work this binge off before exercise touched the rest of her bulk. She had to get out of here and run!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina tried to push herself up, trying to think like a hardened criminal escaping an interrogation again. Only instead of a confession, it would cost her her mobility. Desperate, she managed to get vertical just in time for her phone to go off, Cass having thoughtfully put it on by her plate. Bruce's picture was on it and the obese Catwoman felt head over heels, mushy gushy school girl emotions shoot through her head to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi lover, I need you,\" she purred, thoughts of being tied up, hand fed and petted shooting through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass smiled and put a plate heavy with fresh salad in front of her step-mom. A fresh salad who's greens, tomatoes and carrots were buried in heavy anonymous blue cheese dressing, cheese crumbles, croutons and bacon bits, with fresh bread sticks steaming next to it. Batgirl smiled, eating her own dressing-less salad as her mother gorged unthinkingly, eyes filled up with love. And love needed vegetables and fat to fuel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that she was that attracted to fat girls, although the wobbling flap of fatty flesh made her hum, it was that Cass loved making other people feel safe. And if feeling safe meant being stuffed to the brim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, you'll be away on business for the rest of the weekend?\" Selina asked, polishing off the salad, \"you better describe what you'll do to me when you get back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass laid down a bowl of freshly stirred chocolate pudding, Anonymous brand of course. Chocolate is the food of anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I can wait until monday,\" Selina sighed a minute later, spoon scraping the bottom of the large bowl when she hung up, \"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl placed a heavy plate of fresh french fries and a steamy burger of what Anonymous claimed was beef in front of her mom, then sat down in front of her own plate of eggs and vegetables. Selina was done with the immense lunch plate before Cass could finish, sopping up ketchup with the last of her fries. Catwoman laid back and groaned, stomach rising up from her like a body like a mountain from the sea. Green eyes blinked at the dome of food, horribly contemplating just how many thousands of calories would be coursing from it to her thighs and wondering if there was a way to stop the beyond skin tight monokini from cutting into her sensitive skin...and despairing of ever being skinny again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass smiled down at her, drawing a small pairing knife and cutting the fabric free in an expert flash. Selina groaned in relief, sighs rising as strong fingers began massaging her stomach. She felt herself drifting off towards sleep, body pinned by a stomach so large she doubted she could get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a great mom, loving and sweet,\" Batgirl told her, memories of her own fit, murderous mother cutting in, \"soft and caring. Fat and lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed Selina's forehead as she started snoring and left to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Aunt Karen, do you think you might feel better in the pool?\" Supergirl asked, high voice full of concern and mouth full of fresh bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt amazed Power Girl, a glutton of gluttons, that anyone could be eating after downing so much soup but the other Kryptonian was still shotgunning loves of bread to feed her carb addiction. Unlike her older dopple danger, Kara was a pear. Her upper body, with its double chin, sloppy Cs and flabby stomach was merely life long chubby, but the once tiny blonde's lower half was clearly soaking up the majority of her weight. Bee-stung thighs pressed warmly together, altering her stance with their width, and her shelf like ass was swelling so wide its striated bulk visible from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie Brown nodded, making her own heavy boobs bounce, \"Oh yeah after a little snack like this a swim helps relax my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly retired Spoiler patted the beer-barrel bulge of her gut, which sloshed with half a gallon of salty french onion soup and two full loaves of bread. Swollen up, the belly was starting to sag and push Steph's panties down with it, a porten of what was to come.Spoiler's body still bore signs of the agile athlete she'd been, she could even still be called tentatively \"strong fat\" although Brown didn't have much time left of it having abandoned strength training. Her biceps flexed still when her arms bent, there was tone to her calves and her breasts remained firm thanks to strong pectoral muscles but they were tentative. Spoiler was really getting an apple shape, her pregnant looking gut was promising to soon double onto itself as soon as she crossed 200lbs and her cleavage was starting to tilt downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't want to get a cramp,\" Power Girl moaned, \"especially after a gorge like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall blonde lay flat on her back on a pool chair, relatively thin, flabby arms hanging to the floor. It was hard for Karen to see past her tits, even unsupported and hanging to the sides as they were, but her swelling stomach was raising up and up, the pale sphere a rising moon. The CEO knew she shouldn't have eaten so much, especially after the double breakfast Gordon had stuffed her with, but French Onion soup was a weakness of hers...to the tune of a full gallon sloshing around in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I don't have a suit,\" she moaned again, gesturing to her sweat darkened athleisure wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could really use a belly rub, a gentle set of powerful fingers rubbing her tender belly with cool cream and prodding the gurgling bomb of a gut until it relaxed. But asking either of the two chubette blondes in front of her would be too awkward and Karen was too weak and stuffed to do it herself. For the first time she wished that Harley was with her, the ex-psychologist might be insane but she was an attentive feeder. Closing her eyes and indulging in fantasy, Power Girl groaned again, as an authoritative voice sounded in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, buy her a suit,\" Cassandra ordered, striding back into the room silently, her jet black swimmer's bikini showing off her hard muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this? Nobody in Gotham is going to be open,\" Super-Girl said, gesturing at the blizzard outside, \"and I left my purse in Metropolis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Florida is open,\" Batgirl smiled, dexterously drawing a limitless credit card pilfered from Selina's purse out of her bra, \"you can make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass slid the card quickly into the alien girl's bra, gave her a quick peck on the cheek and a playful slap onto Kara's basketball sized rear end. Kara gave a giggle and hovered into the air, shooting towards the door. Karen watched her go, noticing the immense girth and droop of the girl's matronly hips and sagging cheeks, with a burst of jealousy at the younger alien's maintained ability to fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl was still in a professional swimmer's bikini, which showed off her bulging, diamond cut abdominal muscles and hard, intimidating thighs. Her stride was quick, soundless and purposeful, absolutely nothing touching. Karen's eyes cracked open to see her, the sight of the half asian girl causing her to feel a bit of fear. Given how fat Selina was, the Catwoman must have been infected by accident or purpose the day Karen gave her the virus, but her step daughter was still chiseled when she should have been even more of a cream puff than her friends. Her ability to avoid becoming a lardass was unnerving, as were the occasional glances the short, scarred girl gave at Karen's supine form on her way to Stephanie's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking good,\" the quiet vigilante smiled, running her callused fingers over Stephanie's sensitive gut, making the taller woman moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, the new diet's really helping me meet some gains,\" Steph said, flexing a chubby arm, bicep sort of rising, \"I'm really feeling stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer, Cass pinched the suet soft underflap of the blonde's tricep, earning a girlish squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to eat more,\" she smiled, \"you're losing muscle mass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I could eat anymore, I think I might need to actually lift again, its been a while,\" Stephanie said, patting her gravid-seeming stomach, new stretch marks starting to form, \"and after all that soup I'm about to pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" the muscular Batgirl insisted, pressing her fingers to the knuckle against Stephanie's stomach, \"room for desert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde moaned as food moved inside her and the much stronger, shorter Cass pressed in close, planting a strong kiss onto her girlfriend's lips and coping a quick feel of her bikini busting cleavage. Stephanie leaned into it, but blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass, there's people,\" she said sheepishly, shocked and enticed by the once shy girl's forwardness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't mind, go get ice cream,\" Batgirl insisted, \"desert time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie giggled and walked off, a bounce going up her still shapely legs, over the expanded bulk of her belly and into her over full bust. Cass watched her go, the purple thong disappearing up behind Steph's cheeks, then turned towards the supine, Power Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" the scary girl said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Karen gulped, trying to sit up and going nowhere, too much food and too little muscle pinning her flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're afraid,\" the mobile brunette opined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not at all,\" Karen stammered, her guilt becoming overwhelming, \"what would I have to be afraid of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould this girl know Karen's responsibility in the fat epidemic? Could the martial artist know her impressive figure had only been saved by obesity by random chance? Was she about to get revenge for her girlfriends turning from athletes to couch potatoes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty,\" the martial artist insisted, reading the nervousness by the set of the blonde's milky shoulders, \"powerless. Helpless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong finger tapped against Power Girl's outie belly button with each word, ripples of fat going through her balloon belly. It made Karen confront her powerless state, until she got a lot of solar energy she couldn't outfight a puppy. She was totally at the buff girl's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, no, its just that I\"m,\" Karen huffed, trying to get her deflated arms behind her but lacking the strength, \"a little out of shape and I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being helpless,\" the dark haired girl observed, fingers starting to run up and down Karen's belly, tapping and thrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the obese blonde asked, \"No, I hate being like this. Yesterday I could fly, today I can't even get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being weak,\" Batgirl went on, pressing harder onto the blonde's huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, ohhhh that feels good, I don't...,\" Karen moaned, a pulsating warmth flowing from her stomach, \"I like being super powered...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be told what to do,\" the living lie detector said, reading the truth through the blonde's protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm...a badass...ooohhhhhh,\" Power Girl sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be protected and dominated,\" Batgirl finished, seeing Karen's tea cup nipples bulge against her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Karen gasped, unable to deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to be huge, so fat she couldn't get up. She wanted someone else to look after her, to tell her what to do and take care of her while she ate and ate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're hungry,\" Cassandra finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm...yes, oh Rao yes i am...,\" Karen said when her belly gave a mighty rumble, impossibly hungry after the stuffing, Cass massage having freed up a vast amount of room, \"How did you do this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie wobbled into the room, balancing three tubs of ice cream in her arms. The spoiler set two onto a table and eagerly dug into the third, a quart of strawberry with her spoon. Cassandra's self image as a resolute, commanding feeder wavered when a droplet of the stuff splattered onto her girlfriend's heavy jugs and her mind exploded with lust, but she had just enough iciness in her stilted tone when she spoke to Power Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, only one question. Chocolate or vanilla?\" her tormentor asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the end of the long weekend, Cass was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuiet she might be, but the young ex-assassin was also contemplative. Speaking little gave her plenty of time to think, especially during the long naps of the stuffed, lazy foursome of ex-heroines she was pampering ever deeper into obesity (although she'd also slipped out and done some crime fighting while her mom/girlfriend/fuck buddy/guest were sleeping off a few gallons of cake batter). And whether she was rapidly mixing together batter or darting silently from an alley after a mugger, Cass was considering the ever expanding waistlines of the other women and what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a type,\" she admitted to herself, padding back into the billiards room where she'd left them, still in her tight batgirl suit, \"blue eyed blonde fatties...who used to be fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie snored in a chair, topless and stuffed. While never as buff as her, Spoiler had been slender and athletic, with a (relatively) flat chest. Now she was over plump and slow moving, head sized breasts sprawling across her beer belly. She'd been a determined crime fighter if never the best, surviving just by grit as she accumulated skills, but now she'd just quit after getting chubby, becoming an assistant \"chick with a computer\" for Tim and Cass without a word of complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl was passed out on the floor, chubby thighs spread wide and still touching, a pair of borrowed sweat pants ripping off her. Although she'd never known the alien, had been even thinner, a tiny little tinker bell. But now she had an ass thick enough to stop bullets even if it hadn't been made out of Kryptonian cells. Although her superhuman powers remained, sometimes, the other young woman was just as intent on being a lazy lardass as anyone else. Alone possessed of superhuman stomach stamina, the alien had tested even Cass' ability to feed a fatty, always the last to pass out from being overfull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl, snorring loudly in an open bathrobe while sat against a pool table, intrigued her though. Cass had known about the now very heavy heavy hitter. Had felt self conscious at her own small boobs when she'd seen posters of the atomic blonde in Tim's room. But nothing remained of the tall, tan, buff, confident woman. Her giant boobs had become a sagging parody of themselves, her skin was milk white and her body language was of a woman who was not only weak and unconfident, but revelling in it. Cassandra valued her own much weaker fighting prowess, she'd hate to lose her ability to help her friends and the innocent and loved being able to run, fight and jump, but Power Girl was turned on by it! It was very strange...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except you...,\" she said, stepping to her step-mom, spread-eagled across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman groaned in her sleep, her impossibly stuffed gut rising and falling with each whimper through the split fabric of her nightie. Cassandra had found her step-mom weeping quietly in the attic, a long walk for such a lazy woman, and decided to counter the handful of calories burned with enough muffin batter to feed a small ballgame. Catwoman's belly was so swelled up it had pulled even with her hips temporarily, the once slinky woman's door jammers a tidal wave of cookie dough spreading across the green felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you,\" Cass said, running her fingers down Selina's stuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd hated Catwoman. When she'd been a villain, Selina hadn't fought honestly, using her feminine wiles on Bruce, having been able to make her body language scream lust loud enough for anyone to read. Cass had hated that, not knowing how to do the same to anyone and had been jealous of the older woman's bustier build.She'd thought Selina vain and weak, knowing the increasingly less villainous Catwoman was afraid of Batgirl in turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were vain,\" Cass told her slumbering step mom, \"you were...seductive. Now you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's face was getting perfectly round. Guileless and soft, like a big marshmallow. All she did all day was either fret, wanting to make sure everyone was safe and cared for, or eat. Cass loved both of those traits, loved that somebody was treating her as a beloved family member and not just a woman and went inwardly wild to see her modelesque mom multiply in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So fat,\" Cass said, poking at stretchmarked thigh thick as her own waist, \"so lazy. A sweet, fat mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Batgirl hadn't seen first hand this lazy butterfly of lard emerge from the cocoon of the seductive Catwoman, she'd have never believed it. Selina was a fluffy, chubby housewife. An obese society socialite. The old Selina would have been fretting at what a pregnancy would do to her figure, this one was so fat no one would know she was knocked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Batgirl asked, cupping her own firm jaw in one hard hand, \"and why do I...like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd question to ask after two days of massive feeding. Of dumping slumbering fatties in tubs and filling them up with molten chocolate for them to eat their way out of. Of putting half a hundred Batsymbol sugar cookies into Selina's belly, making her look far more pregnant than she was. Of privately filling Stephanie to the brim with bread sticks and garlic butter, then making out with the chubby blonde until well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always liked you,\" the ex-assassin said, pacing over to Stephanie, seeing the fading muscle tone of her arms and legs, \"you were so funny. So pretty. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered Stephanie being bikini model slim. She remembered secretly loving Steph when the Spoiler was stick skinny, secretly touching herself to thoughts of the blonde as much as she did the middle Robin Tim. It seemed absurd, a sexy girl should be soft and fat and lazy, big and bloated and warm, but that would have been disgusting a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" she asked herself, sliding off her face covering mask, \"I didn't always, now I do...was she...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Girl's cruel words, claims that the fat fetish was a new thing, a disease came back to Cass. It had seemed strangely true then but she'd been suppressing dealing with it. Was it really true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a detective,\" Cass said to herself, abandoning the room of snoring, rumbling fatties, \"I have to know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass hurried quietly up to her room, opening up a drawer and carefully taking out a stack of well thumbed celebrity gossip mags focusing on Selina Wayne's weight gain since her marriage to Bruce seven months earlier. With some difficulty, the dyslexic girl determined the exact date of Selina's gain, then hurried down to the Batcomputer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery member of the family's entrances and exists were logged. A check of the house security tapes on that showed an unbelievably slim-fit Selina going running at 7 am, her tapered waist and slender legs making Cass blink to see. That was her lazy, doting mom? On the tape, Selina ran down the perimeter of the manor's large grounds, going gradually out of frame and not reappearing on the next camera for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using the blank spots,\" Cass hummed, catching a flash of a not-quite as obese as she was now Power Girl, \"Karen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fast forwarded the tapes, watching Selina come back home and eventually leave, having logged that she was going to lunch with Lois Lane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supergirl's mom...,\" Cass said, tapping her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Selina returned from the trip she was incredibly bloated, the first sign of her weight gain standing stark against her otherwise fit body, and she was clearly sick. She was sneezing and coughing, having a long bout just she went past Cass' door. Cassandra put her hand to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was right, I was infected...,\" Cass said, amazed, \"do I even like fatgirls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of Stephanie's swollen chest bounce out after Cass' nimble fingers had undone her bra. Of Selina wriggle herself out of a sports' cars narrow doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I like fatgirls. I don't want to change that,\" Batgirl said to herself, \"but, I need to make sure...someone did this. I have to find out who infected my step mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she could tell if the now whimpy Power Girl was lying on interrogation, training from the Batman meant she needed to get some more evidence before confronting her. She could surely finagle some sort of ...internship or something, getting herself and Stephanie in NYC and keep a close eye on the pale woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could keep an eye on Supergirl's Step Mom Lois Lane and see why the wife of the Man of Steel was now an obese food critic. It might be odd haunting the Kent's quiet farmhouse but she was sure she could figure out an excuse or two. Lois and Selina went out every once and while, surely she could figure out a way</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Really Miss Starr, thank you for the internship!\" Stephanie chirped as she pulled into Starr-Ware's executive parking spot right next to the elevator, \"We won't let you down, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you won't Stephanie, just try and drive a little slower next time, okay?\" the depowered Power Girl puffed from the driver's seat, wiping sweat from her brow after the younger, somewhat fitter blonde's harrowing first drive through NYC traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got here in one piece, didn't we?\" the retired Spoiler giggled, a moderate titty quake going through her tasteful cleavage, \"I wouldn't want us to be late on our first day as your interns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week after the fantastical feast weekend at Wayne Manor and they were in Power Girl's personal electric sports car, a flashy red vehicle who's suspension was starting to groan under the combined weight of its occupants. Stephanie Brown sat in the driver's seat, wearing a purple skirt suit that was painted over her super plush curves. Fantastic cleavage showed beneath the unbuttonable top two buttons, jiggling whenever the bubbly blonde laughed, while her more than substantial belly pressed her skirt out to rest on her beefy thighs. Steph's legs and arms still gave an appearance of strength, one that would last unless the increasingly sedate girl was asked to do anything athletic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car's owner rolled her eyes from the passenger seat, bending down to try and find her seat buckle past all of her blubber. Power Girl had been a very heavy girl a week ago, back when she'd still had a super powered metabolism. A week spent powerless and over eating Ivy's superfood was turning the once fearsome blonde into an ever more helpless fatty, blasting through the 300s at super speed. Karen's gigantic breasts defied easy measuring, an immense sports bra trying to keep the drooping zeppelins from hitting the floor, the left most boob surging up past its partner. Her gut had swelled up into a bean bag packed with suit, stretching her size 24 pants suit to the very limit with its apron sagging. Behind, Power Girl's neglected ass was drooping into a waterfall of uncooked dough, packed so tight into her slacks that both cellulite and panty lines were visible through the fabric. Her legs were stiff pillars, with her cankles pouring out over her shoes. The only thing that hadn't gained on the blubbery blonde were her still pathetic arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather us be late than dead,\" Karen sighed, pushing her glasses up her nose as she finally got the seat belt undone and slowly began the process of getting her lazy bulk out of the car, \"really, keep it under 30 next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loss of her powers wasn't just making Power Girl fatter. Another week of cloudy, frigid weather had prevented any recovery, keeping Karen an obese weakling. She was noticeably shorter without her super powers being active, shrinking down towards a pre-set 5'3, her skin was ivory pale and beneath her red wig, once golden hair was coming in brown at the roots. Her decoy glasses had become a necessity as fierce astigmatisms kicked in, dimming her super powered vision down 20 points per day, explaining why Stephanie was driving. Vulnerable, shrinking and increasingly short sighted, the formerly brave woman was becoming quite cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Stephanie got out of the car with just a fat girl grunt, Karen was having some trouble. Power Girl's gut poured between her thighs as she got her flabby thighs onto the concrete, the massive paunch pushing against the fabric as she tried to rock out of her seat. Sweat poured down the CEOs puffy face from that minor effort, the already blurry garage getting harder to see as her glasses steamed from the heat pouring off her face. Help came in the form of a vice-like grip on Karen's shoulders, easily pulling the obese super human to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you,\" Cassandra Cain-Wayne smiled, the obese Karen's blubber pressing into the ex-assassins steely body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl might be in hog heaven with her temporary Boss' obese body pressed into her, but unlike every other women in her life she hadn't changed a bit. Cass' pitiless exercise regime and ultra healthy diet was unchanged, she'd used the gym of the apartment building she and Steph were staying at that morning after all, and the stylish black skirt suit she'd stolen from Selina's closet fit the fit girl like a glove. She smiled up, but not that up, at the widening, fattening Kryptonian and quickly put a box of custard cream donuts into Karen's swollen hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snack for the trip up,\" Cass said, picking up a towering stack of donuts without effort and herding the two blonde fatties towards the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pace was frustratingly slow, waddling barely described Power Girl's trembling step and the formerly powerful woman needed steered toward the elevator repeatedly. Not that Cass minded, she had a deep appreciation for immense asses and even in an America of rebounding obesity rates it was hard to find ones to rival Steph and Karen's. Once she got the two and the company donuts into the elevator, Batgirl hit the button for the top floor, hopped out of the elevator and dashed up the stairs at a run. She wasn't even breathing hard when she beat the elevator to the top, picking up the donuts with Steph having only taken two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your appetite,\" Batgirl pressured her girlfriend, knowing that the gentle prodding would ensure the swollen Spoiler snacked until lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to say anything to her \"Boss\". Donut 9 and 10 went down Karen's pouty lips as she waddled through an office where everyone had a rebounding weight problem, old fat skirts and pants vaccuum packed over starter bellies and softening thighs, muffled hello's said through mouth's packed with pastries. Cass got the other stack of boxes into the break room, causing a chubby stampede that she easily flowed through, one box held high, and opened the door for Karen to her office just as the blonde shot gunned the last two and collapsed into her groaning chair and Stephanie waddled in after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...,\" Power Girl moaned, her already snug blouse buttons about to pop off, \"alright girls...I'm glad you both asked to intern for me because we're a very busy company *hiccup*. We're entering into a real growth phase now and changing the whole *urp* world. So I'm going to need both of you to stay hungry...Stephanie, go through my inbox for important emails and Cassandra, I need you too...yumm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra might be the most dangerous fighter on the planet (and perhaps the slimmest woman in the super hero business) but her abusive upbringing had given her plenty of handicaps. Namely dyslexia severe enough she couldn't do the slightest clerical work, which her new boss hadn't known about when hiring her. Granted, Power Girl had been so food drunk when Cassandra had pressured her the blonde might have made Batgirl CFO if she'd asked, but Batgirl needed to hide that, lest the rotund alien ask questions that could impede Batgirl's investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she stuffed the depowered Power Girl with an entire Box of Boston Cream doughnuts. Cass was careful and precise, not letting a single crumb fall into Karen's cleavage or the tiniest smear of cream form on her swollen cheeks. PG's eyes rolled back into her head, her gut swelled out further with the pressure, seams strained and the button on her tight pants snapped with a dull pop. The ergonomic office chair groaned back into recline and Power Girl passed out into a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang girl, I didn't think she wanted you to do that for her...but your giving me ideas for later tonight,\" Stephanie giggled, slightly aroused and slightly jealous to see Batgirl's amazing stuffing powers turned onto someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check her files,\" Cassandra said, wiping her hard, scarred hands off on a towel, \"look for anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused. Stephanie had volunteered to help her out with the investigation, although Cass hadn't shared her discovery that all of Spoiler's bulging beauty might be linked to this company. Pointing out that she was weighing well north of 200 now might make her girlfriend cry and well, Cass would hate that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"weird,\" Batgirl decided, taking the lanyard off Karen's neck, its keycard picture showing a fatless woman, \"I'm doing recon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when she wakes up?\" Steph asked, chubby fingers typing away into Karen's desk top, \"whoa girl! Are we going to really do that here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just changing,\" Cass told her, closing the blinds and quickly undressing and showing her hard, scarred body, \"time for recon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the work clothes into her brief case and pulled out her actual work suit, the batgirl costume fitting like a glove over her hard muscles. She slid a screw driver from her belt, removed a grill and slid her slim body into an auspicious airvent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back,\" she promised, beginning her recon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarrware's ever expanding offices were vast, meaning Batgirl would see quite a bit during the day's exploration...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cass finds:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGimme your lunch money nerd: a depowered, obese Karen being \"bullied\" by Harley in the executive wash room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX'Hal, I swear I'm a size ten!: A slightly more than chubby Starfire here for another photo shoot, unable to fit into the provided clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cass spent several hours creeping silently through the air vents, her slim and agile body passing easily through the steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recorded several conversations from various scientists and researchers discussing the ever growing demand for the super food, as well as break rooms full of snacks being continuously raided. With the old weight loss foods phased out, the thoroughly addicted populace was chowing down on the high fat superfoods grown by Ivy's plants. Their weights were rebounding, most starting to edge past their old highs. Secretaries were crammed into their old fat day skirts, bellies sucked in desperately to keep the snaps from popping even as they crammed donuts into their mouths. Young execs talked about a new body positive ad campaign over bagels overflowing with cream cheese, just as their muffin tops over hung their stretched belts. Panty lines were visible everywhere Cass looked, Karen Starr's young, mostly female work force blimping up at record pace and barely realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than panicking at the returning pounds, they were complimenting each other! Unknown to Cass, Ivy had subtly seeded the growth pheremones of her food with hypnotic properties designed to make their consumers happy with their own ballooning figures and attracted to accumulating pounds on others. Except for anyone with a Metagene of course, Ivy wanted every superheroine fat and miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl watched with aroused alarm at the chubbying work force for some time, a peak of interest happening when she passed by an executive washroom. Not that type of pervert, Cass was about to go on when she saw Power Girl waddle out of a stall and to the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe depowered Kryptonian was huffing and puffing just from the short walk, her pantsuit more like a sack of frosting than a designer suit. Karen's substantial belly pressed into the sink as the blonde neared the mirror, water splashing onto it when she leaned forwards to turn on the water. The CEO sighed, washed her hands and started dabbing chocolate frosting off the corners of her mouth and berating herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rao, get it together Karen,\" she sighed at herself, squinting through the insufficient specs, \"you're fall apart here. You've lost your powers because you were too lazy to tan, you got so fat you can barely get out of a chair, you're blind as a bat, you're losing an inch in height a day and this time next month your boobs are going to be on the floor. Why did I ever agree to get fat like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnobserved in the vent, Batgirl raised an eyebrow. She'd been right to suspect the blimping Power Girl. Karen had agreed to get fat? She'd done this to herself on purpose? Who'd she agreed to it with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe executive washroom's door swung open, revealing a corpulent blonde pear who's beanbag hips brushed the door way. This newcomer was in a painted on red and black skirt suit, her pale blonde hair in pig-tails. She could have been Power Girl's sister, both pale blobby blondes in the mid 300s, although the new comer was just a little taller than the rapidly shrinking ex-power house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, what do we got here?' the new comer sneered in a thick gotham accent, locking the door behind her, \"a fat little nerdette crying to herself in the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...,\" Power Girl stammered, looking around for a place to if not run, at least slowly waddle away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the vent Cass readied herself, even if it would blow her cover she coudln't let anyone be harmed. And her erstwhile employer was looking completely terrified, sweat pouring off her face and her already strained breathing rising...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Karen,\" the new woman giggled, voice very familiar to Cass, walking up to Power Girl until their bellies bunched together, \"I told you not to be using this bathroom without permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but, I'm the boss,\" Power Girl squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel like the boss?\" pig tales cackled, reaching out and flicking the thick inches of belly fat overhanging Karen's skirt, \"because you don't look like one. How much money you got in your purse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...no,\" Karen squeaked, her taller tormentor pressing the hulking fat girl back into the sink at the slight denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPig tales had to push pretty hard, she wasn't exactly in shape and the CEO's picture was next to \"heavy\" in the dictionary, but Karen's sagging but was soon pressed onto the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? A no?\" the other woman asked, \"Someone under the mistaken apprehension they're still a badass? You? Squeaky little wideload Karen? The flabby goody too-shoes who can barely pick up her box of morning donuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please, don't. Just take my money,\" Power Girl, one of the bravest and strongest heroines on earth whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will, powerless girl,\" pig tails teased, \"but I gotta give something to you first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass found herself wanting to jump in...but frozen in sexual amazement as seven hundredish pounds of panting blubber jostled around the wash room. Both of them were clearly very, very aroused, faces read and breath coming tight. She realized this was some sort of erotic role play, a dominance/submission fantasy that had to be very carefully done.  Soon a blushing, gasping Karen was pressed face first into the mirror, her make up smearing off of her chipmunk cheeks as the sweaty pear behind her fumbled at PG's painted on pants, trying to unsnap Karen's button even though PG's immense ass and her own considerable belly were in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, how fat are you anymore Betty?\" the panting pear gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really damn fat,\" Karen whimpered, \"so fat, I'm so fat and lazy and weak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dominant girl gave up on the button, instead trying to get a hand down the back of Power Girl's pants. Pudgy fingers were wedged tight between substantial backfat deposits and slowly ripping fabric, going nowhere fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, where the hell are your underwear?\" the pig tailed girl wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I outgrew them yesterday,\" Power Girl moaned at the confession, \"my legs were too thick to get them up anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Betty, you gotta buy more of those things!\" the other blonde huffed, \"how are we gonna do this bully fantasy of yours if I can't give you a wedgie? I went through a lot of work to set this up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, you're the dom, I'm just the dumb, placid sub,\" Power Girl panted, \"I think the food is making me dumber...Its hard to think anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're just as smart. Its just that you've gotten lazy upstairs at the same rate you've gotten fat downstairs, which is pretty fucking lazy\" the other woman said, slapping Karen's butt for emphasis, \"but since you're ass is too fat for panties, I'm deciding that this means your tits are too big for bras. Shed it Holstein and let those milkers flop free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I'll sag really badly now. I've gotten all droopy,\" the huge busted blonde whined, even as she started carefully undoing her straining buttons, \"come on Harley, do you want me to trip on em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I want to see you trip on em, I'm a super villain!\" the pale woman cackled, ripping Karen's now exposed bra off and letting her immense breasts plop free, tits large as Cass' entire Torso surging into view, \"no more underwear for you at all!...unnless your back hurts too much or somethin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley...this was Harley Quinn? Cass had to blink, the clown had once been as athletic as her but was now just as much a fatty as power girl! And she was working for Karen...well, at least having sex with Karen. What was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon stopped having dicussions at all, going at very slow, careful sex, even as they pawed and bit at each other's folds. Cass lay transfixed, watching every wobble and bounce until the two's muffled grunts subsidded into sweaty pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna need...phew...a fucking shower after that....I'm a little out of shape,\" Harley wheezed, a pile of naked, sweaty, pale fat on the floor, \"you gotta get those interns out of your place or I'm gonna be too big to even screw soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're moving a few doors down soon,\" Karen panted, floppy breasts rising and falling, \"oh Rao that was good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do it quick. There's too many fat blondes around as it is and the skinny one....she gives me the creeps,\" Harley said, beginning to try and sit up, fat rolls forming on her hills of lard, \"Have you dosed her with the drugs yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will...whew....,\" Karen whined, not even trying to set up, \"I've got a little salad in my fridge for her, the dressing is straight from one of Ivy's weight gain plants. I'm not sure where she went off to, but once she eats it she'll pop out of that mini skirt by closing time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass immediately put in a mental reminder not to eat anything here...and to give anything she found to Stephanie. And Poison Ivy was involved somehow? The vain dryad who flaunted her slinky body at every chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you know what they say,\" Harley whined, \"if they can see their feet, don't trust em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth obese blobs laughed, before slowly, slowly getting to their feet. and starting to get their straining clothes onto their drooping bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your afternoon like?\" Harley asked, forcing her skirt up her telephone pole thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another photoshoot for the next phase of product, the talent is being troubling and 4th floor wants me there to reassure them,\" Karen said trying and failing to reach the trousers she'd tossed over the stall partition, \"you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna go see the big red tomato herself. She's getting a little stir crazy without enough pampering, but you know how fat girls are, right?\" Harley laughed, jiggling Karen's stomach, \"She's opening a big restaurant today and wants me there for emotional support...or just so her fat butt doesn't have to try and stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass frowned, deciding on who to follow as the two slowly, slowly got up....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Breath coming in huffs and puffs, Selina staggered across the seldom used fourth floor of Wayne Manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce scrambling up a skyscraper would have left the agile cat burglar fresh as a daisy, but the retired Catwoman was on the point of collapse. Her hoggish thighs burned, not just where the flab rasped together like normally, but deep within the layers of lard where the atrophied remnants of her firm muscles groaned at greater than normal movement. Selina was kind of almost not in completely pathetic shape for her size due to her busy social calendar but her lack of exercise and total gluttony meant she was still at the end of her stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big is this stupid mansion?\" Selina whined, stumbling past rooms that had once been servant's quarters and were now home to her mothballed gowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a rack of size eights through an open door, slinky black gowns the best designers had paid Bruce Wayne's leggy bride to wear at various high society parties. Selina recognized one sequined number that had made her ass seem huge at the time, initial feeding sessions having put a new layer of fat over her buns that tabloids had eagerly, and positively, commented on. Right now, the aristocrat doubted she could get half an ass cheek into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I'm more turned on or horrified by that,\" she asked herself, trying to ignore the siren call of a divan sat in the hallway, \"Come on Selina, think skinny thoughts. Think skinny thoughts and get thin again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly pregnant ex-supervillain wiped sweat from her brow and paused at a cord hanging from the ceiling, smiling at it just as she'd grinned at valuable gems on the other side of bullet proof glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last...one last set of stairs,\" Selina smiled, pulling the cord and then hurriedly stepping back as the attic stairs descended from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fast stumbled bumped Catwoman's basketball sized buns into a side table, making a vase shake back and forth. Suppressing a yelp, she snatched at the tipping pottery with chubby, clumsy fingers, only for her over stuffed stomach to knock it to the floor. Catwoman stood horrified, waiting to see if her guests or worse her step daughter had noticed but after a minute no one appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your fault,\" Selina said, twisting around to stare at the twin couch cushions she permanently dragged behind her, then turned around at the not normal sphere of her gut, \"and yours. Ugh, is this what being pregnant is going to be like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea how many meals had been stuffed down her throat in the past 48 hours. The snowed in weekend had become a pattern of being stuffed into agony, given a belly rub into unconsciousness and then waking up in some other room for the feast to see her smiling, silent step daughter proffering more food. Sometimes Selina had woken up in bed, once belly to belly with Power Girl, sometimes in one of the living rooms jammed tight into a love seat with Cass' blonde guests already digging into a pie big enough for a plus size stripper to pop out of and once inside a warm bath up to her chin in melted chocolate. Without her phone she'd have no idea what time or day it was, probably late sunday night, but knew if she ate another bite she'd pop. Her belly looked as if she'd swallowed a couple watermelons and never stopped groaning, heavy enough it tilted her torso forwards and had angry red stretch marks starting to form on the sides. Selina rubbed it, wishing her fingers hadn't lost all of their strength and wondering when and how she'd exchanged her ruined monokini for black lace nighty and silky bathrobe too small to cover her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I going to even fit into anything on monday morning?\" the thief wondered, touching her face and realizing that she'd picked up another chin since friday when this gorge session had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppalled at her butter fingers, Selina waddled over to the very narrow seeming attic stairs and took a cautious step onto them, wincing at the wood groaning. Her ultra plush hips pressed into the railing on one side, making her lean to the side. Selina's balance was awful due to her center of gravity changing so much and as she looked to the carpet three feet below her slippers the once fearless thief felt a lurch of vertigo. Not that she could actually see her feet with the food baby she was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Selina, you've run across high wires,\" she steeled herself, closing her eyes and making herself slowly walk up the attic stairs, \"don't be such a fat, whimpering, lazy pussy...and stop getting turned on at being like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman managed to get into the attic without falling and only getting mildly stuck. Buttery hips jammed fast into the narrow opening, leaving the pear stuck, her torso jammed into the chilly attic. Selina had to wiggle side to side, hip fat bunching and rolling as she gradually popped free into the frozen room, longing immediately for a hot tub, a belly rub and somehow, more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to fix this,\" Catwoman gasped, \"other wise...that doesn't bear thinking...by this time next year I'll be too fat to even walk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture of herself, an immobile whale of a woman flowing out of a mobility scooter with an ecstatic Cassandra feeding her bonbons flashed in her mind, making her shiver even more than the dwindling storm outside. Selina pulled a phone out of her bathrobe pocket, not her real cellphone but a burner phone kept from her super villain days. Oracle was still monitoring everything with a Wayne computer chip. Swallowing, praying that Ivy hadn't gotten a new number, she dialed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ivy, come on,\" she whimpered, mouth going dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took four rings but the phone was finally answered by Ivy's somewhat nasally voice, \"Cat, what the hell took you so long to call back after the mission, did you infect Lane or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took me so long...Ivy I'm fat as fuck is what took me so long!\" Selina hissed, \"I realized I was two hundred and fifty pounds on Friday and that was before this weekend! You've got to fix me before my ass gets its own zip code! The tabloids are calling me the richest fat woman in America, how did you not realize I'd gotten infected too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I assume you wanted to reject unrealistic western beauty standards,\" Ivy said, pausing to chew, \"Pardon, trying out the new synthetic steaks. You should come by my new steak house at some point, its delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food is the last thing I need, Ivy I doubled in weight in a few months!\" the burglar nearly yelled, \"You've got to fix me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selina, losing weight is the last thing anyone needs! Think of all the green house gasses you're storing in your thighs,\" Ivy pointed out, \"you're helping the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivy I spent in a daze eating myself to the size of a hippo,\" Catwoman pointed out, \"you've got to fix me damn it. You can do that, right? I can waddle over there and get a cure and go back to being skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I mean I never bothered to come up with a cure,\" Ivy sniffed, \"we're all better off obese you know. And think about it, you might not be able to do a cartwheel anymore but all of those dreadful female vigilantes are currently fatties too. Last I heard Black Canary couldn't even do a kick anymore, Huntress' can't get to her crossbow arrows past her stomach flab and that Spoiler hasn't been seen since her boobs popped out during a sting op.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of them, Batgirl...,\" Selina said, not giving up that said Batgirl was her step daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Gotham's villains had somehow not guessed her marrying Bruce pointed to Bruce being Batman was baffling to her, but her family's secret identities were their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dreadful ninja girl? Ugh, I hate her. She broke every bone in my arm the last time I tried to unleash a hyper allergenic flower at the park and poison everyone, I can't wait to see her too fat even to throw a punch the stupid quiet bitch!\" Ivy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never call her that! She's one of the sweetest,\" Selina began indignantly, stung maternal pride rearing its head and still unable to see the hyper dangerous assassin as anything but a precious darling to be protected, \"I mean...um, she's, uh, she's immune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immune?\" Ivy screeched, \"Immune? No one should be immune! I made it to work on Kryptonians and demi-gods! Some kung fu girl shouldn't even be able to stand up after getting infected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's still got an 8 pack and she's turned into some sort of super feeder,\" Selina said, rubbing her stomach, \"she just ignores food unless its to put it in some other woman's mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...shit,\" Ivy said, \"I didn't count on someone being immune...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean shit?\" Selina asked, \"and you're Poison Ivy, you should find a way to infect her lickity split, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been a bit distracted really,\" Ivy admitted bashfully, \"Mostly the plants around me are a bit too focused on feeding me and whenever Harley's around I tend to get peckish and I'm becoming kind of a really big girl...but let me put it to you plainly Selina.I can cure you or try and make Batgirl fat, but I can't do both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina bit her lip. Her own vanity demanded she get back to a size two, while her unleashed feedee libido demanded she never lose a pound. Jealousy demanded that she not be the only fatty in the family, envy proclaimed she needed to get back in shape. Motherly concern jumped with joy at a way to keep her cutie pie out of danger and properly plump, while familial pride didn't want her martial artist daughter slowed down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Pam, I want you to,\" she started to say, <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That her quiet adoptive daughter wound up getting the odd scrape and gunshot wound while filling the emergency room with supervillains and mercenaries, terrified her. She was just the world's most dangerous hand to hand fighter, she was going to get hurt! Better she stay home, fat, safe and warm next to her mom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho had an ass that was outgrowing the manor's fleet of sports cars. Who couldn't see her feet past her belly anymore. Whose fat, clumsy fingers couldn't even pick a lock. Whose lumbering step made the furniture bounce. Who was impossibly getting hungry again after a mere half hour not eating. Who was wet as a swamp at the thought of all of that because damn did a part of her want to be huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman twisted around, side rolls forming and stared at the basketball sized cheeks that had been her perfect ass, thoughts of anyone but herself falling away as she poked her pudding plush buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to fix me Pam,\" Selina whined, \"I've turned into this over stuffed house cat who does nothing but sleep, eat and watch TV all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's wrong with that?\" Ivy yawned on the other side of the phone, \"isn't that an ideal existence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Catwoman huffed, shivering in the cold attic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you getting enough sex?\" Pam asked tiredly, \"I'd hope that billionaire idiot's gotten a taste for real women, do you know that he told me I was too fat to sell diet food just for gaining a few curves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMention of sex made the house wife remember passionate early mornings and evenings with her billionaire vigilante husband...which made her hungrier. It had been half an hour after all.. Feederism had been introduced soon after she and Bruce's unknowing infection, contributing half a foot to Selina's 54 inch hips before the pregnancy cravings had kicked in. Selina blushed, crossed her chubby legs and patted her still stuffed stomach before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two or three times a day, its not the problem,\" Selina denied, pacing across the attic floor with a groan of squeaky floor boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only two or three?\" Ivy asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...what? I' don't even want to know, Ivy if I keep eating like this I'll be too fat to walk by the time I'm to term,\" Selina insisted, butt banging against the attic struts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still walk?\" Ivy asked in amazement, 'I've almost forgotten how annoying that was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman blinked in the gloomy attic, stomach churning. She'd meant it as an expression but if Ivy, the absolute skinniest villainess in Gotham was too big to walk after sampling her own superfood, superfood Selina had been chowing down on for a couple months....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam, just how much do you weigh?\" the burglar questioned, fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Selina, weight is just a number,\" the immobile bioterrorist turned food mogul waved off, \"Now, if you're determined to ugh, lose weight, I can get a cure to you in ...about six months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman's massive thighs gave out and her bean bag hips slammed down onto an ancient toy chest, which crumpled under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six months!\" Selina screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to yell,\" the obscenely obese redhead said, making a little coo of joy as some server sat another heavy plate of synthetic meat onto her table, \"oh, my rib platters are here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget the ribs!\" Catwoman hissed, hoping no one had heard her, \"I'm gaining a pound a day here Ivy! I'm going to be four hundred pounds by then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just eat less then,\" Ivy suggest through a full mouth, \"maybe exercise a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivy you turned me into fatophillic perverted glutton,\" the pear grumbled, \"I wake up stuffed silly from sleep eating and then eat the rest of the day! The only time I don't eat is when I'm taking my step daughter to appointments. I can't wait for six months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then spend more time with her,\" Ivy suggested, not knowing she was suggesting Ivy spend more time with the best feeder in town, \"I'm a busy woman and six months is a rush order. I've got to be careful making a plague that will cure you without hurting you. Unwriting retroviruses is harder than making them, especially with you pregnant...ooohhh, baby back ribs! Now I've got to go, the Planet's best food critic is coming by tomorrow and I need to sample every dish to make sure its perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman stared at the dark attic for a moment, amazed at what she'd heard. She'd have to wait six months before being cured? She'd be...unimaginably fat by then...probably more than four hundred pounds given how she seemed to be getting fatter faster the fatter she got! The bigger she was the more Bruce was turned on, the more Bruce was turned on the more she was fed, the more she was fed the fatter she got, the fatter she got the more Cass pampered her, the more Cass pampered her the wider she got, the wider she got the lazier she got, the lazier she got the less she exercised, the less she exercised the more Bruce was turned on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its three vicious cycles,\" the obese socialite groaned, putting her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina stiffled a sob. She was the Catwoman, a lithe, athletic, gymnast, dangerous as she was beautiful. A lethal fighter, a stealthy infiltrator, an impossible thief...who'd become a fat, lazy, clumsy, soft skinned housewife. It was humiliating, it was degrading, it was really arousing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" a soft voice said, hugging her tight in hard arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina almost yelped, finding her daughter had somehow snuck up on her and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass, how long have you been there!?\" Selina asked in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now,\" the quiet girl smiled, hugging her soft, butter mother tight, \"you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's stomach rumbled in answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no sweety,\" Selina lied, \"mommy's tummy is upset...I ate too much, how about I go for a walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't an easy night for Cassandra Cain but life was never easy for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaised to be the ultimate assassin, Cassandra's extreme ability to read micro-movements in body language coupled with extreme martial arts training put her in the low levels of superhuman...at the cost of illiteracy and near muteness, essentially a form of autism. Her extreme morality prevented her from ever killing and had brought her into the bat-family as the second Batgirl, and fitting into that family was as hard for her as everything that wasn't fighting. Legally she was Bruce Wayne's adopted daughter but typically worked with the rest of his wards under the supervision of the original Batgirl, Barbara Gordon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched on a gargoyle, the ultra lithe crimefighter nursed an uncharacteristic cold while watching models, moguls and journalists get out of limos and move towards a massive fashion show, showing fear and hope and exhaustion and lust like they were carrying neon signs. Down there, she saw the Wayne limo drop off Tim Drake, Red Robin, and Stephanie Brown, Spoiler, her own adopted brother and best friend who'd danced around the attraction their fit, muscular bodies signaled into the stratosphere. The two had been flirting and teasing toward it for two years and it had been clear to Cass the first moment she saw the two together: the jokes, the teasing, the lingering looks...the same things that both had occasionally given to her a few times but that she, the girl who'd could kick through a brick wall and read a punch before its puncher knew he was going to punch had blanked at acting on them, couldn't dredge the words that howled inside her head for any sort of release. How come they'd never been able to read any of her body language?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how come neither of them had read how shitty she was feeling in the mission briefing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow burned, her button nose was stuffy, her eyes were red behind her night vision hood lenses, her mouth was dry behind the stitching of her mask and the lithe, corded, titanium hard muscles of her body ached, while her stomach rumbled with unusual hunger. It was rare for Cass to ever get sick, her healthy diet and social isolation besides vigilantism and speech therapy prevented most infections. She'd wanted to bring it up again and again but the words kept jumbling in her brain and the only thing that came out of her mouth was a quiet cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Calendar-Girl is going to spray some sort of nerve gas into the crowd of models at the fashion show,' Barbara had briefed them from her wheel chair, a once hyper-fit vigilante who was getting a bit skinny in her chair, 'Tim and Steph, you'll go in in your civilian identities, the rich Wayne ward and his pretty girl friend.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie was pretty: a tall, fit blonde with incredibly shapely legs and a firm butt you could bounce a coin off. She was Cass' best friend, showed her how to text and then texted and read them for her, the girl that Cass defined pretty as, with her long hair and make up and boobs and hips...although she was a little scrawny now that Cass looked at her closely. And she'd be with Tim who Cass really liked too...not as much as Steph but a lot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass, you wait outside on over watch for their entrance,' Bab's had said, and Cass' objection over how she felt like shit and how she wanted to get to wear a pretty dress and couldn't begin to reach her throat before she was already looking over the fashion show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miserable Bat-Girl noticed a slow in traffic, traced it back to a line of armored cars driving erratically. She wanted to alert Babs but knew she couldn't say it before they arrived. She zip-lined over, swooping over traffic and landing on another gargoyle to see a group of armed thugs getting out of the armored cars, along with a gorgeously fit and perfectly voluptuous woman in a skin tight body suit under a skimpy black dress and a white mask. Calendar Girl, former super model Paige Monroe who's career downturn in the bitter world of fashion as she'd aged had driven her vengefully insane. Superbly fit and carrying a harvesting scythe, she was surrounded by at least twenty armed goons eager to take in promised hostage money that would never arrive due to the lethal nerve gas they unknowingly carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smoke bomb went off among them and a bout a minute later all of them were on the ground, unconscious and hand cuffed to their cars. Cass really did feel like shit after all, but at least the mission was over...she looked down at Calendar Girl, honestly way too skinny to be pretty and at the dress and heels which would fit her...damn it did fit her, was she really this skinny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass looked herself over in the mirror of a van, seeing a slightly tall, steely fit half asian girl with short hair and a slightly red nose. Her legs were slightly bulky with muscle, her abs cut like diamonds and her arms bulged with steel. Not very elegant but not bad, she was happy to be so fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's virus was running rampant in Cass' body but the plague had only partly penetrated Cass' amazing immune system, white blood cells as tough as the rest of her. She sneezed, the spray landing on Calendar Girl and immediately infecting her, and slid silently into the fashion show, leaving a trail of high infectious viral clouds from sneezes and contaminated door knobs. Diets broke like glass and hungry models began visiting the craft service between walks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat fetishes bloomed behind her like flowers after a spring rain, skinny models suddenly hot houses of weight gain in the path of the near mute Batgirl. She slipped into the crowd and was suddenly sitting between Tim and Stephanie, interrupting an almost first kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uhh...Cass, aren't you supposed to be outside?,' Stephanie asked, pulling back to see her friend sitting next to her instead of her almost boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes,' Cassandra said after a moment, wrinkling her nose to stop a sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass, what about Calendar Girl?' Tim asked, slightly alarmed and noticing as always just how dangerously sexy Cass looked in that dress and too afraid to make a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Taken care of,' Batgirl promised very carefully and slowly, putting her arms around both their shoulders, 'just watch.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim and Steph looked at each other, confused at the sudden appearance of their friend. Then Cass sneezed and the faint spray touched both their noses, the quick acting virus immediately penetrating their minds. Stephanie soon felt herself get hungry and immediately stopped a waiter coming by with a tray of shrimp cocktail. Like most young women in the super hero business who lacked a super metabolism she was on a careful diet to keep squeezing into her skin tight purple jump suit. Being In the same career path as women like Wonder Woman or Power Girl wracked up body issues, ones Stephanie was forgetting as she began shot gunning shrimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy should she worry about staying super skinny? Cass did most of the fighting, all she needed was to be able to keep up, hack stuff and sabotage. That six pack she was working for didn't really help her help people at all, why not relax and enjoy herself...have another thing of shrimp, signal for a thing of champagne, try some of that cake and a slice of that pie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie ate like a pig at a trough, an amazing amount of food disappearing into the lithe blonde's usually flat belly. Cass smiled at her, happy to see her cut loose, while Tim began to feel strangely turned on and uncomfortable. Steph really shouldn't be eating like that he thought, seeing her shovel down her three thousandth calorie in the form of a caramel cupcake, but damn if she didn't look good doing it and that little food baby suited her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, models were stalking by on the catwalk, looking hungrily at the amount of food Steph was shoveling in. Mari McCabe, also known as the super heroine, Vixen, was practically drooling down in her bikini, while the Brazilian heroine Fire almost walked into norwegian model Heroine Ice who'd stopped to stare at a cheese cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra sat back in her cheer, feeling far, far better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only one female member of the upper classes wasn\u2019t growing and she was the happiest of all, Ivy\u2019s virus having turned her life around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 2 am, Cassandra Cain dashed across roof tops at full tilt. Up buildings, across them and leaping over streets, she reached her destination in the warehouse district faster than a car would have, breathing easy when she found the designated meeting point. Tim reached it not long after, not able to keep up with Batgirl\u2019s amazing parkour speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Woof, Cass. You should maybe take it a little easier,\u2019 he joked at his adopted sister, \u2018you\u2019re gonna wear yourself out.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No,\u2019 Cass told him, looking at the trucks until Stephanie arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh my god, *puff* oh my god, *huff* oh jesus,\u2019 Spoiler huffed, flopping onto the top of the building like a limp fish, \u2018I\u2019m gonna die. I\u2019m gonna die. How do you do that. No way you\u2019re human...oh jesus.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass pulled a bottle of soda out off her belt, handing it to the blonde with a smile behind her mask. Stephanie grabbed it and sucked it down, emptying twenty ounces of soda in moments and then giving a soft belch, her breathing heavy but steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Thanks Bg, that really hit the spot. You always seem to know just when I need an energy boost,\u2019 she gasped, the seams of her dark purple and black outfit groaning with each breath, \u2018don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018My pleasure,\u2019 Cass smiled and handed her a candy bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie had been Hollywood\u2019s idea of the girl next door: long golden hair, soft peachy skin, big hazel eyes, long straight nose, bow lips and a banging body. Long legs and round hips, with a tapered waist and high C cups. Bat mandated exercises and sparring sessions with Cassandra had made her hard and fit, a dangerous vigilante in her own right if focused more on sabotage than fighting. Four weeks of increased hunger, a subconscious desire to see big as beautiful and pampering from Cass at every moment had plumped up those trim legs, wrapped a muffin top around her girl abs, added a year early freshman fifteen to her ass and popped her Cs up two cup sizes while adding a growing softness to her jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass had had to help her friend into her costume, Batgirl\u2019s immense strength needed to shove the zipper over her soft curves. The near mute girl had read every one of Steph\u2019s emotions in a feast of her own: elation at the tightness round her thighs, embarrassment at how squishy her stomach was compared to Cass, happiness at her bigger boobs and worry that Cass was too skinny. To the altered Batgirl, the softer Steph was the very definition of girlish beauty: soft and chubby and destined for rapid growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No problem,\u2019 Cassandra said slowly, \u2018you earned it.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive words weren\u2019t much for most people but Cass\u2019 heart thrilled at the length of the sentence. She had a friend, a friend who she was softening and growing at Cassandra\u2019s will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Check the perimeter,\u2019 Cassandra ordered Tim, who departed at a last glance at Steph\u2019s rising and falling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl looked down, marking out the Mafia goons by their hostile body language against the nervous forklift operators and truck drivers. She counted twenty five of them loading up five trucks, meaning there\u2019d be five each on an even distribution. Illiterate she might be, but Cass was an ace at math. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Cut four,\u2019 Cassandra told Stephanie when her friend rolled to her feet, adjusting her utility belt where it pinched into her new paunch, \u2018leave one.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Sure, just give me a minute. I swear, these warehouse districts are getting farther apart every day,\u2019 Stephanie huffed, zipping away and still breathing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass watched her standing up, eyeing how her buns pressed into Steph\u2019s pants. Out of shape as she was it didn\u2019t take Spoiler long to cut the truck\u2019s ignition wires, although getting under the trucks was starting to be a tight squeeze for her friend. The moment Stephanie was safely aside and Tim was in position, Cass began her assault, swooping down and landing heel first on a mobster\u2019s jaw. A dance of dodged bullets and broken hands followed, the near superhuman Batgirl leaping out of sight lines and breaking knees before her opponents even knew she was there. Eighteen of the mobsters went down in a minute, the slow speed due to Cass having to jump to Stephanie\u2019s rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby blonde had sprang from cover to launch a high kick, that landed with a loud rip as her butt seams tore from belt to knee. Mortified she froze just as a man swung a crow bar at the back of her head, Cass\u2019 batarang knocking the weapon away before Steph even knew it. Cassandra darted in and broke a few hands and jaws while Stephanie bashfully pulled her cape over her now exposed ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs planned the remaining goons drove off, hurtling towards their hide out and not noticing as Red Robin jumped onto the top of their truck. Cass watched, completely satisfied at her success, then threw another batarang to knock out a goon disguised as a factory loader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Stay hidden next time,\u2019 Cass told her, wagging a finger, \u2018no fighting.\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018I can still fight, Cass, not like you can but I\u2019m not useless,\u2019 Stephanie objected, \u2018I get that I\u2019ve put on a few pounds but weight\u2019s just a number.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Cassandra froze, the perfectly graceful woman at a loss of what to do. Then, with more courage than she\u2019d ever felt before, she stretched out one gloved hand and ran her fingers up Steph\u2019s puffy belly, over her fuller chest and cradled her soft chin. With the other she wrapped Steph\u2019s waist, squeezing one fluffy bun. She leaned in close, her mask touching Steph\u2019s, breath\u2019s mingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You are not for fighting, you\u2019re for spoiling. Do you understand?\u2019 Cass whispered, mouth dry as she completed her longest ever sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018...yes,\u2019 the motor mouth Stephanie gasped, lust, longing, embarrassment and desire boiling off of her and Cass stepped closer, her chiseled waist pressing against Stephanie\u2019s soft belly, only for Tim\u2019s radio broadcast to interrupt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Found their hideout and handled them. Some weird stuff, come check it out,\u2019 Red Robin said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls parted, slightly flustered and began zip lining towards their target. Cass landed silently while Stephanie landed with a thump and another rip, her disintegrating outfit totally exposing her backside from soft calf to full hip. Her cape was wrapped awkwardly around herself to maintain her dignity, but each step brought a small sigh of seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You guys all right? It took you long enough to get here,\u2019 Tim asked, domino masked eyes going to Stephanie, Cass reading the lust coming off him at her embarassment, \u2018Why are you standing like that, Spoiler?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Had a minor wardrobe malfunction, I took a little damage during the fight,\u2019 Stephanie blushed, embarrassed and horny,\u2019 what\u2019d you find?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Drugs, guns, bombs, standard stuff,\u2019 Tim said, leading them passed knocked out and hand cuffed goons into the building, finding gun racks and drug piles, \u2018but the truck they were driving in was full of this stuff.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fit young man opened the doors, revealed stacked boxes of Anonymous brand donuts: glazed, cream filled, jelly filled, long and rounds, chocolate, vanilla, sprinkled and cream topped. Steph\u2019s eyes almost bulged out of her head and she hoped up onto the truck with a slight grunt, Cass and Tim almost fainting as they saw her plump legs and wobbly but as her cape fell away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Huh, hadn\u2019t heard Anonymous donuts were coming out. Not even marked diet huh.These would just rot in an evidence locker so I\u2019m going to have a few. Holy crap these are good,\u2019 Steph said, immediately stuffing a cream filled long jon under her mask, \u2018try one Batgirl!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass caught the box, the treats gleaming inside. She shrugged, Ivy\u2019s virus had only given her a fat fetish, not a desire to get fat herself thanks to her honed immune system, and tossed the box to Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ingredients?\u2019 she asked, wishing she could read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Uh, flour, sugar, yeast, eggs\u2026,\u2019 Tim read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Cage free?\u2019 Cass asked immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra\u2019s ability to read body language came with a deep empathy, loath to cause any pain save to help others. A vegetarian, she got the vast amount of protein her muscular body needed from beans and eggs, bought from humane farms by the Wayne Butler, Alfred. She\u2019d spent most of her childhood locked in small rooms, being raised as a human weapon without seeing the sun and couldn\u2019t imagine supporting even chickens in that environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Doens\u2019t say, I guess not?\u2019 he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Eww,\u2019 Batgirl said, eyes tracking back to Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiler was finishing up her first half dozen doughnuts, whipped cream and custard on the front of her uniform and her cheeks bulging against her mask. Her stomach had gone from cute girl in math class squishy to the knocked up homecoming queen, revealing a crescent of pale skin as her pants separated from her shirt. Tim dropped the box while Cass\u2019 jaw hung open, drool collecting in her mask as she took in the complete happiness coming off her over fed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018C-co-collect!\u2019 Cass ordered Tim, pointing at a trio of empty duffle bags, \u2018e-evi-evidence!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt nine thirty in the morning, Cassandra found herself waking up comfy and warm in Stephanie\u2019s bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rock hard arm cradled Steph's engorged belly, hot to the touch and beachball taut. Steph smiled beatifically and Cassandra's heart thundered as she remembered what happened and blushed. A celebratory session of hand feeding Stephanie donut after donut had led to something she'd never imagined herself doing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Snuggling.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her friend sleep until her classes, Cass slowly got to her feet so she could..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassandra's life was changing rapidly for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom an abused human weapon to a homeless vagrant to a vigilante, she'd never imagined having any sort of normal life. A boyfriend or girl friend, non-abusive family, even a roof over her head had been beyond her dreams. The best she could hope for was using her assassin's skills to help the helpless, even after getting adopted by Batman and mentored by Oracle. She could read people like she couldn't read a book but could never speak beyond a forced word or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, since she'd started appreciating curves, the almost mute girl was happy as a clam. She had friends, almost a girlfriend and something she'd never expected to have: a Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left a beautifully drawn heart around two Cs, nearest she could get to a signature, on Steph's table and tip toed out. Clad in leggings and a hoodie, never one for fashion, Cass walked out of Steph's apartment silent as a mouse, not wanting to wake the heavenly soft spoiler early. As soon as the door closed she felt a hum in her pocket, pulling out her phone and seeing Selina Kyle's chiseled face on it and the  word 'Mom' under it. Cass smiled at one of the few word she could read and flicked it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi,' she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass, I've been trying to get a hold of you all morning,' Selina said, voice slightly worried, 'where are you? Do I need to have Oracle put out an APB? Do you know where you are?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm fine,' Batgirl reported without sarcasm, 'at Steph's.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh thank God, you've got your speech therapy appointment in an hour. Are you alright to go? Do you need to recover from last night?' her step mother questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm good. Just mafia,' Cass told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good, I'll pick you up by ten, are you in a safe neighborhood?' the reformed criminal asked, as if the college campus was a warzone and Cass a lost puppy instead of the most dangerous person in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Be fine,' Cass smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone else would have been smothered, but for Batgirl it was just nice to have someone care about her. She'd only met her birth mother, the super assassin Lady Shiva, four times and each time the mass murderer had almost killed her. In contrast Catwoman took her clothes shopping, spent time with her, worried about her safety and tried talking to her about boys...as much as Cassandra could talk at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a wait she spent people watching, taking in every emotion the groggy college students around her could give, the ex-jewel thief pulled up next to Cass in one of the Wayne's stable of Rolls Royce's rolling down the window and ushering her adopted daughter in, brow rising at the two duffle bags Cassandra carried. Selina's green eyes looked the vicious fighter up and down worriedly, trying to find any sort of injury and sighing with relief that she was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know why Bruce lets you go out like that, you'll get hurt one of these days and then I'll have to ...do something,' Selina sighed to the girl who nightly filled hospital wards with mercenaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when she'd been running herself ragged stealing jewels and art, the second Batgirl had been the very last person Selina had wanted to run into. A meeting with Bruce was tinged with the possibility of being caught by Bruce, while any of the past or present Robins had been easy to fluster, same with the old red haired Batgirl. But the silent one was a relentless pursuer out of a horror movie, who ignored every distraction, plowed through walls and beat Selina, no poor fighter herself, like a redhaired step child. When she'd reformed for good and joined Batman's team, she'd still been unnerved...until she'd met the girl under the mask after the wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra was quiet as a mouse and gentle as a lamb. She didn't speak up for herself and when Selina had found out what little had been pieced together about her past, her heart wept. Human weapon or not, someone needed to look after this girl as more than just a crime fighter. Bruce might be content to use her as another weapon in his war on crime, but not Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat filled up more and more of Selina's days after her inadvertent infection from Ivy's virus made her drop the four hours of running and pilates she did each day to stay cat burglar fit. Running up roof tops was a young woman's game, not a proper high society matron like Selina was now. Staying unhealthily thin wasn't nearly as important as making sure her sudden brood of adopted children were taken care of, especially Cassandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Have you eaten breakfast? There's a new donut place we can try,' Selina asked, eying her gaunt daughter, who had arms carved out of wood and a six pack so defined it showed through her hoody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Already ate. Try this,' Cass smiled back, handing over a fresh half dozen donuts, 'you're thin.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have been running around, Damien's parent teaching conferences took forever. That academy is like a palatial maze,' Selina confessed, munching down a glazed donut with joy, 'oh my these are incredible. Do you want one?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm good. Already ate,' Cass, who'd eaten cage free eggs and drank skim milk confessed, busy looking Selina up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass took in her gorgeous step mother, not all the slinky jewel thief she'd been.Clad in the latest fashions it might be, but Selina's models body had been hit with middle aged spread, replacing steely muscle with padded fat. While her upper frame was just a little soft, with fuller breasts, a hint of a double chin and a slightly puffy belly, the real change was on Catwoman's glamorous legs. Her short dress showed off thick, toneless thighs spread across her seat and she sat higher on a soft pillowy rump who's width had put her into a pear category. Graceful ankles were swollen and thick, cementing her as totally bottom heavy if the slight waddle the agile woman now possessed hadn't already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take a miracle to get Selina into her rapidly outgrown costume again, the plump socialite six sizes too big to get them over her thighs, much less running over roof tops. She was outgrowing even the thick Lois Lane, for Lois still had only a middle class budget, Clark's lust and her own gluttony to fatten up on. The candle of catwoman's figure was burning at every end: the infected Bruce was just as approving of her gain but had billions fueling it, while a staff waited on Selina hand and foot. And of course, she had a live in feeder who could read her mood at a glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocolate for boredom, muffins for stress, soy bacon on waking and pie when she needed to rest. Coffee heavy with cream and sugar before noon, chamomile tea with spoonfuls of honey afterwards. All delivered silently, before Selina even knew she needed it. It was honestly rare for the rapidly expanding burglar to even feel hungry, Cassandra reading the slight ripples contracting stomach muscles made as food moved on and making sure more was in Selina's hands before any pangs hit.<br>\r\nSelina wasn't aware of this feeding and would have been ballooning even without Ivy's infection, although now she was just happy she was getting a proper upper class physique: pampered and decadent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass was exultant that her new mom wasn't all hard edges and bones anymore. Selina's emotions weren't, Cass judged, that of a criminal, but a kind, warm woman, the type of mom found in cartoons and it was good Selina was growing into that persona: soft, warm and cuddly. Could she maybe...Selina liked to take cat naps in the drawing room by the fire now that fall had come, maybe one afternoon Cass could...cuddle next to her? Feel warm and loved and safe? What if...what if she asked Selina to read to her first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cassandra, your eyes are watering, are you okay?' Selina asked, pulling a tissue out of her purse in a very mom like gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine, just happy,' Cassandra smiled to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour was spent in a therapist office, Selina's porky buns poured into the chairs next to her. The now 180lb society matron's double chin wobbled as she ate down another box of the donuts Cassandra had given her, ignoring the warning signs of thighs chafing just from the short walk in. When she was finished, she got up with an ignored fat girl grunt and swayed over to the trash can, noticing as she did a months old magazine showing her wedding to Bruce. He looked so handsome...and she looked so gaunt! Had her collar bone really been so pronounced? And her cheeks...so gaunt! Ugh, her waist, like you could put your hands around it. And her arms were tooth picks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank God that's changed,' she told herself, waddling back to her seat, another pair of eyes watching her basketball ass cheeks swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slender receptionist had been lucky to not been infected by either Cassandra or Selina and was amazed in the other direction. The impossibly graceful trophy wife who brought in the quiet Asian girl had morphed into a thick thighed, huge assed mom in barely a month. Her cute pixie cut that had shown off modelesque cheekbones no longer flattered her puffy cheeks, slowly turning into a 'I need to speak to your manager' hair cut. At first there was no way she could be that 19 year olds mom, but now she looked to have gained fifty pounds and twenty years in weeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Crazy world anymore, I'll never let that happen to me,' the young nurse sighed, taking a bite of an Anonymous diet cookie, the last of the old, actually slimming kind in Gotham City, with a fresh package of the hyper fattening kind ready to go, 'to get that big, ewww.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cass got out, smiling from having made further strides with her speech, Selina's phone hummed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd gotten up at 6 am the day before and gone through twenty seven hours of database scraping, firewall hacking and police report scanning and even managed an hour of rolling her wheel chair around the block. But crime never rested and neither did the Oracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabs checked her progress bar on a download. Someone was buying up a lot of unused land for some reason, along with tech used for hydroponics and green house farming. To the paralyzed red head it smelled a lot like an enormous drug production ring, the question would be for what. And that was the best case scenario, the worst might be Ivy breaking her parole again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know that crazy dryad going onto the straight and narrow was too good to be true,' the exhausted ex-Batgirl sighed and tossed the blanket off of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the horrible, almost accidental gunshot that had damaged her spine, the 5'11 Babs had possessed a spectacular pair of stems. Years of childhood ballet and gymnastic competitions and lots of martial arts had given her a magnificent set of leg muscles, from her shapely calves to her chiseled quads leading up to her deliciously curvy backside. Much of that was gone now, three years in the chair leaving her legs spindly and atrophied. She was lucky she still had feeling in them, although her control amounted to maybe a toe wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was before Barbara had been in the same room as an infectious Cassandra Cain. Immediately after developing her cold, her appetite had skyrocketed and Barbara had suddenly began to care more about her appearance, finding herself way too skinny and seeing nothing wrong with women who were on the heavy side. The cupholder of her wheel chair had a half empty 32 ounce soder cola in it, while her work station had an empty bag of chocolate chips besides it. Barbara's thick ankles and chubby thighs tested her leggings, she sat higher on an inflating fat ass that wouldn't have fit into any of her old batgirl costumes and a flabby belly was puffing over her waistband. Bab's boobs had bounded up past her bras capacity and her painfully thin face had softened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is wrong with this wheel chair, its like its getting harder and harder to push,' Oracle muttered to herself, turning around and letting out a startled yelp to see her successor standing in front of her holding a duffle bag the size of a grown man, 'Jesus Christ Cass!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi,' the second Batgirl smiled, handing her mentor a full box of new Anonymous doughnuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry, you almost gave me a heart attack. We really need to work on your social etiquette skills,' Batgirl sighed, shaking her head, Cass beaming at the little jiggle that went across her cheeks, 'uh, what are these?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'From the drug bust,' Cassandra beamed, forming the next words with care, 'I confiscated.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You can't just steal stuff from a crime scene, Cass,' Barbara shook her head and took a bite, 'oh wow, these are really good.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it the contraband was gone, having vanished into Barbara's stomach and begun making its way towards her expanding fat layer. A second soon replaced it and Babs slowed a little, looking over her grinning protege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, good job then I guess. Although I wonder why they bothered to steal them, they're just donuts,' Babs went on, wheeling her way back towards the computer only for Cass to grab the push handles of her chair and wheel her towards the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara lived in a secondary Bat-base called the clock tower, a shimmering hub of the information super highway packed with servers and super computers. Taped into Wayne Enterprises telecommunication network, it gave Barbara access to anything she needed, except for maybe human comforts.A tiny bathroom and a small cot were all Babs had to herself, pouring the rest of her life into preventing another tragedy. Cassandra wheeled her away from the computing file and soon had the exhausted woman tucked into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rest and eat,' Cass insisted, shoving the last doughnut in the box into Barbara's mouth, the others having been eating already by the ravenous redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, I guess your right,' Babs sighed, swallowing the last mouthful and letting her stomach rumble, 'I do need a nap.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quiet vigilante looked down at her soon dozing boss, blanket tucked tight around her stuffed belly. It gave her the biggest thrill to make sure her mentor was taken care of. Barbara spent so much time worrying she didn't take care of herself, having gotten frighteningly thin. It was so much better to see her chubby and soft, cuddly and warm. And it would be so much better when she was even bigger, with breasts bigger than her head and a belly out to her knees and legs so thick and swollen they wouldn't be able to support her weight even if she wasn't paralyzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent as a bat, the vigilante began turning Barbara's apartment into an immense fat trap. Cookies in every nook and cranny. Doughnuts on every shelf. A fridge full of cakes and brownies. Cass even heated up a pie, guessing at how long it was supposed to stay in the oven and at what temp, then set it out to cool by Barbara's bedside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Batgirl it all smelled awful of course. She liked vegetables and baked beans and whole wheat toast and poached, cage free eggs. But ever since that night she'd felt so bad, she'd come to many realizations. Liking fat girls was the smaller of them, the other was that while speech was still hard, she could still care and control for those around her. She could make the girls she cared about soft and squishy and safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You'll be happier fatter,' she told Barbara, leaning down and kissing her on the forehead before leaving.</span></div></div>",

K'oriander called from where she hovered on Titan's Island, 'Raven, keep your guard up even though you've got her wrapped!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien stunner had three jobs: as a crime fighter, as a super model and as the super visor and leader of the Teen Titans. Watching over half a dozen super powered teens could put anyone into the nut house, with the normal teen tantrums and angst issues super powered as well, but the tall, tan redhead was an image of warm authority. She hovered over the sparring gym where Wonder Girl and Raven sparred against each other, eying form and stance with a warrior's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie Sandsmark was forwards and confident, putting too much trust in her Amazonian durability and strength instead of quick thinking. There's no jock like an ex-nerd eager to forget the days of being a shy book worm and after getting powers near equal to Wonder Woman, Cassie had become as aggressive and brash as she was buff and leggy. In comparison, Raven was a short, skinny grouch of a goth with enough half demonic powers to rip up a mountain range and the arrogance to match. The two did not get along in anyway shape or form, demonstrating it as Cassie gave out very unpulled punches and Raven's telekinetic bursts started going beyond what even the Amazon could endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's enough!' Starfire yelled as she saw Cassie bury her arm up to the elbow in the concrete wall, right next to Raven's very non-super durable head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teens ignored her, Raven lashing out with lethal power Cassie barely dodged. K'ori grimaced, her green eyes narrowing and shot down from the sky with a trail of green light behind her. The team leader snatched both goth and jock by the collar, lifting them high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I said enough!' K'ori yelled, 'you've both gone beyond the rules of training! Someone could have been the hurt!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped both girls to the sand, daring either of them to object. Raven brushed sand off her cape while Cassie muttered, buff arms tensing and fists clenching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Raven, I want egg juggling from you without a single cracked shell. Cassie, I want that wall patched and then an hour on the punching bag without a single burst bag,' K'ori lectured, 'You both need to learn control or you could go to far.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven growled but complied, while Cassie gave a sarcastic snarl of 'Funny for you to say.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have heard a pin drop as Starfire glared at her, eyes burning green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...what were you of the saying?' she managed, glaring at the blonde amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That its funny for you to talk about control when you've, well...,' Cassie shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When I have the what?' Star asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gained weight,' Wonder Girl smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire was a byword for beauty in a profession of gorgeous women. With her ankle length red hair, which was often on fire, gloriously happy and innocent face, high bouncy DDs and hard four pack she was gorgeous. But with her spectacular hips, big steely buns and flawlessly sculpted, literally perfect legs she was one of the most sought after models on the planet as well as a super hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet after her most recent shoot a few weeks ago for Starrware's new foodline, Starfire was feeling herself...change. Karen had warned her that she was looking a little soft and her words had proven prophetic as the alien red head had started to chub up that very day. Her graceful ankles had gotten thicker, her muscular runners thighs had rounded out, her flawless bubble butt had sprouted a spackle of cellulite and started to deflate and the start of a FUPA had covered up her lower abdominal muscles. The single cookie Karen had given her was enough to kill her super human metabolism permanently dead, leaving the Tamaranian tired, cranky and hungry all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as embarrassed. K'ori's species had no taboos about nudity but part of that came from a complete love of their flawless figures. K'ori found herself blushing at the initial brushes of her thighs, of her ankles stretching out her boots, of her butt starting to ooze out of her panties. She'd stopped wearing her V-string outfit out of bashfulness back to her more forgiving mini-skirt and long boots combo, going from exposed belly to one piece as her abs had faded. Not long ago everything would have looked good on her, but now Starfire had a major case of the mom jeans going on. She was shocked and ashamed at the changes, which were doing nothing but increase especially as Star was finding it impossible to stick to any sort of diet. For the first time doubt about her body had entered her mind, refusing to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she getting fatter? Uglier? Could she still have her career? Be a heroine? Would Dick still love her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the younger heroine had brought up Star's no longer perfectly svelte figure, K'ori drew herself up to her full, intimidating height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, a little of the weight has gotten on me,' K'ori lectured, 'it happens, you'll find that out. But that doesn't take away any point of mine. Now, punching bags unless you want to go a few rounds?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie, a buff, head strong young woman with muscles seemingly carved out of oak, smiled, 'Yeah, I think I do.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassie wasn't exactly a rookie, having served three harrowing years as Wonder Woman's side kick before joining the Titans. Her powers fully awakened, she had the speed of a fighter jet and the punching power of a main battle tank. The moment that her sneakers touched down on the sand of the practice ring, her considerable thigh muscles tensed against her blue jeans, eying the still hovering Starfire who's pants were equally tight if for very different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, Wonder Girl had been the ultimate rule following butt kisser but now in her senior year, she'd grown confident enough in her demi-god abilities to buck at the seemingly petty restrictions placed on her at home, at school and as a Titan. Her mom might bitch about her bisexual tendencies and greek paganism clashing with her own catholic beliefs and school might insist she have to attend every class and do the work to be on the varsity girls wrestling team, but Cassie couldn't exactly punch them and still feel like a good person. Starfire on the other hand? With her demands about team work and restraint? Oh she could punch Starfire and still feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially as the ginger bitch's demands had grown with the expanse of her thighs. Cassie's little crush on her team captain's flawless figure, especially her glamorous gams, had made her angry as the Tamaranean had put on the pudge. K'ori was ruining her figure and Cassie's fantasies at once and Wonder Girl would make her pay for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire on the other hand, was looking down past her breasts and noticing that she had the start of a muffin top going on, a little ring of orange flesh brimming over her jeans against the waist of her one piece costume. Yeesh, she really needed to cut down on the...well, the everything to be honest. She settled her heels down on the sand, not even going into a stance as Cassie shot forwards at a few hundred miles an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire may have been softening up, but she still had ten plus years of superheroine work and years of training as a warrior princess. She twisted around,gave an immensely high kick that sent Cassie's feet flying out from under her, grabbed the teen titan by the shoulder and ankle before slamming her hard into the ground. Sand shot up from the demi-god's outline, while Starfire dusted her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Over comitted to the charge were you,' K'ori said, her self confidence refilling 'I used your force against you. This is why control is the important.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ughhh,' was all Cassie could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, I want you too-,' K'ori began before feeling a breeze across her ass and stopping mid sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK'oriander's flexibility and speed hadn't been harmed by the measly thirty-ish pounds she'd put on. Thanks to her immense height she wasn't even overweight technically. But her already full bodonkadonk had put on a few inches and she hadn't upgraded her jeans. Although the sound of the breath leaving Cassie's body had covered the sound of ripping seams, K'ori had torn her pants wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, resume training,' the alien said, 'I'll return soon!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot back to her room, backwards less anyone see the tear. Once in front of her full length mirror, the warrior princess began peeling her pants off with a little difficulty. She winced as her stomach folded into a crinkle of rolls and winced harder seeing her self pantsless in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, no more of the thigh gap for me,' K'ori sighed, looking at the puffy rub of her soft thighs, 'and my calf muscles have gone!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperheroine Monthly's best legs in a row for four years running had gone to seed, losing their graceful muscles and tone, even picking up a little cellulite in the back. And her vaunted ass had ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is it supposed to sag like that?' Starfire asked, pulling her long hair to the side so she could see her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more were they perfectly round and firm, having started to rest against and merge into her thighs. Faint striations of stretch marks were forming across the flabby flesh and K'ori could now pinch the fat flowing out of her panties with ease. She slapped her ass and watched how long it bounced, then winced at how little it flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've become a fat ass,' she sighed before her phone buzzed on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a text from Dick, her long term boyfriend and the super hero Nightwing asking if she was busy that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire was torn. One one hand she desperately needed some reassurance she was still good looking, especially as her calendar happened to be a picture of herself in a bikini, showing off perfect legs and glorious ass that were quite at odds with her plumper present appearance. But what if he disliked how she looked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dick Grayson didn't need to be a master detective to realize something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, although the vivacious Koriander had accepted his date suggestion she'd rejected going dancing. Then the girl who loved showing off her stems had suggested a movie night. That was alright, a long week of crime fighting in Gotham and bludhaven had left Grayson sore. But when Kori had shown up, flying in at mach10 it had been in sweat pants and a hoodie instead of the expected lingerie and with a desire to apparently actually watch something instead of have sex. Usually every time they met the tall tamaranian showered him with kisses but she even avoided his hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you ok, star?' Nightwing had asked ten minutes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori was normally a snuggler extraordinaire even when not desiring sex, but she'd bundled herself up on one corner of the couch with her knees drawn up. Munching a buttery bucket of popcorn, she exuded cranky frumpiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am the fine,' the alien woman grumbled through her snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You sure?' dick asked, 'you seem kinda sick. I know there was a nasty bug going around Gotham recently...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't have a bug, I ... Am I still the attractive to you?' Kori asked green eyes huge and mouth full of corn, grease smearing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'what kinda question is that, Kori?' Dick asked, confused, 'you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick Grayson has seen Catwoman, Lois Lane in her mid twenties peak, fought robots along side a prefat power girl and spent a week on themyscyra at Wonder Woman's invitation. And what he said was completely true, Stars sugar sweet disposition, natural optimism and kindness giving her a moral magnetism beyond any amount of long tan leg, tight tummy or bountiful breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'even now?' Kori asked miserably standing up, ' even like this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori dropped the empty bowl and ripped off her clothes. Dick saw her tantalizing hips, their soft roundness stretching her panties taught and begging for his hands. Saw her thick butter soft thighs pressed together, a run way towards her woman good. Felt his mouth water at the sight of the little fat roll over her panties and her starter belly obscuring her abs. Felt himself go rock hard when she turned profile to show an ass starting to merge with her thighs and showing stretch marks. Near died when he saw how her purple bra band bit into new back fat and how her breasts hung lower in their cups, having found a few years of sag in the month since he'd last seen them. Even Starfires face had changed, a slight puff to her patrician features that made them look kinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've gained thirty of the pounds in one of  the months,' Star confessed, 'i keep trying to do a diet but I'm the hungry all the time and cheat six days every week. I am too much embarrassed to wear my costume, I have a big photoshoot next week and will be much the fatter than the other models, my agent will be the furious and I ripped the last pair of pants my butt would fit into today. My students mock my when my back is turned. I feel the gross and the ugly and the shame, my gribnacks are the saggy and my uglonks jiggle! And I'm the scared and you...\" Star looked down at the speechless and clearly aroused Grayson,\"Really do think I'm pretty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later and the two floated in mid air as the film ended, neither having any idea what it was about. Both were naked, with Grayson laying on her back, hard arms around her soft chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the four times?\" Kori asked teasingly, \"I must be getting the fat then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a teenager any more Kori,\" Dick yawned, \"but give me a minute.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori felt him stir against her ass, knew he wouldn't need that much time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but...I have put on the weight recently. Never have I before,\" Kori shrugged, \"I know you love me but will everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kori,  I'm not sure how tamaranian biology works, but it's not much. You said you were still exercising and your fitness hasn't really changed. What's a few pounds on you when you can lift a tank?\" Dick asked, teaching his fingers in her back to cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I had heard being the thick was in now,\" Star grinned, rolling over and grabbing him by the hard, athletic waist, \"show me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour later and they were on the floor, Stars eyes crossed. Dick looked at her, seeing not the Slinky, warrior princess with the impossible figure he'd fallen in love with, but a gentler, more matronly figure. She lacked muscle tone, her stomach was pinchingly sorry instead of hard and her breasts wound now fail a pencil rest but she'd never looked more alluring. he thought of Star in her old V string costume but with a baby in arms and another obviously already on the way, her smile deep and warm, shot though his mind and stayed there. That Koriander might not score covers by the boat load but she looked happy and serene and oh so soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy not? They were both in their late twenties, they'd dated off and on for ten years, why not pull the figurative trigger? Bruce had married an ex villain after all and Superman had a kid. It wasn't like dick and Kori were so much younger. Between her modeling career and his police salary, to say nothing of a Wayne trust fund, they could get the white picket fence and all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire was sleeping there warm sleep if the reassured, now confident in herself after the marathon sex session. She stirred when dick woke touched her arm, not noticing the roll at her belly when she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is a weird question,\" Dick asked, \"but how about we get married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire grinned, \"thought you'd never the ask.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Are you about ready to go?' Dick asked in minor amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That depends on what you mean by the 'go',' K'ori smirked back at him, raising his blood pressure a notch and then finished off her milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightwing, in civilian clothes, was staring in awe across the table at his now fiancee. Starfire's jaw hung open to expose her pearly white (and sharper than human) teeth, her very long tongue lolling out over her full lips and the first delicate dollop of a double chin forming beneath her mostly clean jawline. Her eyes, behind contacts that kind of hid their alien color, were half crossed.That morning, after wake up sex, K'ori had stuffed herself into a pair of jean cut offs and a tight white button up blouse, perhaps not the wisest after softening up thirty pounds but it showed off her long, curvy stems to perfection and was painted onto her ass. Granted those legs were a little soft and her butt a little lower and yes her up a size boobs mean the top buttons wouldn't close, but Dick wasn't one to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you mean leave, then yes,' the alien said, 'but if you mean go....then also yes. Both depend on me getting up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire was stuffed to the absolute limit and given that she'd once confessed to having nine stomachs, well...that was a lot. K'ori's still flatish, only just pinchable tummy was a distended sphere that looked ready to deliver the kids they'd occasionally talked about having.She leaned forwards and undid the button, letting a tan avalanche pour out over the straining denim. He could see panties at the bottom of the orangish slope, the buttons over her gut were gaping and her belly button had become an outie from pure pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But I think that now I am too the full to be in the mood,' the alien supermodel smiled, surpressing a rather un-lady like burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick had eaten an egg white omelet of spinach, onions and peppers. K'ori had eaten the same, twice. With half a loaf of buttered whole wheat toast and an entire jar's worth of jam. And a a fake hamhock's worth of soy sausage. And four cinnamon rolls the size of a fist. And five glazed doughnuts. And two jam stuffed ones. And a milkshake made after signing an autograph as supermodel Kori Anders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now a glob of sticky crimson juice was on her lower lip and Dick almost had a heart attack when K'ori licked it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But if you can get me to the back seat and find room for both of us...,' the fiery red head said, letting the sentence linger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK'oriander felt she'd made a mistake in eating far, far, far too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Dick's well, happiness at seeing her near naked had washed away the fears she had over her own body and restored much of her own confidence. The sexual marathon afterwards hadn't hurt that either, the multiple body wracking orgasms making the tammaranian princess flood with endorphins and joy, relief that her sexual prowess wasn't harmed by the softer thighs or little belly she'd grown a potent salve. Starfire had always been a woman of appetites, fueling her tall fit body with plenty of calories at her thinnest, and well, the day before she'd almost succeeded on following her diet so after all the sex she was enormously hungry and had kind of let go. She knew that while she was still gorgeous, she should probably avoid two hour binges where she wound up stuffing herself sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not too sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some very gentle, slow and passionate love making in the back of Grayson's car, the two had driven to stately Wayne Manor. The two's busy lives had meant that although Kori had occasionally visited Gotham, she'd never actually been to either the Batcave or to the massive mansion. She cuddled close to Dick as the car pulled up the meticulously kept drive way, her hair falling over her shorter partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you think?' Dick asked her as he pulled to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Very quaint, the royal palace on Tamaran was much the shinier,' the warrior princess teased, 'but you humans must make with the do, eh?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori wasn't completely presentable when they got out of the car. While her curly hair was always perfect somehow, she needed a second to fix her make up and then barely manage to button up her pants, her fast digestion efficiently moving calories from her stomachs to her thighs. She still looked pregnant, but the night of inkindling passion seemed five months in the past instead of nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How do I look?' Star asked, still a little anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have a photo shoot in a couple weeks and the bikinis for it were very, very, very small. She had a half written email in her outbox to the shoot manager, saying that hers needed increased by at least two sizes. Star knew the fashion world had changed a bit, being a little curvier when you were already a name was somewhat allowed but if she kept pigging out like this then...well there was always plus size she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two entered the manor, the door opening on Dick's thumb print, and went into the to be greeted by a not-quite familiar sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dick!' a very pear shaped Selina Kyle-Wayne cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slinky, sexy catburglar who could climb a sky scraper like others walked a side walk was gone. Her firm legs inflated hamhocks, her hard waist a distended and puffy gut stretching her designer skirt to the breaking point, her lean features rounded and soft, her breasts heavy and wobbly and her arms gone from dextrous to lazy pillows. She waddled over towards Grayson and hugged him like the prodigal son, even though she was only four years older than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Selina?' Nightwing asked in surprise, seeing Bruce's nubile new bride having packed on eighty pounds of dough in just a few months, blowing up from svelte criminal to obese society matron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, you probably didn't recognize me with my new hair cut,' Selina, who's short pixie cut didn't flatter her rounder face smiled, 'come on, Alfred's about to lay out brunch.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we already ate,' Dick tried to say, but the obese catwoman couldn't be disuaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I haven't, so you'll have to indulge me,' Selina yawned and started waddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stared in amazement at the door breaker hips swinging side to side in front of them. For Kori it was like seeing the ghost of christmas future, another trim woman inflating up in her lower half, merely months ahead of her. For Dick it was complete shock, he'd guessed Selina would pack on some weight after retiring from crime but not this fast. What really messed with him was how middle aged and relaxed the cat burglar was acting, as if she'd help raise him rather than be an active criminal most of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick had been infected by Ivy's virus thanks to Selina sneezing on door knobs months earlier and like the rest of superhero community given a rampant fat fetish that had only emerged at seeing Starfire's extra pounds. While he would have loved her regardless, he was now looking forwards to the inevitable increase in his fiance's hips. Kori on the other hand hadn't been infected, too many extra steps between her and the others (although Wonder Girl had contracted another mutated form that's a story for another day) and was horrified to think she might get that big. The bloated superheroine promised to ditch pizza for salads from now on unless she turned into that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being seated, the loyal retainer Alfred winking encouragingly at the young master, Selina immediately started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, tell me all about this delightful young lady you're planning to marry,' Selina grinned, 'and I promise not to bring up when you had green shorts in you outfit...too much.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well it all began with a kiss,' Dick teased, guessing he could get into the mood of whatever weird shit was happening here, 'say where is Bruce?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Some league thing, you know how it is. Hopefully he'll get in for dinner,' Selina giggled as she scarfed down scones, 'Cassandra is supposed to meet us when she's done training.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat cut through the mental haze Kori was having, making her look away from the pile of delicious looking treats and towards the ballooning ex-supervillain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cassandra?' Starfire asked, mind thinking of Wonder Girl Casandra Sandsmark's harsh words and her own pants split the other day, 'Who?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arm took the chance to grab a scone and her mouth agreed to start eating it while Kori's brain was otherwise distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, its been so long since you were in Gotham. I'm an idiot,' Dick sighed, 'so, I know you met Damian but well in the past year there's been another new addition...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra jumped, rolled and kicked through one of the Bat-cave's ever changing obstacle courses, occasionally lashing out at a target to hit it with pin point accuracy and perfectly controlled force. A small army of security drones filled the pitch black maze but Batgirl easily avoided them, their state of the art equipment unable to keep up with her magnificent skills. The impossibly dangerous young woman rolled across the finish line with a graceful somersault, the cave computer congratulating her on destroying yet another record. There was very little pride in it, Cass just did her best as always, especially as she could not yet read the display to her frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoffing her cowl and changing into civilian clothes, Cass headed upstairs for a shower and pre-afternoon nap meal, already salivating at the thought of poached eggs and spinach when she heard giggling and laughing coming from the dining room. She tip toed over, silent as the grave, and peered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile immediately formed when she saw Selina's sweet, pampered body jiggling with a laugh. Every the ex-thief so much as smiled Cass did too. But when she looked past Dick, her favorite of the ex-robins by far, and to the girl next to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEndless thick thighs. A well fed food baby pushing past her pants. Insanely round hips. The face of a pampered angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass blinked for a moment and then found the ground rushing up at her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cass woke up dimly, blinking her soft brown eyes slowly at the dull shapes in front of her. There were four of them, round soft and bulging. Two were milky pale, with small, silvery marks on the outer sides and pale blue veins spun across them packed into a shimmery black fabric. Two, slightly larger, were a deep tan half way between brown and orange, with freckles of deeper brown, bulged out more towards her face, falling out of a white, unbuttoned top. Usually Batgirl's instinct upon waking up was to start punching, but even if her arms hadn't been pinned to her sides by tight blankets, her immediate instinct was to pucker her lips. There was more boob flesh in front of her than she'd ever thought to see after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's waking up! Cass baby, can you hear me?' one cultured voice asked, 'oh I knew she was too skinny.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, call the ambulance! What if she's hurt?' a strangely accented voice objected, the orange boobs bouncing before the vigilante's eyes, 'she could have the concussion!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Girls she was only out for a minute with a steady pulse and no broken bones, give her some air,' a familiar male voice told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass gave a groan as the heavenly sea of tit flesh pulled back, revealing her room in Wayne Manor. Posters of ballerinas and martial artists covered the walls, her obsession with human emotion shown through movement on display, and Batgirl felt herself blush when she realized that Dick's elbow was leaning on her dresser, where a substantial amount of porn was stored. Selina and Starfire were kneeling on her bed, faces awash with motherly concern and heavy breasts almost falling out of their dresses and into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass darling baby, are you okay?' her step mother asked in immense concern, leaning forward and putting a hand to the assassin-trained young woman's forehead to check her temp for a fever, 'oh after we both got sick I knew you should have taken a few months off this cape stuff. Its not safe for a girl like you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this brought Selina's fat engorged tits up to Cass' nose, she was happy to let her do it. She'd liked Catwoman after she'd turned straight, finding her a kind and sympathetic woman, but liked her more when she'd first popped a starter belly and lost her thigh muscles. When it had turned sexual Cass couldn't say, but well...now with fat engorged DDs in her face that question was academic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm going to call Brucie and have him take you out of rotation,' Selina said, pulling back and hauling a phone from her bra, a benefit of being suddenly large busted, 'at least until we can get a doctor to see you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, no, I'm fine,' Cass tried denying and setting up, only for Starfire to press her flat to the bed with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass might only weight 120 hard, muscley pounds but her immense training and an inexplicable, almost mystical focus gave her the strength of someone thrice that size. She was a little surprised when the abundantly soft redhead pushed her flat to the bed with ease, exerting just enough effort that a tide of boob almost splashed out of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, the rest. Let me check your eyes,' Dick's fiance insisted, leaning in close to look at Cass' pupils, 'so many of my Titans get the concussion, I'm good at the checking.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust by her almost feline body language, Batgirl could tell the redhead wasn't human. But that didn't matter much when she was posed over her in bed like one of the pinups Cass had haltlingly found online and printed out for her own colllection, heavy boobs hanging down in her shirt, full, well fed paunch hanging out of her tight skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They're fine but you look so the sweaty and your breathing is the rapid,' Star mused, 'you seem sick.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just uh...,' Cass said, trying to find a word for it and remembering something Stephanie had whispered to Tim once and muttered while falling asleep after a feeding session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she wasn't about to say 'Impossibly turned on' to her step-mom and future sister in law. Not when she was fumbling awkwardly but with progression towards a relationship with Stephanie and Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'tired. Need a nap,' she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm. And probably some food,' Catwoman suggested, poking Cass' stomach and wincing when her soft finger hit Batgirl's thousand weighted sit ups a day abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. Eggs and spinach,' Cassandra, who really was hungry, insisted, 'pepper and hot sauce, no salt. Whole wheat toast and avacaodes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's not a real meal Cass,' Selina told her, 'I know I've been hounding you but its not right that you don't have a single slice of cake or pie at your meals.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Umm, that's not quite something a super heroine should eat,' Starfire objected, 'lean protein and healthy carbs and fat like that are good for her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire didn't seem one to be objecting to heavy eating. The supermodel heroine alien's gut still looked pregnant and growled for more, having begun gurgling at the mere mention of cake. Her legs were soft and her boobs heavy, her full ass hanging out of her skirt and explaining Dick's silence during the conversation. But she wasn't a viral infectee and retained old body standards, feeling a bit sheepish over her sudden lurch towards the plus sizes and not wanting anyone else go get big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina frowned at Kori's intrusion, fixing her with a soft glare. The ex-burglar was a high society lardass who's hips were a foot too big around to ever fit into her catsuit again after only a couple months post-infection. After her second feast of the day the seams on her short dress were being tested to the breaking point, the fabric whiskering over her scone stuffed gut. And she had no concern at all over her daughter picking up a few hundred pounds, a girl of Cassandra's class shouldn't be lean and lethal, but soft and privileged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eggs,' Cass insisted, having no wish to get stuffed sick, the one time she'd tried sweet foods in her life having left her puking from pure nausea, 'you eat cake.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...fine then,' Selina insisted, sitting up to head to the kitchen only for Cassandra to pull her back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman had long lost all of her muscle, turning into a big, bottom heavy cream puff and Batgirl easily pulled her down to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Still tired. Stay with me?' she asked softly, delighting at the feeling of Selina's girthy hips pressing into her and how her green eyed-step mom's breasts lay heavily upon her own flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh of course baby,' the doting adoptive mother agreed, 'Dick, be a dear and get Cass her eggs while we nap.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, sure,' Dick shrugged, snapping his attention away from his girlfriend's well rounded rear end, 'Kori wanna help me find the kitchen?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I should stay here in case there's a relapse,' Kori told him, pressing in on Cassandra's other side, 'her heart rate is very high!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just need rest,' Cass insisted, although the Tamaranian E cup pressed into her cheek made it hard to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick shook his head, glad at the matronly concern K'oriander was already expressing even if he didn't think it was needed. Selina might treat his adopted sister like she was made of glass but Dick knew she was tougher than steel, possibly the toughest person he knew. Why she'd fallen down was a mystery to him, if it hadn't been innocent, angelic Cass he would have assumed she was trying to get a nap between Catwoman and Starfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bedroom, Dick headed down to the kitchen, running into the grumbling Damian as the later arrived home from school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I swear, no one ever listens to me about any of this,' the grouchy youngest Wayne and fourth Robin insisted,'is everyone else in the world blind? Am I the only one not noticing this happening?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Problem tough guy?' Dick asked Bruce's only blood descendant so far, probably a shortly fixed session if how Batman looked at his pear shaped bride was any indicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, I'm the only sane man left in the world! Its like I'm taking crazy pills!' the heir to the league of Assassins and only totally non-infected member of the Batfamily ranted, running upstairs, 'how the hell is no one else noticing this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim and Stephanie came into the immense main entrance hall not long after that, having picked the grouch up from school. The third robin was like a taller Damian or shorter Dick, a muscular and clean cut young man in a letterman's jacket ironically covered in computing and robotics team letters. Spoiler was pressed in next to him, Stephanie's paunch oozing out over her far too tight jeans. The blonde senior had picked up an early freshman fifteen twice over before the end of first semester, most of it hitting her upper body to give her a rather thick midsection and heavy boobs. She hadn't thrown a punch in three weeks, staying back and commanding drones or spotting for her team mates and would likely soon edge totally towards a supporting role, although the pair were working on a strength and agility boosting suit to make up for her physical deterioration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Any clue what set off King crabby pants?' Dick asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No clue. All he does is insult Stephanie and then when we tell him to cut it out he goes ape shit about every woman in town getting fat without noticing it,' Tim shook his head, 'he's just going crazy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, he's so non-body positive,' Steph agreed, munching anonymous cookies even as she tugged her belt buckle, 'like, so I've filled out a little. What's the big deal?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph had been on a diet since entering the super hero game but that had been before her infection. Now she ate whatever she wanted, which was everything, whenever she wanted, which was often. Only sparring with Cass and nightly patrols through the city had kept her just plump, but if she was pulled off active duty then all bets were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I'm going to go get Cass some eggs. She had a weird fall,' Dick began only for Steph to give a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass is hurt!?' the blonde squealed, bouncing off upstairs to be with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Girls,' Dick sighed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cass' afternoon nap was incredibly refreshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina had been used to long cat naps during her catburglar days, recuperating from the previous night's exertions, and had kept it up when her biggest exertion had become sex. Catwoman passed out pretty quickly, the emotional and physical exertion of her step daughter fainting had tired the retired thief out and when combined with her absolutely full belly of scones and bacon, well, the catburglar was soon curled up next to Batgirl and snoring cutely. She'd rolled over in her sleep, her inflated ass pressing down on Cass' hard thighs, warmer than any blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire was on her right, asleep on her side and leaning into the thinner heroine. She'd fallen asleep not too long after, while still an active heroine the plumping redhead was giving into her new gluttonous nature and the laziness induced by Ivy's miracle food. Cass was in deep danger of drowning within the canyon of alien boob fat, their warmth permeating her face.Star's fully belly pressed onto Batgirl's rockhard abs, a contrast of flabby and firmness that made her want to sing if she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut everything has to end and eventually Batgirl had to slide out from beneath the covers and get on with her day. A very late lunch/early dinner of eggs and toast satisfied her hunger pangs and then the lethally lithe vigilante resumed her training down in the Batcave with the rest of the family while the lazy plumpers upstairs napped into the evening. Cass couldn't suppress a skip in her step after the nap, the presence of so much boob and ass pressing into her revitalizing as a soft rain on a spring day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the silent Batgirl couldn't focus too much on the soft bulks of her step-mom and future in law, she had other fish to fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely Stephanie Brown: smart, loving, empathetic, brave, dedicated and all around lovably cute dork.The blonde vigilante was currently in sweats and t-shirt, her chubby muffin top hanging out over her pants, as she spared against Damian in the training circle. Cass didn't require her horrible upbringing to see the exhaustion pouring off her chunky besty, the sweat outlining her sports bra was more than enough. For a second the silent siren watched, noting that Stephanie's skill and strength were increasing, from practice and at least doubling her daily caloric intake, but that her stamina was falling off a cliff. Spoiler was taking great heaving breathes, giving the shortest Wayne more openings than needed as they sparred. Cass winced as Stephanie tried kicking Damian in the face, not a  high kick considering but failed to take in her rapidly shifting center of gravity. Damian caught her ankle and easily flipped her on her back, driving her air out and making her immediately tap out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm done,' Spoiler groaned, Cass seeing a delicious twinge of humiliation, shock and shame that confused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie was a good martial artists but depended more on gadgets and sabotage than the rest of the family. Damian was unfortunately her superior in terms of hand to hand combat, but given that he too had been raised by the league of assassins from birth while Stephanie had started her training less than two years earlier, she'd done well to have lasted as long as she did. It wasn't anything to be ashamed about, which confused Cass....until she saw the blonde get up and immediately understood that her D cup bra hadn't survived the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Steph sat up there was a soft roll over her waistband, meaty belly folding in on itself and driving Cass wild. But as she stood...Steph sagged and then bounced back up as she got up, rubbing her back and making her heavy breasts bounce. Stephanie had never been busty before her infection, lucky to be a modest B-cup due to her active life style. To Cass though, that combined with her long hair and having actual hips had made her impossibly feminine. To see her engorged boobs now large enough to actually bounce almost made Cass faint again. She needed to work up the courage to ask to touch them their next sleep over, to bury her face in them and never come up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is exactly what I'm talking about!' Damian snapped, angry voice grating through Batgirl's fantasies,'am I the only one to notice how heavy all of the girls are getting? Everyone but Cassandra has become a bloated hag! And its not like Brown was worth much before!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrayson, overseeing Tim going through the obstacle course, let out a sigh and started thinking of what punishment to dole out to his youngest brother and hoping that Steph wasn't crying. When he turned around though, after less than a second, Steph had her hands over her mouth while Cass was dangling the little turd over a bottomless chasm by his ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Apologize,' Cass ordered him, eyes on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell's gotten into you?' Damien demanded, not sure how he'd gone from standing on the matts to hanging in the air, 'I was only speaking the truth!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Apologize,' Batgirl hissed, impossibly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass what the hell's gotten into you, put him down!' Dick told her, Nightwing dashing over as Stephanie hurried up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its not worth dropping him over!' Steph said, running up to Batgirl's side, fluffy paunch pressing into her hard hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When he apologizes,' Cain hissed through a clenched jaw, the skinny ex-assassin holding the boy without any apparent effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damian apologize to Stephanie now,' Dick sighed, rubbing his eyes and hoping parenting wouldn't be like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring of alarms sounded, cutting off the discussion. The Bat-Signal had been lit up early, meaning something big was going on. Dick sighed and hurried over the computer, while Cass tossed Damian to the side casually and stormed off, Steph hurrying after. The youngest Wayne dusted himself off and went towards Grayson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great leadership skills Grayson,' Damian muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nice job insulting the best friend of the most dangerous girl in Gotham, Damian,' Dick told him, eyes narrowing as he read the police report, 'Oh shit.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass, wait up! Come on, please stop! Oh God, when did you get so fast' Steph yelled, jogging after her friend who was pulling ahead into the depths of the cave and stopping when she felt a stitch in her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her exercise, the fat virus and a few days worth of Anonymous cookies had made her quite out of shape. Running wasn't her thing anymore, especially given how her thick thighs were rubbing and her heavy boobs were currently unsupported. But the moment she bent down to catch her breath, Cass was suddenly at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You okay?' the iron hard Batgirl asked her with caring concern, putting a hand on her friend's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just *whew* out of breath,' Brown wheezed, 'worked pretty hard today. But you, why'd you do that to the prince grouchy? I can handle his bullshit. Maybe not in the ring but verbally, I've got that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Have to protect you,' Cass mumbled, feeling her own breath rising just from standing next to her, feeling her love handle press into her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just a dumb insult, his fault he can't handle a real woman being around. Uh. Not that I'm saying anything against you by the way I just said that. You're obviously sexy as hell despite being skinny and uh...,' Steph stammered as Cass pressed in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Doesn't get to insult,' the skinnier vigilante breathed out, pressing in, feeling Steph's paunch press into her own abs, stepping closer and feeling Steph's fuller chest overwhelm her tiny boobs, 'my...girl...friend.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass, I'm n' Steph said, cutting off when Cass kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra had nothing to compare the kiss to. She felt warm from head to toe, her heart hammering harder than after fighting an entire army of ninjas. All of her muscles tensed to the point of cramping. It was really quite graceless, an action she had no practice at for once, and she smushed noses with Steph until she adjusted. For a second Steph was surprised and then kissed her back, putting her hands in the small of Cass' back to pull the shorter girl up to her. To Cass, Stephanie tasted like Christmas and she didn't want it to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Girls we're gonna need all hands on...,' Dick said, walking up with typical Batfamily quietness and pausing as he saw both girls lip to lip, 'uh...head back to the computer when you're ready.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Steph broke the contact, breathing hard, 'Okay, should have expected that to be honest.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra laid her head on her shoulder, smiling and reading the peace and happiness off the blonde's body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But ...not like it wasn't great but Cass, I'm not on the market. I don't want to start some sort of horrible inter-bat family fight,' Steph tried to say, only for her friend to shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Enough of you to share,' Batgirl told her, 'he wont...mind.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked towards the computer, hand in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the exception of Bruce himself, almost the entire Bat Family was on hand in the cave:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick himself, already dressed as Nightwing was at the main computer, with the family spread out in an arc before him: Damian as Robin, Tim Drake as Red Robin, Stephanie Brown as Spoiler, Cassandra Cain as Batgirl and Selina...as a very well fed house wife whose thighs were stretching her leggings to the breaking point. <br>\r\nThe odd one out was Starfire hovering above the ground in thigh high purple boots and a matching bikini, made for a woman thirty pounds thinner. He had trouble not looking at her thigh fat bulging out over the tops of her boots despite having had sex nearly ten times in the last day with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Cass and Stephanie were masked so he didn't have to see any looks between them. Seeing his adopted sister and his adopted brother's girlfriend frenching was not his idea of fun. Granted he was happy for Cass but was not looking forwards to dealing with the teen drama from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, now that everyone is here,' Dick said, wishing that Bruce was here to deal with this shit then realizing it was best he handle it given Bruce's uh Bruceness, 'we've got an alien incursion in downtown.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Blast, I knew that this would happen again,' Damian snarled, 'who is it? The White Martians? Darkseid? Have the Kryptonians turned on us at last?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, no,' Dick sighed, 'thankfully, but its um...I'll let the video speak for itself!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Computer Screen flickered over to a news feed of the plaza in front of Wayne Tower, an upper end commercial district usually well policed. Right now it was littered with hopefully just unconscious police officers and burned cop cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Weak mortal men of uh... Earth! I, Maxima Queen of Planet Almerac  have come seeking a suitable mate!' a tall, incredibly muscular redhaired woman in extremely revealing green armor yelled, holding up a sword in one hand and a cop car in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a cross between Starfire and Wonder Woman at their fittest, an impossible collection of curves and muscle although with a slightly bloated stomach.She also swayed slightly, as if she was just moderately drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bring your best to me! Only the one who defeats me will be a suitable mate!' the human seeming alien yelled throwing the cop car away and taking a chug off of a bottle, 'And do it soon I tell you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Easy then, earth men are...uh, very nice,' a yawning Kori saved realizing that Damien was in the room, munching on a post-nap muffin, 'we find her a boyfriend and everyone is the winner!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unfortunately its not that easy,' Dick explained, 'I'll let the video speak for itself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If no one defeats me by the stroke of midnight, then I shall wipe this miserable city off the face of the earth!' Maxima finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought a wince from the entire assembled Bat Clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So as for beating her...,' Dick began only to be cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's a Kryptonian level threat,' Barbara Gordon interrupted, rolling into the room, 'first rank psionics letting her resist bullets and throw battleships. We're going to need a plan to be able to beat her. Good to see everyone again, sorry its under these circumstances.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOracle wheeled herself up to the computer, the plush and pudgy computer PHD's belly jiggling as she went over every bump in the tiles. Her slightly plumper finger tips dashed across the Bat-Computer's keys, bringing up detailed information on the alien queen. She gave nods to the rest of the family, even Selina, while pointedly ignoring Starfire. K'ori glared and Dick immediately felt himself start sweating from the nerves one got when your ex-fiancee and current fiancee are in the same room. Especially when one was a genius computer hacker information broker and the other was an alien princess super model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the weight Babs had put on really suited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She typically bothers Superman whenever shes' ...amorous,' Barbara informed them, 'unfortunately he's not available. I'm sending out notices to any meta human or alien with a high enough power ranking to fight her but I don't know if any are available.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'As if we needed some alien or meta human's help. This is Gotham,' Damian grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wouldn't Starfire be able to beat her?' Tim asked, his lack of social skills missing the obvious tension in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...Oh, is Starfire here?' Barbara asked, turning around and pretending to see the towering, gorgeous woman falling out of her swimsuit, 'Oh, didn't notice you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK'ori glared, eyes starting to smoulder in anger and annoyed the wheel chair bound PHD was looking so healthy, 'Glad to see you out and about Barbara. But don't worry I'll be able to handle her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Doubt it,' Babs said, annoyed that the supermodel alien looked so good, 'I've got body cam, surveillance and traffic data to begin evacuating downtown at the very least. I'm going to need everyone doing sweeps for anyone trapped. I've got some feelers out, there's some reserve members who might be able to take her down.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Glad for the information Babs,' Dick decided to run with, sweating more when he saw Starfire's face, 'but right now I think we can at least hold her back. We'll be splitting into two teams. Cass, Tim,  Damian and Stephanie will run evacuation. Star and I will try and stall her. I'll do my best to talk but if we have to, Star can fight her until we get some heavy back up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm on the fight,' Cass objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass, she's not someone you can beat with just human punches,' Nightwing tried telling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I won't use punches,' the quiet girl objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick knew that arguing with her was a losing proposition. When the other person can just go silent forever words can't have that much of an effect, 'Alright then Cass, if you say so. Everyone, let's head out.'<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass, baby, I'm worried about you,' Selina told her, wrapping her tubby arms around Batgirl's iron hard shoulders, 'you fell down today and you shouldn't be going out in a fight like this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, you fell down? Since when do you fall down?' Barbara demanded, turning away from working the transit networks and wheeling up towards her charge, belly poking into Cass' thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you sure you're alright? You seam extremely sweaty,' Starfire observed, pressing close enough Cass was threatened to be pulled in by her breasts gravitational pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'fff...fine,' Batgirl managed, overwhelmed by so much motherly attention at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did you ever even eat any dinner?' Selina pressed on, 'look at you you're skin and bones.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have been on duty every night for the last year. Maybe you should relax a bit,' Barbara told her, 'I know, I should book us a cruise. You can lay back and put on a few pounds that you clearly need.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, I mean, uh yes, later,' Cass stammered, 'have to fight now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, the girl dashed towards the already taking off Batwing, Starfire floating alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry, I know you're the clearly an excellent fighter,' the alien told her, 'when this is done, why don't you come train with my titans? There's a lot of other girls your age there.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls her age there. Cassandra almost slipped getting into the jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you sure you're the okay?' Star asked again, boobs almost falling out of her top as she leaned forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure,' the quiet girl managed, having to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat shaped jet's engines fired off, sparing Cass more sexual confusion. Her heart beat returned to normal by the time they left the cave's tunnels, the stealthy fighter craft humming along under Dick's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not gonna tell you what to do,' the oldest side kick told her, after insuring the comms were off, 'but please let me try and talk this crazy alien out of this first. I hate to brag but this won't be the first time I've had to deal with a horny alien princess...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nTen minutes later and the Bat-Wing was smouldering shrapnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Babs, any update on that help?' Dick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick struggled, trying to free himself but fifteen years of Bat training can't help much against a steel bar wrapped tight around your wrists. He'd gotten maybe three words before Maxima had started beating the shit out of him, a few minutes of desperate dodging ending when she'd gotten him around the leg. Spitting blood, he looked around through the one eye not swollen shut, seeing flashes of green light signifying Starbolts. Starfire, covered in sweat with rips and tears in her outfit, fat bulging through the rips, dodged under a cop car chucked at her and fired off another useless burst of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Working on it,' Barbara yelled back, 'I keep getting busy signals and crises and...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is that all...*hic* is that all you...earthlings ...can do?' Maxima ranted drunkenly, staggering on her feet only from booze and not from anything else, 'oh new gods, I'm never...never gonna...get laid...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Laid this!' Starfire yelled, dodging down to try and punch her enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe much more muscular alien took a step back from the pudgy Tamaranian and then grabbed her by the throat. Starfire kicked and struggled, bikini bottoms ripping apart to show her inflated cheeks while one chubby boob popped free. Dick would have stared but he was pretty sure that his fiance was about to die and he would be completely helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Swear to...swear to New Genesis that I...uh...,' the drunk Maxima slurred, 'uh...blow up your city and then drunk fuck the guy with the tight ass over...over there...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that didn't sound good either. Captured, about to see his city blow up, his fiance killed and then getting...and where the hell was Cass?'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassandra Cain knew how to read people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while alien body languages hadn't been part of her horrific upbringing, the near-humans like Kryptonians and Tamaranians and the like weren't any different. She'd been able to read the absolute and selfless love pouring off K'ori towards Dick like Barbara could read computer code, as well as her petty jealousy and flustered attractions towards Barbara. Ditto for the few times she'd seen Superman, who'd radiated love and honesty like a star radiates light, and Power Girl who'd done the same with a little resentment and an immense amount of hidden lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been able to read Maxima clear as day the moment she saw the buff red head on the Bat-Computer's screen and immediately figured out how to beat her. Well, almost. Cass knew academically that the kick to the throat her muscles suggested wouldn't do something to a woman so strong. But knowing that, she'd still been able to figure out the way to defeat the angry redheaded warrior Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Bat-Wing had sat down, Dick had slowly approached the drunkenly ranting Maxima while Starfire served overwatch. Cass had done a Bat-Family vanish, running past wrecked cop cars and abandoned barricades until she'd found what she was looking for. Figuring out how to get it started and drive it was an issue, she'd seen Bruce and Dick and Stephanie drive before but the Batmobile and various other bat family vehicles were a far cry from a semi-truck. She managed to get the key turned by the time Dick's 'I'm Nightwing and I'm not here to fight you' speech had gone south and put it into a gear by the time he finally failed to dodge one of Maxima's sloppy yet sound barrier breaking punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that gear was reverse and a thankfully abandoned car got smashed flat as the big semi backed up. Panicking, Batgirl slammed on the breaks and looked at the confusing mishmash of gear letters, her severe dyslexia keeping her from figuring out which was which. Trial and error found 1st by the time Dick was tied up and she started driving forwards, having to painfully navigate at 3 miles per hour while Starfire's chunky form loosed useless starbolts at the nearly invincible Maxima, the energy doing little but blast off pieces of her armor and leave the scantily clad alien even more naked than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I swear I'm gonna...do...ugh. So stupid...piece of shit Lobo...ran off...,' the alien Queen slurred as Starfire kicked helplessly in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick saw the fight scene illuminated as a massive truck pulled up, coming slowly but surely towards him. The acrobat winced at the painful death, especially as he saw Cass, the least vehicular inclined member of the family behind the wheel. Fortunately she managed to slam on the break ...before it hit a barrier. But the truck was only going a mile an hour so it just stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What...new devilry...is this...stupid planet,' Maxima muttered, tossing Starfire away towards Dick and trying to find her sword, 'kick its ass...anyway...unless something has the balls to fuck me today...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass leapt from the window of the truck onto its top with athletic grace, kneeling low and balling her fists as Maxima stumbled to the top. Her mind was giving her suggestions on how to physically murder this woman, like it always did around everyone all the time, but she had to ignore it even harder than before. Punching couldn't solve anything...but her other talents could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Back off little twig girl...the chubbster over their couldn't kill me and at least at least *hic* she's tall,' Maxima muttered, taking another drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl raised her black armored fist in the air and brought them down. Skinny as a twig she might be, but Cass was stupidly strong and she ripped through the steel top of the trailer like it was tissue paper, tearing a four foot wide hole. Taking a deep breath and again glad her suit lacked a mouth, she dove down into it, leaving the drunk alien wavering in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh...not yet you don't!' Maxima snarled, jumping after her and into a sea of cream filling, frosting, crust, syrup and Poison Ivy engineered hormones designed to make the consumer fat, lazy and placid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor half a second the alien Queen feared a trap of some sort, but then she was munching on the stacks and trays of unwrapped treats out for delivery from the local Anonymous bakery. The low speed wreck had knocked them off the shelves into a deep pile on the floor, one that Maxima was now gobbling down with superhuman speed and appetite. Maxima ate and ate, dulling the fires of her post break up anger on a technicolored sea of macaroons and gorging away her horniness on a four hundred pound plateau of triple fudge chunk cookies. Her already booze bloated stomach ballooned out past her considerable breasts before long as she crawled along the floor eating, breaking the buckle of her sword belt and letting her armored hot pants ride lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Starfire ripped the steel off of Dick's bruised wrists, the two heroes readying themselves for the inevitable fight ahead. Dick was terrified his little sister, ultra bad ass or not, had decided to take this maniac on while Starfire, aside from her hurt pride, was just confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dick! Your lens cameras off line, what's going on?' Barbara demanded over the comm unit, 'what's happening?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, Cassandra appears to be a lot better at distracting her,' Grayson reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cassandra? Dick get her the hell out of there!' Babs yelled, 'if she tries to fight she'll get killed! Holy shit, her vital signs are off the chart: heart rate, brain activity, its like she's exploding in there!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For the love of God, Dick pull her out of there!' Selina ordered, 'if she gets hurt I swear, that retired or not I am kicking your ass.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Be the relaxing, she simply tricked Maxima into diving into a truck of...is that me?' Starfire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe side of the Semi-Trailer depicted a perfectly lithe 'Kory Anders' sitting on a beach. With trim, firm and slender legs stretched out in front of her, her hard abs and tiny waist on display and her full breasts about to fall out of a white bikini, while she provocatively put a long jon donut towards her lips. The picture was sexy enough that it made the usually horny princess squirm but also a reminder of just how she'd puffed up. She'd never even be able to tie that miniscule string bikini on now and even if she sucked in an empty stomach to the max, displaying every modeling trick to hide an extra pound she knew, Kori couldn't get her stomach that flat again. She resolved to double down on her diet and be that woman again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick was just amazed how much better Star looked now. So much more luscious, mature and vibrant than the starved stick in the picture. Granted, Star had been pretty then for sure, but now she was just so much more healthy and womanly. Partly it was the effect of Ivy's virus making him think that but such was Grayson's love for her that he'd have convinced himself of it without the infection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Doesn't matter, we've got to get her out,' Grayson said, shaking off thoughts about seeing Star in her current, or larger size, pouring out of that thong, 'she's a better dodger and stronger than me but not on Maxima's level, but she's probably bought us some time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ran forwards, Barbara radioing in their ears, 'Her vital signs have plunged, heart rate almost halved in just a second, she might be out cold!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cass...,' Selina trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry, we'll-,' Dick began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by the back doors being kicked open and a slightly junk food stained Batgirl hoping out. Cass moved with a slightly woozy step but her full face mask made reading her expression impossible. She sat down and gave a long, satisfied sigh that was almost a giggle. Of Maxima there was no sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'she's fine,' Nightwing relayed, 'Cass, what the hell happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Told you, I could beat her,' Batgirl said tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire looked inside at her tormentor, who'd dared to call her chunky, and let out a high laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxima was passed out flat on her back, her red curls splattered with frosting and her face painted with cream, like a toddler let at a cake. Her armored pants had fully ripped away, leaving her clad only in a bra, and her stomach was a beach ball sized monument to raw gluttony. Strange growling noises sounded from the engorged woman's waist as her alien metabolism, altered by Ivy's extracts, went to work on turning the hundreds of pounds of gorged junk into fat cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And she called me chunky,' Star huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did you get her to do that?' Grayson asked, amazed that Cass had come up with it, 'I have to admit I would not have thought of that strategy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm, knew she wasn't angry,' Cassandra explained, 'just depressed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been obvious to Cass. When Stephanie felt inadequate she overate. When Babs felt despondent over her legs and single-ness she over ate. When Selina worried about her social class she over ate. Granted they often ate because Cass was there giving them food, but the truth remained: depressed girls over ate. Not Cass though, she generally just punched training droids or holograms when she was depressed which was frequent given everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight though she wasn't. The kiss with Stephanie had been special but the sight of Maxima gorging herself into defeat and out of her clothes had been...something else for her. For a while all the bad fears and doubts and self hate had gone away, leaving Cass ready for more action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Going on patrol,' Cassandra announced, drawing out a grapple gun, 'you clean up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot off into the night, leaving Dick and Star alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not what I was expecting, but I'm glad she talked me into it,' Grayson shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She seems very *munch* capable,' Starfire agreed, digging into one of the uneaten cheese cakes in the back of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer diet could start tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nervous didn't even begin to describe how Cass was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all started after her defeat of the alien warqueen Maxima, when some plucky news reporters had gotten an excellent photograph of the 5'6 Batgirl standing alone against the 6'4 tower of drunken alien muscle. That had given her the public credit for saving the city, especially as the embarassing details of Maxima's fattening defeat hadn't been shared, and as a result the quiet girl's popularity in the community had skyrocketed. But Gotham being Gotham this had pissed off many of the Mafia gangs and Supervillain madmen that had had previous plans more quietly thwarted by the frightening ex-assassin. The Penguin had set a fifteen million dollar bounty on her head, dead or alive, leading to a deluge of hit men, assassins and bounty hunters descending on the city for Cass' head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks of criminal murderers trying to punch, stab, snip or blow her up hadn't been an issue for her. Not having to worry about them gunning for anyone else was honestly relaxing and with all the criminals throwing themselves onto Batgirl's fists, the city was more peaceful than it had been in years. She'd filled hospital wounds with the broken bodies of her would be hunters, all of them alive but in immense pain, during a two week war that had ended when Deathstroke had gone after her on a friday, counting on her being tired from the constant fighting. Cass hadn't slept in a couple days at that point and the deadly contract killer had managed to get in a few deep sword wounds to her thigh and bicep before she broke his legs, arms, pelvis, jaw and nose and then put him into a coma before passing out from blood loss herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're off patrol for the weekend,\" Bruce had told her when she woke up in the cave, her arm and leg sutured and a blood transfusion going into her veins, \"Just until you recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, I'm fine!\" she'd insisted, but seeing the ponderous form of Selina tapping her foot behind him told her exactly what her chances of winning the argument were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be for months, you had me worried sick the whole two weeks,\" the matronly catwoman huffed, ripples going up her when she tapped her high heeled shoe and chin wagging as she munched an eclair, \"I swear, you're going to drive me to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started at her swollen foot, fat rippling up her swollen ankle and clumsy cankle, over her dimpled knee and across the pillowy expanse of her thighs, which were red where they rubbed constantly despite constant applications of soothing cream. Stylish as ever, the obese Selina was crammed into a little black dress which barely covered the immensity of her hips. The uber-pear Catwoman had recently announced she was expecting and certainly had the birthing hips for it, currently measuring in at a staggering 50 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was relatively smaller, the gut of a 180 lb out of shape woman rather than the pushing in on three hundred pounder she was. Completely lazy and totally inactive, Selina was essentially eating the richest foods on earth round the clock, worry about her husband and adopted children causing not only stress eating but a nasty case of sleep eating that was compelling her multiple pounds a day weight gain. No one would have believed that mere months earlier she'd been forty pounds thinner than average, a delectably nimble anti-heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Months is a little drastic Selina,\" Bruce spoke up for her, \"she knows her limits enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are days,\" Cass shrugged her impressively shredded shoulders, her sports bra showing off her diamond cut muscles and numerous scars, \"I want to patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman glared, her piggish green eyes demanding Batman do something. Mentally sighing, Bruce tried coming up with an argument that would keep his adopted daughter under a roof for the weekend and then settled on someone instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie, new mission for you,\" he told the Blonde currently scanning police scanners on the Batcomputer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie Brown had spun around in the computer chair, hopping up with an enthusiasm a sixty pound weight gain hadn't dimmed. She didn't need her hands to stand up, but when her thick legs pressed the lower slope of her overfed belly popped out over her yoga pants and remained in view after she stood up, a size to small T-shirt not able to cover all of her torso. While her thighs and backside were bigger, the blonde's gain was concentrated on her upper half: a cuddly pot belly with a matched pair of E cups, while her angular face had become cute and round. To Cass' relief, the Vigilante had been removed from active duty after failing the obstacle course three days in a row. While her sparring had been getting better due to her caloric excess fueling muscle growth, Brown's wind was increasingly pathetic. The blonde stopping exercising now that she was on computer and support duty wasn't going to turn that around any time soon, without any exercise her gain would do not but speed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure Cass doesn't go back into the field this weekend,\" Batman said, \"sit on her if you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kindly blonde had smiled, turning to her girlfriend and saying \"How about a movie night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought the Batgirl to the next evening, strangely in her room instead of swinging from roof tops and punching crooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on night three of no sleep, having been to nervous to even nap during the day. Cass had a lot of energy, having only been able to workout for eight hours in the cave's holo room and robot sparring chambers during Selina's mid-day napping/eating session until the furious and full to the point of bursting catwoman had waddled into the room and dragged her out by the ear, the jello wobbling of her ass cheeks driving out all three hundred kung fu moves Cass knew to break the simple hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do this,\" the bandaged Batgirl said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunfire and knives didn't scare her, why should a movie night with her best friend/girlfriend? Everything was ready, a pictograph grocery list had been delivered to Alfred who'd stocked Cass' room with all of Stephanie's favorite snacks. A cheesy B grade horror movie was in her VCR, guaranteed to make the bubble gutted blonde press tight to her and to fear eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass was terrified. Surely something would go wrong. This was so scary, how did regular people date?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at her door made the ultra-dangerous woman jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, come in!\" she stammered.</span></div></div>",

The pants were a little short, chubby ankles showing over the rim of her soft ugg boots, and sausage skin tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass could see the blonde's pale thigh skin through the near transparent fabric, the only partly atrophied muscle in her quads making her legs extra bulky. When she stepped in, her inner thighs went swish swish. Her friend's gain had been significant enough a camel toe was easily visible through panties and leggings both, making Batgirl sit down onto her bed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass, are you okay?\" Spoiler squeaked, running towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl read the concern pouring off of her guest...but that was almost foiled because there was a lot of bouncing to distract her. Steph's fat girl habits meant the leggings and soft sweater didn't meet and the purple wool rose higher with every step, Brown's soft spare tire spilling into view as it rode up the curve of her waist, revealing more and more of her belly. The bouncing continued upwards, Steph's new fat girl boobs wobbling like mad and making Batgirl break into a cold, nervous sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a terrible idea, Cass thought, barely able to sit up and incredibly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph put a soft arm around Cass' back to support her, meaning that her substantial boobs were pressed right into the ex-assassin's face. Soft wool backed with buttery boob fat hugged Cain's head, a marshmallowy nirvana that the fit vigilante had no desire to ever leave. Batgirl's minimal vocal abilities totally abandoned her, thoughts barely able to pass through her head. When Steph did try to pull away, all she could do was pull her in tighter. All she wanted was to lay here and cuddle and snuggle and hug and maybe, if she got the courage worked up for it, kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass...,\"Steph gasped at the surprising strength of the skinny girl, her vertebrae popping, \"Cass...uhf...Cass let go of me...I can't breathe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she okay?\" a second voice asked from the door way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat managed to penetrate the dream state going through the vigilante's head. It wasn't Selina's voice, she knew her step mom's routine down pat and the mega pear socialite would just be settling down for an evening nap to sleep off her post afternoon nap binge. Giving a frown that could make a mystically trained master assassin shit themselves, Cass pulled her head away from its heavenly pillow and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Batgirl was pretty angry that someone else was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous she might have been as she was at any social interaction, but the shy vigilante had been looking forwards to an evening feeding, cuddling, snuggling, fondling and kissing the ever chubbier form of her beloved Steph. That sweater was pure magic and the ex-assassin wanted her callused hands under it to gently rub the buttery soft bulge that had been a hard four pack a few months ago. Spoiler was at a perfect point, big enough to be the class fat girl a few months ago but due to her now over workout regimen now one of the skinnier girls at Gotham U and Cass really wanted to get to feel her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat someone was getting in the way of that made her furious and her frightening scowl earned a sharp yelp from the fat shape in the doorway before immediately softening. Cass recognized the fat, passed out blonde from the back of the car that afternoon, when she'd been breaking the rules of her forced rest and spying on Steph during Selina's early afternoon nap. That had been another fight and a force feeding session towards yet another blonde, followed by the disturbing news that her joy bringing fat fetish might not be native. Cass was still grappling with the consequences of that but all the fat on display put that thought to the very back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't ask ahead of time, but I found her lost and stuck near the campus and couldn't leave a fellow super in the lurch,\" Steph explained, soft body still pressed close to Cass, \"I figured I would have to invite her, so Cass, meet Kara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie was absolutely gorgeous and just fat enough to be too big for crime fighting. But for the moment there was still some muscle holding up her chunk, Kara on the other hand was 100% flub. Supergirl was a wobbling victim of the obesity epidemic, looking like she'd spent a lifetime obese. Being able to eat at super speed had increased the tiny blonde by 150%, making her wobble into Cass' room at 250lbs of pure butter pouring out of college cheer leading uniform. Her boobs were plunging, toneless DDs that really needed a bra and were currently near visible through the stretched fabric of her sweater. A big, flabby pot belly sagged over her skirt, two lesser bulges floppy love handles. Her hips were stunning and her thighs were <i>magnificent</i>, living with Selina had given her an appreciation of pears but for every pound Supergirl had gained on her upper body two had popped onto her lower figure. The skirt was so stretched to show the bottom of her panties, bags of hip fat pouring out the sides. She had a lovely waddle, thighs turning red from friction and Cass could read her embarrassment at every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, we met when our moms went out to eat,\" Kara said sheepishly, \"I've gained a little weight since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this universe, one hundred pounds did count as a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass swallowed, marshaled her dwindling ability to speak and tried to not pull both bubbly blondes into her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you today,\" she said softly, crossing her yoga panted legs and hoping she wasn't soaking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I didn't see anyone who was...oh my god, I should have figured that out, you're Batgirl!\" Kara said, a moment of fear sweeping through her at remembering how scary the black armored vigilante had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of her outfit and in just a pair of Yoga pants and a t-shirt, the other girl didn't look scary. Uncomfortably ripped and skinny and those scars were a little sad but she mostly looked cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Cass, who cared little for her identity admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm Supergirl and you didn't happen to see my friend Cassie did you?\" the fat blonde alien asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Briefly, she left,\" Cassandra fibbed, Sandsmark having drifted off like a balloon back towards her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, that B-word,\" supergirl almost swore, \"you don't mind if I stay here do you tonight do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra smiled, glad that problem was out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later and the three girls were curled up in bed, the schlock horror movie playing and the two blonde's gorging. Cass had the supple Stephanie pressed in tight on her right side, her marvelously soft sweater and its even softer contents pressing tight to Cassandra's jacked form while the Spoiler munched on her fourth strawberry poptart of the evening. Cass watched her girlfriend's soft second chin jiggle with every small bite and how with every swallow her heavy boobs bounced just a little inside her snug bra. On her left, the pear shaped Kara had a half empty three gallon bucket of pop corn in between her thick legs, that an entire stick of butter had gone to greasing down her throat. Her legs were crossed, one meaty hamhock covering Cass' hard thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moved really fast today,\" Supergirl complimented her, \"I'd have trouble keeping up even if my powers were on today. How'd you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice,\" Cass shrugged, \"you look...strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, thanks. Usually I am I guess,\" Kara beamed at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice she says, its because she's not in college and didn't put on the freshman fifteen like us normies,\" Stephanie chuckled through chocolate, patting the gut her sixty five pound weight gain had packed onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can't believe how skinny you are,\" Kara munched, \"aren't you cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm...,\" Cass stretched out, \"content. You two are nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside snow was falling but inside Cass was gloriously warm. The information from that afternoon that this was somehow fake barely even niggled, because damn did it feel good to be literally surrounded by these gloriously soft, binging fatties. She smiled and slightly adjusted herself, her hard body making the fat pressing onto her jiggle and bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen, a rail thin bottle blonde with silicon DDs got axed in a ludicrously unbelievable fashion, making Cass' two bed mates press in close to her in automatic fear, despite being or having been a super powered space alien and a badass vigilante. The fit assassin smiled ear to ear, sliding a hand up Steph's back rolls and nimbly unsnapping her bra. Cass had already had light fingers and before her concerns had turned just to food, sex and coddling her Selina had given her a few pick pocketing lessons. Stephanie never even noticed her bra was missing and her ripe E cups plunged against her sweater, jiggling as she put yet another pop tart into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass smiled, reached out a hand and ticked a particular spot on Stephanie's flank, making the blonde a little thirsty. Stephanie reached out and grabbed a two liter of Soda, chugging down the Soder Cola like it was a cup of water. A rumbling stomach swelled out more under Steph's sweater. Crossing her legs, Cass reached out her left hand and undid Kara's bra as she swallowed. The temporarily de-powered Kryptonian only had a C cup but they dropped pretty far, jiggling when she let out a loud belch at having finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get cocoa,\" Cass said, sliding out between the warm cave of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room had a small kitchenette and she hummed happily to herself as her plan went on, quickly making three mugs. One held zero calorie chai tea, the other two a 1200 calorie drink of cocoa, cream, whipped cream, marshmallows sprinkles and shot of peppermint schnapps filched from the liquor cabinet. The two blondes took the steaming drinks and sucked them down with gluttonous squeals, Cass sipping her own tea and then putting it on a window sill when they finished. Both Steph and Kara's round cheeks were red with warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its warm now,\" she smiled, sliding off her shirt and revealing firm A cups in a sports bra and abs hard enough to shred cheese on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll do the same if you don't mind,\" Steph said, warm from the Manor's furnace, the shared body heat, the blanket and her overweight body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara nodded, \"yeah I'm warm too, I'm not used to having to need to worry about temps, hopefully my powers are up tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweaters were slid off, revealing gloriously soft bellies resting in their laps and two pairs of fat girl boobs. Steph's were larger and firmer, her still in existence pecs lending a degree of pertness to her center fold rack. Kara's were smaller but their sagginess was enticing. Both gave small squeaks of shock that faded when Cass dropped her own bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" the dark haired Batgirl smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass woke up to sunlight coming in through the window. Fat pushed onto her at every angle, from the sweat shiny E cups wrapped around her face to the basketball sized ass cheeks pressing into her hard stomach. She smiled and yawned, sitting up to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Diverges:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fatgirl Begins:</b> her own stomach packed full with anonymous food, Cass isn't immune anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Nemesis:</b> the door opens to reveal a pale, obese, depowered Power Girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Spending most days spread out across the couch and enjoying nature documentaries and gardening shows, even her plants were starting to reflect her foul mood, growing more thorns and barbs and turning red and more vicious looking. Perhaps this was to make up for how Ivy was looking less threatening this ways, since she was growing a lot more then just irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she might have been able to claim before that she was just incredibly curvy or pleasingly zaftig, there was no denying nowadays that Ivy was more pig girl than plant girl. Graduating from taking up one seat to two on the sofa she occupied nowadays, Ivy had bloomed with excess adipose, with a grand cauldron of a belly that hung over her sunken in knees, tree-trunk thighs, and flabby bingo winged arms that did little more then deliver food to her eager little mouth when she wasn't feeling especially lazy and having her sentient vines feed her instead. This fed into her frustrations considerably; she may have found her double chin rather striking and enjoyed the impressive size of her rack that was beginning to resemble her own melon plants in size, but those were all the signs that she was losing her touch, and while her infinite checkbook was the silver lining of this arrangement, she had to admit that it was the biggest reason why the scale with a three hundred pound limit cracked under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also the biggest reason why it was so hard to find a corporate lackey that would go along with the scheme. Her donations to environmentalist causes have been doing wonders to further her goals, but a lot of those groups were viciously anti-corporate by nature, meaning many corporations were a bit unwilling to work with the super-sized super-villain that funded them. Even the Penguin, while he was willing to launder their money and find some investment opportunities, chafed at the idea of getting the businessmen he rubbed elbows with to meet and discuss Ivy's ultimate plan. Still, if there was any positive to come out of the time wasted on the endeavor, the compound she wanted to put in the food supply, the compound she not-so-subtly tested on Harley, worked like a charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red!\" came a shout from the kitchen. \"We're outta burritos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then have something else!\" Ivy shouted back. \"You just had food delivered yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhining under her breath, Harley emerged out of the kitchen to display the full effects of Ivy's little experiment. Dressed in only a light t-shirt and panties, her thigh meat was on full display, creamy and jiggling with every ponderous step yet still resolutely supporting the rest of her body, including the belly that broke into two rolls as it hung down and the head-sized cleavage straining the limits of her top. Once the smaller of the two, the jester's lazy lifestyle and Ivy's formula had torpedoed her metabolism; now she was matching Ivy in terms of girth and didn't look like she was going to stop any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said we were out of burritos,\" Ivy said, eying the giant Mexican delicacy, twice as big as any normal burrito would have been, in Harley's hand. Undeterred, Harley opened her mouth and fed the giant burrito into her eager maw, swallowing the meal and letting out a powerful belch that wobbled the ring of fat that made up her second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're outta burritos now,\" Harley said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, it's parta my charm!\" Harley said defensively as she went to sit next to Ivy, the two of them filling up a sofa that could comfortably fit a whole family and still creaked dangerously as the jester lowered her bulk into it. \"Besides, not like I have anything better to do, no one wants to work with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why...\" Ivy said sarcastically, running her fingers across her own belly sprawled out in front of her and letting out a soft belch. This couldn't last, Ivy realized. She had to come up with a new way to get her formula into the food supply before she and the jester were too big to fit in the house anymore. But what?</span></div></div>",

She decided to indulge in some early victory celebration by eating some ice cream. As soon as she got home, she marched right over to the kitchen, pulled out a pint of cookie dough ice cream, a spoon, and took a seat at the kitchen table. She eagerly dug into the ice cream, stuffing a big bite of the ice cream down her threat. Mm, so good she thought to herself happily. Having always had an addiction to chocolate, Ivy continued to stuff bite after bite of the delicious creamy ice cream down her throat until she had finished it all. Mm, that was so delicious she thought to herself as she contently patted her belly. It was just then that she heard her cell phone ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling like getting up, Ivy was grateful that she had left her pink cellphone on the table. She picked it up and smiled as she saw Harley's name flash on her caller id. \"Hey Harl, did the guards bring over all the money?\" she asked. \"Um...no. None of them have come by yet. That is why I am calling ya. Did they get confused and come to the apartment instead?\" Harley asked. \"No! How strange. I wonder what happened. Maybe it was a mistake to use men, they are such simple creatures\" Ivy commented. \"Yeaha, well everyone but Mistha J of course, he is a complicated fella\" Harley said. \"Yes, everyone but the Joker\" Ivy said, placating her friend for the moment even though she didn't feel the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley then heard a door open and one of the guards walked in. \"Hold on Ivy, I think the guards are starting to arrive\" Harley said before covering the mouthpiece with her hand. \"Where were you? What took you so long?\" Harley demanded of the guard Paul and then noticed he was moneyless. \"And where is all the bags and bags of money? \" Harley asked the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ran into your friend Catwomen. She is really nice. She said she was working with you guys and that there had been a change of plans. We were supposed to give the money to her so we loaded it up into her car and she drove off. Aren't you pleased?\" Paul asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul never got his answer as Harley then grabbed her hammer and knocked the guard out. Harley then picked up the phone. \"Uh red, we got a problem. Catwomen intercepted the guards, told them that she was working with us, and got them to give her the money. What are we going to do?\" Harley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy immediately grew quite angry. Catwoman was really getting to be a pain, getting in the way of her crimes. Something needed to be done. Ivy decided that....</span></div></div>",

It wasn't like she could go to the cops, for God's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long, drawn out silence. \"Harl, you still there?\" she finally managed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's up?\" she responds with just as much discomfort in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill the guards, get out of there...\" Ivy sighed again, \"I need time to think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha...\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Time to Think\" soon became long and drawn out, almost eight weeks had gone by since the criminal duo's last outing, which was regarded amongst the criminal underworld as a ridiculous flop; especially considering Ivy's caliber amongst the scum of Gotham City. They hadn't done <i>anything</i> in those past weeks. If one good thing came out of this little hiatus, it was that suspicion had certianly dropped around them renting an apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's bloated form continued to swell and swell in a mixture of self-pity, boredom, and a generally healthy appetite. And Harley seemed to resume her life as normal, not so much as put off by the rarely-mentioned flop. Sure, she sat at her computer nearly 24/7, but at least she wasn't moping around like her redheaded roomie. Harley could swear Ivy vegged out on the couch (lol) more than she did<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy's massive behind crushed the cushions that were unfortunate enough to meet it's swollen cheeks, the couch frame itself wasn't bothered however. Her stomach swelled outward as she sat, billowing out to swell over the plush seating ever so slightly. Her cheeks, fixed in an almost permenant state of 'flushed' were round and drooped slightly over her long enveloped neck. Her eyes were forced into a slight squint and her nose crowded by her chubby cheeks. Supporting her stomach were two purely massive thighs, past succulent and much more than 'meaty', Ivy's thunderthighs had enveloped her entire lower end, her ass was fat and so was everything else about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once respectable villainess placed rather large forkful of chocolate cake in her mouth, a few crumbs tumbling down into her generous green bosom. She grunted somewhat, letting the flavor sink into her taste buds and then immediately sucking it down her esophagus. Again, she grunted; this time in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley!\" she barked, simply yelling for her cohort wasted precious breath, \"HARLEY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarleen Quinzelle, the 'thin' member of this team, had a lot of time to do whatever she wanted. She could leave the apartment whenever she wanted, and she certainly had free reign over the internet so long as she payed the bill, but living with \"Premadonna Ivy\" had taken a bit of chipper out of her around the house. She got irritated a lot easier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Harley's shrill cry pierced Ivy's eardrums, the blonde woman storming into the living room like Hurricane Norman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out of cake.\" Ivy pouted, doing her best to cross her cushion-sized arms. Ivy had resorted to pouting to get what she wanted lately, even to get Harley tending to her plants. The green skinned goddess spent nearly all her time wallowing in her failure. \"Go get some more.\" she rested her hands on her gut, letting her turkey neck rest on her fat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Way!\" Harley whined back, that wasn't so odd, \"I'm busy playin' RuneScape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on her hips, standing indignantly at the incredibly lazy chloropath. If one were to just look at Harley, they would see a very pretty young gymnist in blonde pigtails. But when someone who knew her (other than the self-absorbed Poison Ivy) looked at her, they could clearly see lack of definition. She was losing her muscles, which was made almost painfully obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a little old for that?\" Pamela quipped, turning up the volume, \"It's not like I'm asking you for a leg or anything, just some cake!\" Harley grumbled, storming back into her room. Ivy barely noticed, she was currently wondering how she could get that simply <i>elegant</i> forest patterned dress from QVC without theft or having to get off the couch.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\nHarley muffled her exasperated screams in a pillow, she was so tired of Ivy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used ta think tat livin' with Red would be a breeze!\" she sat back down on her bed, focus shifting back on the bright LCD screen of her laptop, \"Feh, she sure proved tat wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over the mail, something from the supor. Probably about the bills again, she and Ivy hadn't paid them in a while, if things kept up like this they were going to get evicted. Not that they could <i>force</i> Harley anywhere, she could whoop their blue-clad asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grumbled again, \"We need money...\"</span></div></div>",

She would go out to do the grocery store as someone had to keep plenty of food around for Ivy and other basic needs. She would even do both her and Ivy's laundry. She also used these ventures out to get new computer games to play. Not that she was getting bored of her old games but she liked to have a variety to play. After going to the laundromat and putting their clothes in, Harley headed across the street to the mall to go to the video game store. As she passed the jewelry store on the way to the jewelry store, she noticed Selina Kyle aka Catwomen trying on some jewels. Instantly she felt some anger surge through her, Selina had the money that should have been hers. She quickly calmed down as there was nothing that she could do about that now and her getting into a fight with her at the mall which had it's own security certainly wasn't going to help the situation. It wasn't that she didn't think she could handle the security, she could, it would be just a hassle that wasn't worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley was about to continue on our way to the video game store when Selina walked out of the jewelry store after making her purchase. Now that Selina had money, she had no problem with getting her jewelry legally. Harley didn't hold this against Selina though as she and Ivy had done the same thing.  Selina smiled as she spotted Harley. \"I am sure I am the last person you want to see but it was just too easy to steal your money from the guards that I couldn't help myself\" Selina replied. \"Ya I know, I learned tha hard way\" Harley grumbled. As she took a closer look at Selina she noticed that she had been living it large. Selina's hair was looking fabulous, long and straight, like she had just been to the salon, had on gucci sunglasses, a prada bag, and some expensive clothes. It also didn't escape Harley's notice that Selina had put on about 10 pounds. She had a small belly with a little thicker thighs now I guess Ivy is not the only one gaining weight Harley thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't take it too hard Harley. I am sure you and Ivy will be able to pull off another successful heist soon as long as you don't use men in your schemes or otherwise I will foil it agian\" Selina replied with a laugh. She hwas half teasing and half serious. She definitely would foil Harley and Ivy's plan again if it was as easy as last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that\" Harley said before even realizing that she was saying it. \"Why not?\" Selina asked curiously. She had noticed the sincerety in Harley's voice and wondered what had happened that had gotten Harley so down that she didn't think that she would pull off another heist. This was alarming to Selina as she always enjoyed the rivarly with Harley and Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley decided to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Telling Catwoman about Ivy's weight problem and their general disfunction would certainly be a bad idea, Harley decided. It'd be like giving Superman the key to his kryptonite shackles, or Batsy a target that says 'BATARANG GOES HERE' on her rump. There was no way she was going to allow that to happen, how else could she and IVy pay for the internet bill (among other things)?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah i's nothin', I'm just eh... havin' a bad day is all!\" Harley quickly fabricated a lie, hoping it would be satisfactory. Selina looked her fellow criminal up and down suspiciously, \"You sure?\" she asked finally, leaving Harley sweating nervously, \"Can't have my cash flow dropping any time soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley twinged, that last comment stung a little. \"I mean, had it not been for you and Pam, I would have <i>never</i> been able to afford all <i>this</i>!\" she gestured quite haughtilly to her ensemble; a slinky town dress with a prada bag, pearls, and many other extravegant items. \"I owe you guys a lot.\" she purred, self-satisfied as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's gettin' a swelled head on 'er.\" Harley jested, half serious. Ms. Kyle continued, \"And I've been cordually invited to the Social Society of Gotham, courtesy of Mr. <i>Bruce</i> <i>Wayne</i>.\" she had drawn out her date's name for effect, the most elligible bachelor in Gotham had asked her, over all the other socialites in Gotham (or the world, considering his vast wealth) She was going to go anyway, she and Bruce had a very 'on-again off-again' status, but Harley didn't need to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's face grew heavy with exasperation and jealousy. \"M-Mistah Wayne?!\" she couldn't help but stutter, it was Bruce effin' Wayne for God's sake! \"He asked <b>you</b>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked away teasingly, \"My, I think I may have said too much!\" she purposly feigned panic in the most caddy way possible, \"I should go!\" Harley was left agape for a few seconds, there was just nothing left to say (which was quite a shock, considering it was Harley) She heard Selina's heels click loudly as the socialite made her way into another nearby store, \"I'll be sure to see you around, Harleen!\" she waved back, laying it on really thick. Something that made Harley even angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, by the looks'a tat tummy, Mistah Wanye'll be seein' alotta you too...\" she murmered, storming into 'Joystix', counting what very little spending money she could spare...<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\nIvy hadn't done much since Harley left this morning. She was dressed in slacker shique, huge sweatpants and an equally large black tee that had a few crumbs scattered aimlessly across it. Her red hair was combed half-heartedly, though she still put on her special lipstick in the off chance of a home invasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was completely covered by her garments today, a rarity around this apartment, but still spread out far; it rested heavilly on her monstrous thighs and spilled slightly through the small gap between her legs. One pleasingly plump hand held the remote and rested on the couch's arm, and the other rest on her midsection. Currently, she was flipping through the channels aimlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown to enjoy the luxury of satellite TV, a big improvement over cable. The only downside was that out of hundreds of channels, only a few shows were watchable. Even less things if you only counted the ones in English. Ivy grumbled, there was nothing on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green woman hefted her bulk from the couch, something that was getting harder and harder to do lately (though she couldn't exactly tell why...) and waddled to the Island Countertop that seperated the Living room from the Kitchen. As she wobbled about the room, her gut jiggled wildly about on her thighs, and her heavy footsteps sent her behind quaking. \"mmm... hungry...\" she said in a rather husky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand travelled from her side to the fridge's stainless steel handle, opening it lethargically as she pondered what she could eat. \"The cake's gone...\" she put a chubby digit to her cherubic cheek, \"There's no more of that pasta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Ivy spent her time with her rear up in the air as she searched the fridge. Until she found it; Harley always had something sweet stored away and this week's turned out to be a large pan of brownies. She always made the best brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second of hesitation, Ivy's stomach growled and that look came across her face again, the \"I want <i>that</i>.\" look that had once struck fear into many do-gooders around Gotham. She shamelessly struggled over her own bulk to get to that tray, placing it on the counter, and cut a whole fourth of it for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the kitchen's barstool, her overall bulk inadvertantly spilling over onto another nearby stool and began her work. Pamela always complimented Harley's tastes in baked goods, even if she was the one eating all of them. She finished the morsel off quickly, tummy still grumbling for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she heaved and hoe'd her weight onto the floor, icy linoleum chilling her bare plump feet as she travelled back to her prize. \"Mmmph...\" she mumbled, chocolate dough stuffed into her mouth , \"So <i>good</i>!\" she lauded over the pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only Harley could sell these!\" she mulled over the thought, examining a chunk of brownie before inhaling it, \"We'd be rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something inside Ivy's brain clicked. She had a long-overdue idea.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------<br>\r\nHarley burst into the apartment, back to her usual chipper self at the thought of getting to play her new video games. \"Hey Ivy!\" she said, looking for her obese roomie. Suprisingly enough, her usual space on the couch was empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to her left, she saw Ivy; fiery red locks held back by a bandana, bloated belly framed by an apron that suited her better a few pounds ago that squeezed her fat ever chance it got, and batter splattered on her green cheek. \"Red?\" Harley asked, she hadn't seen Ivy doing much of anything these past few weeks, this surely came as a shock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Harl.\" Ivy said, unusally merry herself considering her massive attitude lately, \"Something I wanted to talk to you about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley sat the bags down on the couch, Bud and Lou came to greet her eagerly. \"Yeah?\" she asked, looking up from her babies, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to make your brownies, a lot of them.\" she said curtly, her entire body jiggling as Ivy emerged from behind the oven, \"We're gonna get rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley raised a wire-thin eyebrow, \"Call me crazy Red,\" (\"Not really, tat's not funny.\") \"But I don't think a bake sale's gonna make up for all the money we lost.\" she crossed her arms, wondering slightly if Ivy could do the same anymore. \"Of course not, but with <b>this</b> we just might.\" she sprinkled a purple pollen into the batter from a bottle marked with the ever-familiar Skull and Crossbones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An'...\" she had to ask what Ivy was doing to her Ma's recipe, \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's plump face smirked as she stirred the spores into the batter, \"That's a very potent dopamine stimulant...\" she trailed off slightly as she dropped in another powder, marked poisonous. \"And an -huff- body fat stimulant, I figured that -wheeze- mixed in with a brownie, they couldn't fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words were familiar to Harley, she did have a degree in psychology after all, but for some reason she couldn't place the exact effect. \"So... they're gonna get fat and that'll make us rich?\" Harley was totally lost, lost in excitement over getting her new video game and the fact that the two might have some cash flow soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ivy hissed, stirring vigorously. It visibly tired this large woman out. \"The stimulant will release dopamine every time they take a bite, and the body fat stimulant will lower their metabolism, and heighten their appetite!\" Harley was still lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... it's like crack?\" she asked, trying to humor the gigantic green vixen; she sighed in return. \"Yes, Harl...\" she huffed, \"It's like a drug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' we're gonna...\" the dethroned Clown Queen of Crime tried her best to put two and two together. Ivy interjected, already knowing the next question. \"No, Harl, we don't need to open up a bakery, I'll just <i>'motivate'</i> the caterers of all the important events in Gotham!\" she continued to explain further, removing her kitchen outfitting and shoving them into Harley's chest, \"And I've been baking all night, so get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley narrowed her eyes, she enjoyed baking; when it was for fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy sensed she was being to harsh, so she tried to lighten the mood by playfully spreading a dollop of batter onto Harley's cheek. She was quiet for a while, but burst out into manic laughter. \"Right-aroonie Red, I'll get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, sorry for being such a bitch, Harl.\" Ivy smiled, waddling down to her room. The blonde girl seemed strangely drawn to Ivy's monstrous hiney jiggling with every step. \"Hope she remembers that these a'e for those Rich Guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley wiped the batter off her cheek with a slender finger, \"Mm!\" she squealed, \"Chocolate!\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>\r\nSelina Kyle peeled the dress from her frame, a note lay neatly on her plush pillow; untouched by any of her many mischevious cats, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Selina-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to be out of the country for a while, I'm sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bruce</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed, \"<b>Dammit</b> Wayne...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Harley and Ivy dressed in their disguises and paid a visit to the caterers of the upcoming social. Luckily all the cooks were men and so Ivy was able to use her pheromines on them. She and Harley quickly signed a contract that said the caterers would use their brownies at the events they catered and they would get a cut of the profits. The long-awaited Social would be the first of these events. A couple of days later, the Social arrived and the girls brought over the brownies to the caterer's business. They had spent the past day baking all of the brownies. Harley was the one actually doing the baking, Ivy was more subervising and eating the extra brownies. Aftter arriving at the caterer's business, Harley got out and helped the caterers load the brownies into their van while Ivy sat in their car eating more extra brownies as she was too lazy to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping finish loading the van, Harley got back into the car. \"All done Red. I sure hope this plan of yours work\" Harley said as she started the car and started driving them back home. \"It will work. Don't you trust your own family's recipe and my dopamine stimulant?\" Ivy asked in a casual and confident tone. \"Oh I do\" Harley quickly replied. \"Then relax\" Ivy said. She then added, \"Let's stop at McDonalds on the way home. I feel like having fast food for dinner\" Ivy said. She loved fast food and was in the mood to celebrate. \"Alright red\" Harley agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................................ ................................................................................ .............................................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the social, the caterers were pleased to see that all of the guests seemed to really enjoy the brownies. They quickly became popular among the guests through word of mouth. Almost everyone had one and some even had a couple. Even though she no longer had Bruce for a date, Selina was still invited to the social and she was still sure going to go bed. She decided to arrive late to make her entrance and an entrance she had. All eyes were on her as she descened the stairs to the party. She looked beautiful with her long raven hair down, her makeup done prettily, and a beautiful silky black dress that hugged and flaunted her figure. She carried a small purse with her. She was pleased to catch the eyes of some of Gotham's wealthy single men. Though she had said nothing to Harley about her belly, she was a little self concious about it and so she sucked it in as she made her entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina immediately made her way over to the bar where she ordered a strawberry daquiri. She recieved her drink, thanked the bartender, and glanced around the party to see who was around. One of gotham's wealthy bachelors made his way over to her with a couple of brownies. He offered her a brownie saying it was really good before beginning to talk and flirt with him. She accepted the brownie and took a bite. She had to admit the guy was right, it was delicious. She quickly ate the brownie while talking and flirting back with the guy for a bit.  The guy was a bit old for her so she moved on after talking with him for a bit. She walked around the room, mingling with different people while nursing her daquri. As she talked with some more wealthy bacheeleors a mix of some closer to her age and more of the old type, she found herself glancing over at the brownie trays from time to time. She was really craving some more but wasn't so sure she should due to her recent weight gain. In no way did she want to loose control of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Selina gave into her cravings for the brownies and ate a couple more that night along with another couple glasses of drinks as she continued to talk and flirt with the wealthy elite men of Gotham. She was still hoping to get with Bruce in the end but she realized a back-up men were needed because it was well know that Bruce was a pretty dedicated bachelor. She hoped that she could change that eventually.</span></div></div>",

Ivy snorted, \"Do you wanna be caught by the big bad Bat?\" she quipped, picking up another straddled brownie. Harley had to agree, Batsy had gotten slack lately around Gotham; why push their luck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer black painted lips smiled, driving out of Wayne Manor's impressive parkway. Ivy snorted haughtilly again, \"Thought so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the criminal's confections were soon spread lightly throughout the social standings of Gotham. They were served at a handfull of Socials, a few plays, and even a girlscout meeting or two. Ivy and Harley had accumulated a certain wealth, enough to live peacefully in their new lifestyle anyway, and things remained peaceful at their household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things were beginning to change in Gotham, namely the wealthiest of the wealthy...<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\nWeek Four, Party Eighteen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick Grayson escorted the lovely Barbara Gordon (better known as Nightwing and Oracle, respectively) to this next outing. While the two posed as a couple, they were really running recon for the strange occurrences that had been surrounding the richer population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara wheeled her way around the floor, hoping that her wheelchair wasn't leaving skidmarks that would ruin the elegant tile. She was dressed in a salmon-colored evening dress, and her 'date' adorned a designer tuxedo with blue lining, his long hair tied back into a pony tail. \"I still don't see why this is so important, Barb.\" Grayson mumbled, it wasn't that he disliked being with Barbara, it just seemed that they seemed to do a lot more dancing at these things than actual research. \"Oh come on, Dick.\" Barbara pleaded her childhood companion, \"Is it so bad to be seen with me around your arm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick couldn't help but lose his tongue, she always had that effect on him. \"Fine, just keep your eyes open, and not on my chest.\" he quipped back finally. She raised an eyebrow, \"Fine, but no promises.\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far side of the room, one of their main reasons for recon had spent almost the entire evening picking things from the complementary buffet; Selina Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe much pudgier Selina Kyle examined the confection dreamilly, her plump lips open slightly as her lovely eyes scanned it. She knew something this delectible had to have strings attached, and her weight was certainly becoming a very thick string, but she didn't really care. This treats were too good to watch her waistline. Selina popped the pastry into her mouth, eagerly picking out another victim. Her eyes travelled towards the donation sign <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still anonymous?\" she asked herself, \"Too bad, I might have considered donating to <i>their</i> cause...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate her next prize, Selina's double chin exaggerated itself as she chewed. Her thick booty wobbled as she moved to the other end of the table, and the eyes of once-jealous (but equally large) sociallites turned away, the only thing she had on them now was all that money. \"Judging by her size, it all goes to food...\" an obviously fake english accent caught her ears...<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\nPosion Ivy laughed somewhat maniacly, sending her entire body into a massive sensation of jiggling. She had finally hit the big time, and all she had to do was put some pollen in some food, how ironic after all her hard work! Harley couldn't help but laugh too, only because she was easilly impressionable and was just happy that Ivy had calmed down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone else had slowly ballooned over the past few weeks, Ivy hadn't gained <i>too</i> terribly much over the past few weeks. Instead of having to special order new sweats to lounge around in, she just stretched the ones she had to the limit. And instead of blowing all of her money on food, she actually saved up enough to buy Harley a new makeup set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, they were lounging around like always. The two villains had decided that instead of spending this time apart, today they should sit down and enjoy eachother... as <i>friends</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... So that's how I got the name 'The BackSeat'!\" she puffed, long lost her breath from laughing so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha!!\" Harley giggled, \"Tat's hilarious Red!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed for a little bit longer, when Harley noticed that Ivy was falling asleep...</span></div></div>",

Harley was really surprising how much Red was becoming an appropriate name for Ivy as now it was longer just her hair that was really red. Her whole body was starting to get red due to her weight gain particularily her face and cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Harl\" Ivy replied as she laid her head back against one of the couch pillows. \"So besides Harley Quinn, what other nick names do you have?\" she asked her friend. She then closed her eyes and slowly fell asleep as she listened to her friend happily babble on some different nicknames she had throughout her years in school from middle schoolup through college. After Harley finished her through story on her nickames, she noticed that Ivy was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley then got up, grabbed a blanket hanging off one of the chairs. She then gently laid it out on top of Ivy and then spread it to the right of her. Feeling really tired all of a sudden she decided to crash on the couch as well. She figured Ivy wouldn't mind, especially now with her being so sweet again. Harley then slide herself under the covers and found herself cuddling close to Ivy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley laid her head down on Ivy's stomach, finding it so soft and squishy. Wow she is so soft. She has really packed on some pounds. The softness is so nice though. Maybe it's not so bad that she has gained some weight. It's really nice cuddling with her when she is so soft. Maybe she should gain some more weight and get even softer Harley thought to herself. She quickly fell deeply asleep on Ivy's soft belly, dreaming of fattening up her friend even further.</span></div></div>",

She hugged it in her sleep, squeezing it further to comfort her face. Every now and then the blubber nearly suffocated her, causing her to unwillingly wake up with a jolt. However, she always managed to meander back to slumberville... Until dawn, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's comically stereotypical snores blended in with Ivy's log-sawing almost harmoniously. The smaller of the two currently laying face-first in her friend's flab. Without warning, though, Ivy's gelatinous form shifted in her sleep, forcing Harley's head from her stomach and knocking her to the floor with a <i>thud</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the blonde girl a few minutes to fully realize that she had been knocked aside by Ivy's bum, and even longer to realize that she was fully awake now. Harley rubbed her head, \"Oww...\" she whimpered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately she concluded that she had no more brain damage than usual and brushed herself off, rising to her feet. Harley turned to face Ivy, or rather IVy's rear. Harley cooed, \"Awww... she looks like'a li'l sleepin' angel...\" here she pat her friend on the side lovingly, \"Snores like jackhamma though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings came back to Harley from the night before slowly as she started on her breakfast; the laughing, the money, the television... how unbelievabley soft Ivy's tummy was... Harley couldn't help but giggle, that was probably the best non-medicated sleep she'd ever had! And it was all thanks to...<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Red...\" she soothed, trying to wake her corpulent cohort. Ivy continued snoring loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Re~ed...\" Harley tried again sweetly, rubbing her friend's massive muffintop lovingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy continued to go on with her sleep, uninterrupted in the slightest by her friend's calls of breakfast<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley stood up straight, a forefinger to her chin curiously. \"What was tat Mistah J usetah do ta wake me up?\" she asked herself aloud, after a couple of seconds she got her answer; Grabbing Ivy's green nose so she couldn't breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough, Ivy woke up startled and out of breath. \"Harley?!\" she asked, exasperated at her friend's antics, \"What time is it?\" she asked groggily. As soon as she could breath through her nose, however, Ivy's nostrils caught waft of something grand. Something like waffles, whipped cream, toast, strawberries, all the breakfast delicacies that Ivy adored; all laid plainly on the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" she asked, half curious and half starved<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley bounced over to the feast that she painstakingly laid out for her gluttonous friend, presenting it like she had seen so many Wheel-of-Fortune prize girls present before. \"Ta-dah!\" she chimed (off-key) \"I thought ya'd be hungry, so I made my bestest buddie brekkie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was stunned, she never expected anything like this. \"How long did it take you to make this, Harley?!\" she asked, heaving herself from the couch, \"It looks... edible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Harley wore clean clothes, she wouldn't admit that in her room lay two pairs of batter-stained clothes from some of her failures over the last few hours at this banquet. She was in a simple pair of playing-card pajama pants and a black tee, nothing special. Nothing... <i>too</i> odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh tis is nothin'!\" she nonchalantly waved away her question, \"Thought I'd do somethin' nice for ya, I know how hard ya work at makin' us money.\" she flattered her friend, who drooled as she waddled towards her prize. \"Th-thank you Harl!\" Ivy said, not exactly sure how to take a token of kindness anymore. She hesitated, but locked her thin companion in a big bear hug, her massive top half suffocating Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's nothin'!\" Harley stuttered, \"Now dig in, b'fore it gets cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy didn't need to be told twice, she grabbed a piece of butter-soaked toast and shoved it into her mouth before she even plopped down in her seat. Immediately following, she grabbed her knife and fork (laid out courtesy of Harley) and began mutilating her waffles, greedilly wolfing down her sustenance. Next to her sat a glass of apple juice, the jug placed just barely within her reach (to not draw suspicion). Her cheeks grew flushed with excitement, she never knew Harley could cook this well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump vegetation woman travelled a little to the west of her waffles, seeing a whole bowl of strawberries. Two porky fingers pinched one and placed it between her plump lips, taking a bite of the fruit, and placed the rest on top of the butter smeared across her waffle. Harley, who had remained silently watching from the counter, reached over and placed a serving-spoon sized glob of whipped-cream on top of said strawberry. \"Righta-roonie!\" she smiled, \"Enjoy Red, I'm gonna take a shower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use reaching Ivy, she was lost in her glut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley skipped off, taking enough time to look back at her friend's badonkadonk booty. \"I hope you get big and squishy~!\" she said <i>very</i> quietly, continuing her romp down the apartment's hallway soon after getting an eyefull of her friend's many rolls.</span></div></div>",

She took a nice long warm shower, dryed herself off, wrapped the towel around her, and changed back into the clothes she had on since she knew it would be a stay home day. She then combed her hair and put on a little make-up. She then headed out of the bathroom and back to the kitchen to check on Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was so hungry and the food was so good that once she started eating, she could not stop. She was locked into her gluttony until she had finished every last bite of the pancakes, whipped cream, toast, and strawberries with a glass of apple juice to wash it all down with. After finishing her meal, Ivy was feeling quite full and a little sleepy. She slowly pushed herself away from the table and got up. She then waddled back over to the couch and sat back down. No sooner had she sat back down did she spread out across the pillow, laying her head on the pillow, and fell fast asleep again. Her breakfast had made her sleepy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harley came back out, she was pleased to see Ivy asleep on the couch again, her soft belly looking bloated and bigger than before with the empy dishes on the table.

Harley got back to work. She first fed her animals and then watered Ivy's plants. She then started to prepare lunch for her growing friend. It took her a couple of tries but she was able to make her friend a couple of large cheese burgers with lots of fries and a large chocolate milkshake. She then carried the food over to the table. No sooner had she set it down did Ivy slowly wake up. It took only a second for Ivy to register the smells of the delicous food and see them laid out for her. Once again, Harley presented the food wheel of fortune style again with another off-key \"Ta-dah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was feeling hungry and so she got up from the couch as quickly as she could and waddled back over to the table. \"Thanks Harl. I could really get use to this\" Ivy said sweetly with a smile to her friend. She made her way over to the table, plopped down onto her seat, and greedily dug into her first burger. \"Mm, so good\" Ivy moaned before taking another bite and another. Well you are definitely going to get used to it Ivy. I am going to make you huge Harley thought to herself as she watched pleased as Ivy pigged out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy chowed through the first cheeseburger. She then worked on eating some of the fires for awhile and washing them down with sips of her chocolate milkshake. She then started work on her second cheeseburger. She didn't eat it as first as she did the first one but it didn't take her too long to eat it either. She then ate the rest of her fries and washed it down with the rest of her milkshake. \"Ooh, I am so stuffed. That luch was so good Harl\" Ivy moaned softly as she laid back in her seat, gently rubbing her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad ya liked it Red. You look tired though, how about you take a nap while I clean up?\" Harley suggusted as she gathered Ivy's empty plates. \"Good idea\" Ivy agreed. She slowly pushed herself away from the table and waddled back to the couch. She once again sat down on the couch before spreading out across it, laying her head down on the pillow, and quickly falling asleep on a very full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley watched this all with a very approving smile.

The solid flooring of Wayne Towers kept it from creeping, something Harley was quite grateful for. Every tiny break in Ivy's rhythmic snoring, Harley nearly jumped out of her flannal pants, taking it as a sign that the behemoth had awokenfrom it's deep slumber. Thankfully, Harley managed to refrain from having a heart attack before she made it to Ivy's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was a blob, a literal couch potato. Harley's eye examined her every detail, mentally bloating the picture to gigantic proportions. The jester-clad girl giggled, surely there were many more things wrong with her than a simple... <i>fascination</i> with the metahuman body, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she reached out and touched Ivy's pale green stomach, marvelling at just how taut it was. She didn't like that near as much as when the apidose was loose and jiggly; but she would have to work with it. She couldn't help herself, Harley stretched her arm out again to rub her viridian spare tire. It was warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight blush found itself on Harley's cheeks as she continued to scrutenize Ivy's every belly roll and cellulite deposit, eager to make her friend swell with food. Completely by instinct, Harley jiggled the massive cushion that was Ivy's tummy, her hands jerking back like she had just dropped a priceless jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy snored and shifted her massive body to the left, snuggling up against the cushions of the couch. Harley was very thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it as a sign, she decided against going further into Ivy's fat; \"I'll get'ta that later...\" she whispered to herself, \"Gotta reply to that Malone guy....\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\nIvy awoke to the smell of baking and cuisine; that was three times today, not that her shameless gluttony minded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ovaltine coffeetable that acted as the living room centerpiece sat another decadent meal. Lasagnia, garlic bread, a side of linguini and stroganauff, a basket of rolls and breadsticks, and sausage all somehow crammed onto that table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's mouth watered, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Harl?!\" she bellowed from her seat, a little curious as to why fine fods had been showing up in front of her all day; it was like someone ripped a page from her metaphorical diary. \"Oh, yer awake!\" Harley chirped from the oven, Ivy jumped a little from the realization that Harley had been there the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all this, Harl?\" she asked, refraining the best she could from drooling, \"How could you possibly have made all of this in just a few hours?\" Ivy pushed aside the thick blanket, almost losing her breath from that simple act of exertion. She tried her hardest to get into a seated position, finding that her still-bloated stomach wouldn't allow her much more than to lean against the armrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, don't get up!\" Harley pranced from the kitchen to scoot the table closer to her friend, \"I di'nt make tis, the chefs downstairs were complainin' about some rich guy who was complainin' about the delivery boy, so tey took it back!\" she rengaged cooking soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you ended up with it?\" Ivy asked questionably<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all tat complainin' kept 'em busy while I snuck it outta the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy would have said more, but then her nose caught hint of another smell; very overpowered by the italian buffet placed in front of her. \"What's that smell?\" she asked, picking up a breadstick. She could hear the clammor of a plate placed on a hard countertop and a knife scraping against something metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And brownies for dessert!\" Harley cheered, placing the final piece to Ivy's fattening puzzle, \"The regular ones, I'm makin' another couple'a dozen batches for the sociallites in Mrs. Katrowskie's room downstai's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy looked back up at Harley, \"You sure do seem to like baking lately, Harl.\" she raised one of her fiery eyebrows, picking up a brownie. \"What can I say?\" Harley replied nonchalantly, \"I'mma girl'a many talents!\" As Ivy took a bite of Harley's confection, her face instantly lightened up. \"I'll say you are Harl, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again, for the third time today, Ivy proceeded to make a complete hog of herself out of Harley's lard-laden layout of food. The massive woman then spent her fourth night in a row on the couch in her sweats, and Harley the second night huggling Ivy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Bud and Lou spent their night alone.</span></div></div>",

She gets used to the three big delicious meals a day from Harley everyday and then that quickly turned to her expecting them everyday. She began to grow lazier and get quite greedy. The three big meals a day grew her appetite pretty quickly and it wasn't long before Ivy was demanding snacks of sweets in between meals. She didn't do a thing around the house and spent her time either on the couch or in bed reading gossip magazines or fictional novels, listing to music on her ipod, or watching tv or dvds while eating. There were only three things she asserted energy into. The first was eating, the second was getting up to use the bathroom, and take a shower once a day, and putting her poullen into the brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley was quite pleased with how lazy and greedy Ivy was getting. It was only making her all the more easier to fatten. She also didn't mind having to do almost everything as it allowed Ivy to get fatter and more out of shape. Their pastries were doing so well with the catering company ordering more every day that money was flowing in all the time. This allowed for Harley to have plenty of money to spend on food for Ivy. Harley was doing a mix of making food for Ivy and getting food out that she brought back to Ivy. The food she get out usually was either fast food, pizza, or chinese take out. All kinds of sweets and pastries that Harley gave Ivy were a mix of either homemade ones by Harley or ones that she got at the supermarket or donut shop. She also kept the house stocked with milk and soda for Ivy to drink along with her food. Those were the two drinks Harley had discovered Ivy craved the most with the foods that she was eating. Harley loved watching Ivy's appetite grow followed by her body growing more. Harley continued to play with Ivy's belly after she passed out from her pigouts on a regular basis. She always did it just for a bit as she didn't want Ivy to catch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was really enjoying her lazy days of doing nothing but relaxing and pigging out. She couldn't get enough of it and loved that she could see herself doing this for the considerable future. Harley was happy to take of everything as long as she supplied the poullen which was very easy. She felt like she had finally achieved a life that she wanted. The best part of it was she didn't have to deal with Batman the self rigteous stiff anymore as they weren't doing anything that was really illegal so he couldn't do anything to them.</span></div></div>",

They could afford almost anything their hearts could desire, short of a clean record in Gotham and a home plastic surgery kit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor four blissful months, Harley Quinn watched from behind the oven as Ivy swelled and swelled into the blob that sat before her today, unable to think of much more than eating whenever food was placed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, like any other day, Ivy was zoned out in front of the television as Harley fiddled with an ever-fattening snack for her friend, humming merrily as she did so. She examined Ivy's backfat, resting heavilly on the backboard of the apartment's couch, she tensed a little at the thought of it becoming even thicker and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor probably the third time this morning, Harley's baby blue eyes traversed Ivy's massive body with a lusty gaze. She was positively enormous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's stomach dropped halfway down the couch, covering her long-forgotten crotch with it's thick apron of flab. It had so many rolls, and cellulite packed itself at the farther regions of it's acre. Crudely smacked on top was her naval, the lone sinkhole on the trail that was Ivy's belly. She couldn't even wrap her hands around it anymore, it was simply massive! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, swollen cheeks took up a good majority of her face, only further crowded by the three chins she had blossomed. Below that, neck long forgotten, and breasts a bundle. They were gigantic, definately beyond 'hooters' or 'melons' in any sense of the terms. The drooped to either side of her gut, gravity finally proving victorious over the mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Ivy was supported by an equally large, if not somewhat larger base. Her legs were weak and flabby, her behind corpulant and jiggly. Whenever she got up, Harley always made sure to sneak a peak at her rarely seen heavy green orbs of butt blubber. All of Ivy had become exactly like her ass in every sense; Weak, flabby, and heavy. Ivy had become nearly spherical<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty Red!\" Harley picked up the heavy platter, \"Cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green woman grunted something incoherent in her newer, much huskier and demanding tone. As Harley pranced over to her, Ivy eagerly began stuffing herself. She was a complete beast, unable to control that massive appetite of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley beamed, folding her hands childishly, making a very good impersonation of a sexy Lex Luthor \"I'm so glad ya like it!\"; Ivy's full lips simply mumbled something, further muffled through pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she retreated to the kitchen to fetch the beast a beverage. She picked it out of the fridge, 2% milk like she asked for. Back at the couch, Harley put the jug down in Ivy's reach. It didn't take long for Ivy's trained maw to demolish the batch of cookies, and she immediately uttered a simple sentence,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp.... Is there -morp- any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's smile widened, a smile so wide was only reserved for whenever the Joker was in the mood. \"A<br>\r\ncourse!\" With haste, she came back with a bag of barbecue chips; they were hers, but whatever. Harley was just glad to [i}help{/i} Ivy's poor appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... -urp- You're fattening me up, right?\" she asked sarcastically, \"This is... -huff- You're spoiling me... and I can't- wheeze... seem to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley shushed her, \"What? You're as good-lookin' as eva!\" Harley cooed, tapping Ivy's round cheek, \"Maybe a little bigga', but hey, nothin' wrong wit a healthy appetite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy wheezed, swallowing a nearby Tums, \"Yeah... you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, nothing much else was said beyond the television's incessant blaring and the grumble and moans of Ivy's gluttony. \"Mph... So.... So good.\" Ivy had to struggle to catch her breath a lot more lately, with her added bulk and whatnot it was very understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plump hand tapped the bottom of the bag over her awaiting maw, armfat jiggling with her small movements. Every last crumb was sure to fall into Ivy's mouth, lest she miss one and Bud or Lou tear up the house looking for it. She was satisfied, belched, and fell back to relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anythin' else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy belched again, \"-orp- Well.... No, I'm... I'm good.\" she yawned, falling into another one of her mid-day/post-snack naps. Harley took her chance, the young blonde cuddled up to her personal plant-whispering food dispener. She sighed lovingly, resting her head on Ivy's prominant gut and falling fast asleep with her.</span></div></div>",

She smiled to herself as she heard Ivy greedily stuff bite after bite of the brownie down her throat. That's my girl she thought to herself proudly. She rode the elevator down to the lobby and walked over to her mailbox, She pulled out her key, opened it, pulled out the mail, closed it, and locked it again. She then rode the elevator back up to her room. She glanced through the letters and one in particular caught her eye, it was from the Gotham Elite Society. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she walked back into her apartment, Harley quickly tore open the envelope, and pulled out the letter. It read as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Ms. Isley and Ms. Quinn,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         On behalf of the Gotham Elite Society, we would like to invite you both to our social next saturday the 28th. We are very impressed with the growth of your business in the 4 months since you started it. We wish you both continued success with your business. In honor of the success of the business, we would like to welcome you in as members of our society. Please rsvp and let us know if you can make it as soon as possible. Thank you.<br>\r\n                                                                                               Sincerely,<br>\r\n                                                                                          Gotham Elite Society<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley could barely contain her excitement and was jumping up and down. She had always wanted to go to one of these socials. She had no doubt that Ivy would want to go as she loved socials. She had grown up with them, attending them from the time she was a little girl on until her accident and change to a life of crime. Ivy had just finished eating all of the brownies. She licked the chocolate off her fingers and lips as she noticed Harley jumping up and down. \"What (huff) has got you (huff) so excited?\" Ivy asked. Ivy was always a little winded and had a little trouble after stuffing herself with food. She then washed the brownies down with the rest of her milk as she waited for Harley's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are finally on top Red. We get invited to the Gotham Elite Society's social for next Saturday the 28th, isn't that great? We are the elite! I finally get to go to a social and you finally get to go to one again\" Harely said excitedly, hardly able to contain her glee.</span></div></div>",

Her hands shifted to her stomach, now picturing the decadent buffet that was sure to be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley smiled too, she had never actually been to a social event among the higher-ups of Gotham (well, never invited, anyway; nor had she stayed long enough to enjoy the entree's) Her painted lips grew wider and wider with glee, this could open up so many doors for her and Ivy. They could finally have a normal life, a better life... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Harl.\" Ivy snapped her blubbery fingers in front of Harley's button nose, snapping her out of the near minute long trance she had wandered into, \"You... you alright?\" she asked, genuine concern detectable within her thick voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I'm fine.\" Harley smiled, \"You lookin' forward to it, Red?\" she asked, entire body tense at the mear thought of a normal life with her best friend. \"Of course I am.\" she responded, flipping off the television, \"Time for Gotham to see that we're... we're just as -orp- good...mph... oh... forget it, you know.\" she struggled to sit normally nowadays, a part played in no thanks short to Harley's cuisine and Ivy's slothliness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy grabbed the remote, having already given up her ambitions of getting up for tonight, and turned on the television once again. \"Let's not... mphah...  Go start on dinner please... something slimming.\" She grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'course Red,\" Harley obeyed with a wicked glimmer in her eye as she glanced Ivy's pale green flesh pouring over the couch, \"Anythin' you say.\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" Harley barked, \"It's gotta be <b>bigger</b>, tat's nevah gonna fit Ivy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small tailor nodded vigorously, unravelling more and more fabric. \"W-Will this suffice?\" he whimpered, fearful of this young jersey girl's temper. She seemed somewhat dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn held out her arms the best she could, mentally picturing just how big Ivy's belly had gotten, \"Yeah, sure, if she goes on a diet!\" she growls, \"GET MORE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had researched the finest tailors in Gotham in search of their party attire, she had already had to hog-tie an old woman today, enough of a setback in her 'normal' plans. She certainly didn't want to have to off this old guy. He was a really little guy too, little enough to make Harley feel guilty about squishing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hands, Arnold held out a very leniant fabric. It was floral print, of course, leaves outlined and flowers filled with a certain faded amber quality. It was suppossed to be stretchy, that way Harley could gawk at how it clung to Ivy's tummy, but allow the latter to gorge herself without the mental stress of ripping her dress. The lighter she thought she was the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think tat'll work.\" Harley reluctantly concluded that he had gotten just enough to cover the expansive belly in question. Arnold sighed, until he heard the next words out of his customer's mouth, \"And now for the layas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-P-Perhaps we should... focus on your dress for now, Ms. Quinzelle?\" he mumbled nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley grumbled, \"When we get the third laya done, and you betta make tis dress backless.\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"What are you crazy?\" Harley cheered from outside the bathroom, \"Ya look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy grimaced, her chins creasing with displeasure, \"Are you kidding?\" she huffed, \"It's... It's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley did her best to remain calm, \"Hey, it's the style.\" she reasoned, \"All the girls're wearin' dresses big, whattaya gonna do?\" Ivy emerged from the bathroom slowly, her expansive wideness nearly trapping her in the doorway. She was right, the dress was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had the afformentioned pattern, but it was quite distorted over Ivy's generous curvage. The leaves looked more like Elephant Ear Leaves than the simple autumn variety they had were intended to be. Over her ass, there was no pattern, only the lattermost shade of green exactly half-way verticly down the dress with amber piping under the arms and over her huge thighs. It had a slit down the train of the dress, exposing her chubby legs and sagging knees, as well as a generous amount of her cellulite. And, just to Harley's specifications, the dress' backless quality allowed not only her cleavage to spill out, but also allow her superflous backfat to flow freely along the creases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes my ass look gigantic.\" Ivy pouted, a little self concious over her self-justified <i>little weight problem</i>, in truth she very much wanted to go, just to be the best looking girl there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Tat's because it is gigantic...'</i> Harley muttered under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Ivy snapped back, having caught a slight breeze of her comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh nothin' Red!\" Harley stuttered, \"I said that you look gorgeous... and that your ass was small yet perky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's perma-blush couldn't go much deeper, but she was very touched. \"Oh... thank you, Harl.\" she smiled, \"You -urp- you look great, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, however, even with makeup on, could still blush. \"O-Oh really?\" she turned away slightly, \"I was a little upset tat I, uh... wen'up a few sizes...\" Ivy laughed, driving her belly wild with a jiggling sensation, \"Nothing wrong with a -huff- healthy appetite, right?\" Ivy quoted Harley's own words, used to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley smiled, \"Yeah, I guess yer right...\" she started towards the door, \"Come on, let's party!\" she cheered</span></div></div>",

Ivy was disapointed that there was no food in the limo but enjoyed a couple of strawberry daquris instead which she found she quite liked. Harley allowed herself to have a couple strawberry daquiris herself as she was nervous about going to her first social and needed a little liquid encouragement. They arrived at the social a short time later. The girls were let out of the car by the driver and proceeded into the hotel. They got onto an elevator which they rode to the top floor where the social was being held. Harley was so glad for elevators as she knew there was no longer any way that Ivy could get up stairs anymore. Ivy also was for the first time in her life very grateful for the elevator as well as she just didn't seem to have the energy for stairs anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator dinged as the door slide open. Harley and Ivy linked arms as they slowly walked off the elevator and into the party. All eyes were on them with looks of welcome and smiles. The girls had linked arms as a form of solidarity as they both were a little nervous and just because they were friends. They both instantly felt at ease as they realized they were welcome. Everyone there knew who they were, the new members, and they were given a round of applause. The girls acknowledged the recognition with smiles and royalty like waves. \"They like us, they really like us\" Harley whispered excitedly into Ivy's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls then separted and began to go around the room. They introduced themselves to a mix of wealthy couples and wealthy single men. They even flirted with the wealthy single men no matter if they were good looking or not or at least Ivy did. Harley had been a little worried that Ivy's weight would cause her a problem with men but she quickly saw that she had no reason to worry. Despite her weight gain, Ivy was still gorgeous, and the most beautiful woman in the room. Also, the other women in the room had all gained considerable amounts of weight so it wasn't like Ivy could be singled out and ridiculed. It was a little dishearing to Harley that even fat Fat Ivy was more attractive then her but she had to agree. She also had to admit it that it excited her that Ivy still looked hot fat and it encouraged her to continue fatting Ivy up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the single wealthy men that Ivy ended up was \"reformed criminal and business man\" the Penguin. Even though Penguin was not the most handsomet guy even for a villian and had a gut himself, he was still attracted to the skinny super-model girls. Though with his money he was able to get with a few of these girls, he wasn't able to get with alot of him. He had always thought that Poison Ivy was super hot like most men but he found her even more attractive with the extra weight. He figured with her being heavier than him, it was less likely that she would leave him. He also thought it might be a good idea to make her gain just to be doubly sure. \"Hello my dear, may I buy you a drink?\" Oswald Cobblepot aka the Penguin asked Ivy after making his way over to her. \"Sure, that would be lovely\" Ivy said as she blew some of her poullen on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother so called \"reformed criminal and business man\" Edward Ngyma aka the Ridder was also at the social. He had been surprised by how many of the socialites had gained weight but found the extra weight to suit them well. He had always that that Harley Quinn had been attractive but now with the couple of pounds she had gained, she was even more attractive if that was even possible. She had always been so infatuated with the Joker that he thought he would never have a chance with her. She was here alone and he hard heard that she was living with Ivy now. Maybe she was over the Joker. Edward made his way over to Harley. \"Hi Harley, how are you?\" he asked. \"Hi Edward. I am doing really good thanks. How are you?\" Harley replied. While she was not completely sure that Edward was completely reformed, she did feel quite sure that he was talking to her because he wanted to. It was the first time in her life she got the feeling that a guy liked her and it made her feel good. She wasn't sure exactly what kind of like this was but it was a start at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oswald had some trouble navigating Ivy's bulk through the room, especially keeping her from the buffet table long enough to work the old Cobblepot Magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, both of their plump rearends were seated, ordering immediately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy sipped her drink, the strong scent of strawberries, barnuts, and bitter alcohol wafting into her trained nostrils. She loved the taste of anything fruity, especially when it was doused in liquor. \"So, Pengy, I see you're -huff-... legit now?\" Ivy teased her current suitor with a wiggle of her porky fingers around the martini glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOswald's wire-thin lips formed a crooked smile, \"I've been legitamite for quite some time now, Ms. Isely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Pam.\" Ivy's hummed, her surly tone was as enticing as ever. \"<i>Pam</i>,\" Cobblepot raised a curious eyebrow behind his monicle, \"Would you care for something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends... Ozzy,\" Ivy sloshed her drink lightly, \"What'cha got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOswald gingerly grabbed her portly hand in his own, struggling to get past his sizable nose. \"Anything you want, my dear.\" he layed on the sugar thick, hoping that his bottomless \"charm\" would woo the massive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the sound of that, Pengy.\" Ivy smiled, finishing off her drink and placing it delicately down on the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clack</i>, Penguin's dress shoes clicked as his portly shape fell from the barstool to the floor, his hat still barely peaking over Ivy after standing on his feet. He held out his hand, gesturing her to grab it, \"Then shall we retire to the dining table?\" Ivy's stomach gurgled slightly, her nostrils flexed, and her mouth beginning to salivate; she was getting excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm... We shall.\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------<br>\r\nHarley stood with Nygma by the stairway, star-crossed from her green-skinned partner and her corpulant courier. While Ivy was getting somewhat excited, Harley's 'date' had a lot less potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly, things were akward between the two. Sure, she and Edward had traded casual glances on Joker's semi-regular, almost bi-weekly poker night; but things hadn't evolved much due to the Clown Prince of Crime's interaction with his \"Poo\". She did see him sneak a few glances at her rump a few times, but she only assumed that it was a mistake on her part. The last guy she squealed on for checking her out ended up in the river with trace amounts of Joker Toxin in his blood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Edward could barely think, he couldn't take his eyes off of Harley's shapely rump, \"Riddle me this, Where's the J-Man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley turned away, uncomfortable with answering such a question. \"Last I heard he was dead.\" she quipped, knowing full well that the same thing had been said many a time before about Gotham's Prodigal Clown. Truthfully, she hadn't thought much of her Puddin' in a long time, their last falling out was quite a doozy. <br>\r\nBut the past was the past... even if she <b>had</b> said that before. She hadn't thought about it, maybe there was a future out there for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiddler let out what could only be a cross between a girlish giggle and a nervous chuckle. \"Y-Yeah, that sounds a lot like Joker.\" Even when speaking, Nygma's eyes were locked onto Harley's hips, her thighs, and that lovely ass of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley grumbled, she knew the dress was tight, but Eddy's pants were a lot tighter than before they started this little conversation. \"Hey, Nygma.\" Harley cleared her throat, \"Eyes're up here.\" Gotham's riddling, question mark obsessed lunatic jumped up nervously, \"S-S-Sorry.\" he stuttered, Harley rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe not.</span></div></div>",

She finds him to be very smart, understand and suport her views, and be a fun, interesting, and entertaining coversationalist. She would smile and flirt with him at appropriate points during the coversation. Over the course of their coversation, Ivy ends up having two more strawberry daquiris and lots of the food at the social, mostly the brownies that she and Harley had made for the social. Oswald was surprised by how much he was turned on by watching Ivy eat and watching it add some more pounds to her lucious body. \"Here, allow me\" Oswald insisted at one point and began to feed Ivy the brownie. Both Oswald and Ivy thorughly enjoyed having him feed her and they did it a couple more times throughout the night. After a couple of hours, Oswald felt it was time to take the next step. \"Would you care to come home with me tonight? I can assure you there will be more delicious food for you to enjoy\" he said in a proper tone with a smile. \"Oh yes, Pengy, I would love to\" Ivy replied in her sweet and sexy tone. It was a mix of the promise of her getting more food and her actually liking the Penguin that made her agree. She quickly sent Harley a text on her iphone as fast as her chubby fingers would allow before heading out with the Penguin. They headed out to the elevators, rode it down to the lobby, and walked out to his limo which was waiting out front for them. They got in and headed back to the Penguin's mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy couldn't help but gasp as she saw the Penguin's mansion as their limo pulled up in front of it. In no way had she ever imagined it would be this beautiful. \"Oh my god! Your place is lovely\" Ivy said. \"I'm glad you like it my dear but I am sure you will find the inside even more to your liking\" Penguin said before the limo door was open by the driver. His dress shoes clicked again as he lifted his portly frame out of the limo. It took Ivy some energy and effort to get her bulk out of the car. She had to take a minute to catch her breathe afterwards. The Penguin was suprised by how much he liked Ivy being so out of shape in addition to her being so fat. Oswald then wrapped his arms around Ivy's soft and flabby waist the best he could before leading her inside his mansion. He gave her a very quick tour of the house due to her bad shape and his anxiousness to have some fun with her. The last stop of the tour was the bedroom. \"Wow, very nice bedroom\" Ivy purred flirtiously as seductively sauntered over to the bed. Penguin licked his lips as he watched her waddle to the bed, seeing all of her fat jiggle, especially her big butt. He also enjoyed hearing the bed groan under Ivy's weight as she laid down on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am so hungry\" Ivy purred flirtiously. \"I will call for food immediately\" the Penguin said before quickly racing off as fast as his portly frame could carry him. He returned a couple of minutes later. \"Some food will be brought shortly my dear\" He announced. \"Great\" Ivy replied in a sweet and sexy tone. She watched as the Penguin hung up his jacket and then headed into the bathroom. She couldn't help but giggle seeing his gut. The Penguin then returned in a loungue robe before walking over to the bed and laying down next to her. Ivy then moved to cuddle up close to him,enjoying the feeling of the soft warmth she recieved from their soft bodies being against each other. She moved her head to rest on his shoulder, closes her eyes, and sighed happily. She was really having a good time tonight. A smile spread across her face as she felt Oswald began to knead her belly fat. \"I hope you don't mind\" Oswald whispered into her ear. His long poiny nose touching her hair sent a shiver down her spine. \"Not at all\" she purred seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Harley appreciated that Edward was so attractive to her, it was also a bit of a turn off and a little freaky seeing him stutter around her nervously while getting a turn on at the same time as he stared at her. Edward got really nervous after that and didn't know what else to say. He seemed to stand around her nervously, trying to will with his mind a coversation to start with them again which was also a little freaky. He also continued to stare at her with a hopeful smile. Harley had finished her current drink while this occured. Needing a new drink and tired of Edward's stares, she made her way over to the bar, and got another strawberry daquiri. She drank it as she walked around the room, trying to talk with more people, particularily single wealthy Gotham bachelors. Unfortunately they all seemed to be matched up with a socialite by now and she felt Edward continuing to lear at her. So after she finished her drink, Harley headed back to the limo and rode it home. She had recieved a text from Ivy telling her that she was going home with the Penguin for the night. She was happy for her friend but she also wished that she had been able to go home with a guy as well or if not, at least then have Ivy come home with her so she could feed her more. She would have been equally happy with either of those, she just didn't want this going home alone. After changing into a pink t-shirt and a pair of greysweatpants, Harley fed her hyenas, watered Ivy's plants, then grabbed herself a small snack of a couple of brownies and a glass of milk. She set herself down in front of the tv, and turned it on. She watched some late night tv shows while enjoying her snack.</span></div></div>",

Not to say that the room was quiet, it was far from quiet. Oswald's boudouir was quite boistrous throughout the night, a few of his business associates and even the hired help could hear many groans, moans, and belches. Most of them belonging to his new 'acquaintance', Ms. Pamela Isely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so loud, in fact, that no one within earshot got a wink of sleep. Penguin did, but only because he passed out with his shirt unbuttoned, he awoke to Ivy's blimping busom, and the two got right back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, it is five in the morning; Cobblepot's servants sit in his dining quarters, quite agitated at their employer's randy behavior. It was shocking, really. Most of his servants had a strong dislike of oneanother, the fact that something so trivial as sleep had bonded them together was a true testament to the couple's raunchiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm, like, so tired...\" a usually buxom, dark-skinned woman leaned on the table. Dark Bags of sleep deprivation were present under her's, as well as everyone else's eyes. \"We know, Miranda,\" a redheaded, somewhat aged woman snipped, \"We all are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, don't you yell at me!\" Miranda barked back, too tired to even raise her head from her supple arms. A rather elderly man stood near the door, still quite diligent in his butlering duties despite his own lack of sleep. \"Miss Miranda, please refrain from raising your voice, Mr. Cobblepot <i>does</i> have company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, everyone recognized the now familiar rocking sounds that could be heard from three floors down. Miranda wretched, Harriet gagged, and the butler in the corner remained somehow unaffected. And then the now customary cry of euphoria...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"OH <i>OZZY</i>!!\"</b> Ms. Isely's voice echoed throughout the estate, her thick pipes now sent shivers up the female members of the working shift. Oddly enough, they couldn't tell if it was a testament to the Penguin or the chef... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger of the two maids shivered, \"How could, like, he <i>find</i> anyone willing to go up to his bedroom, I mean even if she was that big?\" she finally lifted her head, her usually bright brown eyes remained dim with exhaustion, \"I mean, he's not the best looking guy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet blushed, \"Oh he has his ways, he does have his ways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's head fell down to the table again, letting out a weak \"Eww...\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------<br>\r\nHarley remained in her seat on the couch, more precisely it was Ivy's seat. She could tell by the large indent that refused to re-flate back to the original plush of the davenport. In her lap sat a well-worn batter bowl, some brown would be confection and a spoon still remain from the night before, as well as a smidgeon under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe television was blaring, some channel that Ivy had programmed it to record, and had been left there all night. Her sweatpants cut into a swollen tummy, the tiniest bit of weight swelling over the white elastic. Whatever the case, the usually hyperactive Harleen Quinzelle had been reduced to 'heavilly sedated Harleen Quinzelle' in a single night, something not even the highly acclaimed doctors of Arkham had managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slumbering psychopath looked distraught, even in her sleep. Her brow was furrowed slightly, eyebrows plucked carefully in preperation for the night before pressed together due to bad dreams. She had obviously taken measures in going to bed, or was very bored before falling asleep; her nailpolish had been removed as was her makeup, her hair pulled back up into her informal pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even the lumbering of her rotund roomie woke her up, Poison Ivy making her entrance as quietly as a woman of her stature would allow. Even as she squeezed into the doorframe, and knocked the coffeepot to the floor with a stray lovehandle, Harley remained knocked clean out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy giggled, still giddy from the night before. Her giant stomach was even more distended with her consumption, never in her wildest ambitions did she ever think about eating so much food. All of it high class too; Filet Mignion, Cavier, Prime Rib Cuts, rich Starfruits, more teacakes than she could keep track of... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy was she stuffed. Barely able to waddle from the elevator to her apartment. Massive green stomach billowing out and falling further down her knees, taut like a drum. She let out a triumphant belch (still futile in waking Harley)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that didn't stop her from reaching over and plucking the batter from Harley's grip, letting her lax grip fall over dead to her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a low growl, hungrilly glaring at the batter; she had definately learned to appreciate food in bed.</span></div></div>",

She managed to squeeze through the doorway into her room, made her way over to her bed, and slowly laid down on it. She didn't notice how her bed groaned under weight as she laid down on it. As soon as she had situated herself back against her pillow, she greedily dug into the batter, eating it with her fingers, pigging out. \"Mm, so good\" she moaned softly. She really had learned to love and appreciate eating in bed. She ended up eating the rest of the batter before quickly passing out due to her long night of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................................ ................................................................................ .........................................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley woke up some time later. It took her a couple of seconds to get her bearings. Remembering that she had passed out while snacking and watching tv, she saw that her bowl of batter was gone and tv shut off. Ivy must have come home from her late Harley realized. She also figured that Ivy must have stolen the batter from her. She was glad for this for two reasons. One because she had already eaten a little too much and two because she rather Ivy eat it and have her grow fatter. Figuring that Ivy would be waking up soon, Harley decided to make breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up from the couch, stretched, then headed into the bathroom to freshen up a bit. She went pee and then washed her face. She then headed back into the kitchen to make something for lunch. She wasn't worried about making too loud of noises since Ivy was a deep sleeper. She proceeded to make alot of mac and cheese, toasted some bread, and got out some sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was woken by the smell of macaroni and cheese at just about the time it was ready. Despite eating so much, after her sleep, she was feeling very hungry again. With some great effort, she got up,  squeezed herself out of her room, and waddled towards the kitchen. She didn't give a second thought to freshinng herself up, she just wanted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley couldnd't help but smile seeing Ivy even bigger than the night before with her green belly very round and prominent come into the living room. \"Hey Red, just in time. I was about to call you to lunch. I made mac and cheese\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Harl. I am starving\" Ivy said as she waddled over to the table and took a seat in one of the chairs. The chair groaned under her weight and seemed a little untable. Ivy didn't notice this but Harley did, much to her delight.  \"So how was your night girl?\" Harley asked her friend curiously as she brought over the bowls of macaroni and cheese. She had a big one for Ivy and a smaller one for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Ivy said as Harley brought over the food. She took a couple sips of her soda before eagerly digging into her marcaroni and cheese. \"Mm, so good\" she moaned softly. \"Last night was amazing. I never realized just how charming Oswald Cobblepot can be. He really knows how to treat a woman and spoil her with good friends. He is actually pretty good looking. After we left the party, we went back to his place, he gave me a quick tour, then spent the rest of the night in bed. It's not what you think though, I just ate the rest of the night, a mix of him feeding me, and me feeding myself as he rubbed my belly. It was soo nice\" Ivy moaned soflty as she conitnued to enjoy her macaroni and cheese. She continued to stuff bite after bite down her throat, only stopping occasonally for sips of her soda. \"How was your night?\" Ivy asked Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley was happy that Ivy had a great time last night and even happier that she ate so much. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if Ivy started to see Oswald if he was going to feed her. She had no doubt that if they both continued to feed Ivy lots she would get very fat very quickly which was an exciting thought to her. \"I had a fun time at the party. Unfortunately I didn't click with any guys. I talked with Edward Nygema but he is just a little weird and a little too obsessed with me you know?\" Harley said as she ate her plate of macaroni and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I'm sorry Harl\" Ivy said with an apologetic smile in between bites of her macaroni and cheese. Before long Ivy had finished her whole plate. She then used the bread to lick up the cheese and ate it before washing it down with the rest of her soda. \"Mm, that was delicious\" she moaned softly, laying back in her chair, rubbing her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley finished off her own plate of macaroni and cheese while starting at Ivy's fat belly lovingly. Ivy was so lost in her stuffed extcasy that she failed to notice Harley's stares. She is going to get so fat, Oswald and I are going to make sure of it she thought to herself as she drank more of her soda. She planned to call Oswald later and work out a plan with him so that they would both be fattening Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy belches loudly, just like she usually does after a large meal prepared by her jestered sister in arms, \"Ohh...\" she moaned, pudgy fingers massaging the pale green dome that was her overstuffed, literally blown taut belly, \"That was good.\" Harley smiled at this, she always appreciated Ivy's ever-growing sense of taste. Even though it was a low-class meal that she had learned in her poverty, Harley knew that Ivy was far too greedy to turn down any food whether it be prime-rib or steakums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive green woman pat her stomach a little dumbly, \"Alright, I think I'll... I'll situate myself on the couch...\" Ivy huffs as she futily attempts to heave herself from the poor overloaded seat, \"Time for.... Botany Hour...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harley could stop herself, she found that her lips had seperated without her consent; they let out a \"Wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded lax, like she hadn't quite figured out what she was going to stall Ivy with yet, which she hadn't. Regardless, the stuffed ex-con turned her chubby cheeks to her roomate. \"Hm?\" her thick voice hummed, \"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley grinned sheepishly, remembering the pan of brownies that she had baked for Ivy earlier yesterday morning, \"I've got some brownies tat ya haven't eaten yet...\" she choked out the words like a frightened child, \"Ya wanna split 'em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's round face broke out a small, elegant smile. She saw that Harley just wanted to spend some time with her, something that she neglected to think about with all of that... \"Mmmm... food...\" Ivy's voice came out somewhat trancesque, it had become lower and much more sultry with her widened neck. She didn't mean to say that, it just sort of popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Kay!\" Harley nearly jumped out of her seat to get the delicious morsels from the fridge. Ivy didn't notice the younger girl's enthusiasm now, her stomach commanded her brain now: commanded it to eat. Ivy's nostrils flared as soon as the chocolate aroma filled the air. Even for cold brownies, the smell was still strong enough to get Ivy excited without even having to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know,\" Harley tried her best to make small talk with Ivy, in effect lightening the mood between her and the glutton, \"Mrs. Katrowskie's complainin' that we fattened up her and 'er girls, funny huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that: Harley was desperate to make conversation. Even she knew that wasn't funny, nor was it interesting. The redheaded feedbag had been turned on, her eyes glass with lust and greed for those sweets. Her stomach gurgled, Harley couldn't tell if it was a sign of emptiness or that it was filled beyond capacity. Either way, Ivy was getting those brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to reach over her own gut, it proved futile as her immense front side wedged itself between her reach, she grunted and huffed like a spoiled child trying to reach an inaccessable toy. Harley couldn't stand it, Red was so cute when she got like that. She had to do something, and something she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde got up, picking up a chunk of the pan's contents with her hand along the way. Her bright baby blues locked onto Ivy's squinched green eyes, they looked at her angrilly. \"What?\" Ivy huffed, eyes finding some way to narrow themselves even further, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley playfully shoved the brownie into her friend's mouth, giggling girlishly, \"Tat's what!\" she laughed, scampering off to the latter half of the room, which put her behind the couch. Ivy rebuttled by tossing a paper plate like a frisbee at Harley's head. It ended up breaking a lamp and giving Harley a nasty shock which put the Cupid of Crime in a bedridden state for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy felt no remorse, \"She started it.\" </span></div></div>",

She had found it really enjoyable and found herself acting more like a queen while thinking of Harley more as her servant. So when Harley did something she iddn't like, she was going to react with force. She could see from her chair that Harley would be out for awhile. It was just as well to Ivy as it would allow her to eat in peace. She had been able to tell that Harley would want to take while she ate her brownies and Ivy just wanted to eat in piece. Ivy greedily grabbed one of the brownies and showed it into her mouth and swallowing it. She began to stuff brownie after brownie down her throat, not bothering to stop. The chocolatey taste was so good that all she wanted was omre of it and not only want more of it but need more of it statisy her cravings. She continued to stuff brownie after brownie down her throat until she had eaten all of them. She then licked the chocolate off her fingers and then her ilps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that it hit her of just how stuffed she really was. Her green belly was even more bloated then before and pressing more against the table causing her a little discomfort in addition to the pain she felt from being so stuffed. She closed her eyes and moaned softly, gently moving her hands to her bloated belly and began to gently rub it. She could both feel and her her stomach grumbling and growing as it began to digest all of what she had just eaten. She found herelf breathing a little heavily from having eaten so much. The pain of the table into her belly was really starting to get to her but she realized that she was too stuffed to move and had no energy. Knowing that she couldn't stand the pain, she moved her hands from her belly to the table and with all her strength which wasn't much as all eating and being lazy had weakned her, she was able to manage to push herself just enough away from the table so that it wasn't still hitting her belly anmore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy breathed out a sigh of relief as she laid back in her chair and resumed massaging her swollen gut. She moaned softly as she sat there rubbing her belly, enjoying the feeling of being so stuffed. She sat there for awhile, allowing the food to digest for a bit before trying to get up. After a while, she placed her hands on the back of the chair and began to slowly heave herself from the chair. It took her a great amount of energy and she felt herself huffing as she got up. She had to take a minute to catch her breathe after getting up. Shen then slowly waddle over to the tv. Luckily \"Botany Hour\" was having a marathon today so she didn't have to worry that she missed seeing the show at it's usual starting time. Seeing Harley unconcious on her seat on the couch in front of the tv, Ivy was not pleashed. She pushed Harley off the couch who just laid sprawled out on the floor, Ivy then collasped down on the couch, oblivious to it's groaning under her weight. She then picked up the tv remote which was on the side of the couch, turned on the tv, and tuned it to \"Botany Hour\". She then laid back and began to watch her show while rubbing her bloated belly. Though she found the show very interesting, she was finding herself  getting sleepy due to all she had just eaten and eventually passed out ina stuffed induced slumber.</span></div></div>",

Ever red, they were certainly the things of children's nightmares. His eyes moved side to side not out of a premonition of threat or a sense of uneasiness, but because his warped attention span couldn't quite fathom what made the painting on the elevator wall \"art\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In what sort of world does a boat equate to a masterpiece?\" He asked to no one but himself, as he was truly the only one he could ever amuse, \"I mean really; it <i>looks</i> like a nice boat, and I'm sure it is.

He removed his gloves, allowing an abhorrent amount of sweat to pour from their white cloth confines. He whipped the gloves in his now exposed to be pale and ghostly hand; doing the same to the other before slipping them back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Night with the ex.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking his reflection in the golden archway over the automated doors, he smoothed out a cowlick in his trim green locks with some spittle, only to have it pop right back up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could rectify this little mistake, he was moderately shocked to see that the doors had opened up to the penthouse suites. Contentedly grinning to himself once more, smoothing over his hair quickly before making his exit, he let out a little chuckle as his gaze travelled back to the disturbing grin forced upon the now deceased Elevator Operator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a stiff.\" he joked, \"Didn't laugh at a single one of my jokes... nice smile though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pee...eff... one-o-seven...\" he murmered quietly to himself before reaching into his lapel, pulling out a folded slip of paper.

Gingerly with one of his gloved hands, he rapped lightly on the door and pulled back, waiting like ever so the gentleman he appeared to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoooo iiiisss iiiiiittt?!\", came a familiar throaty Harliquin's holler from behind the door. Ah how many times he'd heard the sound of that sweet Jersey siren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telegram!\" he said calmly, deciding to have a little fun with his surprise date for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened to reveal...</span></div></div>",

A big one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously now, Harley's trepidation was barely hidden at all, \"H-How big?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotham First Bank. Gotta start somewhere, might as well be somewhere with easy access to cash.\" he said, plopping himself on the couch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause between the two demented entertainers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's wrong with you?\" Joker finally asked, \"You don't seem to happy to see ol' Puddin' these days. Still mad? Another guy? Oh don't <i>tell</i> me Ivy's got you thinking you're a lesbian now. I've been with you in the sack Kid, you're no Gina Gershon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Harley hollered, rushing over to his side, \"I would nevah cheat on you Puddin', it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flex of his nostrils, an oddly familiar smell wafted into his sizeable nose. \"What's that smell?\" he asked curiously, not quite able to place the scent, \"Whatever it is its great... Your Mama's Special Cinnamon Rolls!\" he jeered, \"Oh what's the occassion; someone getting married? No, your brother finally got a job? No, that'd never happen... LOST got greenlit for another season?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley then unprecedentally removed herself from her once rightful spot at her Puddin's side and darted towards the kitchen. \"Y'see, that's what's different now Mistah J...\" Harley whimpered, grabbing the oven mitt and removing an entire tray of sweets fresh from the oven, \"Ivy needs me here so we can work on our plan togetha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plan? What plan?\" Joker snapped, \"What are you two up to that involves baked goods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee... you really have been in the slamma a long time, haven't ya?\" Harley giggled nervously <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overworked little gerbil inside Joker's brain sped up to Mach 5 before a sudden realization hit him smack in the face like so many bat-gauntlets in the past. \"Wait a second... you two are the reason everyone's getting so tubby!\" he shouted, \"Your mother's recipies combined with some weird plant gizmo that Ivy's concocted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mistah J...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's brilliant!\" he shouted, jumping from his seat and pacing about the room, \"Tubby people are, for one, hilarious when they run. But they're also much easier- and bigger- targets. Does it take a little bit of the fun from watching them cower in fear? Yes. But on the upside, it makes it all the more hilarious to watch them waddle away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he laughs maniacally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean really, the obese population is just so <i>funny</i>! Chris Farley, John Belushi, hell even that chubby fellow from the Office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley smiled, a bit of her stressed eased as she found her Puddin' rather approving. He seemed to be in high spirits today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'm glad ta have your approval Puddin'!\" she giggles, planting a big wet one on the sunken white cheek before heading down the hallway with her freshly baked buns<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going with those?\" he asked, \"Can't I have one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh no Mistah J. These are spiked, the way Ivy likes 'em. You'd get hooked in a single bite!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And, Ivy <i>ingests</i> these addictive concoctions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yeah, that's kinda how things work around here now.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside Ivy's room had become a foreign land to those other than herself and Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blinds were closed and doubled over so as to allow little sunlight, which interrupted her schedule at times and through the lack of which sapped her of some much needed energy. Her plants had adapted to a nocturnal state, with haunting yellow \"eyes\" of slick mucus not unlike what made a firefly glow. They had grown gnarled and twisted in their evolution, long Seymour-esque \"teeth\" to capture the occasional fly that managed to slip in from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kept at a nightly chill and rather humid in her room, for her babies as well as herself. The decorations were coated in a film of condensation or wrapped by some vine-bearing plants. There was plenty of room to breath; the oxygen that her loving plants provided their mother with may have been the only thing keeping Ivy from her terrible wheezing and panting fits. In return, she would breathe herself much more carbon dioxide to sustain her own little ones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roots and vines made a carpet that covered the entire room, with only a trail that led up to the sole piece of visible furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, behind a divider of protective pink flowers that glowed with the same eerie incandescence as the rest of her babies, sat Poison Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it would not be the Poison Ivy that Joker had seen last, almost a year and a half ago. Initially what had been just simple overidulgence combined with denial had yielded undeniably the fattest chloropath anyone had ever laid eyes upon. Swollen to unimaginable proportions, Ivy lay in her bed at a staggering half-ton of pure pampered blubber. All green, every fold and nook and cranny of her vast and underused body. Constant exposure to her own toxin had, ironically, left her lazy and hopelessly addicted to her own food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in the nude, large green body censoring all the dirty bits to her save her saucer nipples. A large, overbearing stomach surged forward eagerly to hide most of her legs. It lumbered towards the edge of the bed, folding over even itself several times over as it lazily sat. There, where it had accidentally flopped atop a pillow, was a small break in the perfect line where her mammoth muffin top was forced upwards unto her middle roll. Sitting atop said side bulges were her arms, the thick wings her adipose had lent her matching what would have hung over any bottoms to fit her perfectly in size and girth. Her flabby arms folded couldn't even cross her bosom anymore, they simply sat about four inches from eachother in a sorry state of slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face, chinned that and a time over, leaned forward as she used her own frontal blubber as a pillow. An exceedingly long strand of leafy red hair drooped over her fifty-some-odd inch arm wing only to get lost in her many folds- reemerging to touch the bed and go on for maybe another three inches. She snored quietly. Obviously this mammoth mound of supervillain had fallen into another fat person nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh Golly, Pam!!\" the Joker hollered as he walked into the room, \"You really let yourself go!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean really; Penguin said that you had put on a few, but he never warned me just how big you'd gotten. Poor ol' chap's broken hearted by the way. Says burn in hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, all the plants jerked towards the Harlequin of Hate in a threatening manner. They hissed and clicked wildly, some bearing actual teeth and threatening the ghastly ghoul with ingestion. However it took more than that to intimidate everyone's most feared clown. He simply walked towards the curtain petals with wild abandon and rapped roughly on their delicate petals<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puddin', I wouldn't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock knock, anyone home?!\" he jeered, \"Its Happy Girl Cookie Time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My babies!\" Ivy was jerked awake by the shrieks and wails of her beloved foliage. Her expression changed to one of pure dumb exertion as she wriggled about in her bed in a futile attempt to see what was going on in front of her. \"What's going on with my babies?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Ivy, ya big old softie.\" Joker said, raising his hands in defense, \"Call off your weeds before I pull out the Round Up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Joker?\" Ivy asked in a husky yet surprised voice, \"Harley told me you were-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead?\" he cut off the mound, \"Well I'm certain I was for a second or two there. And you're not far behind me, Heart Disease is the major killer this year... well, besides me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, what is he doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, who had nervously hid behind the doorway all this time, finally peeped up, \"He... uh, he kinda dropped in... you know how I can't say know to Mistah J...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" the blob said in her newer deeper and slower voice, \"I thought we agreed that <i>I'd</i> have final say over who gets to come into the apartment- wouldn't want anyone finding out about our situation would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go Red!\" Harley said with newfound pep as she remembered the tray of cinnamon rolls in her hand, \"Fresh from the oven, just how ya like 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme.\" Ivy said greedily as the plants allowed Harley to pass with their mother's tray. She handed her the large silver platter and watched with a wicked sense of glee as she lifted one up with fat fingers; biting into it sinfully with a throaty moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\" Ivy hummed blissfully, \"That's the good stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh save it.\" Joker huffed, \"I believe I didn't come back here to talk sugar with the ladies. I came to get my hench wench back, but upon seeing that her services are... profitable to you, Ivy, I've decided to compromise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compromise?\" Ivy huffed as she swallowed another bite of bun, \"She's <i>my</i> room mate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless; I saw her first.\" Joker quipped, taking a step towards Ivy, \"Now, what's say you keep ol' Harley here with you in good company with Wayne Towers? I'll move myself and a few of my boys next door to keep you company! In return, we'll call it... fifty fifty on profits. Better make that sixty-fourty. Guards don't come cheap, even if they are from Blackgate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixty-Fourty?!\" Ivy roared, \"That's insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer \"socially impaired\" myself.\" Joker giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it!\" Ivy barked from her fixed position on the bed, \"How about you just leave, and we all pretend like nothing ever happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence before Joker turned his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine... I can tell when I'm not wanted. Harley, you stay with tons of fun here and I'll be on my way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistah J, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Poo!\" Joker cooed, \"The poor girl's rather attached to me, you see? Might bweak hewr poowr widdle heawrt to see old Uncle J go. Tell you what- you let me in on this... and I'll use my \"connections\" to launch your little baked goodies all over the nation. Easy-Peasy Pam- you just keep secreting those spores of yours over whatever it is we make and I'll get my boys to launch them from Coast to Coast! We'll be billionaires!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, he shouted fervently and raised his hands- a storm of Monopoly money flies from his sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Billionaires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You betcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Joker gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley jumps to Ivy's defense, \"But Mistah J, there's no way Ivy can produce that much of her pollen- she only gets a good batch goin' if she eats a whole lot.\" she whimpers, turning to her already engorged friend, \"She's gotten real big already, how is she gonna feed a whole country?\" Wickedly and with secret pleasure, Harley leaned against Ivy's flabby form. Supported by a hijacked hospital bed to keep her in a sitting position, Harley's face sunk deep into Ivy's soft blubber rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here? Here is where the trademark grin came along. The grin that frightened children and adults alike. The grin that spoke one thousand words. That grin that sent shivers down even Batman's spine at times...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then... we're just going to have to get her more to eat.\" he said with a haunting rasp to his most serious of voices, \"Isn't that right...<b>Pammy</b>?\" he pat Ivy's globular gut before leaving the room and shutting the door- Harley not far behind him... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was no sooner than the next morning that Joker kept good on his promise of kicking Harley and Ivy's operation into second gear. He had spent the previous night scouring every lowlife den and hideout to put together a veritable who's who of capable henchmen. Big Sal, Joey the Rat,  and Tiny, no expense was spared finding the best of the best, henchmen who could not only take a bunch from the Batman, but had enough carpetentry know-how to assemble a proper villain's hideout. By the next morning the 35th floor of Wayne Towers had begun it's transformation into the Clown Prince of Crime's newest abode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy stirred from her sleep as the sound of hammers being pounded into plyboard rang throughout her apartment. Ivy rubbed the sleep from her eyes as her gigantic wobbling armwings jiggled by the slight exertion. Unable to investigate the disturbance herself Ivy shouted for her roommate \"Harley? Harley, what's going on out there?\" Ivy's plants sprung up from their slumber alerted to the presence of an approaching force. They hissed quietly as they tensed themselves for whatever was coming. With a pound and a thud, the door to Ivy's room flung open and smashed against the wall, the tendrils and vines that had rooted themselves to the opposing wall, visibly damaged by the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My babies! Joker you lunatic, I will not suffer you hurting another one of my babies do you hear me?\" Ivy shouted, her slower and throatier voice not nearly as intimidating as it was 900 pounds ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops a daisies! Won't happen again Pammy-Wam, scout's honor!\" Joker laughed as he hid two crossed fingers behind his back. \"Anywho, its time to do a little retrofitting Pam, gotta rework this room a bit if we want the plan to really rocket into stage two! Hey boys, file in!\" Ivy blushed slightly as 9 men shuffled into her room single file, each one gawking at just how big she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ives let's introduce the boys here! Bachelor #1 here is Big Sal. Loves walks on the beach and designer chocolate, I suspect you two have a lot in common!\" Joker said as he motioned his hands in front of the pale, fat, and bald Italian mobster in front of him. Joker moved onto the next henchmen, a lanky sweaty creep with dark circles under his eyes \"Muscles magoo here is Joey the Rat, great guy, murdered his family, ran heroin for the mob, can you believe this guy is single? Next in line is uh....this guy and well that's uhhh and he's...well there names aren't important! But you'll be getting to them over the next few hours as they retrofit your little greenhouse here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?! Joker get them the hell out of here, this wasn't part of our arrangement!\" Ivy said as she wobbled around feebly in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should've gotten that in writing!\" he laughed before exiting the room, his henchmen taking that as their cue to get to work. The 9 men worked quickly as they assembled a steel contraption to the ceiling. It was a large vat bolted to the wall, with a long running steel chute that fed directly to Ivy's bed.  All the time Ivy's plants clicked and hissed as the bolts they installed ran through the vines and roots that entrenched every corner of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You animals! If you don't stop installing whatever the hell that is, I swear you'll spend the next 4 months slowly digesting in my baby's fly traps\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah about that\" Joey the Rat said flatly. \"Jokah said that if you try anything we have full authority to bring in the flamethrower and clear out all the weeds\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she snarled. \"Just tell me what this thing is.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeding tube.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's mind raced at the implications this had for her future. At first the idea repulsed her, was this really what was left for her? To spend every waking moment being fed and fattened, like a prize pumpkin to be saturated with nutrients, grown to immeasurable size, and then harvested? But, before she knew it the idea began to stick with her. She was already at the point in her life where she did nothing, but sleep and eat. The idea of being able to eat at all waking moments deeply appealed to her and by the time she had accepted her fate, the installation was finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you waiting for?\" Ivy demanded. \"Feed me!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy\u2019s fate was sealed, incredible obesity the only foreseeable option available to the overgrown super seductress. Today would be the first time Ivy strapped on her not so proverbial feedbag and was force-fed liquid nutrients from the mechanical vat in the apartment above. As she was more or less resigned to her incredibly hedonistic future by this point Ivy had little to be concerned about. In all honesty the greedy green glob of what once was Gotham\u2019s most notorious femme fatale was beyond anxiety or fear, even as the respirator-like device lowered from the ceiling and over her mouth. Her feelings on the matter were simple: she was hungry, and this machine was going to feed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have plenty of time to think of a possible alternative later\u2014but she could already hear the low hum of her breakfast churning upstairs on the other end of the long tube. And that only served to make her massive green middle growl viciously from deep within, demanding to be sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Big Sal lumbered over from his position amongst the other seven whom had constructed the contraption, the sick giggling of their much feared employer heightened as he ran the fastener behind Pam\u2019s mane of red hair and leaves, snapping the mouthpiece into place with a loud CLACK as it cut into the woman\u2019s chubby cheeks. The ghastly clown could barely contain himself or his excitement, presented as a polite golf clap that slowly spread throughout the apartment between the violent sociopaths. Taking a polite bow he lowered his bald head in mock appreciation before returning to the foot of the bed, allowing for the top dog to step forward and lead the christening of S.S. Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and Jerks,\u201d he began as he held his arms out, \u201cI am honored to be here today standing before you a humble, smart, good looking fellow, with a dazzling smile and a wicked sense of humor\u2014I\u2019m sure if you\u2019d ask my main squeeze over here she\u2019ll attest I\u2019m not so bad in the\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistah J!\u201d Harley coughed as she avoided the lusty glances of the sexually depraved deviants in the room, \u201cIt\u2019s, er, almost time for Ivy\u2019s breakfast should we, uh, ya know<b> wrap this up</b>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine fine.\u201d The Joker rolled his eyes and folded his outstretched arms before beginning again with much less fervor \u201cAnywho, above all, I am proud to say that today begins a new dawn on our prosperous nation. Where clean-cut British gents in powdery little wigs fought so that any poor schmoe walking the streets, such as you fine gentlemen, could be free to make as much money as possible, as fast as possible! Now let\u2019s stick it to everyone but good ol\u2019 Ben Franklin and make everyone as puckish as a Macy\u2019s Day Parade float!\u201d here he adjusted his smiley-faced hard hat and pulled out an equally gaudy walky-talky. \u201cAlrighty Joe, pull the lever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove them, a lanky sweaty man with dark circles under his eyes pulled down on a comically oversized lever embedded into the floor. Deep within the mechanical elephant\u2019s trunk, suction began to flow that pulled the thick pasty mixture from the vat and down the chute\u2014eventually into Ivy\u2019s always open mouth. As the goo quickly bulged Ivy\u2019s cherubic green cheeks her eyes shot open; not quite used to being fed in such a manner. But quickly she adjusted, eagerly sucking down and swallowing a mixture of untold fattening capabilities\u2014spiked with the spores of her own creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Harley watched, wide-eyed with a terrible wonder, she couldn\u2019t help but feel conflicted over her friend\u2019s new predicament. On one hand , she was happy. Ivy would now gain all the fluffy inches to her waistline that Harley had thus-far enabled and indeed desired. On the other, she couldn\u2019t help but feel\u2026 wrong. Getting so much pleasure from seeing Ivy like this, fastened to a feed bag while indulging her every gluttonous desire, knowing that all she was to her Puddin\u2019 was a big green eating machine, made her feel bad. Not bad enough to say anything, of course. But still pretty lousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the other nine men had left the room, Harley snuck over to Ivy. Looking over her shoulder, as if Mr. J was going to pop right back in at any moment, the pigtailed blonde wrapped herself around as much of Ivy as she could reach\u2014relishing the fleshy folds that smothered the right side of her face as the belly beneath it was slowly filled to contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah, nothin\u2019 wrong about this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the results to show around the nation. Coast to coast people were busting out of their Sunday best, their leisure clothes, and uniforms. Of both genders, all those indulging in the newly-named Guffaw Brand of confectionaries found themselves with exponentially growing waistlines; along with a gnawing addiction and a sapped motivation to do much about either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Gotham City, high above the rabble and brightly-lit streetlights, a woman vastly illadvised to don any variation of her many outfits had squeezed into one such in an attempt to capture her old days as a neutral party in crime fighting. Clad in black leather that conformed and exaggerated every meaty roll of her generously padded frame, Selina Kyle wheezed up a storm after having jumped from one rooftop to another. Having had to run for a short period of time to build up the proper momentum, Catwoman found that her gait had been long insufficient to be considered \u201crunning\u201d. More like she <i>waddled</i> as fast as she could and made a blind leap over to the building over. Thankfully she had made it, having landed on her plump rump rather than her pudgy toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 does\u2026 it\u2026\u201d she grunted as she struggled to rise under her own power, ripping the eared cowl from her head and removing the now uncomfortable goggles, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 becoming\u2026 a housecat\u2026 full-time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetropolis, as Gotham\u2019s only rival in high crime and cosmopolitan status, was a prime victim to be ensnared by the fleshy vice that became their collective trousers alongside its sister city. Lois Lane sat propped in a custom-ordered rolling chair, chubby legs kicked up on her desk reading an issue of the <i>Daily Planet</i> with a so-far unflabby Livewire and a somewhat husky Parasite running rampant. She hid her face behind the black and white pages, making distinct chewing noises and letting slip a few \u201cmmm\u201ds and \u201cahh\u201ds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright, Lois?\u201d Perry White asked knowingly as he walked the halls of the Daily Planet, far from blind to his employee\u2019s expansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust \u2013mpmh\u2014peachy, Perry!\u201d Lois said from behind her barrier as she chewed on a brownie, chocolate staining her plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of our fair country, Smallville Kansas, an uncomfortably large blonde woman in uncomfortably small daisy dukes had all but taken over the modest 50\u2019s diner that had taken stock of Guffaw products some months ago. Evolving from a puckish patron to a rotund regular, Kara <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Zor-El</span> *ahem* <i>Kent</i> had grown into quite the super-hog since learning that Mary\u2019s Diner stocked her favorite supply of treats. All but wedged into the booth, her mighty appetite had led her to sampling the entire dessert menu in one sitting, a feat most onlookers took with a side shock and awe as the blonde beluga gorged herself all afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019m a growing girl?\u201d she asked sheepishly to the expectant waitress, \u201cYou can just, uh, put it on my aunt and uncle\u2019s tab.\u201d She said with an innocent smile as she pat her wobbling gut, mostly uncovered by her red plaid shirt. A burp escaped her and, in a feat of identity-jeopardizing super sloppiness, shattered all the windows in the modest diner. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be coming out of my allowance\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Coast City Carol Ferris sat behind her desk, dressed in a violet business suit that must have been fitted for a hippopotamus. The young head of Ferris Aircraft was quite plump, owed to her sedentary lifestyle and recent addiction to a certain brand of confectionary. An addiction which was only deepened and indeed attributed to the now year-long disappearance of her boyfriend-slash-intergalactic justice enforcer Hal Jordan, better known as one of many Green Lanterns. Some months ago she had heard about the popular brand word of mouth around the office and\u2026 well, time makes whales of us all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Hal\u2026\u201d she said solemnly as one plump finger longingly traced the glass on his picture, \u201cPlease come home soon\u2026\u201d she said with a sigh before reaching into her desk and pulling out a prepackaged muffin bearing the cheeky grin of Guffaw\u2019s logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not too soon\u2026\u201d she added quietly before taking her first of many sinful bites\u2026</span></div></div>",

Normally she preferred illicit activities to doing <i>actual</i> carpentry, but with Harley's promise of a generous paycheck she found herself unable to refuse. \"Hey, don't mention it.\" she says, drill vibrating wildly in her expert hands, \"You're the one paying for the gas for me to get up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that last quip, the Carpenter's job was finished; all doorways in the apartment had been widened by three feet to better fit Ivy's massive form. Though, she didn't have to know <i>that</i> particular reason, did she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure Wayne won't mind that we're screwing with his property?\" Jenna had to ask, she was crazy enough to work with Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum and their psychotic 'Wonderland Gang', but incite the wrath of the Prince of Gotham? She wasn't that crazy. \"I mean, I'm not even sure my carpentry liscence is <i>valid</i> anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley waved off her newfound companion, \"Naw, a'course not!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna narrowed her eyes, \"You're sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley took a seat close to the finished doorway, admiring the craftsmanship while enjoying the last of an untainted batch of brownies. \"A'course I'm sure!\" she said, spewing small particles of chocolate treat over the white 3x6's that made up the doorframe, \"He was nice enough ta let Ivy keep 'er plants in the next room afta all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna wiped off the chunks of brownie, \"Geez, watch where you aim those things!\" she then wiped off her carpentry gloves, \"What's with all the brownies anyway? You starting a bakery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Cupid of Crime smiled bashfully, not willing to admit to <i>herself</i> that she had made these brownies just to inflate Poison Ivy's massive frame before the heaving heffer decided that <b>now</b> was the optimum time for some shopping. Thus leaving Harley alone with Jenna and an entire platter of brownies, all of which found themselves inside Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no reason!\" Harley's answer came out very sharp and almost unfriendly, \"Uh... you want one from the next batch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna turned her head, Gotham sure were weird. \"Nah, I'm watching my waistline.\" she said, patting a set of moderately polished abdominals behind denim overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good to hear...\" Harley replied, visibly relieved that the questioning had ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the distance, an unfamiliar quaking startled the Keystone criminal. It was slow and methodic, but seemed to be approaching the apartment, singled out rather than the entire city being targetted. She ducked, \"That better not be the fuckin' Bat!\" she shouted, getting her power tools ready for action<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Duffy got her answer soon enough, though it was a very unexpected one at that. Poison Ivy; Duchess of Daffodils, Queen of Crisanthimums, Mistress of Gotham's Crime Underground, looked to be about 400 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery part of the ludicrously obese Ivy quivered as she took steps inside the apartment (thankfully the entrance had been widened just a few hours ago) Jenna watched as Poison Ivy's expansive bustline heaved with every deep breath, winded from head to toe. Her stomach jut out boldy past her pitiful disguise, sticking out at least a foot and a half from her original waistline. Jenna giggled to herself as she watched Ivy reach past her own girth to reach her purse, pushed aside by her monstrous lovehandle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey Harl...\" she wheezed, winded from her long day of going out on the town, \"Guess who I met out on the-\" the enormous woman paused as she noticed the snickering low-rate criminal in her living room, \"Who the hell is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley bit her lower lip, praying that Jenna would keep her mouth shut about Ivy's little <i>weight problem</i>. Her prayers were not recieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-h-h my God!\" Jenna roared with laughter, causing her to drop her circular saw on the floor, \"What the hell happened to you- You're HUGE!!\" the younger girl gesticulated with her hands to reflect just how massive Ivy had been fattened to, \"You breathing so hard because you got tired on the elevator?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley motioned for Jenna to shut her mouth, aware that Ivy's massive form was lumbering towards the carpenter. \"Jenna!\" she whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait, can you take the elevator anymore, or do you fill it up by yourself?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jenna!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... did you eat the bellhop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>Jenna!!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, Ivy had locked Jenna in one of her mind-wiping kisses. She had locked the young ponytailed villain in a state of drunken enibration, entranced with Ivy's now apparant beauty. Ivy turned her firey eyes to Harley, who squeaked, \"And <b>you</b> said I wasn't gaining weight.\" Ivy said, suprisingly calm. Harley knew better, that was rage detectable behind Ivy's flabby cheeks, \"Oh well, I guess I'm gonna have to start exercising while <i>you</i> do all the work around here, Ms. Five-Meals-A-Day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Jenna, who was busy staring off into space. \"Empty your pockets, you're paying us for allowing you to work for us.\" suddenly a wicked sneer crossed Ivy's plump green cheeks, \"And take one of my <i>special</i> brownies, you'll <b>love</b> them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin became that familiar sneer that made Ivy so feared, \"Actually, take a few. Spread the word to Keystone about the Gifts of Demeter.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley was disapointed that Jenna had blown her cover of fattening Ivy up though she hadn't given up on continuing to fatten Ivy up. She had seen how greedy and lazy Ivy could get and how much she loved it. She also figured that exercising would help get Ivy back to fattening. Once she saw how weak and out of shape she was she would find exercising hard and boring. Harley had no doubt that Ivy would quickly give it up to go back to eating lots and being lazy after that. With all that in mind, she was finding Jenna's blowing her cover a minor speedbump they would quickly get over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had left Ivy to give her some time to herself and also because she needed to restock the apartment with more food. She was on her way to the new grocery store that was not too far away from their apartment when she noticed a familar face. It took her a second to place Selina Kyle aka Catwomen as she looked chubbier than the last time she saw her.  Her surprise at how chubby Selina only lasted a second before remembering how Selina had gotten addicted to the goodies at the high society social event. She couldn't help but smile to herself at seeing how her goodies had fattened up another villianess, and this time a rival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was not as big as Ivy but still quite chubby. She had a round soft chubby pot belly that was pushing her black t-shirt up some, her breasts had gone from a round c to a round d and pushing out her shirt from with in her bra. Her black pants were also quite tight due to her wider hips and very thick thighs that rubbed together. She couldn't see Selina's butt but she was sure it was quite round and big. \"Selina?\" Harley asked. Selina stopped and slowly turned to see Harley, blushing bright red. She was embarassed to be caught by one of her rivals looking like this. Selina paused for a second but realizing there was no escape sighed and said, \"Hi Harley, okay I admit it. I have turned into a fatass. It's all because of that damn social. They had these most delicious pastries there that just got me hooked. I can't stop eating them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no way was Harley going to let Selina know she was responsible but she was going to have a little fun with the the now chubby catwoman. \"Well that sucks. I guess that puts you out of the cat burgulary business since all those cats are thin and not chubby\" Harley said with a giggle as she gave Selina's belly a pat, enjoying how soft and jiggly it felt. Selina felt both a mix of rage and embarassment. Harley was right, she hadn't been able to continue her life of crime since she gained weight and hated to be reminded of it. It was so embarassing to have let herself get this fat but she also hated Harley's making fun of her. She didn't want to let her have that satisfaction. \"Oh don't you worry about me, I am going to lose all this weight and be back in the game before you know it Harley. You and Ivy enjoy your little time with out my rivalry while you can because I will be back with a vengence\" she said before storming off in a hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley watched as Selina let, pleased to see that her guess of Selina now having a big soft round butt was proven correct. With that, Harley continued on to the grocery store. She got a grocery store and began going through the store, getting everything she needed. It took her awhile but she was able to get everything. After paying and grabbing her bags, she started to head back home. Feeling a little hungry she decided to stop in a dunkin donuts for a snack. As she made her way inside, she recognized another familiar face, Talia Al Ghu, one of the daughters of Ra's Al Ghu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had seen Talia at the high society social event as well but didn't get a chance to talk with her. By the looks of her, it looked like she had put on some weight too which could only mean she had tried her pastry. She now had a small pot belly, her hips looked a little wider, her thighs a little rounder and thicker, and even her breasts a little bigger. Talia was sitting at a table with a latte and a couple of donuts. Even though her gain was smaller compared to Ivy and Selina's, Harley had to admit that it looked good on her. After getting  a couple of donuts and a milk for herself Harley made her way over to Talia. \"Hi, I saw  you at the social a couple of weeks ago but I didn't get a chance to say hi. I'm Harley, may I join you?\" Harley said in a friend tone with a smile. Talia decided the young women looked sweet and innocent enough so might as well allow her to join her. \"Sure, it's nice to meet you Harley. I'm Talia. Have a seat\" she said gesturing to the empty chair across the table from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ***********************************************<br>\r\nBack at Harley and Ivy's Apartment, Ivy had changed into some exercise clothes and was going to try to exercise some of this flab off. None of her excercise clothes had fit so she had put on a pair of black  sweatpants which were pretty snug and a old large white t-shirt which was now tight on her as well which kept rolling up revealing her fat belly. She was still amazed that she had allowed Harley to fatten her so much with out realizing it. She also didn't understand why Harley would want to do that since they were so close and a team. She decided to worry about that later, she needed to start working off this flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy decided to first start out with some stretches.As she swung out her arms, she could fell all the fat on her arms and all over her body jiggle which both disgusted her but she had to admit felt kinda nice. After shaking out her arms, she began to strech out her legs but found they were so heavy that she didn't have very good balence and was mostly only jiggling the fat and not getting them stretched at all. She displeased with her start but she wasn't going to give up. She decided to try jumping jacks. She found that she could barely do one with her whole fat body jiggling and making the apartment shake. She so so weak and fat that it took all her strength to do that one and it was a very slow one too. She was embarassed to find herself already out of breath after just that one jumping jack. What has happened to me she wondered to herself in both shock and horror</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ghul's brunette number-two took a very ladylike chomp from her donut, followed swiftly by a swig of coffee. Talia then dabbed her lips with a napkin. Harley couldn't place exactly why Talia remained so formal, even in such an informal setting. It was nice though, a stark change from Ivy's belches, bellowing, and accumulated poor eating habits. Not that she didn't enjoy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So~o...\" Harley found herself at a loss for words, she felt so outclassed by Talia. Even as she hungrilly lusted over her afternoon snack of donuts, Harley still couldn't place Talia al Ghul as approachable. She certainly blended in with the populace of Gotham well enough, well enough while still trying to hide her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley found herself staring at Talia's breasts, heavy milk sacks that tested the confines of her top. The blonde woman began to blush, they certainly were very large for a woman who could only be classified as \"sturdy\" rather than the rest of Ivy's fanbase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was certainly going to be an akward meeting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whatsit like having Raish ahl Gool as a dad, huh?\" Harley looked away as she tried to pronounce her father's name correctly, trying her best to even remember his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia looked up from her meal, smiling knowingly. \"First, why don't you tell me how lovely it is to have such a wide fanbase of loyally addicted customers?\" her accent reverberated sensually through Harley's chest, it made her sound so much more intelligent....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nIvy's massive body quivered as she did steps in her apartment, working to the beat of Harley's mp3 and doing as the slender blonde on television instructed her to. She managed to find a set of steps sturdy enough to support her weight, strangely enough there were three sets in the closet. Two of which were now in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we go ladies- one, two, one, two- a little faster now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was working up a storm, she could barely breath. With every step, her vast expanse of fat jiggled; from her chubby cheeks to her lard laden legs. And what's worse, between everything that was jiggling there was sweating and chafing involved! Her desperate puffs of air got more and more struggled as she attempted her workout session. And it had only been ten minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the beat of some DJ, Ivy tried her hardest to jiggle her way into fitness with arm movements choreographed in accordance to her stepping motions. But to no avail, all that she accomplished was that now her <i>arms</i> were tired too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused the recording, letting her entire weight flop helplessly back onto the couch. Ivy wheezed as she attempted to navigate the music to a more classical tone with her plump sausage like fingers. Below her, she could hear a shrill whine emenate from Mrs. Katrowskie's apartment, \"<i>Ma</i>, you said Mistah Wayne had these buildings quake-proof!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's fiery red eybrows furrowed, her determination to get thin was rejuvenated. Slowly but surely she lifted herself up from the couch with help from the armrest, something that without her superior plant body structure no mortal woman could achieve, her soft fat drooping back freely into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that she had done enough steps for today, she fastforwarded the recording to crunches. It was going to be hard getting rid of the gut that <i>Harley</i> created all by herself (at least that's what Ivy told herself what happened) but it was going to be even harder reaching over it first.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------<br>\r\nTalia took another sip of her latte, \"You heard me.\" she says matter-of-factly, \"I <b>know</b> that you have something to do with Gotham's collective girth lately, I presume you had help from someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's mouth hung agape, now afraid of a woman she had clearly underestimated. No one knew that she was one of two faces behind the anonymous brownies; <i>no one</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that hard to guess, dear.\" Talia rested her soft cheek in her hands dreamilly, \"I must hand it to you though, your culinary skills are far from terrible.\" Talia calmly took another bite from her pastry, swallowed, and resumed her corraboration, \"Though I wouldn't mind a little more frosting on those teacakes in the paper- what do you call them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cupcakes... dey're cupcakes...\" Harley was still at a loss, \"I'll see what we can do about tat....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do.\" Talia smiled before balling up her napkin and pushing it aside, leaning in like an excited schoolgirl with the face of a distinguished lawyer; intent to kill. \"I take it your partner, she has grown quite fat lately, has she not?\" she narrowed her eyes at the young jersey girl, who's eyes travelled once again to Talia's ample busom, \"That nymph woman, if I'm not mistaken, the one that my beloved calls \"Poison Ivy\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-\" she stuttered over herself, unable to form a coherent sentence. Not only had Talia unwravled the mystery of the quickly growing sociallites, but she had determined that she had a partner and who it was. All from information that Harley didn't even know she had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia's smile remained unchanged, but her eyes visually softened, \"Don't worry, I would never halt such an <i>admirable</i> business, even one who's strangely addictive meals manage to put a few inches on my beltline.\" Harley could see the growing lust in Talia's eyes for another donut, \"Ya mean... ya mean yer not gonna tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia al Ghul simply smiled as she gathered up her belongings. She rose from her seat to reveal a large, bulbous backside. Harley drooled slightly as she watched the shapely woman swagger towards the exit, \"See what you can do about those \"cupcakes\", will you my young friend?\" she turned her head slightly to face Harley, who only nod vigorously. \"And... its not polite to stare.\" Talia said quietly, purposely exaggerating her hips in a proud stride as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley let out a heavy sigh, content in knowing that at least for now, her secret was safe in Talia al Ghul...<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------<br>\r\nIvy's plump arms folded behind her head, flab flying all over the place as she tried her hardest to lift her head to her chubby knees. \"<i>Come... <b>on</b>!!</i> she grunted, doing her best to lift herself over her own ample middle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to hear a loud ripping sound come from behind her. Her face, already a dangerous shade of green and round as a dinnerplate, couldn't get any more flushed even from embarassment. Immediately, her entire body fell down weakly to the floor, which wasn't that far of a drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when she realized that, even laying down with her boobs flopped to the side, Ivy <i>still</i> couldn't see over her pale green gut. She let out a whimper, later followed by a moan filled with a mixture of despair, rage, and hunger; despair at being such a wide-load, rage at herself for not seeing Harley's plan, and hunger for one of her filling meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a creak beneath her, Ivy took that as a sign to roll over and heft herself up with some more assistance from the couch. All of her stepping motions must have weakened the floor in that area...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled hopelessly to the bathroom, the full body mirror in there would surely expose the source of such a rip. Ivy checked herself out, it was just as she feared: a huge green whale with red hair. However, there was not a rip in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, and then looking over her own lack-of-a-neck to check out her backside, she saw that the sound had <i>actually</i> come from her shirt! The entire back had given way to her quivering backfat! And her ass- what the hell had Harley's food done to her ass?!<br>\r\n-------------------------------------{one quick shower later}<br>\r\nIvy barged into her room, plants of all shapes and sizes greeted their mother eagerly. For convenience's sake, Ivy had all of her mobile plants move their pot-bound brothers into her room. She kept it warm for them, she kept it moist for them. She found it pleasant herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she flopped down onto her bed, another dangerous creak from such a heavy load being dropped so quickly. Strange clicks and chirps came from her babies, they were conversing with their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh babies...\" for the first time, Ivy noted just how deep her voice had become since becoming such a fatty, \"Mommy's still pretty, right, even if- even if she is just a... just a <i>little</i> bigger?\" without question, all of the plants in the room showed their approval of her question, happy clicks and whistles filled the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy... Mommy thought so.\" Ivy smiled graciously, still having some trouble breathing.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nA few days passed by in the Isely-Quinn household, and things kept their shape. Ivy managed to not have a heart attack before Harley got home and reasoned that \"Why should <i>every</i> day be a day to work out?\" and settled on only exercising on alternating weekdays between Monday and Thursday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley remained more social than she had been allowed to be with Ivy's previously harsh schedule, and since Ivy was attempting to do more around the house like getting groceries and... well, just getting groceries, Harley found herself with a little more free time. However, something <b>else</b> was going on with Harley Quinn lately...</span></div></div>",

Still though, she wanted Ivy to keep growing and thus made sure that Ivy continued to get more of the pastries than she did. Another excuse she gave for eating more of the pastries was she need to check them to make sure that she was putting enough frosting on the cupcakes as per Talia's request. She could tell that Talia was addicted to her pastries and was only happy to oblige her request to keep her eating the pastries. She felt felt so nervous and uncomfortable around Talia yet attracted at the same time and that fueled her wanting to please her (Talia). She still felt an attraction towards Ivy of course but the nervouness and uncomfortalbe she had first felt around Ivy was now long gone since they had been friends and partners in crime for awhile now. She hadn't had exchanged numbers with Talia but hoped that she would run into her again soon and see that she had put on more weight. Since she and Ivy were not in a romantic relationship Harley did not feel like she was cheating on Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley immediately started putting more pastry on her pastries and she had to admit that they tasted even better with the more frosting. Ivy also agreed that the pastres tasted better with more frosting. Harley was pleased to see that the more frosting was getting Ivy to eat more. The more frosting was getting her to eat more pastries as well. Along with her increased eating habits, she found herself starting to get more lazy. She would spend more time on the computer while snacking, when Ivy was asleep would watch tv for awhile, or other times go out on the porch to just read or listen to music. She would always be snacking though whenever she did any of those activies.. Even when she went out to hang out with some villains from her days working with the Joker and other villains she had met she would snack. She found that being lazy and snacking went together nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't lost on Harley that her lifestyle was starting to put some pounds on her formerly thin frame as well. She wasn't too concerned by this for a couple of reasons, she was still thinner then even Talia and she liked how the extra pounds had enhanced her body. She had put on about 25 pounds. The extra 25 pounds had given her a curvier more womanly body which Harley loved. Her thighs were a little thick now and her perky round butt was still that only rounder and a little bigger. She had a small slight soft belly which she enjoyed gently patting and her breasts had gotten a little bigger and rounder. Harley enjoyed the way her clothes fit her tighter and snugger with her belly, breasts, and butt making more of an indentation through them getting her some more attention from both made and female eyes. Since she liked the extra weight, she saw no point in exercise since she wanted to keep the weight she had gained. Also, she felt like she got plenty of exercise anyway with her always bouncing around due to her endless energy and all the cooking and baking she did which also required her to move around alot. She in fact wouldn't mind gaining a little more weight to make her curvier but she didn't want to get as big as either Ivy, Selena, and soon hopefully Talia. She wanted to make Ivy, Selena, and Talia all huge.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Poison Ivy lay sprawled out in her bed, her hair still tossled in a fiery bedhead and positioned quite comfortably within the confines of her own fat. She was quite a sight, stomach acting as foundation for her quilt in its claim to height. Her breasts, far too big to remain perky, sat lazilly on her gut as they flopped over to the sides slightly. Her armfat was currently being used by her chubby cheek as a makeshift pillow. Some drool trailed over the cozy upperarm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a mighty bellowing erupted from underneath her blanket. Shortly after Ivy's quivering form began to shift awkwardly, fighting herself to stay asleep. Her form shifted from laying on her flabby back to resting on her lovehandle and breast, chubby hands tucked underneath her fat face in a stereotypical fashion. A content smile flashed on her round face before her tummy rumbled again, leaving her with an annoyed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...\" Ivy grunted, clumsilly trying to find her way off of her mattress, \"Fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she pried her massive body from the plush mattress with a sense of disdain at her own appetite, wishing that she could deny it long enough to stay fast asleep. As her chubby green toes touched the warm hardwood of the apartment, she felt the familiar sensation of being one with her plants; their clicks and murmers being enough motivation to continue in feeding her empty belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain it rumbled, leading Ivy to touch it tenderly with her pudgy hands as she marveled at just how fat she had become; rather how fat Harley had <i>made</i> her. Green digits lightly inspected the portly rolls that protrude. As it growled again, this time with much more fervor, Ivy felt the familiar sting of hunger pains reverberate throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, Ivy felt another familiar sensation, the chafing of her sweatpants that had grown too tight for her flabby hindquarters. Struggling to turn around past her own lard, Ivy managed to catch a glimpse at her balloon booty, stretching the confines of the poor black material. She scowled, dimples further deepening as her facial muscles tightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Harley, making me eat all that crap...\" Ivy pulled at her tight pants, \"... I should cover her entire body in Poison Oak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall and a few struggling steps into the kitchen, the engorged green goddess instinctively found herself at the fridge. As her fat grip wrapped itself around the cold metal refridgerator, she found a not written on pretty pink paper, cursive handwriting in red ink and outlined hearts; one out of three colored in with said red ink and two with black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Red,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft ya some breakfast. Hope yer not still steamed at me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHa ha,<br>\r\nHarley</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy rolled her eyes, flaring one nostril disdainfully. \"Ugh... stupid... stupid Harley, it's probably-\" she stopped, however, as she opened the fridge to reveal a smorgasboard, \"<i>Ooh!!</i>\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"More coffee?\" Harley asked, her tone of voice far more chipper than the first time she had introduced herself to Talia. The young Ghul woman simply shook her head no, attention focused elsewhere. Namely on the tuberware full of baked goods that Harley was nice enough to bake specifically for her. \"'Kay...\" Harley looked away, \"So anyway, you wer' tellin' me about the... uh... Lazris Puts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lazarus Pits.\" Talia corrected her newfound comrade, \"La-za-rus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry.\" Harley grinned sheepishly, leaning forward, \"Lahzahrus Pits, what's so cool about 'em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia's eyes narrowed, dipping an unfrosted donut in her coffee (per request of Harley, such a thing never occurred to the practical woman) she readjusted her blouse. Harley watched as her new friend's breasts shimmied under the thin white fabric, soft bikiniline wobbling slightly as she swept the crumbs from her shirt. Despite her best wishes, Harley found her mouth watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I'd rather hear about you, Harleen.\" Talia smiled wickedly, \"All day it's been me, me, <b>me</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley blushed slightly, if anything she didn't want to offend her new friend. However, Harley's baby blues remained glued to Talia's boobies; they were so soft, so swollen... so <i>fat</i>. That adjective was swiftly becoming one of Harley's favorites. Just the way it sounded, <i>fat</i>, it made her shudder with every application of the word!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia looked down, following the perky psychiatrist's gaze. It was either she was checking out how big her boobs were getting, or Harley was gawking at how fat she had allowed herself to become. And truth be told, Talia <i>had</i> allowed herself to swell up; she was fully aware of the addictive qualities of the pastries Harley peddled with Ivy, and just how fattening they could be. She just couldn't seem to deny herself these... delicious treats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know.\" Talia gave a weak, though haughty wave, \"I'm becoming such a pig.\" to test her theory and exercise her detective skills, the brunette semi-immortal arched her back to flaunt her breasts. Her heavy sweaterpuppies tested the tight confines of her top, her cleavage fat pressing up against her facial, creasing her ever-so-slight double chin. \"I'm getting so fat lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley could barely breath. \"O-O-Oh Oh I don't th-th-think-\" she stuttered over herself again, her peepers magnetically drawn to Talia al Ghul's boobs. \"-Yeruh... yer pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Talia smiled that knowing smile of her's. \"Oh?\" she toyed with the young girl, \"And how pretty am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-V-Very pretty!\" Harley gulped, \"Yer beautyful!\" a nasty habit of hers, whenever she became too nervous; her accent got out of control and she made stupid jokes. Old habits are hard to break, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia's smile simply widened<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------<br>\r\nHours later, Ivy lay sprawled out once again; but this time on the couch. Her flabby apron of a belly spilled out over the couch cushion, her feet kicked up into a laying position and her fat cheek resting in her hand. She sat comfortably, no doubt, and every couple of seconds she popped in a bonbon that her jester-clad roomie had left for her on the end table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~\" Ivy moaned as she ate another truffle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, much to her dismay, the doorbell rang. \"ARGH!\" she grunted disdainfully, \"WHAT?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the large woman heaved her bulk from the couch halfheartedly. Again, her plump little piggies touched the cold linoleum of the kitchen, and again every single part of her body disgusted Ivy as it jiggled uncontrollably. Her gut got in the way slightly as she attempted to check the peephole, it not only poked out of her red t-shirt but also proved itself to be an obstacle in leaning against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up on the peephole, Ivy backed up (giving the door adequate room to open past her belly) to reveal- </span></div></div>",

For starters she was much skinnier than Ivy, reminding her of her formerly lithe physique even though the woman was pretty chubby with a pot belly, flabby breasts, and a kind of blubbery rear end. Another thing that bugged Ivy about this woman was the superior gleam she had in her eyes. And finally, what Ivy was really annoyed about, was the puppy dog eyes Harley was making at this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley looked away from Talia at Ivy's voice and over to Poison Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Red, this is Talia Al Ghul and she's a new friend I made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al Ghul? You wouldn't happen to be related to Ras Al Ghul, would you?\" Ivy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia nodded and then stepped into the apartment, noticing the remains of Ivy's massive breakfast from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, your roommate's quite messy isn't she?\" Talia observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy glared at the chubby newcomer before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm not outgrowing my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia just smirked and patted her growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there won't be any clothes to fit you if you got any fatter, dear.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Harley realized that a grand opportunity lay before her. She could grab some of those pastries that she knew Talia loved, and feed them to her in front of Ivy. She had to admit that she had wanted to feed Talia since she first saw her. She hoped this would make Ivy jealous and keep her to continue gaining weight. It wasn't that Ivy was eating less and gaining less weight since Jenna blew the cover on her operation or that Ivy had gotten really serious about losing weight and had lost some, no, it was more just to keep Ivy on what she (Harley) liked to call the fat road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I have those partries ya like and ya will be glad to know that I have started putting more icing on them' Harley replied quite proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, well then please do go get them\" Talia replied in that seductive tone of hers as she licked her full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley didn't have to be told twice though it took all her strength to tear her aways away from the hot chubbying body of Talia Al Ghu. She quickly bounced into the kitchen where luckily she had found the couple of trays of pastries she had made and left in the oven still in the oven. Ordinarily she wouldn't have mind if Ivy had eaten them, today she wanted them to feed Talia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the living room, Ivy had slowly padded back over to her couch and collasped down on to it, the couch groaning under her girth. The short walk had winded her and she had to take a minute or two to catch her breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia watched this scene with quiet fascination and a big evil smile spreading across her face. Here was Poison Ivy, known to be the hottest woman in the world, the one woman no man or women could resist, super fat and out of shape. Talia had to admit that Ivy was still gorgeous and that the extra weight did look good on her but still she had to admit that she got some satisfaction of seeing a beauty like Ivy very chubbed up. Yes she knew it was a very mean girl high school thought but in the case of two vain beauties were who villainess she felt it justfied. While Talia herself liked the extra weight she had gained, seeing that Ivy had gained more then her did make her feel better about her own gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy found herself hating Talia even more as she saw her staring at her with that evil smile of hers. She didn't have the power to read minds but she knew exactly what Taila was smiling at, just how much weight she had gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping herself to a couple of pastries from one of the trayes and having a large glass of milk, Harley felt her hunger satiated for now, and walked back into the room carrying the other tray of pastries. \"Here are those pastries ya like\" she replied proudly, showing them to Talia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia felt and herrd her stomach gurgle this time and licked her lips while gently patting her potbelly with one hand while looking over the pastries. \"You really did put extra icing on them. You are a doll\" she said sweetly before reachiing out to grab the trab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley quickly yanked the tray back. \"Wait! I want to feed these to you. Go sit down on the couch and I will come over and feed them to you\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia was a little surprised by this. She hadn't been excpecting Harley to ask to feed her but it seemed like a harmless request. In fact, she even found it kinda hot. \"Okay\" Talia said before sauntering over to one of the chairs, giving Harley a good look at her big butt which knew Harley was crazy over. She sat down on the chair and as promised Harley walked over to her, taking a seat in the chair next to her and feed her the first pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, these are even better with the extra icing\" Talia said after finishing her first pastry. \"Good\" Harley said before feeding her a second pastry. One by one, Harley fed Talia pastry after pastry. Both girls truly enjoying this. Talia couldn't help but moan after everyone. Even though her eyes were closed to truly get into touch with his moment, she could feel Ivy's jealous stares as her friend Harley fed her pastries. At Ivy's current size, Talia had no doubt that she felt those pastries should be hers. For fun, Talia decided to put extra oomph into her moans to rile up Ivy even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley could feel Ivy's jealous stare too as she continued to feed Talia the pastries. Her plan was working out perfectly. She was enjoying feeding Talia and helping her grow more while driving Ivy jealous and making sure she still kept gaining. It truly was a win win fo rher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For her part, Ivy was staring at Selina like she'd grown another head. Selina was now two hundred and eighty pounds of fat cat. Her breasts, thighs, ass, and belly were all fat veering into true obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom their place on the couch, Talia managed to finish the last pastry, licking along Harley's fingers before looking at the fat thief she had had some run ins with in the past.

Harley's baby blues watched as her heavy stomach heaved with her heavy breathing, as the soft supple flesh of the once fit catburglar turned anti-hero jiggle as she set her things down; her short hair letting her chubby cheeks free reign to emphasize her face. Harley beamed as she heard the seams stretch on her jacket; her gut tested the confines of her skin-tight top visibly. As she let out a puff of air to relax herself, Selina smiled nonchalantly, \"So ladies, I see we've all been hitting the gym lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy, her bulk claiming enough space for two average Gothamites, simply grunted knowingly. She was still pretty miffed at her waistline, and still pretty pissed at Harley for expanding it for her. \"Yeah, you can blame giggles for my couple of extra pounds.\" Ivy gestured to her jester-clad roomie with a pudgy thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Talia knew better. It was clear by her stance alone that Ivy had been growing all on her own for some time before Harley's self discovery. Her fat shoulders were slouched, her jaw was slack without anything to preoccupy its time, and her gaze was locked on the television; she had clearly been enjoying her time on the couch. Her massive gut spilled over the couch cushions like green cake mix, and her arm flab rested on the flank, engulfing the armrest in the doughy substance. Harley, at least to Talia's expertise opinion, was not <i>completely</i> to blame for Ivy's extra couple pounds and inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Talia herself, she had reclined to a lounging position on the loveseat, allowing her tanned creamy stomach to spill slightly from underneath her blouse and exposing her deep naval; her chubby cheek rested lazilly in her palm. \"I will admit, I have become somewhat lax regarding my exercise regimine.\" she adjusted her stance to allow her arm to rest on top of her tummy (and massage if need be), \"But there seem to be women in Gotham who can put my newfound girth in a different light, right Love?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Ivy's chagrin, Harley replied with a happy squeak. \"You betcha Tallie!\" she chirped, bringing over a platter of baked goods. Harley herself had slowly accumulated her own small amount of girth, little more than barely two stone that had so graciously left her the gift of a much more womanly figure. \"Cookie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dipped in marzipan, Love?\" even when Talia demanded things, she still managed to seduce Harley with her wide hips, generous busom, pouty lips, and air of sophistication. The slothly eco-terrorist stretched, circling her bellybutton with a dainty fingernail; \"You know how to make a cookie Tallie!\" Harley chirped, resting the tray on the coffeetable to rustle through the cabinets, searching for this 'marzeepan' Talia had so sweetly asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Ivy and Selina found themselves salivating at the sight of more sweets to stuff themselves with. They both struggled to get up and claim their share (both eyeing the entire platter as their prize) Selina couldn't muster up the strength to reach past her gut, and Ivy was simply too far down the road of obesity to swiftly manuever her blobby form. Talia smirked, she <i>knew</i> that she was going to get fed, and thus there was no need to strain herself. Though it was entertaining; watching these once prime examples of female beauty weighed down by their own fat, driven by hedonism and gluttony. Talia herself had far much more control over herself than the other women<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley soon emerged with a bottle of basil she had found in the cabinet, \"Hey, wheres da fire?\" she teased, giving each bloated beauty a cookie to bear the tide, \"There's pleny'a munchies for everyone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy stared blankly at the bottle of basil as she munched on the entire cookie. \"Harl... those, like all of the other spices in the cabinet, are plants.\" she stated matter of factly, \"And, while dead, they are still under my juristriction.\" Talia chuckled, \"Hush now, wood nymph, I think its cute.\" she beckoned Harley with a sultry tone, \"Come Love, grab the... 'frosting'... is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Harley bonked her head with the bottle of basil, \"Doy, sorry Tallie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina snorted, this was too much. She had long known that Talia al Ghul was her main competition for Bruce Wayne- the man who had entrusted his dual identity to her. Talia had figured it out long before Selina had any idea, rather Ra's did, and constantly called him Beloved. It was kind of suprising, and a wee bit entertaining, to watch Talia and her \"Love\" so flirty. And Ivy was just an added bonus, she was nearly spherical and fuming at this new and unholy relationship. The clown and the daughter of the devil; hilarious. As she giggled, her stomach jiggled slightly and cookie crumbs fell into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy glared at the newly formed team; Harley scooped a cookie in frosting and traced it around Talia's full lips. Between bites, Talia gave Ivy the sharpest glares; ones that would strike fear into the more sane denizens of Gotham. The would-be immortal woman could see how Ivy had grown so large in such a short time, Harley was surely a culinary master now. \"I can see that you've been practicing Love,\" Talia moaned indescreetly after a few pastries, \"Perhaps on Ms. Kyle and the Nymph?\" Both fat women felt the anger bubble inside their hearty chests. <br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nIvy watched the scene fold out in front of her with an undescribable feeling; it was very much like a mixture of rage, sorrow, woe, and hunger. First, Harley had the audacity to feed the big fat immortal a large portion of the platter, thus taking a large chunk from <b>her</b> share of the snack. Secondmost, it made Ivy sick the way Harley cuddled up to Talia's paunchy gut and fell asleep beneath her flabby arm. Talia stroked the bubbly blonde as her \"love\" used her boob as a makeshift pillow. Selina, having long given up on a friendly conversation with her once fellow bat-bashers, retreated to her cozy (if not too tight) seat to watch the play fold out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Nymph,\" Talia yawned lazilly, \"I can only assume that you will be seeing a lot more of me soon, my Love has grown quite attached to me as of late.\" she pointed to Harley, who was giggling madly in her sleep.

Ivy tried to ignore this at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Talia started to noisily munch on whatever fattening treat the jester had made for her, the sounds getting on Ivy's nerves. Talia would just grin back at the eco terrorist before resuming her binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPound after pound showed on Talia's frame, the daughter of the demon going from just chubby to plain fat in no time at all. Most of the weight had gone to three areas: her belly, her breasts, and her thighs, contrasting with Ivy's enormous bottom and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally there came a day when Ivy was just minding her own business, lounging on the couch, the remnants of her latest binge around her. She was about to try to exercise yet again when a joyful squeal came from the bathroom. Getting up as best she could, Ivy waddled over to see what the commotion was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red, you'll never believe it! Talia weighs two hundred and eighty pounds now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can believe it,\" Ivy muttered. Harley ignored the comment and resumed fawning over Talia's gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia heard, of course, and that infuriating smirk appeared on her face. Taking Harley's hand, she placed it on her gut, helping Harley to rub it slowly across the pale expanse of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this sight, Ivy stormed out of the room, slamming her door loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley broke away from Talia at the noise and looked back to where her roommate had just been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia, sensing a shift in Harley's attitude, rushed to placate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore her My Love.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley truly felt torn. She did care about Ivy and wanted to check on her on. On the other head, she was just so wowed by Talia that she was just happy to follow her along and do whatever she asked. She had totally not considered the negative of Ivy getting jealous of her feeding Talia and that being Ivy upset with her. She looked at Ivy closed's door back back to Talia's soft fat body with her rounded breasts, big belly, and thick thigh as Talia struck a sexy pose that she knew would drive Harley wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had to give into her lust and she figued it was probably best to allow Ivy to cool down as she got really fiery whens he was upset. Looking at Talia, Harley quickly nodded and said, \"Ya do look lika ya need those donuts. I will be right back with them\" she said before bouncing into the kitchen. Talia watched her go while a smile of satifaction spread across her face. She totally had Harley wrapped around her little finger, completely devoted to her and she loved it. With Ivy not around, Talia made her way over to the couch and sat down on it, groaning a little under her girth but not as much as it did under Ivy's girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley bouenced back from the kitchen carrying the box of a dozen krespme kreme douts. Talia moaned and licked her lips in anticipation. Harley paused for a second when she saw Talia sitting on Ivy's spot on the couch which she knew that Ivy wouldn't like but she assured herself that Ivy wouldn't find out since she was in her room and wouldn't be coming out anytime soon. Ressured by that thought, she made her way back over to the couch, and sat down next to Talia. She opened the box of donuts, pulled it out, and waved it in front of Talia's face teasingly. \"Now feed back and let Harley feed you\" she said cutely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia obediantly laid back against the couch and opened her mouth wide. She closed her eyes and moaned softly as she ate the first donut that Harley fed her, and then another, and another. She was truly in heaven. Her appetite had grown with her body and she needed more food then even to statisfy her. \"More, more\" Talia begged as Harley continued to feed her the donuts. The only time Harley stopped feeding her was when Talia asked her to stop for a breather and so she could lick some of the icing off her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................................ ................................................................................ .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of her room, Ivy could hear a muffled version of the feeding Harley was giving Talia.. She was really surprised to find that she was so jealosu of Harley feeding and fattening Talia but she was. She wanted Harley to only be feeding and fattening her. She was so used to be lusted and devoted to by both men and women that she came to really like and expect it. Due to this, she felt like all attention should always be placed on her and she didn't like Talia taking some of that attention. She felt threatened by Talia but she wasn't sure what to do to get rid of her. She knew she had gone soft pyschically but now she felt like she had gone soft villaness wise too as she couldn't think of a great plan to get rid of Talia when just a short time ago she could do that without anything probelm at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis realization depressed Ivy even more.Ivy was now eating not only because of her huge appetite but to deal with the stress she felt from having letting hereself get so fat and Talia's wrapping Harley around her little finger. The one good news was that  Harley was still continued to pack Ivy's room full of goodies to eat so she would never be without food. Ivy had never been more grateful for this now. She waddled over to her bed, and sat down, the bed groaning under her weight, She reached into the food chest next to her bed which was on the level of her bed, and pulled out a pacakge of oreos. She greedily tore open the package and began stuffing one cookie after the other down her throat, not stopping until she had eaten them all.</span></div></div>",

Instead she was glancing towards the hallway and Ivy's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Love, please don't leave me. I'm so full from all that food and I really need a belly rub,\" Talia said, adding a groan for emphasis and jiggling her huge gut a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tallie, I'll see you later, alright?\" Harley murmured, getting up and heading down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Harley's retreating form with gleaming eyes, Talia gave a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like she would need to withdraw for now but she was confident that her superiority and her growing form would send Harley running back to her eventually. So, she got off the couch, bending over to retrieve her purse, when a loud ripping sound came to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ballooning rear had finally won over her larger pair of pants. But whereas most women would have fretted over this, Talia smirked and patted her steadily growing butt. \"Three hundred pounds here I come,\" Talia said to herself, her smirk widening as she thought about Harley's increased devotion to her once she was that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling her driver, she then waddled out of the apartment, mind already turning over all the possibilities to gain over three hundred pounds before she saw Harley again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley knocked as loud as she dared on Ivy's door, opening it a few moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the room, she saw Ivy's obese frame with her back facing the jester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent Talia home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Ivy turned slightly and looked over at her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...say Red is it okay if I...well...if I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Harley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep with you tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's eyes widened a fraction as she heard this. She knew Harley wasn't bisexual like Ivy herself was so the request was very odd. But she wouldn't mind Harley cuddling up to her as they slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Ivy then moved over as far as she could, her body still taking up over half the bed. Harley smiled brightly and hopped beside her fat roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Harley was cuddled up to Ivy's large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for not being that good of a friend these last few days Red,\" Harley mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'm sorry for storming out on you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright...but do you think, maybe, we could go to a buffet tomorrow? Just the two of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dark, Ivy smiled. \"I'd like that Harley, I really would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley gave a little giggle of joy and slowly rubbed Ivy's stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as both friends fell asleep, contented smiles played on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir friendship was restored.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy dressed herself up nicely, a custom made floral print dress that managed to circumnavigate her immense body frame and cover her almost entirely. Though her belly still hung quite low to the ground, Ivy's superior plant-like physical stature kept her strong enough to waddle awkwardly down the street. Her flabby arms and her flowing side-cleavage was covered by an earthy half jacket that was far too tight on her to zip up. Her purse, though she had found it useless before becoming rich, was wedged between whatever flab covered her the inside of her elbow and rested beside the rest of Ivy's lovehandle. Though it was much harder for the chloropath to get around these days, she reasoned that she could use a day out of the apartment with Harley; ever since Talia came into the picture that's all her hyperactive friend would yammer on about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just like Harley to go on and on about another creep inparticular. Between visits to Arkham, bunking with Ivy, and her own criminal career; Ivy saw the plainly obvious pattern of Harley's abusive partner: the Joker. She would talk about him all the time, had several portraits photos and even mugshots of her precious \"Puddin\" in her room (even now, there was one on her desk despite her claims otherwise) And how did that green-haired lunatic treat the poor girl? Terribly, that's how. And whenever she got dumped, Ivy's door had always been open for Harley to scamper in and wait for him to calm down. The simple thought of those two together made Ivy want to vomit, but her newest \"relationship\" with Talia might have done even worse things to Ivy's near limitless appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough about that, she didn't want to ruin this nice day out with Harley after all. She heaved her mighty bulk through the doorway (even though the Carpenter's rates were a little high, Ivy had to admit that she did great work) After a quick goodbye to her plants, an application of makeup, and lumbering around the apartment to find the heel that had been lost for weeks now, Poison Ivy was ready to go out on the town with her hyperactive best buddy Harl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a secon'!!\" Harley's jersey accent pierced the air, \"Come on, come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy raised an eyebrow; she knew those sounds, they were very familiar. Jumping up and down, angry grunts and desperate pleas? Either Bud and Lou were fighting again, or the unthinkable had happened... \"Harl?\" Ivy wobbled down the hallway uneasilly, nearly losing her delicate balance due to her reinforced high heels, \"You okay?\" she asked, peeking her head into the harlequin's room, \"I heard some-!\" Ivy's face turned a dark viridian at the sight she had just walked in on: Harley Quinn's bare, naked butt presented by her arched back right in her face (rather the doorway, this was the first time Harley didn't expect an audience)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley immediately stopped bounding about the room, her face grew just as red as the tiny red thong that was wedged between her buttcheeks. She smiled sheepishly, \"O-Oh Hey Red!\" she managed between her embarrassment, \"W-What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy slammed the door shut, embarrassed in her own right; something that Harley was grateful for. While she had always been thin and lovely, a star gymnast and a brilliant mind in psychology, and not to mention a self-proclaimed expert in funny business, there was something that she was not used to being: chubby. While the pounds that slowly crept onto her frame were exciting at one point, and she truly enjoyed the feeling of a full belly on more than just other ladies, they were certainly getting out of hand. It was a miracle none the less that she'd only managed to gain twenty pounds or so while working with Ivy, who had gained well over two- maybe(probably) three hundred pounds; but her girlish figure was slowly getting ruined in her fattening pursuits of Talia and Ivy. And sadly she had no clothes to fit a Harley Quinn with an additional fifteen pounds on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jus-Jus Wait out tere for a sec, kay Red?!\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe two women certainly attracted stares. While the initial hype over the rumor that they had given up their lives of crime had long since passed (about the same time that a certain brand of sweets were released), the media had failed to inform Gothamites just how large Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn had become in their recent plight into a much more posh life. Men, women, and children stared in awe as Ivy waddled down the street; a few dared linger a little to long to catch her sight. Harley still pranced about in front of Ivy, but she too was not immune to the inches she had so unwittingly come to harbor, she had to stop her hyperactivity a few times to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Harley was excited at the idea of getting around Gotham with Ivy, a lot had changed since the public had fallen in love with the spored goodies. Where there was once much crime, there was... still a lot of crime, but controlled better by the porky police officers. Men and Women alike had grown to much larger proportions, Harley even caught sight of an overgrown Roxy Rocket trying her best to ride her namesake high above Gotham. Many restraunts now stocked more food than they did liquor, the Iceburg Lounge was a call for fatcats of Gotham to socialize in a swinging club hosted by another reformed criminal of tiny stature. So, maybe things weren't too terribly different, but Gotham wasn't necessarilly so much of a rotten apple as it had been since... well ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy wheezed, \"Slow down Harl!\" she gasped and panted terribly, this much exercise had become foreign to the overfed plant, \"Are you trying to kill- kill me!?\" Harley smiled, \"Not much longer Red, I toldya we shoulda taken teh car.\" Ivy doubled over, she knew the car would have been the smarter choice, but she was desperate to lose some weight; walking may have taken longer, but it might help with her unsightly pounds and inches. Besides, if they took the car Harley would have to drive: Ivy's big flabby apron of a stomach jammed the steering wheel, and she'd seen how Harley drove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy couldn't help but notice, as she remain doubled over on the sidewalk, just how big Harley's butt had gotten; undeniably large. It flared out as if for attention, thighs jutting out to compete with her glute. Ivy's eye widened, Harley was getting <i>fat!</i> How did she not notice this earlier... it must have been all that time she was spending alone these past few weeks. Again something that made Ivy question about her hyperactive friend, why would she gain weight with her new \"friend\". She suspected that Harley was attracted to Talia long before, her suspicions confirmed weeks ago, but apparantly a fattening relationship was a two-way street. The green woman giggled at the sight of Harley's plump tush testing the confines of her new jean shorts, several sizes larger than the \"normal\" Quinn would have worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd best of all? It was daytime. No bats to ruin anything at all! Of course, they had nothing to worry about <i>now</i> but when you've been punched in the face by a man so many times, a certain animousity builds up. Harley giggled madly as she escort her heavy friend through doorway of the Elliot Lounge (a favor from the Wayne foundation and named for \"deceased\" Tommy Elliot, Tam Fox had \"seen the light\" regarding how wonderful Anonymous Sweets were and convinced Lucius to invest in a lounge that featured them) and was quickly escorted beside her to one of the many reinforced seats in the VIP section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope yer hungry!\" Harley squealed as she pat Ivy's tummy</span></div></div>",

At first she couldn't help but feel some jealously as it seemed like Harley was flirting with not only the growing Talia but now the growing Selina. She took a moment to calm herself down and then saw Harley help up Selina and the two girls began walking over to the table. She couldn't help but giggle a little as she heard Selina tell her waiter to bring the food over to their (Harley and Ivy's tabel). She then saw Harley bounced back over to the table. \"I hope ya don't mind Red but I invited Selina to join us as she looked so sad\" she said as she gestured to the waiter to bring over a reinforced chair for Selina which he did. How could be be mad at Harley for being so sweet and friendly to a fellow female villaness who was currently not too happy. \"No, I don't mind\" Ivy replied honestly with a smile. She was fine with having Selina join them and maybe she could have some fun with her to get back at Harley and make her jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short trip over to the table had winded Selina and she had to take a moment to catch breather before sitting down at the table. The food had already beaten her there and was waiting for her. She then took a seat on the chair, once her again her butt filling it up, and the chair groaing under her weight. \"Thank you for letting me join you\" Selina said. She was not used feeling gratitude towards the two but tonight she did. \"No problem. We couldn't let you eat alone. It's more fun to stuff your face with someone\"Harley replied with a giggle, trying to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina allowed herself to smile a little. In her husky voice Ivy replied, \"You looked so sad Selina. What's wrong?\" she asked with genuine curousity even though she had a good idea why. Since she was wanting ot be sweet, she didn't think it would sound so good to say your upset because Bruce Wayne dumped you. Ivy resumsed eating as she waited for Harley's reply. She could only refrain herself from eating for so long, especially with delicious food in front of her. As much as she tried to lose weight, Ivy was beginning to come to realize that she may be a fatty from now on. \"Well... as you probably have heard. Bruce Wayne recently broke up with me and started dating Wonder Woman. If she hadn't gained any weight, I don't think I would be as upset, I wouldn't blame him for dumping me because I got fat but she got fat too so it hurts that he dumped me for her.\" Selina said before starting to sob which immediately lead her to start stuffing her face again. It was almost like the old saying you don't know what you have until it's gone but until Bruce had broken up with her, Selina hadn't realized just how much she liked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I'm sorry hun. I know how that fells\" Harley said, tried to console Selina but glad to see her pigging out on her food to deal with it. She was really enjoying seeing Ivy, Selina, and Talia all continue to blow up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too hun. Men just aren't worth the trouble. They don't always understand you and will break your heart. You are better off with a women who does understand you and won't break your heart. She will admire you no matter waht\" Ivy said flirtiously, laying on the charm. If Harley was going to have fun with Talia, then she was going to have fun with Selina. \"I could be that woman\" Ivy purred seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina stopped eating and a smile spread across her face. \"You may have just convinced me. I have never seen you have relationship problems with other women. You may be on to something\" she said. She paused before continuing, \"Okay, I will give it a try with you\". Then a devilish smile spread across her face, \"I do have one condition and that is I don't want to be the heavier one in the relationship so I get to fatten you up as much as I want\". Not only did she not want to be the fatter one and felt better about her gain if Ivy was fatter then her, but also she found Ivy really pretty fat and wanted to see her get fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her pretty little jaw fell slack, unable to do much more than hang there as the women flirted with eachother across the table! Harley wouldn't have it, Selina damn sure wasn't a lesbian, at least as far as Harley could place, and she wasn't <i>about</i> to step in on the incredibly fattening relationship the clown-clad Harley Quinn had worked so hard to forge with Ivy! She had to step in to stop it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley began to giggle nervously, \"Ehehe- Come on Kitty, don'tcha think you've had enuff ta drink?\" she took the cocktail glass from in front of the well-fed Selina Kyle, \"I mean- I mean, don't exactly jump ship <i>yet</i>!\" she tipped the glass up to her own lips, hoping to dispose of it quickly, \"Tere's pleny'a great fish-<b>male</b> fish- out there for ya!\" This only recieved slightly mixed responses, leaving both Ivy and Kyle confused as to regards of Harley's sexual position.\"But Harl, aren't <b>you</b> dating Talia?\" Selina turned her head slightly to face the harlequin, still taking time to shovel some lobster past her full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harley began to persperate, she wasn't quite sure exactly where she stood with Talia beyond her personal caterer, belly masuese, and the pet name \"Love\", but her less than heterosexual attraction to the demon's ever-growing daughter was apparantly a lot more obvious than she thought. \"W-Well no, but- but-\" a reflex, she started to panic, \"Who wants sushi?!\" she grabbed at the nearest thing in an apron and called for more seafood; which both of her bloated buddies couldn't object to. Though, that didn't stop Ivy's flirtatious advances on the fatty formerly known as Catwoman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had accomplished her mission for today's little outing, and Ivy was rivetted in a strange sort of way that Harley was a little more than jealous at a potential relationship between her and another person (let alone another woman), she couldn't exactly drop the subject entirely; albeit with a little toning down. Throughout the second, third, and fourth courses over her own meal Ivy reduced her advances to a few sexy little wiggles of her portly fingers, a few discrete comments using words too big for Harley to understand while Kyle was distracted, and even a wink to hold the tide. Enough to fuel Harley's jealousy yet keep the subject subdued; it was perfect.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Oof- I am so stuffed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the general opinion at the Quinn-Isely-Kyle party of three at VIP table 4. Between the three of them they managed to completely stock the table full of plates, all covered in debris from a meal that the girls would surely remember. Individually, each woman had passed her limits regarding her appetite (some more than others) and truly tested the limits of their ensombles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked down at her plate ashamedly, rather she looked down in the general position of where she thought her plate would be. After all, she had long lost the ability to see past her ample busom and many jelly rolls and had only stretched said rolls with today's impeccable meal. With some struggle, she brought her fingers to the peak of her stomach, \"Ugh... look at me, I'm huge.\" she jostled her own fleshy apron of flab for emphasis, \"Its no wonder Bruce- oh... poor combination of words.\" she said sadly. Some part of her wished for something other than the truth. She lived in a crazy world, right; anything could have happened! Clones, shapeshifters, rubber masks; Hell that could have been Thomas Elliot parading around with Bruce's face again- she had no idea of knowing the truth! But alas, she had to deal with the cards she was dealt. The fact of the matter was that Bruce Wayne's official date to the charity was <i>Wonder Woman</i>; leaving Selina Kyle alone, fat, and ready for some comfort food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley reached over her own distendeded stomach to huggle the poor woman's belly, \"Aw don't fret Kitty!\" she giggled, \"Rich Boy doesn't know what he's missin'!\" Ivy cooed, \"Come on Hun, you have to know it was only a publicity stunt.\" she reasoned, attempting to massage her gullet's own apex only to find that she had grown just a little too fat to mimic her black-haired friend. \"I mean, think about it, what's better for the papers than a millionaire dating a superhero?\" she burped, \"Nothing, that's what.\" Harley nodded in the direction of her corpulant chloropathic friend, \"Yeah, a publicity stunt an' nothin' more!\" Selina looked up from her own apidose with a hopeful look in her eye, \"You think so?\" she asked, unusually downtrodden. Her former rivals simply smiled sweetly at their newfound friend, \"I know so.\" Ivy leaned forward slightly, \"After all, who would dump <i>you</i> for Wondertramp?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, two reactions took place; Selina's confidence in her appearance had been replaced ever so slightly, and Harley Quinn huffed and ordered another drink.</span></div></div>",

I'd like to join you guys on whatever you have planned today,\" Selina said after several quiet moments of digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy smiled warmly at that, Harley offering a small smile that didn't seem quite genuine, though Selina was far more focused on Ivy's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, together, the three growing Gotham Sirens left the buffet, calorie-laden bellies sated as they moved on towards the upscale shopping district. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina stayed close to Ivy as they waddled their way through, Harley following after with a sullen look on her face, every now and then tugging at her pants that were getting a little too tight for the jester's liking. She was gaining weight and was watching as Ivy gained a new partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to hook up with Talia and make Ivy jealous of her once more. Though a part of Harley did feel like she deserved the treatment Ivy was giving her at the moment. But a darker part wanted to force her plant loving friend's attention on her and only her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina, for her part, cuddled up to Ivy more and more with each store they went into. The two larger women were still able to find clothes even in their corpulent sizes as the high end clothing stores increased their sizes in order to meet the needs of their weightier clientele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such member of Gotham's high society caught Ivy's eye as the woman was exiting a botique. She had red hair as well, a shade darker than Pamela's own, and striking green eyes. Her weight was mostly centered around her double chin, her mammoth butt cheeks, and the round orb she called a stomach. But though she had to weigh at least twice Harley's current weight, she managed to still look ravishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" Ivy asked Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked at the person she was referring to before talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Kate Kane, she's some rich daughter of a general's or something. Old money and throws some wonderful parties. Why, did you want to go to one together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in the future but let's continue shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina nodded and they continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the three managed to make their way back to Harley and Ivy's apartment, they were sweating heavily. Well Selina and Ivy were, Harley had just worked up a little sweat. Lowering their big butts onto the groaning couch, Ivy looked at Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, be a dear and fix us some of your lovely pastries, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley wanted to say no but then she remembered that this is what she wanted. Ivy and Selina, both larger than Talia and getting bigger, pigging out in front of her. Sure she wouldn't exactly be doing the feeding but she could still observe the pounds packing onto them in all the right spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Red! Hope you're starving cause I'm making a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in another, more mysterious part of Gotham...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee Montoya, former GCPD but now the superhero The Question, watched the dying sunset from her tiny apartment. One hand held a donut while the other was holding a file stuffed with various articles and photos. All were related to the recent ballooning of Gotham's citizens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of stuffed, Renee thought to herself, finishing her donut and rubbing her formerly trim belly. The detective was now one hundred pounds heavier than she was in the past. Her once trim abs were covered in quite the beer gut. Bigger than Bullock's, if Renee had to guess and she didn't even want to think about how much bigger her butt was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her weight was a topic for later. Now...now was the time for The Question to make her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter applying her blank slate of a face, she put on her blue jumper, taking one last glance into the mirror before heading out into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd get to the bottom of this mystery and then work herself back into her former shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, however, she had some questions to solve...</span></div></div>",

She had to admit that she hadn't only done it to get Harley's attention back, she also did it because she wanted to. She was loving gaining weight and wanting to get fatter which is why she loved Harley feeding her and helping her to gain more weight. She had been pleasantly surprised by how it was not hard for her to get up to 300 pounds. She had given herself a strict diet of fast food and Harley' s pastries with milk and soda to drink and that is all she had been eating lately. She had also stayed in bed the whole day during this time, only getting up to use the bathroom and shower once a day. Her food was brought to her and she would just read, watch tv, or listen to musuic as she ate. She also would nap quite a bit too. She had really enjoyed these past few lazy weeks but it was time to get out and see Harley again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple of weeks of inactivy and her weight gain had made Talia even more out of shape and she could go even less further without getting winded. She was so grateful that the apartment building that Harley and Ivy lived in had an elevator as she would never be able to make up up the stairs. Even with the elevator, the short trip from there to Harley and Ivy's door left her winded. This both surprised and pleased her. She took a moment ot catch her breathe before knocking on the door. \"Harley! Ivy! Open up, it's Talia\" she called. The weight she had gained continued to spread out nicely and evenly over her body. Her breasts were now e cup, they were still, soft nice, round, and perky. Her belly had gotten bigger and was sticking out more. Her hips had widen some more. Her thighs were really thick and rubbing together when she walked more. Her butt was huge though it was still round and soft. Her clothes were stretched very tight by her body, especially the top by her breasts and belly and the patns by her butt and thighs. She was careful not to move awkardly or bend over as she had no doubt that her clothes would once again rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia smiled as she heard someone walk over to the door, unlock, it, and open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rather than Harley answering the door, as Talia would have preferred,  the fatter woman of the household answered the doorbell. Immediately both women scowled at eachother, equally unhappy to meet eachother's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nymph.\" Talia hissed as she leaned in slightly, her breasts pushing upwards and expressing not only her utter disdain for her adversary, but also her double chin as the flab was condensed by the pressure of her tight sweater. \"Talia.\" Ivy replied just as coldly, putting her hands on her generously padded thighs arbitrarilly, as if daring Talia to act on the rivalry she <i>knew</i> was there. Both of their eyes narrowed, Talia slowly waddling her way into the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where is my Love?\" she asked, making herself comfortable without the larger woman's consent. Talia acknowledged a pajama'd Selina Kyle who had placed herself nonchalantly on the couch, flabby arm resting on the back and her legs kicked up; apparantly she had interrupted a social visit between the two, not that Talia cared much about irking Ivy. The bulbous brunette lounged on the loveseat, as was her usual during her visits. Selina looked at Talia with wide eyes, already acquainted with the tension between the two fueding fatties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out shopping,\" Ivy said curtly, wobbling back over to her own seat on the couch, \"I got lonely so I invited Selina over; <i>she</i> has the courtesy to wait until someone invites her.\" Lazilly the queen-sized Ivy plops back down on the couch, both visiting women took note of the reinforced wood splintering underneath Ivy's momentum; Talia smirked at this development as she pieced what had <b>really</b> happened. Judging that Selina was in her pajamas, rather than her usual (if not somewhat awkward) elegance, Talia could guess that Selina stayed over last night. She was in her pajamas, but she still had on her makeup; either she was vain enough to apply eyeliner, blush, mascara, and lipstick just to lounge around Ivy's place or she had accidently stayed too late the night before and changed into a pair of jammies slightly too small to fit Ivy's general expanse. The two were getting friendly, in short; but rather than be completely insufferable, Talia simply kept her mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, apparantly the Nymph's gluttony is contagious, eh?\" Talia's accent remained as elegant as usual, even as she insulted her former rival for Bruce Wayne's affection, \"You are wearing her... eh whatdoyoucallthose... \"PJ's\"?\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nHarley Quinn sighed heavilly as she fiddled with the elevator key, between all the plastic bags and the small plastic card something was going to have to give. Finally she managed to get it right, taking a few more minutes to unwedge the cardkey from the slot. It was tiring work feeding Ivy and Selina, who had been over quite a few times this past week. And because she was so chipper and cheery and supplied the buffet line with goodies every Sunday, the nice little girl in reception got the bellhops to help her with groceries; almost as incompetant with their own heavy loads as Harley, they always left the bags outside the apartment instead of putting them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley plod into the elevator, too tired to even turn back (missing a very heavy Renee Montoya in her uniform questioning said nice little girl behind the counter) and rest her head on the cold metal siding. \"Phew!\" she whistled, \"I am <i>beat!</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours had passed since she had left Ivy and Selina alone in her happy home, something she did quite begrudingly. She had found a new friend in \"Kitty\", a friend who she occassionally caught making goo-goo eyes with Ivy. She didn't like it, those were <i>her</i> eyes to goo-goo, after all. To be perfectly honest, she never expected Selina to grow so \"attached\" to Ivy, but then again she never expected either one of them to grow quite as fat as either one did. Selina was almost as big as Ivy now, just a couple of stones away from matching the engorged growing plantopath pound for pound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley shuddered at the thought, fantasy interrupted by the elevator's weak 'ding', sounding that Harley and her cargo had reached their floor. With another groan, Harley hauled herself off of the wall and down the hall (her room wasn't hard to spot, it was the one before the secure blockade of white plastic bags) Again, she fiddled with the exact same card key that simply refused to work for her today. She could hear the muffled television through the solid wood door, Ivy liked to keep loud. Opening the door, she wasn't suprised to see the bloated form of Ivy, still in her PJs, and Catwoman, also in Ivy's PJ's, but dropped her bags at the unexpected occupant of the loveseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TALLIE!!\" she squealed, prancing past the kitchen's linoleum, a few more steps on the hardwood of the living room, and lunged at Talia's sprawled out, round form. She landed smack dab on the top of Talia, her face in between her neck and her breasts, nestling herself in lovingly, \"I missed you- oh, you're so soft!\" Talia only gave the snarkiest look possible to Ivy, a proud sneer on her face at the obvious favoritism, and then began to coddle Harley. \"Oh Love, how I have missed you!\" she layed her accent thick, \"How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible!\" Harley pouted playfully, \"I've been so lonely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked over to Ivy, \"And what are we, kitty litter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ignore it.\" Ivy huffed as she crossed her arms, a little difficult navigating her hanging armfat over her generous busom, \"That's what I do...\" In her desperation, Ivy shoved the nearest thing that look tasty into her mouth and chewed loudly to drown out the fawning, oohing and awing coming from the opposite side of the room. She stopped when she heard Talia's incredibly haughty laughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, she <i>is</i> a piggy, isn't she, Love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Harley managed to put away all of the grocieries, storing quite a lot in Mrs. Katrowskie's fridge downstairs...</span></div></div>",

No lettuce was on the sandwich, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a big bite, Selina moaned as the food slid down her throat and quickly brought the food to Ivy's mouth as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, ORMHF, our...mmmmm....agreement,\" Selina said, still eating and talking all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy nodded, making sure to take larger bites than the fat cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember but I don't think it'll be enough. You're catching up to me fast, Kitten.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked down then, taking in her large frame, and back to Ivy's vast body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...not all agreements are kept, right?\" Selina finally said, a seductive smile on her face. Ivy nodded once more, before reaching into another bag and feeding Selina several donuts at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe feeding wouldn't be so bad, Ivy thought to herself as she watched Selina start to gorge. And if Ivy was being completely honest with herself the sight of Selina's voracious appetite lit up something inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, with Harley and Talia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love...urp...oh my, excuse me,\" Talia groaned out, rubbing her belly. Harley had started her stuffing as soon as they heard the door shut and Talia's increased gluttony had already decimated an entire platter of nachos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Tallie,\" Harley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia grinned at that and motioned towards one of the plastic bags on the coffee table. Nodding, Harley turned around and started rummaging for more food. As she did so Talia got a glimpse of Harley's bigger butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" she said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something Tallie?\" Harley asked, turning back around to face Talia, hands filled with ice cream bars and twinkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my Love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's eyes gleamed then and she shoved a few twinkies straight into Talia's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavoring the treat, Talia started to rub her belly some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis will grow more and more, Talia thought.

Harley complied with somewhat mixed feelings; she wanted to fondle Talia's taut tummy, but... it <i>was</i> about three in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia and her voracious appetite had eaten away at her time together with Harley, not that the time wasn't well spent. Together, but mostly on the brunette's end of the deal, the two had consumed many, many of the freshly bought groceries that the chipper jester had worked so hard to lug into the apartment and loaded them into her guest's awaiting maw; leaving her bloated, dazed, and sore. \"Mmm<i>faster</i>!\" she bellows, Harley can only go at her stomach in a relatively sleepy pace. Quinn's poor arms were sore as sore could be from all of the monotonous movements, her cheeks hurt from her widening grin (a first) and worst of all, she was <i>tired</i>. All Talia wanted to do, rather than sleep, was get a tummy massage. Surely she couldn't deny Talia one last belly rub, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expertise fingers danched over Talia's many rolls, though they were stuffed to a much more spherical shape by this point, and massaged at a rather slow pace for fear of upsetting Talia's delicate equalibreum. And while she was doing a great job at it, Talia was still eager for more pleasure. \"Mm<b>more</b>!!\" she arched her back, lifting her stomach farther into the air (and thereby a bit of Harley) in her pleasure, her toes curled, her eyes squinched shut. \"Oh!!\" she moaned again, feeling a great pressure on her stomach, \"L-Love, whatareyou-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled past her weak neck to see Harley, tossed over lazilly on Talia's stomach snoozing peacefully. Her adorable snoring was quiet, though comically designed to fit her insane jester motif. Talia cooed, but then winced in pain, \"Love, get up.\" she hissed , \"Get up get up, <i>get up!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, just down the hall and to the left (or, to the room with flora sprouting from the crack of the door) there was no moaning, there was no whining, and there was no groping. Unlike their counterparts in the other room, Selina and Ivy's relationship didn't <i>need</i> food in order to work... it just helped. Selina Kyle's heavy breathing and whimpering did little to upset the ever-watching plants. Ivy found it cute, she did all she could to help by cuddling up to her Big Kitty. \"Oh, Kitten, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile one of the \"conditions\" of their relationship was that Ivy be the heavier one out of the two, that surely didn't stop Selina from making a glutton of herself. While Ivy could probably have handled cookies, chips, cupcakes, about four loaves of bread, mayonaise, peanut butter, and two boxes of cereal (and an accidental lightup toy inside one calorie-filled breakfasttime meal  that had to be heimlich'd out of her) far better than Selina could have, the latter of the two insisted on eating to her heart's content; which just so happened to be a lot and left Ivy with bare satiation levels... still a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she answered meekly, vision blurry, \"I think... I think I'm gonna puke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy cuddled closer, \"Aw... poor baby\" she cooed, \"You want a Tums?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy reached over to the bottle of antacids she kept by her bed for her own indigestion and popped a few into Kitty's mouth. \"Better?\" she rubbed Selina's stomach lovingly, \"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one were to take a look at the sorry state of Selina Kyle, they would notice that not only was she fighting off vomit,  but also that she was fighting Ivy for space on her bed. The two flabby furies took up almost all of the bed with their accumulative apidose. \"Scoot... scoot over?\" Kyle asked weakly. \"I don't think so.\" Ivy said in a sultry tone, \"You need a tummy rub.\" The fat green goddess hefted the upper half of her body up and gave the engorged socialitte a pathetic massage, ignoring strange creaking noises that emenated from underneath the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... urp... no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Ivy teased, \"Your big belly, its churning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babies, come, turn your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"urp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, beneath the heavy load laid on top of it, the bedframe cracked in clean in half. The two fatties on top went folded along with the matress, forcing Selina's stomach to meet her chest painfully. \"Oh!!\" she and Ivy screamed in unison, now falling with the latter half of the matress to the hard wood floor. Ivy, breathing heavilly from excitement and fear, turned to Catwoman. \"Well... I guess we should keep this matress on the floor then?\" Selina let out a huge, monster belch that shook the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy pinched her nose, \"Ew. That was gross.\" she said stoicly, \"Feel better, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much.\" <br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nIn her apartment, Renee Montoya sat at her desk. That's all she had been doing all night, sitting at her desk and going over her case report. Inside of the manilla folder, besides some papers stained with chocolate frosting and crumbs from the corresponding donut, held photos that charted the growing weights of several prominent members of Gotham. She grumbled, scratching her lowermost chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped on Kate Kane, former lover and sociallite. She watched, unblinking, as her weight climbed from photo to photo. \"What's the link...\" she massaged her masked temples with a gloved hand, \"There has to be a link...\". She knew the facts; the expansion of Gotham started at the top, the richest people in Gotham were surely the fattest. Perhaps she could start there, investigation through the air ducts to see what she could observe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not...\" the latina mumbled, hidden eyes travelling down to catch her gut pressing outwards in her seated position; wriggling through the ducts was a job for someone much lighter than her. Maybe she could climb the walls of Wayne Manor at the next... no, that involved lifting her bulky body around a little too much for comfort. \"maldito...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Question sighed, forced into a last resort. \"Maybe... I'll see if Kate won't take me.\" she grumbled, defeated.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three weeks had passed since Talia and Selina had been stuffed nearly beyond their capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis capacity increased as the weeks came and went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beds and furniture continued to groan under the strain of the three ballooning women and slowly gaining jester. Luckily Ivy soon grew tired of that and had the furniture reinforced to handle almost any weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the furniture problem solved Ivy and Harley resumed stuffing Selina and Talia whenever they could. Of course Ivy ate her own large share and Harley snacked on what she could as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these events led to the moment almost upon them: the weigh in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies, time to weigh up!\" Harley shouted after lunch had been digested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia got up from the love-seat, her jiggling belly and rear causing Harley to swoon at the sight. Walking or waddling as the case may be, Talia made her way onto the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digital readout flashed a bit before finally stopping at a number: 350 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking at Ivy, Talia hugged Harley and thanked her with a large smooch on the cheek. Harley sighed in pleasure as Talia's fat breasts were pressed against her and she wrapped her arms around her as far as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was next, the plant lover tugging at her tighter clothes as she ambled her way over to the scale. Sparing a quick glance at Selina, she got on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the numbers flashed: 400 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's been neglecting their greens,\" Selina joked, waddling behind Ivy as she stepped off the scale. Ivy just gave her lover an amused smile and added an extra sway to her massive hips as she moved off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina then stepped on and Ivy flashed back to the skinny thief she had first met. Her lithe form filling out her leather suit to perfection. What a change she had gone through. Selina now boasted three chins, an ass larger than Ivy's, and a belly just as large. To say nothing of Selina's sweater puppies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale doled out it's verdict: 430 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's eyes went wide. \"I'm...the fattest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not so bad once you get used to it,\" Ivy said, coming over to Selina's side and giving her a sensuous kiss. \"Besides your ass doesn't look that big in those pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Selina chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nymph I hope you like being skinnier than someone else because soon enough you'll weigh less than I do,\" Talia cut in. Ivy glared at her rival for Harley's attention but found she didn't want to start a big fight so soon after lunch. And maybe she could talk Selina into chowing down on some donuts while they waited for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job you three! You're so big now, it's just wonderful!\" Harley said, jumping up and down. It was while she was doing this that her  belly flopped out, the gut, for that was what it now was, causing her shirt to ride up her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley blushed at that but Talia just gave an airy giggle of her own and ran a hand along Harley's increased paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love, we're not done with this weigh in just yet. You need to see how much you've gained as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Tallie, I'm going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley got on and watched as the numbers settled on her weight: 189 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia beamed as the number came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the fat life, my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, at O'Riley's pub...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee stared at her former lover as she moved her bulk next to her on the stool, the wood creaking under Kate Kane's massive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for meeting with me Kate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Renee. You've been enjoying your donuts it seems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I actually want to ask you something. About...well it's about how fat you've gotten. I think there's something sinister behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate chuckled at that and rubbed her belly as she ordered some pretzels and a beer from the bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paranoid much? Can't a girl pack on some pounds in peace or does everything have to have an ulterior motive where you're concerned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee sighed and placed her right hand over Kate's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate please help me. Once I solve this I can lose all this flab and you can dazzle the blue blood's again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I don't dazzle them now? But fine, I'll help you Renee. But can you do something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" Renee agreed, not liking the gleam in Kate's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's binge right here, right now. Then I'll answer whatever questions you have, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee nodded, sparing a glance towards the empty plate of nachos she had already consumed along with the two beers next to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate grinned and soon enough her own massive plate of pretzels was placed before her, covered in melted cheese. Renee ordered a few more beers as well as two more plates of nachos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had better be worth it, Renee thought to herself as she watched Kate start to munch on the pretzels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As more time passed, Ivy found herself iching to back into crime. It was not that she was not enjoying fattening Selina up and having Selina fattening her up in return, she was, but she was finding herself missing the thrill of crime. Thanks to Harley's treats, they weren't lacking for money, but there was just something so fun about stealing money. There was some rush of excitement that came along with it. Her and Selina's continued growth was something that she wanted to continue but she also wanted to get some crime in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their expanded sizes, Ivy knew that neither herself nor Selina were in any shape to commit any crimes. Selina was no longer the lith cat theif who could slide in and out of homes gracefully to commit her robberries and as for herself, she was just too fat and out of shape move fast enough to commit a crime. Of course Talia was in no shape to be committing crimes. Harley was the only one of the four of them who was still thin enough and in good enough shape to commit a crime and even she was not as quick as she once was. Ivy didn't think that she could tear Harley away from Talia long enough to commit a crime. Though she was faced with these challenges, Ivy was not ready to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy and Selina were sitting on Ivy's now reienced for bed, eaching working on a eating a pint of cookie dough ice cream. Knowing that Selina had as crafty a mind as she did, she thought she would ask her for some advice on how to achieve a new robbery. \"I've got this drive to commit another crime Selina. It's been so long since I last stole some money. I know that we are both no longer in shape to commit a crime but maybe we could mastermind one, and get someone else to do it for some cut of the money. What do you think?\" Ivy asked Selina in between bites of her ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I totally understand that drive for crime again. I am feeling it too. I would prefer we commit the robbery ourselves but you are right that we are not in the shape for that. Masteringmind the crime and getting someone else to do it is the way we have to go. Where were you thinking of robbing?\" Selina asked. \"One of the banks in twon\" Ivy said with a mischevious smile. \"Well robbing banks was never my forte but I do know of someone who would be up to that task\" Selina said. \"Who?\" Ivy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Circe\" Selina said. \"The witch?\" Ivy asked in surprise. \"Yeah. I know she doesn't strike you as someone to rub a bank but with her magic she could easily rob a bank and since she is not as interseted in money then it is likely she will take a smaller take.  \"I think all of that is great but do you think that she will do it? I mean she might not see much in it for her other than the small cut of the money that she gets\" Ivy points out. \"I think she would just enjoy the new challenge, getting to hurt some men as she loves to kill them, and just the sense of power she will get from the men not being able to stop her\" Selina replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I say it's worth a shot. Give her a call and see if she will do it\" Ivy said and Selina nodded her head in agreement.</span></div></div>",

Spying Ivy long before Harley did, Talia shot a smirk her rival's way before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Love, we have a visitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley stopped her tickling then and turned around, seeing Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Red, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time to get back into crime. Obviously not physically as we're all much larger women since the last time we did anything bad.\" Talia nodded at this, brushing her hand against her large ass and belly. \"But that doesn't mean we can't orchestrate the crimes. We just need some grunt work. Maybe from a certain someone's private army of killers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Talia was intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I could help in this endeavor. But I expect more than half the reward, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy locked eyes with Talia, the two not speaking for several moments before nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, it seems some of that fat you carry went to your brain as well.\" Ivy glared then and Talia was about to continue when Harley spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tallie, that was mean! Apologize right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy and Talia's eyes were both wide open at the jester's sudden outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course my love. I'm sorry Pamela, it was a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted,\" Ivy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the squeak of a wheel rubbing against the floor rang out and Selina appeared pushing an enormous cart laden with all kinds of unhealthy foods. And all were free of plant ingredients as per Ivy's wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're agreed, let's binge and get to planning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy, Harley, and Talia nodded.</span></div></div>",

She blushed a little hearing the chair groan underneath her girth. She whiped a beat of sweat off her forehead before leaning over for one of the pastries and eagerly digging in. Ivy, Harley, and Talia all did the same.  Ivy, Selina, and Talia all trully pigged out on the pastries, stuffing bite after bite down their throst unable to stop. Harley didn't let herself loose control as she wanted the other girls to eat most of the food so they would grow some more. After Harley got her fill, she got up and brought over each girl a glass of milk and kept reilling it as they drank sips of it down in between bites of their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, the ladies finished eating all of the cart on the food. After they each ate the last bite of their last pastry, they washed it down with the rest of their glass of milk. Harley then surveyd the girls. Selina was laying back in her chair, moaning softly as she gently rubbed her huge bloated belly. She had at first been a little resistant to gaining weight but had eventually given in when she realized how much she loved the pastries and pigging out.  She had given up on ever trying to exercise and loose this weight as it seemed very unlikely that she would ever be able to. \"Such a good fatty kitty\" Harley giggled as she gently patted and rubbed Selena's belly causing her (Selina) to pur as she enjoyed the belly rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the couch lay an equally stuffed Talia. Her head was laying back on the couch pillow and her feet was propped up. She lay there, moaning in stuffed exctasy as she rubbed her bloated belly with one hand while smoking a cigerette in the other hand. In addition to eat more, Talia had been smoking and drinking alot more as well and was really getting out of shape. Never had she been more grateful to have servants who she could get to do things for her and brings things to her so she could remain lazy. She was also growing a bit more appreciative to Harley who was alsovery happy to wait on her hand and food. Harley moved over and then gently and patted Talia's belly. She was so proud of herself for helping Talia to get so fat. \"You are eating so well Tally\" Harley giggled to Talia. \"Thank you\" I know Talia purred in a seductive tone with a matching smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was laying back on the other chair, moaning softly as she rubbed her own very bloated belly.Like with Selina and Talia, her belly was pushing out and rolling her shirt up revealing a fair amount of her green skin. She had slowly come to the realization that she loved stuffing her face and couldn't stop. She enjoyed being lazy, just sitting around relaxing and eating. She found it just too addicting and nice to quit. She wanted to get back into crime, but only so far as to plan it and get some of the money but she didn't no longer want to be the one on the field. She rather just continue to sit around on her well padded butt relaxing and eating. Harley then finally moved over to Ivy.  She was so pleased by how fat she had made Ivy and how good the extra pounds look on her. \"Ya like so beautiful Red\" Harley smiled as she gently patted and rubbed Ivy's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Talia spoke again. \"I am too stuffed and tired to concentrate on coming up with a plan right now. Could I take a nap first and then we do it after?\" she asked. \"I could use a catnap myself\" Selina nodded. \"I think taking a nap and then doing the planning after would be best as I am too tired and stuffed to concentrate myself\" Ivy agreed. \"I could use some tuns though to settle my stomach\" Talia said before taking one last puff of her cigerette and putting it on in the ash bowl. \"Sure, I will get a tums for each of you\" Harley said before bouncing into the kitchen with Ivy, Selina, and Talia watching how Harley's bigger butt jiggled more as she did so. Harley then returned with a tums and a glass of water for each of the girls who took the tums and water before quickly falling into a stuffed induced slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley surved the three sleeping fat beauties. Sweet and fattening dreams ladies she thought to herself with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the first time since her first incarceration in Arkham, Harley Quinn was happy with her life and what she had made of it. Sure the good life cost her a once killer figure, but the sacrifice proved well worth it. Honestly, Harley hadn't been quite this happy in a long time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while she loved her friends dearly, like sisters almost, she wasn't about to let things go sour because they had gotten too used to the posh life and seeked out a cheap thrill that none of them needed. She had compromised plenty enough for her friends; putting up with Talia's smoking, turning the other cheek for Selina's kitty ornaments in the kitchen, and Lord knows how many meals she'd cooked for Ivy. Wasn't she entitiled to a little comfort? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she darent say it aloud. Since her career started as a henchwench, Harley had always been a bit of a doormat (sometimes literally) for her \"friends\" and \"cohorts\" and \"Puddin\", and she knew they wouldn't listen to her. However, there was one thing about her that all three of them cared equally about: her culinary talents. Maybe a good meal or two would keep them out of trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky harlequinn looked up from the oven; her personal taste testers all asleep in their favorite spots. Selina stuffed into a chair that hugged her lovehandles so tight that they swell over the flanks, her head tilted down lazilly and pressing her secondary chins into her chest. Talia tossed casually onto the reinforced daybed so that her head was supported by a pillow and one flabby forearm, letting the other fall over her huge hooters that fought eachother for room in her tight lavender turtleneck. And Ivy on the couch, gut falling over the cushions and plump fingers itching to rub it.

She rubbed her eyes with chubby fingers as she awoke to the sight of Harley slowly lowering a skewer of swedish meatballs into her girlfriend's mouth, the corpulant Catwoman drooling eagerly at Harley's little game. \"H-Harley?\" Ivy's voice was husky and groggy, \"Selina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Red!\" Harley beamed as she slid the meat off of the skewer and into Selina's awaiting mouth, \"Ya hungry, I got all kinds'a food ready for ya!\" True enough, there was a lot of empty takeout meals left as debris of a truely epic meal. \"Well, dere might be a lil left...\" the tubby clown grabbed at a box of chinese food, \"in <i>here</i>... nope, my mistake.\" she giggled as she pat Selina's tummy, \"Tallie an' Kitty got a little hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of burning flint and tobacco brought Ivy's attention to the stuffed Talia, lighting up a smoke after an apparantly huge meal. In her sausage-like finger was a lit cancer stick, worked with suprising expertise despite the size of her digits. \"Oh...\" she burped, \"excuseme.\" Ivy, still groggy, let out a polite \"yer excused...\" before scratching her tummy. \"You didn't save any for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Flowerchild, Harley kinda stuffed it into us on the spot.\" Selina pat her stomach, \"You know, I forget what we were talking about before we all took our little nap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were discussing,\" the bloated viridian woman yawned, \"We were discussing our plans for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some cookies Red?\" Harley cut her off quickly, \"Chocolate Chip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please, thanks Harl.\" Ivy paused, \"Anyway, it was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frosting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks Harley.\" she sounded a little annoyed, \"Now anywa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean marzipan, Love, we finished off the rest of the \"frosting\"...\" Talia chimed in a rather husky correction, \"In the top cabinet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Anyway</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean,\" Selina pat her chest to settle a growing case of indigestion, \"You mean the top left, top cabinet is the spice cabinet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, tanks Kitty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy huffed, falling back down to the couch defeated by the constant interruptions that plauged her so. \"Oh I'm sorry, are we <b>done</b>, interrupting me ladies?\" she whined, \"Anyway, if I remember right we were discussing-\" she was cut off by Harley shoving a cookie into her mouth midsentence. \"I'm sorry,\" she mock apologized, \"You were sayin' somethin' Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mfffmfmfmm.\" Ivy mumbled through cookie, \"I said...

She loved how big all three of were getting and wanted that to continue. She didn't want her gaining to either be slowed or stopped by planning a heist. She felt the time of heist was over for her and them, now was the time for Ivy, Selina, and Talia to all continue growing while she continued to fatten them up. This goal of hers went along with her becoming more assertive. She found herself telling the girls what to do more often and those things were to stay on the couch, or in bed and continue to eat or even that they allow her to feed them. If one of them ever so mentions another crime, she would shush them up by making them eat even more than they orignally planned too. Harley was enjoying seeing the three sirens continue to expand and enjoying having some control and power for the first time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy, Selina, and Talia all realized just how fat they were getting but they didn't have the energy or willpower to do anything about it. They were too addicted to eating so much of whatever they wanted and being lazy as Harley made it so easy for them to do and made sure they did. They also had to admit they were really enjoying their new lifestyle and didn't see any new reason for them to stop it. While there had been that brief time were they all three felt an itching to get back into crime, it was mostly gone now, replaced by a contentment of the way their life was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was now a fat kitty and Harley loved to call her that as much as Selina loved to be called that. She had her own spot on one of the couchs, laying on it on her back with her feet up. She had a huge belly that stuck out prominently that she could not see over. Her wide hips and very thick thighs were hanging over the couch now a little and though her butt could not be seen while she was sitting, it was very big and round. Harley would bring plenty of treasts over to Selina which sometimes Selina ate herself and sometimes Harley would feed her. \"Whose my fat kitty? Who wants more to eat?\" Harley would tease Selina playfully as she feed her treat after treat which Selina would reply with, \"I'm your fat kitty, I want to eat more\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia now was laying on her back on the other couch across from Selina. Her feet wre propped up with her huge belly sticking out as well preventing her from seeing anything below it her. Her wide hips and very thick thighs were even bigger than Selina's and hanging over the side of the couch more. Though her ass could not be seen when she was sitting, if she were to get up, a very big indentation would be caused by her huge round ass that she sat on all day. Her days were spent constantly eating along with plenty of smokes and drinking. All three sirens were having trouble getting up and getting around now but especially Talia since all the weight and smoking was making her breathe harder. She was well aware of how fat and out of shape she was getting but loved everything about it. Though Harley was feeing all three of them, Talia was making sure that Harley fed her the most. It was something that both girls loved and found very sensual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was now laying in bed all day with her head propped up on her soft pillows. She would spend her day contantly eating while watching tv and dvds, reading, and being in the company of her plants whom she talked to. Her huge gut stuck way out which she could not see over. Her ass was huge and round leaving a indention in her bed from her laying in it all day. While Talia was the most out of shape of the three sirens, she was a close second. She would feed herself sometimes, other times Harley would, and still other times she would have her humanoid-form plants feed her. While Harley was feeding her a good amount, she was not feeding her as much as before and to make up for that she was having her plants feed her more. She loved being so lazy, spoiled, and decadent.</span></div></div>",

Whether it be due to a shared case of apophenia or general suspicion of the world around them, Renee and Charles both had a knack for finding conspiracies in everyday life. \"Fat\" had become everyday life in Gotham, therefore it was the Question's job to knitpick until she found something sinister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loomed over her work, scratching her lowermost chin in thought; her temples hurt. Taking a bite of kruller, Renee let out an annoyed grunt as she mulled over the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly everyone in Gotham had gained a substantial amount of body fat; rich or poor, high class to no class. It had started with the sociallites, moving downward on the social pyramid due to endorsements and reluctant sharing; Renee had seen it firsthand last month with Kate. From what she had gathered (and experienced firsthand) the brand was named Anonymous and specialized in unhealthy pastries, cakes, and chocolates. Their booth was the most crowded, bluebeards of all shapes and sizes scarfing down everything they could get their greedy mits on, Kate included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnonymous: it was obviously a cry from an unimaginative supervillain/ess trying to strike it rich with doped up brownies. Not hard to figure out. But one thing made the investigation much more difficult; naturally the source of Anonymous would be either uncommonly large or uncommonly skinny by this point, depending on whether or not they followed the Peddler's #1 rule or not. But the largest Gothamites were usually housewives with little to do other than eat the day away or bigwigs who could afford such extravagence. Other than Roxy Rocket, who had proven herself a true glutton and gained nearly a fourth of a ton, every other glam villain of Gotham couldn't match this new M.O.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee had interviewed Roxy about a month ago; hopelessly addicted to food by the last time she saw her. A helpless blob who could barely waddle around Blackgate anymore, she was out of the question. The food was still coming, Roxy wasn't in charge of it or she'd weigh a ton. There had to be someone she was forgetting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Question scattered her files in desperation, searching for even the slightest thing she may have missed. A frazzled groan filled the apartment as all the files fell to the floor, papers spilling everywhere. \"What the hell!\" she chastized herself, resting her head in chubby hands, \"What am I missing?!\" she grabbed the blank slate that was her disguise, thick eyebrows furrowed in anger. \"I don't deserve this shit!\" she tossed the mask to the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I'm sorry.\" she said to herself, struggling past her own stomach to pick up the mask proved futile so she was forced to lift her heavyset form from the chair and bend over. Aside from a general discomfort with herself due to her weight, Renee felt proud... most of the time... to be the Question. It was an honor, she decided as she picked up her mask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" she picked up a recent photo of newest sociallite couple Pamela Isely and Harleen Quinzelle; from crooks to bluebeards. \"I think I might have to speak with...\" a loud ripping sound emenated from her backside, \"...a tailor, first.\"</span></div></div>",

Once again she was really grateful for the mask over her face so Harley could not see her embarssed face. She was really starting to feel hungry now and she knew she wouldn't be able to concentrate on her goal here unless she fed her appetite. \"Okay thanks\" Renee called back to Harley who was already gone but called to her to go into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing voices in the living room, Renee made her way into the living room and her eyes went wider as she saw three more sirens all looking much heavier as well. There on one couch lay Selina Kyle, Catwoman, but she was now a blob of fat with a big belly. Poison Ivy lay on the other couch also very fat though she had a more squash shape. Then in one of the chairs sat a fat Talia Al Ghu who even sitting couldn't hide her bottom heavy hourglass figure. If Renee still had been a novice, she would have take the siren's weight gain as proof as they weren't behind the mass fattening of Gotham but she wasn't a novice and knew their weight gain wasn't a sign of their innocence. The sirens could be behind the fattening but still get fat themseles from their own treats knowingly. Renee still felt that Harley and Ivy were responsible for the mass fattening of Gotham though it was tweaked a bit. She had orginally thought that Ivy would be the mastermind of this and Harley just went along with it and helped her. She still believed that could be the case though it looked like Harley was in control of things since she was by far the skinnest of the sirens and doing all the cooking while Ivy was huge and laying lazily on the couch. She hadn't consider Talia to be part of this but sitting here she couldn't help but wonder if she played a part here, maybe finacing their goods to get them off the ground. She didn't consider Selina to be inmplicated in this as though was far from her usual crimes and she (Selina) didn't look any in shape to even be doing her usual crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy, Selina, and Talia all eyed Renee in her The Question costume in silence as she took them in in silence. \"So to what do we owe the pleasure of a visit from a superhero?\" Talia asked coyly before taking another puff of her cigerette. She then heard and felt her stomach grumble hungrily and she gently patted it. \"Harley! Are the pastires coming? We are all starvingout here\" she called to Harley. \"They just came out and I will bring them out in a sec\" Harley called back. Renee felt herself blush again as she felt her stomach grumble again as well. \"I guess our guest is hungry as well\" Talia added with a smirk. Trying to get attention off her own weight gain and the grumbles of her stomach, Renee replied, \"I want to ask Harley and Ivy some questions in regards to a case I am working on\" Renee replied before watching the three sirens to see their reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy, Selina, and Talia didn't bat an eye even though they had no doubt that Renne was invetigating how so many Gothamites were getting fat off Harley and Ivy's pastries. They all three felt pretty confident they wouldn't be found out and stopped. \"Well I will be happy to answer any questions you have after I have some of the cake that Harley is bringing us\" Ivy replied. She had heard Renee's belly groan and figured that she wouldn't mind waiting since she was hungry too and would want some cake too. \"Of course\" Renee replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Harley returned with two huge slices of cake along with a big glass of milk for each of them (Ivy, Renee, Selina, and Talia). Renee watched in amazement as Ivy, Selina, and Talia all hungrily and greedily dug into their cake, stuffing bite afer bite down her throat. only stopping to lick some  frosting off their lips and washing it all down with sips of their milk. After a moment, Renee dug into her cake and found it so good that she couldn't help but eat like the sirens.</span></div></div>",

Females in the city gaining weight is not a crime and it's not like you are one to talk having gained quite a bit yourself\" she replied with a giggle before poking Renee's fat belly after finishing feeding her the slice of cake.  Renee winced a little as she felt Harley poke her belly as it was kinda painful having just eaten four slices of cake. Harley then handed Renee a glass of milk which she (Renee) quickly downed. She was once again glad that she was wearing a mask when she let out a couple of burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally getting a chance to catch her breathe after all the cake and burps, Renee was finally able to reply to Selina and Harley's questions. \"I am investigating this because I think something was put into these treats to get women addicted to them, eat alot of them, and gain alot of weight. I think it was an organized effort that was planned and intentional. None of that might not necessarily be illegal but the results from those actions could bring trouble\" Renee explained. She watched the sirens to see if her words made any of them uncomfortable. None of the them flinched, seemed an uneasy, or sweated because of her words. Renee wasn't really surprised by this as she knew she was dealing with pros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that is a crazy conspiracy theory hun. Besides, what's wrong with the extra weight? All of the extra pounds that all of us have gained has enchanced our beauty and looks great on us\" Ivy replied before picking up another slice of cake and stuffing it down Renee's throat. Talia, Selina, and Harley stuffed another slice of cake down Harley's throat the way they had the previous go around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Renee panted heavily, and she could barely move, both on account of how full she was, and her size. The vixens had at least let up on their assault, now decided to eat the treats themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia grabbed herself one of the cupcakes from the table and sat her jiggling frame into one of the wider chairs. Despite her attempts to remain formal, Talia eventually gave in to her overbearing hunger and devouring the treat in a few bites, letting a small burp escape. Another rather out of character move came next, she took a deep breath and let her straining pant button pop, breathing a sigh of relief as her stomach was freed. She rubbed it gently with her hands while grabbing a glass of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina instead, grabbed two slices of yellow cake, and unlike Talia's facade of regality, completely gave in to her hunger and consumed the two slices ravenously. Patting her distended belly, she once more stood up, with fair difficulty, and waddled her massive body for more food. She stopped herself realizing that one of Renee's popped buttons (damage from the brief stuffing session) was on the ground. Bending over as if to pick it up, Selina's massive rear struggled against her suit, desperate to be free. The resulting rip told the news of who won the battle. Face flushing red, Selina's hands darted to her exposed bottom as she sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley ate little, one cupcake and a smaller milk glass, as she was mainly watching the show that was her cohorts rotund bodies. She of course was rather large now too, with a stomach now large enough to support her cupcake without it tipping. She turned to Renee and wondered just what they'd have to do if she kept askin' questions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy waddled her massive body into the living room...or at least she tried. The green woman's hips and large backside had once more gotten her stuck in the door. The other three supersize sirens immediately noticed her predicament and rose to help her, pulling her through the doorframe. A good two minutes of pulling and tugging got Ivy out, and sent her toppling onto her saviors. For any normal person, they'd have a few broken bones, luckily, these women were rather...padded. All four rising to their feet, they all froze as a loud knock came from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I *huff* forget to tell you? I brought a little back up. Tell me, how to you say 'Zatanna is going to kick your fat asses' backwards?\" Renee said, lightly chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door burst open to reveal Zatanna who...</span></div></div>",

However, because that gave little insight as to just how important the arrival of their newest house guest truly was, the next sentence that followed was of much more significance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nediw Yawrood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs, you should probably be able to piece the information together by now, Zatanna Zatara had become quite the sizable woman. Not immune to the, once innocently delicious yet now sinfully addictive, treats that had taken Gotham and the surrounding areas by storm, the adeptly magical heroine was finding it harder and harder to squeeze herself in and out of particularly cramped areas such as these unforgiving doorways. As such, this spell was quickly becoming a necessity for her everyday life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke these magical, somewhat confusing words to those not familiar in her M.O., the very arch that supported the gateway into the Isely-Quinnzelle abode stretched like a rubber band to accommodate the dimensions of the young raven-haired lass as she tottered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrown to quite the juicy size, Zatanna had puffed right up alongside a good majority of other victims of the Anonymous Onslaught of baked goods; Capes, Rouges, and Civs and all inbetween. Her face had puffed outwards into two round, bouncy cheeks that bobbed with her heavy movements, supported by a single though large facial fold that creased along where her neck should be as it battled for space against her too-tight bow tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer coat, stretched and stitched magically no doubt, looked tailor-fit to her new flabby body; coating her mammoth arms quite nicely in the black fabric and cuffing somewhere around the middle of her forearm, leaving a bulge of blubber between there and her fudge-smudged at the fingers gloves. Wrapping around her impressively thick spare tire was the remainder of her suit, so tight that it gave her chest a natural push-up effect, unable to contain the swaying behemoth that was her midsection from doing just that. It hung over her fishnetted thighs, though not so much as to conceal a few rips in them, and was otherwise undeniably large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her top hat seemed far too small for her head, as if that had somehow gained weight alongside her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better\" she said with satisfaction after hobbling into the apartment, patting her tummy, \"This city seems to bear a grudge against a girl who likes to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me.\" Selina said, a sense of kinswomanship already preforged between the two of them due to... 'past incidents with a Mr. Thomas Elliot' (I'd suggest reading 'Heart of Hush') \"A girl puts on a little weight and all of the sudden she's a pariah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zee!\" the Question puffed from her seated position, still pinned down to the chair by her lethargic digestive system and equally lazy metabolism, \"Stuff the small talk!\" We've got to bring these hogs in for questioning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take offense to the term 'hog'.\" Talia huffed, her hand self consciously adjusting the hem of her sweater from its position well over her belly button<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you... dios Mio...\" here the Question paused to take a mighty belch before continuing with a heavy shade of red behind her mask, \"I don't care what you take offense to! I'm running the show here and I say you four fat asses are what's making me turn into a parade blimp! Zatanna, hit them with the good stuff!\" Renee barked, pointing a gloved hand at the murder of blubberous crones that stood (just barely) across from her and her coat-tailed companion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" she said with a newfound sense of duty. Taking on even one of the four of these women would have been very difficult had they been in their physical prime. Poison Ivy was quick, but always seemed to have some sort of killer plant up her sleeve. Talia had all kinds of crazy-ass assassin moves that had been instilled in her since birth. Catwoman was quick, had a whip, and wasn't exactly anything to sneeze at in the strength department either. And Harley was really just a big mouth with an even bigger hammer... she liked to swing both around pretty loosely. However, now that they were overblown versions of their ideal selves, this would be quite simple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zatanna was quite overblown herself. So this might get a little tricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tcirtres dna Etarapes!\" she shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn invisible force pushed the four of their fat bodies apart as Zatanna readied herself. Talia was pushed into and forced against the wall, unable to move an undertrained muscle and overpowered by magic. Harley was thrown back into the kitchen, landing noisily amongst pots and pans, whereas Selina was pushed down the hall, onto her belly and therefore rendered helpless. A lot like an upside-down turtle. Ivy, however, was pushed within a reasonable walking distance for the newly lethargic magician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she waddled closer to the chloropathic baker, giving the Question a nice view of her overinflated hindquarters of cellulite om-nomming her black shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed, \"I'm only going to ask this one time, Ivy. One time.\" she had taken a lot of mentoring lessons from Batman, just as he had learned escape artistry from her father. And as she tried her darndest to look menacing in the eyes of the green blob she held pinned against the wall like so many Sith Lords to admirals, it was plainly obvious that she was <i>not</i> as scary as the Bat. Or anyone else under his wing for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me the truth, Ivy.\" she began again, \"Are you four in charge? Do you know who's ruining all our figures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna stepped closer, the overall girth between the two of them colliding at the middle and preventing them from getting and closer to one another. Ivy winced; having just come from outside, dear chubby Zee hadn't had enough time to get her body fat situated back to body temperature yet- she was cold whereas pampered Ivy had spent all day inside with the heater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Ivy said with a cocky smirk, \"I have no idea who or what is swelling us up like overripe fruit; and I don't like it any more than you do.\" she grinned evily, already having planned ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you've forced me to do this.\" Zatanna said with a sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, Zee...\" Question said, lurching forward past her taut tummy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivy, are you in charge of Anonymous Sweets?\" Zatanna asked, her face almost unnervingly serious, \"Hturt eht em llet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was here that would be the ever-so experienced magician's downfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy took a deep breath; showing the calm, level-headed person that she was and still happened to be, despite everything that had happened. She had known Zee's m.o. for quite some time now. The only obligation here was that her next sentence was to be the truth, as it would come out no matter what she did to stop it. This gave her plenty of time to close her eyes, relax, and summon up a concentrated dose of spores from within herself. These same spores that had been going into everything that had come out of her oven for the past year or so; or going into herself, Selina, Talia, and later Harley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zee was about to get hit with a motherload of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exhaled her very breath in her answer, making sure that her pheromones would reach the magician. \"Yes.\" she hissed evilly as she watched the black-haired blob in front of her start to gag, \"Yes I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good enough for me!\" Question said, finally trying to pry her enormous ass from the chair, \"Let's get them back to... I don't know, somebody! Supes? Green Arrow? Fuck, we can give 'em to Huntress if she'll stop stuffing her face long enough to get some answers out of 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zatanna was far too busy choking at the moment to sling any more spells Ivy's way. The chloropath chuckled huskily as she watched the bulging mass in front of her double over the best her massive stomach would allow her to. She wheezed heavily as her top hat fell from her head, falling to her flabby hands and knees as she struggled for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z-Zatanna? You alright, Zee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there would be no immediate response to Renee's question. For the spores had already begun taking their effect on poor, unsuspecting Zatanna...</span></div></div>",

Two days of no movement, no talking to one another; the only contact being whatever was being literally fed into awaiting mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Zatanna, Zee, took the brunt of it. Being able to turn an entire apartment building inside out with a few backwards sentences was a mighty power that was rightfully feared by even the mighty Anonymous group. So while Renee was aloud to speak her mind, as she did in the form of constant cursing and disturbingly vivid threats on what she was going to do to each individual member of the entrepreneurial group, Zatanna was forced under a vow of silence the entire time; force-fed large quantities of baked goods specially dosed with Ivy's spores in an attempt at keeping her magical little mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley seemed to take the most from the experience of satiating such a large woman's appetite, given that she'd grown quite fond of the appetites of the women around her and herself. She was to stay behind while the other girls struggled and waddled around helplessly trying to make up for Harley's absence by mostly keeping to their rooms until the preparations had been made to take care of their two snoops accordingly via a few handy assassins that were due for duty. Usually, Harley would sit in the back and mindlessly pop treat after treat into Zatanna's awaiting mouth as she zoned out on her monumental rump roast, watching either the television or whichever morbidly obese vixen happened to waddle her way into the living room. When she was on her last tray or so, she'd simply ask whichever girl was nearest to the three of them to take over while she went back to baking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a relatively simple existence, this one. Her insomnia helped. Mental instability combined with a natural manic-depressive disorder (sans the depressive part) assured that she would have no problems staying up late for a couple of days keeping the Big Z (as she had been so cruelly codenamed around the apartment) satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, putting Harley in charge of this little project would prove to be a major slip in judgement, but we'll get to that little oversight later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, Zatanna and the Question were, of course, growing. The former much more than the latter, the latter barely much at all, but still. A diet of nothing but extremely high quantities sugar and dough would not only rot your teeth (thank goodness the Justice League provided dental) but that, combined with literally sitting tied up in a chair all day would definitely cause a girl, any girl, to put on weight. Seeing that those ropes were plenty tight around the two of them to begin with, it wouldn't take much to break out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were first secured, Zatanna's tummy bulged out of the gaps that Harley's tying had left; a lot like big fleshy balloons. They were tight, constricting. Zatanna constantly whimpered as they only grew moreso, the pain of her growing body against the not-growing ropes was almost too much for the overfed magician. However she couldn't do much to stop it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she wanted to stop eating, which she did, something inside of her had changed. When Ivy had done... <i>whatever it was</i> to her that she did, Zatanna inhaled almost everything edible that was just laying around in the apartment. That hunger, her insatiably voracious appetite, had not left her. She was filled with an all-consuming desire to eat! Not just cookies and cakes and pies and all that other crap that Harley had been stuffing down her throat, but she found herself with a maddening urge to feast! To gorge no matter how full her stomach had gotten. And she was frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a lot on a girl's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's no wonder she barely noticed when Harley fell asleep on her plush tummy at two'o'clock in the morning, the very day that Talia had prothesied that her assassins would be ready for the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Question nudged her flabbier companion, \"Z-Zee?\" she whispered, not daring to wake the slumbering sociopath on Zatanna's tummy. As Zatanna had gotten a stronger dosage than the Question, the latter was not inclined with the same hedonistic tendencies- rather, at least not as strong. Though, to be fair, she hadn't been fed nearly as well as Zatanna had been. Perhaps it was fate, though perhaps it was because her mouth could only hurt feelings and smoke cigarettes, not conjure an elephant from thin air. \"Zee, you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phmeh?\" Zatanna asked, caught off guard, \"Q-Question?\" Her voice was cracked, having not used her vocal chords for anything other than swallowing slick sugary goodies for the past fourty-eight hours. \"Y-Yeah, I'm up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get us out of here!\" she growled, a vein pressing against the forehead of her mask, \"I think you can break the ropes now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna sighed, realizing that her companion was right. She took a deep inhale and flexed her expansive belly, marveling as buttons popped and stitches ripped across its fleshy expanse. Slowly the tensed ropes clenched painfully over her overbearing stomach. Ever so slowly, as she whimpered and cried in pain, Zatanna's girth won the battle of the bulge and broke the ropes- letting all of each of them hang free in freshly fattened glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-there...\" she huffed, red and sweaty from the exertion, \"I could really use a snack right about now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zee, all you've been doing for the past two days is eat. I think you can miss stuffing your face long enough to realize that you could have just Zatanna'd your way out of the ropes and gotten us back to Headquarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. You owe me a gym membership, tubs.\" Question huffed, \"If I ever see another brownie again I'm going to barf. Get us back to Headquarters, Canary's gonna be pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna was caught staring longingly at some of the undevoured snacks Harley had planned to feed her. Her eyes widened, a dreamy look across her face as she imagined what all of those must taste like- well able to at this point in her obesity. She inched closer to them on her chair slightly before remembering the slumbering harlequin of hulking asscheeks asleep on her belly... no way out but magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" she said dumbly, \"Esab ot epacse Annataz dna Noitseuq... htiw, um, srialce etalocohc fo esac taht htiw!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unlike many of her fellow Capes, Barbara Gordon had kept a relatively cool head about the dietary catastrophe that was affecting the American population. Sure, she was more than a little upset that she had been forced to buy a double-wide wheel chair, but she simply chalked it up to necessity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, being chair-bound had left her pretty large in her posterior area to begin with. If she was going to have an overinflated rear like everybody else, she might as well not have to worry about squashing her only means of transportation with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swollen Oracle had insisted that the Question come to the War Room so as to plan a proper counter attack. And as the bottom-heavy latina waddled alongside her, Gordon found herself more than a match for her slow steady pace. The electric whir of her new motorized wheelchair had really added some pep into her proverbial step, enough to lug around her exanding form <i>and</i> keep it up to speed with everyone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee's, the Question's, own step had been long sapped; taking her walk from a powerful march to a drudging waddle as her inflated bottom half fought for space within her jeans, made only more akward by the uncontrollable jiggling that her volatile midsection insisted upon at every step. She wasn't having much fun being this size, and she aimed to get her revenge one way or another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen that look before.\" Oracle said with a smirk, still zipping alongside Montoya while avoiding the haphazard wobbling of her saddlebag thigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't see my face.\" she puffed back, shifting her hidden features to face the crippled Cape, \"How could you possibly know what kind of look I'm making?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When your mentor's Batman, you kind've learn a thing or two about brooding.\" Oracle answered lightheartedly with a pat to Question's side, \"I didn't even need to see your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...\" Renee began, her rage burning brightly behind her faceless facade, \"I still say that we stick it to Ivy and her little harem. Those <i>brujas</i> were bad when I was on the Force, but they've become so... so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we finish this conversation in private, Ms. Montoya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Gordon whipped her chair around to face the bloated latina and delicately brushed the cold silver walls of the Watchtower with her soft net-surfer's fingers. A mechanical hissing opened an otherwise unplaceable door, a common feature on the highly advanced space station. She wheeled inside, Question following soon after...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas elsewhere, in the cafeteria, some of the other heroes had taken a much different approach in coping with their ruined physiques. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Barbara Gordon and Renee Montoya decided to take the problem with logic and reasoning, the others were far more inclined to help feed the beast that killed them and indulge in whatever edible substance happened to be nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuntress sat at her table, alone, eating the crap out of just about everything as she popped out of her biggest outfit. Ice was currently contemplating whether or not to have yet another slice of cake while Fire was busy checking out the new awesome rack on Ice. Supergirl was busy satiating her superhuman appetite, begrudgingly having no choice but to subdue her latest weakness: hunger. Wonder Woman, now completely bound to her place by her suffocating amount of blubber, could only contemplate how far she had fallen from grace as she was fed by Stargirl and Donna Troy. Everyone was so ruled by their appetite, without much of a choice in the matter. Ivy's plan had truly worked in ways she couldn't have imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there in the center, was Zatanna, who hadn't stopped eating since she had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo small talk, no games. She had plopped her mighty self into one of the tables and began chowing down as if she were charged with eating everything in the world. She was an animal, ripping at tearing at things that needent be eaten so fervently. Making low, hungry grunts and groans as she gorged with her new gluttonous instincts of hedonism. She was consumed with an all-powerful need to feed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms, getting tired, drooped heavily beside her- never to be used again- as she loathed the aching muscles in her underused arms. The past two days had opened her up to a new world- one where one didn't need to use their arms to ease hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em Deef.\" she said dimly, a stupid smile on her face as the mountain of food around her began to levitate around her in orbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, her meals floated into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho needed hands when she had magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erom Doof.\" was what she said five minutes later, when she ran out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's agreed.\" Question said concretely, \"We need a team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOracle nodded, her soft double chin moving likewise in agreement, \"Exactly. We'll need to take down all of Ivy's manufactoring plants. But since they went national, that'll be a bit of a stretch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we just go in and take them all down ourselves?\" Question huffed, removing herself from the table and the table from inbetween her belly rolls, \"All we need is Supergirl or some shit to bust in there and take 'em all out. No big hassle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The plants probably have the recipe down to a patent by now, which means just taking out Ivy won't do anything.\" she said conclusively, \"She, Harley, Selina and Talia will get booked and we'll all still blow up like blimps until there won't <i>be</i> any fighting back.\" she said harshly, \"We need to manufacture an antidote to Ivy's spores. If I can get all the variations, I should be able to get something, at least <i>something</i> to at least kill withdrawls. That'll make it a lot easier for us all to lose weight and get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you suggesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are eight major plants across the country. One in Metropolis, One in Star City, three out west, one in Louisiana, and of course the biggest one in Gotham City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd imagine we'll be taking that one first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally.\" Oracle said with a stifled laugh, \"I know those streets better than the tread on my tires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't they notice that all their plants aren't reporting back? Or at least that their money is drying up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw them yourself, from what you've told me they're far too engorged with themselves to pay attention to the faring of their business. Hopefully they won't notice a thing, at least not until the very end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sounds like a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we need to make it quick. With the rate everyone's growing, the Watchtower will be knocked out of orbit soon. We need to get as many samples of those spores as we can, as fast as we can. That way I can inject everyone with whatever we come up with and they can begin their weight-loss therapy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, that's kind of a big deal...\" Renee said rather flatly, \"Is it safe for everyone to be up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as their growth remains constant, I'd say that the Watchtower has about eight months before it crashes into Earth. So as long as everyone can keep control of themselves, everything should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and dandy, but...\" Renee stopped, \"...Say, how are <i>you</i> going to go cross-country? In your... erm, condition, I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep fort in one of the bases we capture.\" Oracle answered, \"Being surrounded by all of those samples <i>should</i> give me more than enough to work with so that it doesn't come down to anything nail-biting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I got it...\" Question grumbled, her head throbbing from thinking so tactically. She was much more of a mystery person, not a general. \"Dios Mio this is tough. I need a snack...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gotham City, two ante-meridiem, at its darkest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bar, long closed, makes for the setting. Boarded up windows weren't there for the grand closing, being a business in the rougher parts of Gotham meant that one had to have some form of security. The cold wrought iron bars made sure to \"protect\" the easily pickable locks. The owner had always been a little worried about the local crowd busting in and taking everything he had worked so hard for. But he could rest easy, wherever he was, in that the local villains that slithered about the Gotham City streets weren't the one to break and enter into his once precious bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bar, long since closed for reasons forgotten, made for the perfect setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparantly the owner had left in a hurry, the decorum was untouched. Aside from the scars of Renee's rather brutal entry, one could hardly tell that another soul had even bothered with this place. Luckily for one faceless vigilante, this meant that the booze had been left untouched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at the bar shot in hand, heavy rear enveloping her stool into its fleshy mass. She refused to grab another one, refusing to simply condone to her gluttonous physique's demands. No, she was far too stubborn. Too stubborn to let her body win over her mind and training. She was in charge, Renee kept telling herself as she downed another shot of scotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from her the soft glow of a computer screen illuminated a corner of their setting, the light clicking of keys provided rhythm to an otherwise silent night. Her vibrant red hair stood out amongst all else as she hovered over the screen of her portable laptop, leaning into the table and suffocating the surface with her upper body fat. She continued typing, unperturbed by the glass meeting the hard wood of the bar. Her glasses reflected pinpointing positions and battle strategies while her flabby arms echoed with every strike of a key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, things were quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuiet in a profound way, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut quiet still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them hoped mutually, despite their standpoints on the situation, that the night would not conclude with only them. Their plans were possible with only them, yes. But they needed haste and numbers if they were to earn the triumph that they so desperately craved. And haste would only come with numbers, given their individual physiques and physical limitations. Numbers would only arrive if they were lucky, and if their best truly hadn't fallen as hard as the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was still young, as Bruce might have put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... O.\" Q beckoned from the bar, \"You really think they're coming, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know <i>somebody's</i> coming.\" O responded flatly as she stared into her screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so sure?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just know things.\" O said with a closing 'click!' of her computer, \"I know I can at least count on Steph... Batgirl, to show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the light of a computer the whole bar returned to it's dark, hopeless ambiance. The Question, turning on her fat rearend to face Oracle, hid a look of hopelessness behind her mask and a shroud of shadow. Pale moonlight peered in through the boards on the windows, leaving rays of faint blue light across the walls of the Zero Hour. </span></div></div>",

A lot like the League, Renee knew for a fact that this building had been a local hotspot torn down by Anonymous. Like the League, it was now an empty skeleton of what it had been before. Unlike the League, the denizens of this bar would find another place to fill their needs. For most capes, the League is all they had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know if they don't show, it means that they've won, right?\" Question said to the poster of pre-Anonymous Harley Quinn hanging behind the bar, \"It means that they've got everybody... except us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it doesn't.\" Oracle wheeled herself to face Question's bulging butt, \"Even if Batgirl doesn't show, which she will, all that means is that we're stronger. And that it's up to us to save all of the League -and the Watchtower- from failing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so sure that Batgirl will--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatoom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh.\" Oracle hushed, \"Did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she had, how could she not have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roof had obviously heard it, judging by the two sizable imprints left on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow, meathodic movements beat heavily above two bloated Capes as it slowly inched towards the front door. Finally, a drop from atop the building sounded by an 'Oof!' was the key of arrival. There, mostly visible through the breaks in the wood, hunched a large black shape, golden hair draping across its broad shape. Both women's ears, trained and honed for detection, picked up on its heavy panting, along with the sound of fabric brushing against fabric. At once the shape released it's black shadowy cape and slowly tottered to its feet, revealing quite the generously padded form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly it hobbled, with its golden mane bobbing in the cold night air along with the rest of its bulging physique, and started towards the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your heart moniter's going nuts.\" Oracle said lightheartedly as she turned herself to face the front door, the plump shape waddling in. \"You're really out of shape, Miss Brown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, on cue, Stephanie Brown. Batgirl. However Robin's darkly humourous jest of calling her \"Fat Girl\" wasn't far off anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrown quite plump in the Anonymous takeover sweeping the country, Stephanie Brown's flawless physique had bloated outwards in favor of one much more inclined to that of your typical tubby teen. Her body, still rather thin when compared to her peers, kept a certain shape of hourglass. Albeit with much more sand than usual. A proudly seductive swelling of her breasts and thighs was taken a little too far as the yellow bat insignia was distorted along the contours of her bulging breasts; its tail end bulging upwards as it rested atop her puffy middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stuff it.\" Stephanie said, blushing beneath her bat-mask, \"Like you can run and jump rooftops half as good as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the new suit treating you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a glove. Literally.\" she jest, \"But it's comfortable, I'll give you credit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna have to be.\" Oracle said seriously, \"What with your new curves, you've slowed down quite a bit. The suit's muscle stimulants should help you out, but try to control yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion rolled her eyes underneath her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is it?\" she spat venomously, \"<i>This</i> is our backup?\" she pointed harshly at the swollen Brown before her, \"<i>Dios Mio</i>, she's not that much better than anyone on the Watchtower! Come on Oracle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I thought she handled the rooftops quite well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foreign shape, one of slick and lithe contours, wriggled it's way into the bar. A thin frame was almost a suspicious sight for the two flabby heroes. As it reached the moonlight, Oracle and Question recognized a familiar, sleek leather costume that filled them with anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Selina?\" Gordon asked quietly, \"Q-Q, you said that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close: Holly Robinson.\" she answered quietly, \"I ran into Batgirl and she filled me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we would have called for you, <i>Gato Peque\u00f1o</i>.\" Question barked, \"At least... O, tell me you didn't call for her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't.\" Holly answered venomously, \"I'm only here because... I've seen what's happened to Selina. Hanging around Ivy all this time... or whatever's become of Ivy... she's changed. I don't know if its something that Ivy put into the air or whatever, but she's changed. Selina used to be my hero when I was... well, I guess she still is kinda my hero. Its up to me to help her get back to normal. And I since I know what you're doing, I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to help you. Help Selina... Catwoman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touching.\" Question snapped, \"Tell us why you're thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work out.\" she answered vaguely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Oracle's reserves would arrive shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding left to right, lined up in all of their individually flabby forms, was the last hope in the fight against global obesity... at least organized global obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first would be Dawn Granger, Dove. Left relatively thin due to her hardened sense of self-control and the whole \"inner peace\" thing, Dawn was in relatively good shape. However a big, disproportionate middle bulged outwards to make one hell of a muffin top. Out of costume, as she wasn't in danger, her white hair was pulled into a ponytail and allowed to hang loosely onto the back of her blue coat. Should the situation arise, she would play mediator. And most definitely, the situation <i>would</i> arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely because next to Dawn stood her sister, Holly, or Hawk. Whereas Dawn was the avatar of peace and well being, Holly took up the mantle of a much more violent justice. Brash and rather arrogant, she was much less pleasant to be around. However she seemed to have sported a much better set of breasts than her sister these days- something that she loved to hold over her head as much as possible with as much sneering as could be done. Also out of costume due to no immediate danger, she would most definitely be of help in many situations, from someone with a lead pipe or a candlestick approached them or a deadly spore released into the air. For now though, she was Holly. And that was abrasive enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the Granger sisters stood a very different type of bird. No flight, nor much agility at all anymore, would aid this grounded canary as she sung her way into the bleeding ears of her opponents with her Canary Cry. However, in an interesting development, her alto had become much lower in her swelling. Her belly hung uselessly between her swollen fishnetted thighs. Nearly busting out of her leather jacket, Black Canary's choker was absolutely hidden beneath her abundant neckfat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally stood a massive hill of fat once known as Supergirl. Bigger than even Oracle, Kara's superhuman appetite had been amplified once introduced to Anonymous, and she had practically not stopped eating since. Swelling out, weighing in at probably about four-hundred, the only thing that kept her as mobile as ever was her super strength. Her large middle squished outwards from underneath her top, clapping heavily against her equally tubby thighs. She was simply here in case of heavy lifting or super-strengthed minions were to show up. She was just hungry a lot now, and it was in agreement that no matter how heavy the boxes or crates they were to unload, Super-Hungry Supergirl was not to touch a single one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the night still young, the onslaught would begin...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Holly's initial refusal didn't arouse much suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could really blame her, given that she was cornered by a sea of feminine blubber that that brand of particular sweets had indirectly caused. It was only in human nature to want to preserve themselves in pique fighting conditions, so the whole thing was dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if it was a person's job to find suspicion in even the simplest of acts, it was the Question's. Renee Montoya's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many subtle hints that could give away someone's ruse, most of which are involuntary. Most Capes and Villains are trained not to give away these secrets by identifying and then suppressing the urges that create them; especially those who tend to skulk around Gotham City, practically a modern-day Gomorrah. That being said, Renee was always the best, save for maybe Vic, at finding just about anything when most would have just given up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Vic was crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this life had led her more than just a little off the deep end when it comes to unfounded suspicion and downright grasping methods at conspiracies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, like Ralph Dibney, she had a real nose for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion watched as the solitary lean member of Oracle's Reserves sat around with the rest of her bloated companions, making comfortable usage of the floors of Anonymous' Bakery within their production plant. Her tight toned rear barely mussed from the act of squatting down... it had been a while since she'd seen such a marvel of the human form. And when compared amongst the others, flabby untoned and downright massive in some respects, she had to admit that having someone who could get through tight areas would definitely be beneficial...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparantly Renee wasn't as subtle as she might have thought herself to be; even behind her mask Dinah Lance was still able to deduce that the bottom heavy detective was staring daggers at the would-be Catwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocked her head subtly to the right, indicating that she wished for a word with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth huffing hiefers rose to their feet, weighed down by their individual jiggly parts as the remaining members of the Reserves were left to ponder the gravity of the situation. However things were soon forgotten; as Hawk made a crude remark about the size of Renee's posterior, to which Dove pointed out that \"she would definitely know about being a giant ass\", to which Holly and Supergirl concured as the latter stuffed three donuts into her mouth, once again offering but meeting refusal at the hands of Holly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, things were going pretty good except for Question's initial distrust of their newest member. But that was to be expected. Vic would have insisted on a full-body cavity search for small cameras, voice recorders, and certain breeds of electron-transmitting animals that would generally serve the same purpose. The fact that she failed to perform these searches made Renee either a better Question than Vic Sage, or a better one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking directly in the bakery of the Anonymous' Gotham City branch had a lot of technological advances that working almost anywhere else within the factory would not have provided. Talia had ensured mass production through her vast wealth and deeply rooted connections, meaning that a lot of ovens were to be plugged in and grounded so as to ensure optimum production. All Oracle had to do was get someone to unplug and remove an oven or two (that was a job for Supergirl) and set up what would be her very own Batcave of sorts. Seven monitors sat a front, each with a different screen that held pertinent information- one being Stephanie's bodily statistics as she stood watch outside and another showing results from the plant harvested from the cracks in the tiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing trained by Batman had it's advantages. From a relatively young age, Barbara Gordon had learned how to take in large amounts of information and sort it out accordingly. This, combined with her photographic memory, would eventually lead her to becoming the Oracle that so many superheroes today depended on. However training under the wings of a Bat often led to bouts of insomnia, a nasty side-effect of working so many late nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara was, also, well versed in the grooming of plants and horticulture- as were all mentors of Bruce Wayne. She was well aware that the sample harvested from the main room was far from the only source of the viral spores Ivy had grown, however it provided just enough information to give her a little insight on the plant's strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Barbara, one of the many things that she failed to emulate in Bruce would be his incredible self-control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... time to get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wheeled herself over to the conveyer belt as she awaited the results of her scanning, taking in potential aid and assistance of her surroundings and how things could have been used to her advantage. An extra outlet here and there, preferably one that wasn't too out of the way. Just the usual stuff. However she noticed that, with the flick of a simple switch, the assembly line came to life with a quiet hum. Four rows of black rubber and ovens, complete with big red metal mouths for everything to tumble out of, suddenly began sliding once again, back from the dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOracle couldn't help but watch with interest as the first of the newest batch of sweets came out wrapped and pretty not even two minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had invaded the base, things had been shut down for the night. The \"powered\" members of their team took it upon themselves to take out as many of Talia's culinary-converted assassians themselves as the others stuck to destroying machinery... apparently they had missed this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOracle wheeled herself over to the end of the line, normally where cardboard boxes were to be placed and collect the shipment of... what looked to be muffins. Though there were no boxes to await the packaged delights. Just a cold, tiled floor where they weren't to be eaten...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out and grabbed one before it touched the floor. Still warm. Plastic and package, still warm from the processing plant. She'd never had one of Anonymous' sweet hot off the line before... and she had forgone eating with her comrades to set up her new office. Perhaps she could...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be long before she forgot her work for the night entirely. Not a single muffin touching the floor from the first line. The gluttonous Oracle would see to it that no treat would fall behind as she eagerly led them to their pearly-white demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear a word of it, Question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you seem like a really smart lady, despite the whole \"biker chick\" thing you've got going on.\" Montoya responded harshly, \"Let me spell it out for you, 'That little bitch is working with Catwoman.', now tell me it doesn't make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't make sense.\" Canary said flatly as she crossed her puffy arms over her belly, \"Why help us if she's on Ivy's side?

Can you say the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Question responded, \"It makes me suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it weren't for her, it'd been <i>you</i> unplugging Oracle's computers. And judging by how big your ass is getting, you'd have gotten stuck quicker than Wally can down a sandwich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust her.\" Montoya spat, \"And I'm not going to. I'm the Question, God dammit. It's my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I'm reassigning you.\" Canary hissed back, \"Get your ass in gear or go back to the Watchtower.

And they weren't even done yet. Rather than hang around with the team she led, she had decided that a more stable base was more suited to her situation. By which of course she meant her obvious handicap of being chair-bound. It made sense when one looked at it logically. It certainly wasn't that she would hold the team back in their efforts to halt the crippling obesity that had gripped the greater part of the nation, though due to her inability to walk it certainly seemed that way. No, Oracle was just more of a behind the scenes person. Not one really accustomed to life outside the curtains anymore. She was in constant communication, even. So what's to worry about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have really taken to the Plant in Metropolis...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got B there, don't you?\" Barbara Gordon's voice came in over the earpiece<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's not the same.\" Montoya answered brashly, \"We need as many eyes and ears on the field as we can get if we're going to be looking for information on how to take down Ivy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a camera in her cowl and a piece in her ear. I can hear and see everything she does right here from Metropolis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that seem a little lazy, O?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the glories of modern technology. I'll give you the tour some time later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion lightly kicked a discarded magazine as she cut off communications, leaving Oracle to her own devices as she continued searching. Things hadn't been going nearly as well as she'd initially hoped; in the time that she and her begrudgingly titled \"partners\" had spent scouring every nook and cranny that these stupid factories had to offer, it seemed that nothing had gone right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, Holly Robinson was still a factor to be unaccounted for. While Oracle had done a background check and filled her in with whatever files were to be found in the League's article (that's rather generous, more of a footnote really) she had remained a bit of a wild card within their contained little community. She was an off one, always a little quiet. Her figure remained unchanged in the past few weeks, which only served to stir up some feelings of what was an admittedly petty jealousy within Renee. However she did her job, and that was only reason enough to suspect her even more. Especially when she practically had to put some of the others' faces to the grindstone to get a lick from any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl had officially been reduced to just-past useless in Renee's book. Her appetite was bigger than her entire circumferential form, and that was saying something. If she didn't have Canary or Question breathing down her neck, it was no doubt that she could have eaten the entire factory clean enough to eat off of the floor. She was sweet, yes. But it was a heavy nuisance having to keep reminding her that they were trying to put a <i>stop</i> to the widespread takeover of the stupid factories. And while Kara eating all the treats would certainly accomplish that, it would definitely make things look suspicious enough to warrant an investigation on Anonymous' part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawk and Stephanie were always fighting, the result of two headstrong personalities thrown together, and Dove was always trying to play mediator. The two girls would butt heads constantly, occasionally bellies if they actually got close enough, and have been known lately to spend the entire day getting so distracted by their bickering that they let an important ticket of information slip by when they went through the computers' database. And what's worse? Dove was a comfort eater. So when she felt particularly stressed about those two going at it like two overstuffed rams, she would console herself with eating the very treats that everyone was trying so hard to find what made them so dangerous to ingest (and that Canary had to work so hard to keep Kara from eating herself.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinah was constantly challenging Renee's authority, too. That made things pretty hard on the team as a whole. It seemed that lately Canary just seemed to pick whatever Question stood against and played the Devil's Advocate just to get a rise out of her. That stupid fat stomach of hers was no match for all the stupid fat in her head, if you asked Question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and they'd had to stop for new civilian clothes and costume modifications since their departure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, most of them were for Supergirl, but point remained: Renee's ass wasn't getting any smaller, nor were any of the other miscellaneous bulgy parts that the Reserves held to themselves. It was looking more and more hopeless as their diets began to consist more and more of the very beast they were trying to slay. Hell, Supergirl was having to break down doorways just to get anywhere anymore! Something had to be done, and fast, or they were all going to be large lardy hills of naked blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkulking about as a woman her size could do, Renee cautiously avoided the piercing eyes of Canary as she watched Dove literally get between the feuding girths that were Batgirl and Hawk. They were certainly getting heavier these days. Hawk's outfit was magical and Batgirl's commissary to her size thanks to science. At least for now, they could hold up. But Canary had obviously given up on fishnets or anything constricting. Renee could only chuckle as she took in the sight of Lance's badonkadonk, remembering with wicked glee how she liked to constantly poke verbal barbs towards her own admittedly generous amounts of butt blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer search had led her to Holly Robinson, probably the only one taking her work seriously around here anymore. Renee watched quietly as the young woman, their own Catwoman if you will, clacked diligently on the computer screen, making up for absent Oracle in the best way she could<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any progress?\" Montoya asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet.\" Not even a jump. This girl was either really good or being honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An order form for double-wide lingerie.\" Holly said plainly, \"Judging by the amount of leather pertaining to it and the whip, I'd say it's Selina's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... why in the world would you have that up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To remind me of what I'm doing here, Question.\" she spat, turning in her chair, \"I'm here to help Selina get back to her old self again, no matter what. I can't stand the thought of her living it up as a raunchy, sex-crazed ball of flesh with Poison Ivy.\" she said, turning back to her screen, \"And I'm going to put a stop to it. Even if I have to make an antidote myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you really look up to Selina, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly turned back, removing her goggles as she did so. \"Yeah... I do. She used to take care of this gang I was in when I was a kid... and she was, like, my hero. And I would... I still would do anything to help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she hadn't been an emotionally hardened crime fighter, who'd suffered from divorce heartbreak, addiction, death, and the strain of being ousted from her family, Renee might have shed a tear. However, the notion was still sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work.\" Montoya answered flatly, patting her on the back, \"Why don't you take a break, go make sure Kara isn't taking a five-finger discount. I'll take over from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I don't think you should--\" Holly admonished as she was forced from the chair <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt split down the middle, the central podium of the poor thing snapped like a twig underneath the weight of the Question's mighty bottom half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee's ass certainly wasn't getting any smaller...</span></div></div>",

For, what the online order form failed to mention, it had been an exact replica of the Catsuit most recently used by Selina Kyle; one to her exact specifications. Though while she had put on some weight, as she seemed to do a lot, before it arrived Selina was certain that she could squeeze her massive body into the tight leather bodice. With some help, of course. And who better to help her than the no-necked doormat formerly known as Harley Quinn?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping me into this thing, Harl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Kitty.\" she answered with a grunt as she forced the zipper past a particularly stubborn bulge of Selina Kyle's blubber, \"Anythin' for a friend, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" she huffed back, winded from the simple exertion it took to stand on her own two feet and lean against the wall. Her lethargic lifestyle had atrophied those perfectly sculpted muscles and replaced them, and then some, with pound upon pound of useless jiggly flesh. Tipping the scales at just about six hundred pounds, she was a far cry from the lithe and limber claim to fame she had prided herself on for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally closing the cold metal teeth shut, Harley smiled and slapped Selina's wide bottom, watching with not-so-subtle amusement as the fleshy mass that was her buttcheek wobble inside the second skin of her outfit. Maybe just another, this time the other one. The same chill of arousal rushed throughout the horny harlequin as she watched both cheeks reverberate violently with her simple slapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, Harl... I don't think I'll be able to get back into this thing if you pop me out of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley couldn't help but lick her lips. That would definitely be something she'd like to see. However she would control herself; pissing off a woman of Selina's size wasn't exactly the brightest thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" she answered, trailing slightly, \"Ya need any help down the hallway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina exhaled heavily as she pushed herself from the wall, tottering slightly as her unstable weight nearly toppled her. \"No, I... I think I got it.\" she puffed as she lifted the cowl and goggles; her chubby cheeks bursting out of the mouth's line. Slowly Selina attempted towards the doorway, only to feel her fleshy hips press uncomfortably against the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... a little help with the door would be appreciated though.\" she said meekly, growing bright red beneath her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy, now Harley had an <i>excuse</i> to touch those glorious thunderbuns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away.\" Harley answered with a sense of duty about her, hardly hiding the sinful glee that she anticipated from manhandling those killer jiggly buns of Selina's. With one doughy hand she pushed into the pliable flesh, more groping than pushing at this point. She giggled, feeling herself grow unusually flushed as she put her own considerable weight into Selina's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow ow ow!!\" Selina whined, \"Harley, what are you doing back there?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just messin'.\" she grinned, \"Don' worry Kitty-Cat I'll get you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubblebutted blonde then grinned like so much the cat she was resembled as she kneed the glorious ass-flesh that spread before her. Unlike Ivy, who got her jollies from force feeding everyone else until they were bigger than her, or Talia, who was simply just a histrionic glutton for attention, Harley was much more into kinetic relationships. With these newfound appetites of hers, Harley got more pleasure out of anything than getting to play with jelly-bellies or to just squish someone's extra rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harleeeey!\" Selina moaned as the addressed girl proceeded to play her massive asscheeks like a bongo drum, \"Knock it off! I told Ivy to wait for me--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown princess of crime cut off the vastly overfed cat with a tug in the opposite direction. Miraculously, Selina's stuckfast middle was released from the wooden grip of the doorway. Selina panted, receiving quite a fright from the sudden pull. \"Great job, Harl, but that's kinda not the way I need to go.\" she huffed as she turned back to the still-grinning pigtailed girl, \"Ivy's just down the hallway, if I can get just two steps out I can lean on the wall and hobble over. You think you can help me out--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she was pushed, this time down to the couch. Selina grunted as she made impact with the re-reinforced sofa. \"Harley!\" she hollered, \"Knock it off! You know I can't get up when I'm down here.\" Harley waddled over to Selina with a hungry glimmer in her bright baby blue eyes, a painted black smile across her face as her chubby cheeks dimpled with giddy glee. She giggled, sending her belly aquiver, and took one step forward towards the now pinned Selina Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelled, onto her tree-trunk knees, and began caressing the leathery dome that was Selina's lowest roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley!\" Selina fought back, shifting fruitlessly in her seat, \"I'd imagine you've probably heard this before, but you're crazy!\" she hollered, \"Talia and Ivy are right down the hall, they can hear us--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puh-lease, Kitty Kitty.\" Harley said with a provocative tone, \"They're doped outta their gourds on sweets. Besides... I don't think they're wriggin' their way outta their rooms any time soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Harley pounced. Literally, the woman jumped onto Selina's sizable stomach and grabbed her big puffy cheeks, pulling her in for a rough session of tongue. A woman possessed, Harley began pawing at Selina's many spare folds, particularly stretching her little fingers across her sizable lovehandles and going to town. Her big butt high in the air, Harley pressed herself against Selina as she mouthlested her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, much to her own surprise, Selina did little to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, I--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh... Nuh-uh-uh Miss Kyle.\" she said seductively, \"Now I have three big ladies aaaaaall to myself. And you don't find anything wrong with that, now do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually I--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley dove back in for another long kiss as she slammed herself into Selina passionately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little less wrong.\"</span></div></div>",

At once, the sounds of rumbling and shuffling filled the Anonymous' Louisiana branch as the massive redhead on the other end situated herself. \"You alright over there, O?\" Dinah asked from her seated position across from Question, \"They haven't found you out, have they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. Nothing like that.\" Oracle's answer was a little too lighthearted, \"Just... just, ughhh... there we go.\" she let out a heavy sigh of relaxation on the other end, resulting in heavy static right in Stephanie's ear. \"Sorry 'bout that... mrpm...

The problem is, every spore has its own strand of DNA. It can have anywhere from five different kinds, all from five different plants. I've been working on picking apart the DNA from each of the samples you've sent back to me, and I think I might finally have a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've got a cure?\" Holly asked hopefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" came the cowl again, \"Or I would have used it on myself.

The good news is that it should be ready for delivery, and I've got ten vials of the stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the bad news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a while for it to synthesize; I had to leave what I have on the pot for two days. You've got to wait for it to cool down or it doesn't work. It's extremely volatile, so if you get it too hot it'll explode, but if you get it too cold it'll kill the poison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do?\" Dove asked as she sat on her heavy hiney next to her bloated sister, \"We can't all make it back to Gotham City, I mean just look at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, of course, referring to the immobilized seniors of the group. Question's derriere kept her completely pinned to the ground as her bulging stomach demanded that she kept it fed. Canary's was no better, though much larger than Montoya's. The two of them exchanged guilty glances, knowing that they had weighed their team down in both the literal and figurative sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the juniors were just as bad lately. Hawk and Dove had bloated into twin tubs of imposingly built blubber. Dawn's incredible muffin top only exploded downwards as her lower half expanded every passing day, where Holly's bloated bust line only yielded back pain as she let her stomach swell and churn with sweets daily. Though, as an unforeseen added bonus, the constant threat of bodily failure had yielded them the ability to transform into their respective forms at will. So, yeah, there was that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl's titanic tonnage was only movable by her super strength, but that was starting to get a little far-fetched as she started huffing and puffing from even the slightest of steps. More often than not, she would hover anywhere she needed to go, but she was starting to sink lower to the ground now. Batgirl was no better than Hawk, who despite general protests regarding her usefulness, had been labeled as the Oracle Oracle. Since all she seemed to do was sit down and channel Oracle's commands and stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one unaffected remained to be Holly Robinson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion didn't like it. She would frown, but her face was getting too fat to stuff into her mask anymore. She knew that there was no hope for her and Dinah, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... I think you girls should leave me and Dinah here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks aghast were shared amongst them, audibly questioning their leader's decision. Of course they were all against the idea, having little to no leading skills themselves. Hell, Dove could barely keep Holly out of trouble, let alone an entire squad. Supergirl was in no shape to lead, and Hawk's leadership would only send them into disaster. That left one, one unwilling, but one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly, you have to go.\" Renee said softly in her accented slur, \"Take these girls and lead them to victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q... I, I can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to save Selina, then you'll go.\" she said softly as she leaned to her side and gripped Holly's hands between her own portly peelers, \"Be quick, be sneaky, and be subtle.\"</span></div></div>",

No matter what country one is from or what time it is there, those hurdling through the inky black abyss of space over time find it rather easy to forget that, in their home back on whichever planet they may be from, there are those who may be sound asleep as they wake or who ritualistically go about their day while those up above slumber. This being said, it was no shock to find that no one really seemed to notice when what must have been days have passed by like mere seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds filled with debaucherous, sinful indulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bea?\" came the deep Norwegian drawl of Tora Olafsdotter, Ice, as she floated around uselessly in Zatanna's field. Her muscular body gone long before, the zero-gravity habitat that the spell slinging glutton had introduced had only served to further atrophy her underwhelming physique and bloat it into overwhelming properties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think we're taking this a little far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" came the equally throaty Brazilian accent of Beatriz da Costa, Fire, as she floated by the neighboring body of Olafsdotter, \"Taking what too far?\" she reitterated as a turkey club floated its way into her mouth. Like her best friend, Fire had bloated up to resemble a floating mass of blubber, though one of considerably more mocha-colored quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole eating thing...\" Ice said solemnly, \"I think we might have a--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, something scrumptious was forced past Tora's full fat lips. Her instincts formed over her extended period of gluttony kicked in, and she was left as she was seconds ago; chewing and gleefully enjoying the great gift from Zatanna's magical conjuration skills. She hummed lightly to herself and closed her big blue eyes, enjoying the wonderful food that she had been blessed with. Her hands, wrists still covered in the remains of her furry gloves, traveled to her globular expanse, rubbing herself contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire nodded half-heartedly, only half listening to her in the first place, but now having completely forgotten whatever it was that Tora was yammering on about. She, too, had been given a new treat for indulgence. After all, she <i>had</i> asked Zatanna if she could hook her up with a magical food orbit, not unlike the one she had claimed for herself. The least she could do was indulge in it. Or so she rationed until becoming giddy at the sight of yet another triple-chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down up there!\" came the heavy barking of Huntress, floating underneath the pair by maybe a few yards or so, \"I can't get any sleep with you two yammering on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena Bertelini had become a bit of a sourpuss, moreso of a sourpuss than usual anyway, as she continued to expand and bloat outwards. Weighing a toppling half-ton, the Huntress was all but useless in her pledge to fight crime, seeming to be one of the few who realized this simple fact. However, while she may have been more than a little grumpy towards her situation, Fire and Ice were far from the only things keeping her up. The constant onslaught of food didn't aid her lack of slumber, or anyone else's really. However it didn't really matter whether or not they felt like eating anyway. Their appetites were so large now that all of them had begun eating in their sleep, which their new protector Zatanna was more than happy to oblige... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she got too fat to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor months, they had just been floating there, getting rounder like so much the miniature planets they resembled now. Their orbiting bodies unable to defy Zatanna's magic, while Zatanna herself was far too fat to even call of what she had done... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...

She plops down on her rear all day and stares into her own inky abyss- blindness. Though while she may be blind, she manages to find a way to get herself to the fridge or wherever other food may be hiding from her lack of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInbetwixt two of her fat fingers is a tarot card.

Thanks to a combination of a potent mind-altering fungus carefully groomed and grown by Poison Ivy in her many hours of spare time and a custom-fit top hat \u2018donated\u2019 by Jarvis Tetch, the formidably powerful (but incurably gluttonous) Zatanna Zatara was now a tool to by used by Talia and her titanic teammates! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia traced over the outline of her newest conquest\u2019s distended stomach with her chubby fingers, Zatanna\u2019s big blue eyes unblinking and unresponsive. The drug kept her mind sedated while the hat allowed anyone access to her powerful magic through the touchscreen mechanism. So for all intents and purposes, Zatanna was now just one big reality-altering machine for Talia to use as she saw fit. It had worked with the Question\u2014who\u2019s to say that Zatanna couldn\u2019t be used for other things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen wide, darling.\u201d Talia said with a smile as she popped one of the brownies past Zatanna\u2019s lips, entering the command \u2018eat\u2019 onto the touch screen. To her delight Zatanna began chewing, \u201cThere\u2019s a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia smirked, satisfied with her new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConquering the corporate world just became a whole lot easier.</span></div></div>",

Men and women alike flocked to supermarkets, grocery stores, and anywhere else that they could get their fix all across the country. As their business expanded from Gotham, to Metropolis to Keystone and Central City, then into Star City, it seemed that there was no stopping their growing market on the snack food industry. Many tried and failed to duplicate the spores that Ivy produced on a daily basis through the use of special plants, but there was simply no one who could challenge their stranglehold on the market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was <i>before</i> they mindwiped a magician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna Zatara was yet another card up their sleeves, and one that could be played over and over and over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out small. Once they realized that they could manipulate reality around them, any unfortunate heroes who found themselves on the trail of the mysterious conglomerate taking the country by storm would find themselves... well, Talia had coined the term \"reassigned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than let the Question\u2014their first \"test subject\"\u2014get hot on their collectively corpulent tails, everyone had agreed that she was better off hooked to the stuff, and in a position where she couldn't do any damage. With Jenna Duffy watching over her, the faceless woman and former cop was sure to serve them dutifully as a line worker. And if she caused any trouble then... well, Talia knew plenty of people capable of taking out an out-of-shape saddlebag of a cop and a <i>former</i> vigilante.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, among the corporate heads and many chins that made up Anonymous' leadership, their efficient \"disposal\" of Renee Montoya had shown them that the sky was truly the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course, being a bunch of ill-balanced former supervillains, this new commodity was abused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, it started slowly at first. It was agreed that they were to move out of Wayne Towers post-haste, and into their corporate office. Then it was agreed that the top floor of their corporate office building, as it pierced the skyline of Gotham City, was to be magically refurnished and rebuilt into the perfect living space for the four super-sized supervillainesses. With Ivy and Selina's lack of mobility, no spell had been spared in ensuring them the luxury that (they felt) had been deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cozy.\" Selina purred as she nestled into her meaty shoulders, her hands resting pleasantly on her gut, \"I could get used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmm...</i>\" Ivy stretched her pillowy arms upwards in a thick lazy yawn, \"Why not cut to the chase and make ourselves queens? We certainly live like queens. Why not make it official?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have every magic user on our tail? No thank you.\" Talia lounged next to Zatanna, tracing small circles in the bulges of her fishnet stockings, \"No, we've got to do this subtley. Anything less and we risk blowing our entire operation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Red, dontcha listen?\" Harley bounced, her fat rear flopping up and down, \"Subtlety's <i>my</i> middle name! Ain't that right, Tallie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I find that hard to believe.\" Talia cut her eyes at the fat-bottomed clown, \"As the resident expert in magic, I feel like it would be best if <i>I</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia's suggestion was met with groans of displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014Yes, <i>I</i>, watched over our little friend here.\" Talia curled a lock of Zatanna's black hair around her chubby middle finger, \"It's in all of our best interests to keep our little operation going, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, yes, she was right. Over the course of the next few weeks, Zatanna was kept well taken care of by the colossal corporate titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it slowly became apparent that <i>someone</i> was misusing Zatanna's powers without anyone's input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a search feature on that hat that Jervis had made for them, but it didn't take the World's Greatest Detective to know that something was up when...</span></div></div>",

One of the workers, a blonde girl barely out of school, waved as she came in. She was new; in fact, Renee trained her herself (even if she couldn't remember her name). She was pretty chubby herself, though she was somewhere in the mid 200s as opposed to Renee, who was actually hiding from scales at the and needed an extra string to tie her apron. A tubby belly spilled over her waistline, but unlike her bigger coworker, her apron managed to hug it enough to keep it in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunching in and waddling to her station, the obese ex-officer muttered: \"I really hope it's a quiet day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Montoya...!\" So much for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna Duffy tottered down the production line with a clipboard held tight in her chubby fist, a far cry from the confident stride she was probably going for, but then she was a far cry from the size to be able to do it. Her big belly peaked out from under her custom-fit Anonymous uniform, slyly untucking it from her bobbing waistline. Employees less than half her size tried to look busy as she waddled by, but she just beelined to the end of the production line, even if she could barely manage a wheeze by then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee sighed. It was ridiculous, she hadn't even <i>done </i>anything! Well, she <i>never </i>did anything whenever her bloated boss came waddling after her, but this time she barely clocked in. Her boss was puffing up a storm by the time she reached her (a rather impressive display as far as her chest went, as Renee noted) and would've probably doubled over if she could manage with that gut of hers. She settled for leaning on one of the conveyor belts with an alarming creak, leaving the lardy latina to wait until she caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think... ya can... hide from me?\" Duffy eventually sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Duffy, this is my position-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well forget it!\" Duffy interrupted, \"You've got the fattest ass in the building, Montoya, think I can't see ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Second fattest,\" </i>Renee seethed. Behind her, the chubby new blonde, (Brown! That's what her name was!) snickered at her, making her even angrier. Deep breaths... No point in going off on this bitch first thing in the morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I've got somethin' for ya,\" the blubbery brunette huffed, \"The Big Boss is sending down some more fresh blood. And guess who's gonna train 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee gaped, \"What?? I've already trained two people, and I'm almost brand new here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got Lance tomorrow,\" Duffy continued as if Renee hadn't spoken, \"Oh, and don't think this means I don't want you doing yer job,\" She hungrily eyed some of the products, \"I'm tired of seein' bad products from over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex cop gritted. Two guesses where the \"bad products\" would go. \"Is that all?\" Renee asked through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Duffy eyed her and simply poked one of her exposed love handles. Lately her red Anonymous polo started to creep up her back, \"Maybe keep the muffintops on the line,\" Duffy grunted, \"I don't want any newbies pickin' up after <i>you</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown snickered again and Renee flushed red. She really, <i>really </i>hated that woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low rumbling rolled over the floor and Renee blinked. \"Er...\" Her belly-heavy boss cleared her throat, \"Th-that's enough lollygaggin'! I'm late for an appointment, so  everybody, back to work! And, someone make sure Montoya doesn't eat off the line again.\" With that, the doughy Duffy awkwardly turned and waddled hurriedly back to her office, her own muffin top spilling out in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee snarled, but she held her tongue and got to work. After all, as her boss was so quick to remind her, there weren't many places for an ex-cop. She wasn't going back to the force especially now that she let herself get so big; she couldn't even fit her polo, much less her old uniform. Too fat to be an officer, too fat for private security, she might have more options if only she hadn't dived into headfirst into boxes of sugary delights after losing her badge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee stopped. No, wait. Was that right? Something didn't sound right about that. She remembered more... booze than comfort food... She shook her head to clear out the fog before. Whatever, right? In the end it didn't matter how her ass got so big or how she grew a gut bigger than Bullock's. The former cop let herself get fat, plain and simple, and all that weight wasn't going anywhere anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really laid into you,\" Brown giggled, her cute double chin wobbling as she popped one of the finished cookies from her side into her mouth. Renee glared, \"What? <i>I'm </i>supposed to watch <i>you</i>, remember? Not the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only hope that the next workers were a bit better than this one.</span></div></div>",

One by one, men and women eagerly piled out of the front door, each notably chubbier than the day they started. None were chubbier though than Renee Montoya, the boss's favorite victim. None of the factory workers seemed well equipped for a standing job but Renee in particular was ready to collapse by the end of her shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why on Earth did I choose a job on my feet?\" she groaned, gratefully pulling off her ridiculous hairnet and letting her long black locks flow down her back. She straightened her shirt back over her love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quittin' time, eh Renee?\" The new girl Brown was leaning against a conveyor belt with a box of Anonymous cookies in hand, eagerly stuffing handfuls of sweets into her fast mouth, just like she'd been doing all day, even with Renee's \"supervision\". Without her apron, her pale belly's expansion was clear and bulge of fat about an two inches thick bulged from underneath the work shirt that fit her just that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna bite big girl?\" Brown asked, \"Seriously these things are awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Addictive, more like,\" </i>Renee rolled her eyes, \"Do I even have to ask if you bought those, Brown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde grinned, \"Call me Stephanie. And you can report me if you want, but I think the boss would just start yelling at you again.\" Both girls bellies growled. Renee blushed in embarrassment but Stephanie just went back to snacking, \"Oh man, I can't get enough of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly,\" Renee snarked, \"Didn't your mother ever warn you about spoiling your dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown shook her head unsteadily but it was only a moment before the feeling passed, \"Spoiling...? No, but she did tell me about never wasting food,\" \"Seriously, have some! Don't think I didn't hear that tummy rumbling. What's the matter, you on a diet or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee bristled, \"As a matter of fact, yes,\" she said proudly, hands on hips nearly twice as wide as Stephanie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's face broke into a wide grin, \"Oh reeeally? Because all everyone could talk about in the break room was how much you keep gaining. When did this diet start, an hour ago?\" Renee sputtered indignantly. They were talking about her?? Damn her stupid coworkers and damn her fucking metabolism. She cut out all unhealthy foods a month ago and she was still gaining weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tubby new girl looked satisfied that her senior was so annoyed and went back to eating. But when Renee opened her mouth, she lost her retort noticing a clipboard poking out behind Stephanie's ponderous posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Renee muttered, waddling up to her coworker. Brown tensed up a bit, but it was for nothing as Renee wobbled right past her, grabbing the clipboard she was unknowingly sitting on, \"This is Duffy's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown tilted her head quizzically, \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This morning, she said she had an appointment, right?\" Renee asked slowly, \"But, we haven't seen her all day. It's after 5, shouldn't that be done by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably is, so what?\" Stephanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where's Duffy?\" Renee wondered aloud, \"She couldn't have left, there's no way we'd miss her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she went out the back then?\" Stephanie suggested. Something about her bigger coworker's tone made her uneasy, so the girl went back to stuffing her face, this time to soothe her nerves instead of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way out of Duffy's office leads back here...\" the ex cop murmured suspiciously, \"Hmm... Duffy sure was in a hurry to get to that meeting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renee,\" Stephanie said uneasily, \"You're really making me nervous.\" Renee started waddling for the back office, more purpose in her stride it'd had in months, \"So what if Duffy's still here? What's it matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Jenna Duffy doesn't do overtime. And because my gut's been telling me something was wrong ever since I started working here. Stephanie,\" she said over her shoulder, \"Go home. I'm gonna see if the boss's 'meeting' ever finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching door, she heard a voice, quiet and pained, flavored with hiccups and burps every few words, \"Am... I done yet ma'am...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuffy! But who was she talking to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...\" a second voice said. The second voice was female, with an accent Renee couldn't quite place. It sounded odd in contrast to Duffy's. Duffy sounded slow and labored. This second voice was fast and playful, \"Lemme think. Do ya think yer full yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a belch; so loud that even through the door, Renee had no problem hearing it, \"I'm... full... ma'am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few excited claps, \"Great!\" The accented woman sounded elated, \"Now we can start on dessert!\" Duffy let out another belch and a defeated groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee reached out hesitated with her hand on the door knob. The whole situation stunk and nagged at her like an itch she wouldn't scratch. But, she wasn't a cop anymore. And even if she was, everything in her \"investigation\" was circumstantial at best. Brown was right. Why was she doing this? Why did it bother her so much whether or not Duffy was still there? Why did it matter who was in the office with her? Did she know for sure if something was even wrong? Did she even  know if Duffy was crooked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe not,\"</i> a small voice said, <i>\"But, it's still a good question.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before she could think again, Renee opened the door.</span></div></div>",

The spherical brunnette must've doubled in size since she waddled out onto the floor that morning. Her shirt had been taken off, laying limply across the table and her entire naked torso exploded outward in an avalanche of stuffed flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd next to her stood a voluptuous bubbly bottomed blonde. Her hair was in pigtails and she wore a tight, form fitting pencil skirt. She wore glasses and with a light smile, the woman held a cookie out under Duffy's nose.  Hands on her belly, Renee's bitchy boss miserably accepted, letting out a moan as the blonde was forced to lean against her mountainous middle in order to reach her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like got a visitor,\" the woman smiled. Another cookie went into Duffy, \"Don't mind us, this is just a little... dinner date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee didn't know what to make of any of this. She didn't expect to see her boss shirtless, and she certainly didn't expect to see what might just be foreplay. And that woman... Her voice had the same semi cacophonous tone as the one Renee overheard, but she certainly wasn't talking like her.All she could do was numbly hold up Duffy's clipboard and stutter, \"Y-you... um... forgot this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Montoya...\" Duffy groaned before cupcake was stuffed in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah,\" The blonde tutted her accent returning as she said, \"If yer mouth's busy talkin', that means you ain't eating.\" She turned her attention back to the ample Anonymous employee, and her unaccented tone returned, \"Now then. You're alone aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms...Q...\" Jenna Duffy was so stuffed she could barely speak, \"What do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual,\" the strange woman asnwered simply, \"I was getting bored with just you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching accents, stuffing her boss, this woman was nuts! \"L-look,\" Renee said, \"I'm just gonna... walk out of here and forget I ever saw any of this. Okay?\" That might've been a lie. Even if she wasn't going to report this to... <i>\"I dunno, someone? Who do I even go to?\" </i>Renee had a feeling that Duffy's bare, watermelon breasts was going to be in her head for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the curvy blonde just grinned, \"Now, why would I letcha do that?\" she asked as she started going towards the ex cop. Renee wanted to put her guard up, but something about how the woman's massive hips rolled and swayed had her stunned. The blonde stood in front of her, easing towards the large latina while delicately placing her hands on Renee's big brown belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should eat first...\" she said holding a cookie up to Renee. Renee's mouth watered. Against all her best wishes, the former officer's soft lips parted, accepting the sugary treat. \"Good girl...\" the strange woman cooed, squeezing her soft gut. She fed her the rest of the box while Renee tried futilely to stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm guessing you're alone, which means I don't hafta pretend.\" The blonde took off her glasses and her smile got a lot wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to leave,\" Renee huffed trying to turn for the door. The woman's hands tightened on her meaty middle, spinning her back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just got here,\" she said excitedly, offering Renee another box. No! Not the thin mints! So... good... The blonde drew closer, letting her ample bosom press into Renee's fatter chest. The cookies additives took effect and Renee was eating as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna do with ya, Renee?\" \"Ms. Q\" asked. Renee wasn't listening, she was too busy mowing through the cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started nibbling on the latina's earlobe and Renee bit back a moan while stuffing her face with more cookies. Her mind was clouded with the drugs in the cookies and simple lust.The blonde took back over feeding while Renee's hands tentatively reached for the other woman's perfect bubble of an ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde grinned as she felt Renee's fingers sink into one bulbous cheek, \"No no. Not yet.\" Renee whined. It'd been so long since she'd been with someone! Months since Kate broke up with her and seeming increasingly impossible as she continued to pile on pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit back and relax, first\" she said, pushing Renee back towards the side of the office and the ex cop felt her massive ass sinking into what felt like a giant marshmallowy swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What the hell am I sitting on?\"</i> Renee wondered for a moment before Ms. Q was on top of her, handing her a cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren'tcha gonna eat?\" she asked. Renee barely stiffled a cry as she tore into the delicious dessert. Ms. Q unwrapped another one and the ex cop devoured it too. And another. And another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee's belly grew. Her polo shirt, previously snug, was rising high on the curve of her fat, caramel gut. Renee's deep belly button was completely bare, and Ms. Q found it inviting enough to dip a finger into its depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer makin' good progress this time,\" she said, leaning her significant mass atop Renee's larger form, \"Who knew all I had to do was shake my ass to make yours bigger?\"</span></div></div>",

Renee opened her mouth to eat, but didn't stop her questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... ugh... you look familiar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ask a lotta questions,\" Ms. Q stuffed another handful of cookies into her captive's mouth, \"Wouldn't ya rather just enjoy the moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not right,\" the ex cop insisted. One hand went behind her, squishing deeply into whatever was behind her. It felt warm... and was it breathing?? \"Wha?\" Renee sputtered with cookies bulging in her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Renee entered the room, her super-sized boss was naked from the waist up and a stranger was feeding her to the point of popping. So Renee almost forgave herself for not noticing the even bigger woman sitting at right of the room. Literally right beneath her was a massively fat woman, big enough that Renee mistook her for a seat. Her blob like breasts bulged out of a white corset while the enormous belly Renee made contact with swelled out from beneath it, nearly touching the ground while seated. Fishnet stockings gaped as they attempted to contain her fleshy thighs that were as big as barrels. Renee never saw so much flesh bulging out of one place! Her cheeks were the size of apples and a triple chin adorned her neck. She wore a magician's top hat of all things and beneath that black top hat were blue eyes that were blank and unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Q sighed, \"Guess that's over with. Congrats, Question,\" she sneered, \"This is the fourth time you've caught me. Yer a lot smarter than Tallie gave ya credit for, I'll tell ya that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Renee snarled, struggling to rise from the behemoth magician. Sinking into the quagmire of flesh, Renee couldn't get up, no matter how she struggled. She was just too big and there was nothing to grab onto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That never gets old!\" Ms. Q laughed, \"To be fair, Big Z here, is a lot bigger than the last time you forgot seeing her.\"  She patted the ocean of flab and giggled as it shook like gelatin, \"Even with my not so girlish figure, I'm thinkin little Zatanna weighs more than me n' Duffy combined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she pressed a button on the magician's hat and a small screen popped out. She tapped away for a few moments before the previously silent magician uttered: \"Noitseuq Stae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee stared in horror as she grabbed another box of thin mints and began gobbling them down. Unable to control her own arm, she polished off the box and immediately took another that this \"Ms. Q\" was holding out for her \"Who the hell are you?\" Renee demanded, still choking down thin mints, much to her dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" the blonde's face twisted into a sick grin before she parroted, \"I'm yer boss's boss. And I'm tellin ya to take the day off tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee woke up in her apartment feeling like she had a bad dream. Somehow she knew she piled on more weight in spite of her diet and she really had no idea how. Her belly towered to the ceiling, and she already knew there was no way she was making it to work that day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renee did her best not to hang onto the  \"glory days\" of her time on the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed like so long ago, but it felt like she had been a tight, toned member of Gotham's finest yesterday. Her life since signing on to work at the Factory was so fluid, every day was so similar, it was no surprise to the large Latina lineman that it all sort've bled together. Ever since Commissioner Loeb had asked her to turn in her badge two years ago. Three? Had it been three years since she had squeezed herself into that tight little uniform? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to match the dates up, making them work... something in the back of her mind told her to just let it go. Why bring up painful memories on her big day, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, all Anonymous Personnel\u2014can we have a little quiet on the floor, please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly on morning shift, a curvaceous blonde tapped on the microphone with small, dainty finger. Her nails clicked against the head, catching the attention of all those below them. From high above on the porch of the foreman's office, Renee could see everyone on shift. Bulky bodies meant for lifting and sorting, tired eyes from working late shifts, and fat bellies from years of standing around and eating on a lineman's salary. She recognized most of them, she'd trained a lot of them. Brown and Drake she could pick out of the crowd. Their chubby cheeks were parted in pleasant smiles, looking up. They knew what was going to happen, Montoya couldn't have kept a secret if she tried. She'd broke down and told them at the Zero Hour a few days ago, and they'd had about five rounds of hot wings to celebrate. Bertelini must have been in the john again, fucking around on her phone like normal. Renee figured it was her loss; she'd miss the big announcement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we all know that we're going to miss Jenna Duffy.\" Dr. Quinzelle said with a certain amount of tongue in cheek, \"Regardless of how everything went down, Ms. Duffy was a large asset to our company, and no one will ever truly fill her place in our hearts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of snickers went through the crowd below. This was far more professionalism than that walrus deserved. She'd finally been canned for sneaking enough food to feed a small army every shift, something that should have happened well <i>before</i> Dr. Quinzelle started prowling the factory like a mallet looking for a mole. She'd blown up so much that she could barely fit through the door to the foreman's office, so why Renee had to blow the whistle was anyone's best guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, I'd like all of you to welcome our newest factory Foreman, the Que\u2014<i>I mean</i> Renee Montoya!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolite claps filled the air as Brown stuck both fingers in her mouth and whistled. Renee lumbered forward, the flooring beneath her protesting ever so slightly. She waved to her former peers, her pillowy mounds of arm fat wobbling excitedly as her chunky cheeks dimpled in pride. This was so worth having to get a new suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust two\u2014three?\u2014years ago, Renee had been a dirty cop on the take. Loeb had taken her badge and made her feel worthless. She'd lost Kate. She'd gained more than two hundred pounds. She'd put up with <i>Jenna Duffy</i> of all people, poking her and prodding her. Making her feel useless. She couldn't even remember all of the humiliation that she'd been through. But now... it was all worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something... something didn't feel right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you.\" Renee continued along anyway, ignoring the sick feeling in her stomach as she addressed the crowd of what were now to be her employees, rather than her friends and coworkers, \"I... I look forward to working with all of you as your foreman. I know how things are on the line. My only wish was that Vic were here\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho the hell was Vic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... excuse me.\" Renee coughed, \"I mean my <i>mother</i>. My only wish was that my mother were here to witness the excitement and pride that I feel today, moving forward in our great company... and then I could tell her to get back to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellies wobbled in jest as Renee's quick save kept the crowd from turning awkward. Who the hell was Vic? She'd never met anyone named Victor. <i>Madre de dios</i>, sometimes she felt like she was going crazy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In celebration of our new foreman's democratic election, I've taken the effort to provide plenty of pizza, donuts, and a sundae bar for the next few days.\" Dr. Quinzelle's announcement was met with far much more candor than Renee's promotion across the board, \"I have no doubt in my mind that Renee will serve me dutifully as I <i>personally</i> ensure the productivity rates of this plant remain on the rise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Quinzelle's baby blue eyes looked Renee up and down. She gnawed a bit on her black bottom lip, just subtle enough to go undetected by the crowd below. She could dress it up all she wanted, try to pretend that she had gotten her promotion honestly. But Renee knew the real reason why this blonde <i>bruja</i> had filled Jenna's space so quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the floor slowly returned to normal below them, Renee turned tail into the foreman's office. Over the sound of the machinery, no one would hear the sharp SLAP of Dr. Quinnzelle's hand against Foreman Montoya's acres of caramel colored ass cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all happened so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door shut and Dr. Q was confident that no one would hear them, she pressed the massive latina woman against the wall, forcing her into a deep kiss. The smaller woman sunk into Renee's expanse, her vast body folding around her boss's as she made her way forcefully to the overfed forman's lips. Something about the way this woman kissed, Renee had never felt anything like it. It was like everything else melted away, except for Dr. Quinzelle\u2014\"Call me Harley, sweet cheeks\", her boss had told her with a sly wink just days before Duffy's termination. She said it was home made by a friend of hers. Made it with plants from the rainforest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kissing was good. It had been so long since Kate. So long since Renee had known the pleasures of anything other than extra helpings at Big Belly Burger. The fact that such a hot woman was coming onto her so strongly was downright intoxicating. Even though her ass was enormous. Even though her belly was so big she couldn't see her feet. Renee loved the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly, she loved what came next most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be full yet.\" Harley had a way of talking when they were together that was so different from the professionalism she portrayed on the floor. It was so much more manic, and exuberant. It was almost like she was two different people! \"I know there's some room in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee hadn't felt so fulfilled in years. Even Kate hadn't been able to get her going like Harley could. She felt like such a shit for doing this. Harley was her boss. She should have gotten promoted on her own merits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what they did\u2014they always did what was right. Who the fuck was they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the allure and attraction between them was undeniable. Harley had made that very clear the first time she'd grabbed her ass on the floor. And that after Duffy had been canned, Harley had called her into her office and told her that if she wanted the job she'd have to <i>earn</i> it and... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDios Mio, it was time to stop thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get outta yer head.\" Harley said in a low sort of voice, \"Keep eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee looked like a beach whale. For every pie that they'd ordered into the break room, Harley must have gotten just as much for Renee. All for Renee. Everything was for Renee. Harley said so. Her caramel colored corpulence domed out in front of her, shiny with sweat and taut like a drum. She leaned back in her office chair as far as it would go, looking so much worse for wear. God, how much had she eaten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much was she going to keep eating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\" Harley cupped the swell of Renee's hanging gut as it sagged towards the floor of her new office, \"You just keep eatin' what mama tells ya to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye..\" Renee panted weakly, \"But Dr. Q...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Harley</i>.\" her boss corrected, \"Call me Harley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Harley...\" Renee burped, \"I can't eat anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodie!\" the blonde woman lit up like a lightbulb, \"Then it's time for dessert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee got another one of those weird tingles in the back of her head again, but she was too full to fully explore it. How could she think on a full stomach? How could she possibly think with all of the food and sex that Dr. Quinzelle had been filling her up with? How long had it been since she'd felt so satisfied on every level? Food, sex, food, sex, food, food, sex, food, food, food...more food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee shook her head. No, no she couldn't. She felt like she was going to explode as it was. Where were these thoughts coming from, and why did she keep having them? Why did she only seem to have them around Harley? Was she one of those Metas that were on the news? Some kind of mind controlling power?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that was stupid. Renee was just fat. And greedy. And really, <i>really</i> horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in her life, why Question things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her phone buzzed\u2014it was a text from Stephanie. They were all going to go out for celebratory dinner at the Zero Hour, how could she have forgotten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it 5 'o' clock already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh... Brown...\" Renee burbled as Harley picked up her phone and read the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it.\" Harley locked her phone and tossed it aside, far from the humongous heifer's reach, \"You've got plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only fraternizing I want you to do is with me. Got it?\" Harley sneered, before correcting herself, \"And maybe with the product line. One of the many <i>perks</i> of staying in line in your new job... capiche?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee's mouth was soon too full of cupcake to protest. Stephanie's text went unanswered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This new world that had been created for them, the heads of the Anonymous Corporation, couldn't have been designed more perfectly. With the power of a reality-altering, mind-wiping magician, there was almost no limit to what they could accomplish. In their heyday as Gotham's criminals, nothing short of B-list in any villain's rogues gallery, the world might have been painted into a very different picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe childish trimmings of Harley's insanity might have twisted the world into a Saturday morning cartoon show just as easily as it could have been warped into a mundane life free of clowns and crime. Poison Ivy's frightening favoritism and despotic protection of the Green that she communed with would have surely meant the enslavement (if not annihilation altogether) of mankind. Selina's taste for riches and wealth might have made her into the most well-to-do member of Gotham high society. Their goals were so different from one another that a communal living space within a shared, if altered, reality would have been almost impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, after succumbing to their innermost desires as the gluttons that they had become, the \"ideal world\" that Zatanna's magic had created for them was much easier to manage. Between them, there were only three desires: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) To not be disturbed<br>\r\n2.) Comfort<br>\r\nand above all else<br>\r\n3.) <i>Pleasure</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo some, like Harley, that meant a steady herd of cattle that she could fatten up as she saw fit. With Renee Montoya filling the (expansive) space of former foreman Jenna Duffy, she would surely be occupied for some time. And then she could move onto the next one. And then the next. Harley Quinn had taken to her position as Efficiency Manager so very well, getting to use her psychology degree to its fullest. It wasn't as fun as swinging around a mallet and busting ATMs, but watching her playthings squirm beneath her was a different, familiar sort of thrill that she enjoyed <i>immensely</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor others, pleasure took on a different connotation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire warehouse was devoted to caring for and ensuring the wellbeing of Anonymous' most precious resource\u2014Dr. Pamela Isely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time, after her accident, she had renamed herself Poison Ivy, the green-skinned Gaia who worked tirelessly to defend plant life. But that was the name of a terrorist and, in a sense, she had gone straight. She no longer wanted to consume the world in flora, rather she was contented merely to consume. Endlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mutation had been a curious thing in this new reality. After a certain point, she had stopped requiring the rare and exotic flower that she had derived the mind-expanding and highly addictive additive that laced any and all of her company's products. Her unique nature as a human empowered by the Green meant that, the more time she spent around her precious buds, the more like them she became. And these were very curious flowers indeed. Parasitic in nature and highly destructive, in another lifetime, they would have gone extinct. But thanks to the timely intervention of a woman so bent on saving plant-life and looking to get rich quick, they were saved of that fate. And Ivy had been sealed to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwollen to complete immobility, the great green glutton was helpless to watch as an entire staff buzzed and whirred around her. Swabbing her, wiping her down, and collecting her various fluids for use in the company that <i>she</i> had helped found. All while keeping her fed rather comfortably round the clock of course. Not only was her chemical output firmly rooted in her caloric input, it was a requirement of her further mutation. As she'd grown larger and more like her precious babies, her body had begun metabolizing sugars and fats so differently that, for all intents and purposes, she really was more plant than woman now. And consider just <i>how much</i> woman she was now, that was really saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while she may not have liked her helpless state, there were a few perks to being viewed as a mindless eating machine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret Pye couldn't figure out why she kept gaining weight. Lab personnel were prohibited from sampling from what they collected from their source. Even as a lowly janitor, she had been given the same prohibition. The rest of Gotham City might have been blowing up like a bunch of balloons, but Maggie figured that she ought to have been safe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had figured wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the six months that she had been assigned here, busted for another petty larceny and desperate for a job, she'd put on nearly eighty pounds. That was insane. She had been so slender beforehand, so birdy and svelte. To see herself covered in all this... <i>fat</i> made her wretch. No way she was going to go out flying as Magpie any time soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeding time, Boss.\" Maggie managed to say as the hermetical doors shut and sealed behind her, \"Same time, same channel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, looking at what had become Pam Isely, the plump pheasant didn't figure that she had much room to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's green greatness trembled as she squirmed in place. She had grown far too fat to stand or move on her own, but the movements that she made would reverberate for some time in the vastness of her folds. To think that this great big ball of green glob had once been a woman. Maggie shuddered at the thought of ever getting that fat. So big and round that she couldn't fit through the door to her apartment. So fat that all she wanted to do was eat, eat, eat all day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's forest-green lips slipped into a struggling smirk, her cheeks so swollen that her expression was almost illegible. Beneath her chins and her layers of facial fat, Ivy still very much had a mind. One that was focused on food, yes, but she wasn't so far gone that she had forgotten about her powers. Pheromone control had been one of the first tricks she'd learned after the Accident that had turned her into Poison Ivy the Eco Terrorist, and it had carried her well into her life as Poison Ivy, the living breathing source of Anonymous Industries' most addictive products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough more than a ton in weight, Ivy's intellect was by far the most striking thing about her. A pity that people seemed to forget that when faced with her magnanimous massiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum.\" Isely said in her pretty voice, \"Come... come closer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown far too fat to feed herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like a sapling quivering in the presence of a mighty oak, Magpie hesitated. Who wouldn't? Ivy was this enormous green... <i>thing</i>. She didn't even look like a woman anymore. Just a giant leaf-colored marshmallow, positively swollen with fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwollen with soft, jiggly, fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor someone so bent on the destruction of mankind at one point in her life, Ivy had come to appreciate the touch of a man. Or a woman. Anyone. To feel their fingers against her acres of expanse, to feel them squeeze her incredible girth between their hands. She shook like a leaf, deep within her own hundreds of pounds, and quivered like a lady in waiting. She adored the sensations that only a being of her size could experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy watched as Margaret's fear slowly gave way to appreciation\u2014no, <i>adoration</i> for her size. Her beauty. Her eyes glazed and her muscles slacked. One hand extended to trace one stray roll of Ivy's enormous gut as it rose and fell like a great viridian empire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes boss...\" the former criminal gulped as Ivy twisted the chemicals in her brain to that of obedience, \"Are you... are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Always</i>.\" Ivy purred, watching her prey grow more and more docile. The spores from Ivy's hot breath made their way towards the expanding former criminal's lungs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she'd have so much fun with this one. Her babies would have a nice time inside little Magpie. Making her grow and grow like a chubby little flower, sending her out into the world full of her spores so she could spread them even further. Just like she'd done with the last girl they'd put on feeding duty. And the one before that, and the one before that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have only been one plant at a time, but Ivy had certainly enjoyed bringing this species back to the world...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Watch it Di,' the blonde woman whined, massaging the small red mark over her pudgy waist, 'some of us aren't nigh invulnerable anymore.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And if we don't hurry, none of us will be,' Diana declared,  feeling armor pinch across once flawless abs, 'if we'd acted when I first brought up this problem we might all still be normal! And are you drinking their soda?! By Hera, are you not plump enough!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's pretty good,\" Kara Zor L, super girl huffed, pausing to take another sip from a 72oz bottle of Soda, \"and you didnt seem to care that much about stuffing yourself until you started puffing up!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDiana's tan cheeks colored at the unfortunately true accusation. While from a short distance the Amazon princess looked normal (if a 6'3 eternally youthful woman with graceful muscles, athletic curves, gravity defying breasts, perfect bronze skin and shimmery jet curls could be described as normal) a closer examination revealed some changes. The long thighs between her armored boots and blue plate skirt still looked strong, but they'd lost most of their muscle definition and were slightly thicker, a similar disappearance had occurred with Diana's rippling triceps and the flesh of her forearms seemed to mushroom ever so slightly around her bracers, while her literally perfect face had a slightly softer cast to her sharp cheek bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is...technically true, I thought it was at first just a new snack craze...,\" Wonder Woman offered testily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snack trend she and every other woman in America had soon been addicted to. Anonymous had sent out free samples in a brilliant marketing ploy and after one bite Diana had lost almost all restraint around the pastries, cakes, cookies, pies and bars of the food, gorging herself whenever she was in private. For several months her Amazon metabolism and her own athletic life style had rendered the Amazon immune to the weight gain that hit street level heroines by the bushel. It seemed alien's or those with super powers were immune, but slowly the weight gain epidemic had crept up the power levels until Diana had felt the first snug pinch of her armor. She'd gained ten pounds since and had gathered every heroine she could to stop the threat. The warrior princess still looked like an erotic dream, but one that needed to hit the gym after a tropical cruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now we need to do something about it!\" The Amazon said, dramatically snapping a fist into her palm, \"before it's too late! That's why I put out the call to every superheroine on earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And only five of us showed?\" Kara squeaked, taking another slurp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt already seemed too late for her companions, each of them an increasingly plump ghost of Christmas future for Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The five of us can get to the bottom of this scheme and surely we can end it, by the grace of Hera,' Wonder Woman told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah but...what if we have to fight someone?' Supergirl squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara-Zor-El sat on one stool, chunky thighs flowing across the dusty vinyl and squirming as she sucked up the last of her immense soda. Once resembling a preppy cheer captain, the alien coed looked like she'd spent freshman year majoring in the freshman 15. Kara's teeny figure had, despite an addiction to Anonymous, remained thin, until two months ago when they'd bought Soder cola and added a new flavoring. Super girls humming bird metabolism had switched off at the first sip and she'd started expanding rapidly while slowly losing her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer invulnerability was fading fast by the red ring her too tight skirt left on vulnerable gut flesh. In no way was the weight suiting her: While her arms and legs were just soft, most of Karas weight was going to her belly. A freshly ripe Apple, the college freshman's tiny wasp waist had plumped up into a doughy muffin top with a fluffy soda belly that put a six inch gap of flab between her red skirt and blue top. Kara's narrow face now sported moon cheeks, a double chin and a few red spots . The rest of her was soft and plush as well, apart from her small breasts which hadn't grown an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Girls, we can't keep fighting like this,' Barbara Gordon cautioned from her seat, 'we've got to focus on our real enemies. There may be a way to reverse the effects but for that we need a sample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be easy,\" Raven huffed from where she floated nearby, \"your purse is overflowing with their snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her hand, the goth girl levitated a wrapped candy bar from Barbaras purse and began munching with gusto, quickly polishing it off and stealing another. Like Kara she was a college freshman, but there resemblances ended. The grumpy half demon Titan had retained most of her power, but was at a glance an earlier victim of the epidemic than super girl. A little over two hundred equally distributed pounds, the short sorceress had developed the bulky build of a life long fat girl, her once slight curves buried by eighty plus pounds of cellulite coated blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, a cooked bar is completely useless. We need a raw sample for analysis, one where we can figure out which raw ingredients are which. And those are mine!\" Gordon snapped as Raven stole another candy bar, trying to get up and having a difficult time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Batgirl was the heaviest woman in the room, pressing near or a little over three hundred pounds and looking older than her twenty six years. Once tall and superbly fit, the tech expert and gymnast had been a paragon of good health only to take a fateful bite of an Anonymous candy bar. Instantly addicted and with no magical defense or alien immunity, Babs had been in the first wave of victims. Swelling into an incredibly ripe pear with a shelf ass and thighs so round they pressed apart, her weakening muscles weren't able to keep up and her  mobility was fading. Suffering knee pain and constantly winded, the computer hacking red head was using a cane as her ungainly thighs trembled under the weight of her hippo ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Raven, do the apologize to Babs for that!\" Another red head demanded, soft hands on over round hips, 'You should give her your own in recompense!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire, or Koriandr was another alien, unlike Kara though, who could easily pass as human, no one would mistake the Tamaranian with her orange skin, green eyes and ankle length red hair hair as Human. However, no one cared  given the Titan leader's sexycurves and outgoing personality, even before one counted her superhuman strength, flight and ability to shoot energy bolts from her hands. While not all of her powers weren't fading, save for her slightly decreased strength and slowing flight speed, her swimsuit curves were now stretching out a pair of plus size cut offs and a crop top. Starfire had graduated to plus size model status after Anonymous' plethora of brands had taken her from 36X24X36 to 44X34X48 when she'd started gaining during the second wave of addictions. Her already large breasts were now immense head size knockers, her broad hips and pert rear fascinatingly round and broad, while her washboard belly was a plush gut dwarfed by the expansion above and beneath it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Diana's eyes the alien represented the best case scenario for a gain. Her fat was well distributed, to a distracting degree for the bisexual Amazon, and her physical abilities barely impacted. But a careful examination showed the alien hovered a little lower these days and her enabling tendencies weren't helping anyone else, especially as she dumped an entire bag of candy bars and snack cakes into Babs' over broad lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can we focus please?' Diana asked, trying to ignore how her mouth moistened at the sight of the food, 'Barbara, have you found us a target site?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second for the obese hacker to finish her mouthful, 'Yeah, I've got a couple. One of them is an automated distribution center, records on its server should point us in the right direction but I need physical access.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine then, that's our target,' Diana decided, 'as soon as the rest of us are here...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, pushed by the slightly too round booty of her own protege Cassandra Sandsmark. Like Diana, the young woman had been resistant thanks to her half divine heritage until a week or so ago and the tan blonde could still barely fit into her tight jeans, even though she now had a little muffin top and the pant's seams were looking ready to snap off her growing curves. She turned around, showing that her untoned arms were carrying multiple drink containers heavy with cappuccinos and sodas, all bearing the anonymous A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry about the drinks taking so long, there was a big line,' the freshman heroine explained, distributing the fattening drinks to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana felt she should criticize her for not only feeding them the enemy's addictive food but paying for it, but she was sucking down the cream heavy drink in a moment. As it went down, the slightly flabby Amazon noted her side kick was doting on her college roommate Kara, having supplied her with two more immense soda cups and a large bag of chips. There was a gleam in her eye as the chunky Kryptonian started munching, a gleam that Diana recognized as lust. She felt she should say something but before she could another voice cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell happened to you all?' A voice similar to Supergirl's but brimming with confidence and shock cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana turned to the door, seeing another Kara hovering in the doorway. This one though, was about ten years older, several inches taller, from another dimension and went by the superheroine name of Power Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cut like a diamond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second Diana's mouth dropped open in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other heroine was completely pristine, the only woman in the room and perhaps the city not carrying at least a few extra pounds. Hyper-defined thighs showed perfect musculature as they led up to hard hips round with muscle and rock hard abdominals that strained against her white leotard beneath the heaving mounds of her famous chest. Power Girl, or Karen as she went by in civilian life, still had a slim neck and very buff arms with high cheekbones and a clean jaw line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman felt color tinge her cheeks, both at the reminder of what she'd looked like mere days ago and at the thrill her body got examining a perfect female specimen when everyone around her had been bloated for months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're all...fat!,' the Kryptonian exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not fat, I'm only slightly heavier than normal,' Diana tried to deny automatically, before sucking down a few more ounces of coffee milkshake by reflex, 'and why aren't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've been off planet for a few months and then on a wilderness retreat for a few weeks, didn't you check the roster in the watch tower?' Karen stated, staring in amazement at the various stages of weight gain in front of her, 'what happened to you all?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes flashed over Diana's body, X-Ray vision cutting through enchanted bronze and steel to see Wonder Woman's distinct lack of muscle definition and how her slightly curved belly was pinched by her cuirass. Blinking, Karen took in her pot bellied other self, not able to believe the inflated gut the girl she'd nick named 'Tinkerbell' was now sporting, something not helped as the slightly soft Wonder girl handed her another soda to suck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Starfire took in a lot of her attention, it wasn't every day she saw a woman with breasts larger than her own and the Tamaranian's curves attracted her attention like a magnet attracted iron shavings. The frumpy bulk of the psychic Raven wasn't quite as appealing, but Barbara's three hundred pound sprawl demanded appreciate just by pure size alone, to say nothing of how her gelatinous ass fat overhung her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo them it had to be a nightmare, but Karen's heart pounded as she seemed to find herself in a perfect dream. Every super she knew, fat and flabby in various stages and styles? She blinked, trying to clear her mind and keep the dampness between her legs from spreading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We've been infected by some sort of scheme on the part of Anonymous Baking group,' Barbara informed her, plump fingers clicking on a keyboard and making a projector display the juggernaut company's logo, 'they appeared on the scene a few months ago and since then almost every woman in America has been addicted to them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anonymous? I knew they were too good to be true,' Karen sighed, 'I love their stuff. So how come it hasn't affected me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Super powers or being an alien give an immunity but those immunities have been eroding over the past months,' Barbara continued, 'Us normals went first, we didn't have any immunity.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture of Stephanie Brown, Barbara's own protege flickered up with the date of March 2nd next to her face. The athletic blonde rapidly inflated as the calendars continued, face expanding out into meaty jowls by late April before a \"Missing\" title appeared on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'then the magic users,' the hacker said, showing Zatanna looking flawless on April 3rd, plump on April 30th and flat out lardy on May 10th when another missing sign appeared over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'then the aliens over the past two months, starting out with tamaranian's, then Martians and then Kryptonians,' Barbara informed her, showing a curvy but svelte Starfire on May 10th and Supergirl looking tiny on June 1st. Given the tubby state of the aliens now, there wasn't much need for progression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'and then the Demi-gods and Amazon's a week ago,' Babs finished, a picture of Diana looking perfect appearing next to her actual face, highlighting the slight softening of her jawline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, you said the Kryptonians started in June?' Karen asked, one brow rising quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, lucky you missing out on all this,' super girl sighed, pinching her own flabby midsection for emphasis as Cassandra handed her another bag of chips, 'although it will start on you soon enough I'm sure.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But I've been eating Anonymous stuff since June,' Karen revealed, 'not every meal, it's not that good. But pretty frequently and well...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved a blue gloved hand over her stomach, intentionally flexing her immensely ripped abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course the sex symbol stays hot,' Raven grumbled, the rotund goth glaring at Karen's perfect midsection while munching another candy bar, 'because the universe is unfair.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There's nothing wrong with being bigger,' Starfire reprimanded her, settling her too tight shorts against her soft hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Depends on how big you are,' the chair bound Barbara reminded her romantic rival, 'but if you're immune...well, we have at least one member who will always be able to carry their own weight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you haven't mentioned its sucking away our abilities,' Diana told her, not able to fully tear her eyes away from the busty kryptonian, 'which is why we're going to stop them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl blinked, looking away from the display of excess before her, 'Sure, we should get right on that. What's our first step?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'An automated facility needs hacking,' Barbara said, the display showing the building, 'we were just about to move in before you got here.'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once they had a lay out of the building, Raven would teleport herself in and plant a bug on the main server. If all went to plan, no one would ever need to swing a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it didn't quite go to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Kara set off first, zooming up ten thousand feet into Gotham's perpetually dark sky where they couldn't be seen. The two Kryptonians hovered there, eyes aimed at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, how've you been?' Karen asked the alternate version of herself, not mentioning how Kara had lagged notably behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fat,' Kara responded, still breathing heavy, 'can't you tell?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Besides that,' Karen shrugged, 'your weight isn't everything. Busted any big crimes lately?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not since this started,' Supergirl muttered, patting her flabby belly, 'my powers have been going since my abs disappeared. I've lost most of my invulnerability and my senses are going too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I noticed you squinting a little,' Karen said, 'you should probably take it easy tonight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Take it easy?' Kara asked, 'shouldn't I try and use what powers I have left?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, but that won't happen if you get hurt,' the older kryptonian told her, 'just hang back a little, let me do the heavy lifting and take the big hits. Alright? You wouldn't want to get hurt would you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor emphasis, Karen reached out a blue gloved hand and pinched Kara's buttery love handle hard enough to make the coed squeal in shock and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ow! That hurt,' Kara whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah and a bullet would hurt worse,' Power girl told her, 'so stay back. But don't worry, as long as I'm around, I'l make sure you don't get hurt.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the schematics were sent down from the two flyers, Barbara hacked the buildings security systems and disabled them. She was slowed only by her need to munch on a bag of peanut butter candies, made more pathetic because she had to reach up to the front seat with one beefy arm to get more and found it a task difficult as besting the Joker's gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're good, security system is down,' Babs said over her munching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Raven, your good to go,' Wonder Woman told the psychic, who waved a hand and made a narrow portal of midnight energy appear before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven floated towards it, paunch passing into it but finding her meaty hips and love handles got stuck. With a sigh, the Goth widened it substantially and glided through. Diana waited, her concentration broken only by the sound of Cassandra popping open a soda and Starfire munching on a long submarine sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Could you stop that please?' The Amazon princess asked, 'this is a serious mission.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But I'm hungry,' Starfire complained, taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We ate before the meeting!' Diana hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was two hours ago,' Cassandra sighed, 'I should probably go get Kara a snack or two.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No snack runs,' Wonder Woman told her, 'this is a dangerous mission. Hera, no wonder we're getting fat.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited for several minutes. During that time Diana's stomach started to complain of hunger, then started hurting and then started cramping. Visions of ice cream drowning in chocolate sauce, burgers piled high with onion rings and dripping with grease and fried fish piled into orbit filled Diana's thoughts increasingly. There was the sound of an angry hydra and the still mostly thin Amazon looked around for its source, before finding it was her own protesting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, a small snack break,' Diana sighed, 'a small bag of carrots maybe.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cool, I was thinking burgers?' Cassandra agreed, 'do you want onion rings on yours?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'With fries,' Wonder Woman said immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Chocolate or vanilla shake?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strawberry of course,' Diana said, 'now hurry, we need to focus.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Probably we should be getting the coffee too,' Starfire chimed in, 'the kind with the whipped cream and sprinkles.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, frappuchinos for everyone,' Cassandra agreed, 'do you have some extra money Aunt Di?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure, just make sure you get me a soda with my shake as well,' Diana told her, pulling a  slightly sweaty hundred from her armor's bosom, 'I'm thirsty.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra shot off, belly slightly popping over the waistband of her pants as she raised her arm. Diana shook her head, putting her focus back on the warehouse where Raven should have exfiltrated minutes earlier. What was it with everyone's focus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, long enough for Cassandra to return with burgers, shakes and frappes for everyone. The afflicted heroines munched down quickly, no matter their weight they all had the fully developed appetites of born fatties. Diana gorged herself, the burger rapidly disappearing. She dipped the fries into the shake to dispose of both faster and then slurped down strawberry shake and coffee drink at the same time. The Amazon' felt disgusted with herself for doing this and felt the pinch of her cuirass even more, but couldn't deny the joy a delicious bellyful of grease, meat and dairy gave her. It equaled the Ares sent thrill of battle and almost the joy of ograsm, nearly worth the shame of having to loosen the strap on her cuirass a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Have we heard anything from Raven?' Power girl asked, breaking her reprieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kryptonian landed easily, followed a moment later by Supergirl who's belly bulged out even further, to the point the top two buttons on her skirt had come undone. Diana could hear faint groaning coming from the blonde alien's overloaded gut and she looked sick, while Karen's abs remained flawless against her tight leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, I don't think so,' Diana said, swallowing her last mouthful and feeling shame at seeing how Karen must not have eaten a bite and because a warning of a nuclear attack could have come through her radio without her noticing as she ate, 'can you see anything?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, basement is lead lined,' the Kryptonian told her, 'remember?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes...,' Diana nodded, mentally kicking herself for missing that while paying too much attention to her hunger pangs, 'Babs, anything on the cameras?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Umm, looks like the cameras went dark,' the massive vigilante admitted, 'I'm not exactly sure when that happened...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredibly sloppy and Wonder Woman's face turned red with shame. This was her crusade to stop her own impending weight gain, a mission so poorly organized she and everyone else had missed Raven vanishing during a snack break?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess we have to go get her then,' Power Girl said, popping her knuckles, 'right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're right,' Diana nodded, 'pincer formation then. Cassandra and I will go through the front door, you and Supergirl through the roof. Star will be on reserve.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good idea, although,' Power Girl nodded, leaning in very close and leading the dark haired woman to the other side of the SUV before whispering into Diana's ear, 'maybe put Star with me and Kara on reserve. Poor kid is a bit strung out from losing the invulnerability, it could impact her performance and we want to keep them safe.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right,' Diana agreed a bit too quickly, finding that Karen leaning in was a strange mix of arousing and intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good, but you need to watch it Di,' Karen said, tapping a finger against Wonder Woman's snug cleavage, 'you're getting a little sloppy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon wanted to protest, only to find that the Kryptonian's gloved index finger had come up with a dollop of whipped cream fallen from her gorge session onto her breasts. She put it to Diana's mouth and before she could think, the Greek Demi-goddess' tongue dashed out and licked it off. Karen winked at her and the Amazon felt her thighs grow weak  while her mouth went dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl was all business when they went back around the car, but Diana stammered when she gave her orders at least twice. Karen and Koriand'r took off into the air, while she and Cassandra walked towards the building's main door. Wonder Woman's palms were sweaty and her heart was racing; what had just happened? Had Karen just tried to seduce her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it worked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, the superheroine put a hand on the handle of the heavy rolling door. The thick padlock broke with a twist of her wrist, although there was no apparent effort in the action, Diana could swear it took a little more force than it would have just a week ago. Shaking her head, she let the door roll up and saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was nothing out of the ordinary inside the warehouse. It was just a long display of robotic arms and conveyor belts of pre packed snack foods stretching into the dark distance, the robotic limbs picking up snack cakes or cookies and putting them in boxes that hummed along onto robotic golf carts piled high with the hyper addictive food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Amazon couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not too much to see here,' Karen announced, hovering down from the hole she'd quietly cut in the ceiling with heat vision, 'she's not on the main floor.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kryptonian's muscular frame seemed beautifully menacing and her blue eyes still glowed a faint red in the half dark. Diana felt them pierce her to her very soul, like she was face to face with a dragon. Starfire floated up behind Diana before she could speak, munching from a bag of muffins she'd pulled off a conveyor belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Weren't you supposed to fly in?' Diana asked, shaken from the odd feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I had too much of the booty for that hole,' the over curvaceous Tamaranian giggled, wiggling her lusciously wide hips and slapping the orange-tan cheeks spilling from her cut offs for emphasis, 'I didn't want to get stuck.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry, I'm not used to working with...,' Karen started but caught herself before she could say fat girls and motioned to her wide, if muscular hips, 'I'm used to being the biggest woman in the room.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd always been heavier than others due to her density of muscle, wide hips and heavy chest. But even then she'd always been intimidatingly fit, not like the three superheroines in front of her who were fat though. Starfire was the biggest, the plus sized hotty's short shorts were on their last legs both at the thigh and at the fraying button hole and her free hanging breasts pressed tight against the thin fabric of her shirt. Diana and Cassandra could still pass for thin, but they were stuffed enough to need to upsize. Oh to peel uptight Diana out of that armor and teach the softening Amazon a lesson on where she stood now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, let's hope we can reverse that,' Wonder Woman said dryly, before her eyes caught her side kick munching from a stolen package of cookies, 'we just ate!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But their chocolate marshmallow fudge!' Cassandra whined, 'Oh there's some of Kara's favorite raspberry ones, I should bring her the box.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kara is chunky enough she doesn't need...did you say raspberry?' Diana began to lecture but was immediately distracted at the word 'raspberry.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren snorted and tossed a package of cookies from the conveyor belt to Diana. The Amazon caught it and was on her second cookie before she realized she was eating again. Power Girl gave another wink to her and picked up a box of coconut cream filled breakfast bars, without breaking eye contact she picked one up and placed it in her mouth, slowly putting the little sandwich between her lips. She closed her mouth, smiled and then pulled the slightly soggy crackers out, no trace of filling on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hate the crackers, I only like the filling. I need to just get some tubs of it,' she winked, 'Now let's get to the basement, we can eat and walk.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four heroines moved warily through the warehouse, eyes open for an ambush that didn't come and leaving a trail of empty wrappers. What did come was the release of first Koriandr and then Cassandra's pants buttons, Diana refused to loosen her armor another notch and suffered for it as her bloated stomach pressed against the metal of her armor, although she didn't stop eating from the box of cookies Karen had handed her nor its successor. Karen ate more of the sweets than any of them, but her washboard stomach didn't have the slightest bulge to it. Diana caught her brazenly staring at her as she ate, each time their blue eyes met and the alien winked until the Amazon blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, they came to freight elevator doors were set into an interior wall, a door like a bank vault with no apparent lock or handle beyond a small digital display. Karen walked behind Diana, passing so close the Amazon could feel the warmth of her skin, and looked at the display, letting out a whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lead lined doors and a finger print scanner,' the ripped woman whistled, 'someone really doesn't want us to get in.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll take the doors,' Dianna told her, finishing her last cookie and hastily sucking raspberry jelly off her fingers, 'everyone else should follow me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon set her feet and took a deep breath, feeling her tight armor pinch all along her stomach. There was the pop of a seam somewhere, but no plate fell to the ground thank the Gods. Diana punched the seam of the door, her god's given strength letting her put a fist through an inch of lead, half a foot of steel and another inch of lead. Leaning back, she ripped the door off of its hinges, pulling the thousands of pounds of steel over her head and tossing it aside as if it was a small handbell. There was the faintest sheen of sweat on the warrior princess' tan brow from the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire and Wonder Girl moved first, diving down the elevator shaft. Power Girl paused as Diana wiped her hands clean, leaning in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nice work,' Karen complimented her as she walked by, 'but you should watch your form. Don't try and suck in your stomach while you're lifting, you'll hurt your back...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How could you tell?' Wonder Woman asked before she could remember to deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kryptonian tapped the Amazon's waist, where a the tiniest sliver of engorged stomach showed between cuirass and belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The new weight shows when you're not trying to hide it,' the so far immune Kryptonian smiled, then hovering up a little to be at Diana's exact height, she leaned in very close, her breasts pressing into Diana's and face suddenly very close, 'and I think...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was more than decently busty, despite her still mostly fit build Aphrodite had been generous to her in the chest department and when she wore a mortal bra she commonly fit into either DDs or E cups. Karen's were significantly larger though by at least two cup sizes and they mushroomed up out of her tit window, the soft warm flesh spilling against Diana's own breasts and heaving towards her face. The sensation of tit on tit contact sent a shiver down Diana's back, fear and desire rising as a single feeling and they rose higher when the other heroine's hand rose with a three cookie stack of raspberry cream cookies and placed them in Amazon's open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think it looks damn good on you,' she smiled, and then jumped backwards into the elevator shaft, leaving the Amazon standing stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat coated Diana and her heart hammered against her ribs as she swallowed another few hundred calories. All of her muscles shivered in anticipation and she felt an overwhelming tingle of pleasure between her legs. She shook her head, black hair shaking as she tried to clear her mind of the insane interaction. Several thousand years on an island of sexually open, intensely beautiful warrior women meant she hadn't been a blushing virgin when coming to man's world. But never had she felt so enthralled by such attention, attention that power girl had never showed her before. After a moment she felt ready to move on, only then realizing that the pain at her waist was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, the warrior woman realized that Karen's other hand had loosened her belt another notch and that the leather had a crease from where it had strained, the previous hole looking stretched out by the pressure. She usually wore her belt on the tenth notch comfortably, but now it was on the eighth and not exactly loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Am I turned on by this?' She whispered to herself and then rather than answer, jumped down the elevator shaft, finding at its bottom...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Pt 5: Forest of Delights<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana fell for quite some time, the elevator shaft was immensely deep. Her long hair stood out behind her as she fell but at last, surely a skyscraper's heights beneath the earth, the Amazon saw a spot of light beneath her spilling from an open door. With a thought she activated her ability to fly and her eyes widened when for one terrifying moment it refused her command and she continued falling. But then it kicked in and her descent slowed until she was hovering a foot above the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'By the depths of tartarus,' Diana whispered, 'what was that?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer powers had been granted by the Gods of Greece, never had they failed her before. Were they doing so now after only a week of growing fat? She'd hoped to defeat this enemy before that but were her own piggish habits preventing that hope? She'd prayed to Athena and Hera that if it came to it, she'd fade like Starfire, getting slightly weaker in each field instead of like Supergirl who was losing her powers slowly one at at time but what if it was worse than either? She should retreat, seek safety and let someone else handle it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! She was the ambassador of Themiscyra, princess of the Amazons and champion of the 12 Olympians. As long as she could crawl she would fight! She had to find her allies, defeat her enemies and figure out exactly why her mouth was watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And Gods on Olympus, what is that smell?' the Amazon asked, stepping through the open double door and into the last thing she'd expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a dry computer server room or some sort of nefarious laboratory of bubbling beakers and crackling electricity, Diana found herself in an idyllic orchard of fruit trees and a field of crops lit by powerful ceiling lights. Birds chirped happily, some where a stream burbled and a beautiful smell permeated the air, a smell that mixed the soft growth of spring and the delicious scents of a gourmet bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not quite what I expected either,' Power Girl said from her right, white clad arms crossed beneath her impressive chest and giving a soft whistle, 'it gives a new meeting to 'growing food'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you mean...by Demeter's mercy!' the Amazon exclaimed as she realized what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the plethera of plants, there were no fruits or grains. Flowers aplenty yes, but in the place of fruit or grain was junk food: instead of ears of corn there were twinkies, instead of apples there were snack cakes, instead of pears cinnamon rolls, instead of grain peanut butter cups. There were cherries yes, but chocolate covered ones and in a fashion there were apples, whole apple pies popping from the ground as steaming hot as if they'd just come out of an oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance she could see her companions:<br>\r\nShe caught sight of Wonder Girl hovering above a tree groaning beneath the weight of chocolate marshmellow cookies. One hand held a wicker basket and the coed superhuman alternated, putting one handful of cookies into the container and then stuffing the other in her mouth. Cassie's jeans had started the day out a little snug but her stomach had been mostly flat, but after the fast food run and all the snacking on the way to the elevator she'd undone her button out of necessity as she bloated. After only a few minutes of gorging though, Diana's side kick sported a belly so big it had completely unzipped her pants and easily surpassed her breasts. Only their extreme tightness kept them on and if the girl wasn't flying their seams would surely rip wide open.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStarfire was likewise hovering, but along a tree covered in chocolate covered cherries. The sex bomb alien's shorts had suffered a total collapse along the back seam, showing off a two sizes too small thong and even more soft crack. Her matronly breasts bounced as her smiling face bobbed from mouthful to mouthful and beneath them her relatively narrow stomach was only a few minutes of eating away from catching the slightly saggy bosom. The tree's upper branches were already bare and With each bite she was starting to sag just a little bit lower.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRaven was collapsed fully on her back on the ground beneath two trees that were even now growing cinnamon rolls, deep in the throws of a food coma. The fat goth was so immensely bloated she resembled a gorged tick, her already substantial gut having ripped a horizontal tear on her blue-black dress all the way form navel to breast. Milk pale flesh stood drum tight and gurgling painfully, while her icing smeared face had a look of beautific peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is a perversion of Demeter's gifts to us!' the devout pagan stammered again, stopped only when she heard her companion moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Diana saw the muscular Karen shoving a twinkie into her mouth about fifteen feet away. Eyes rolling back into her head as she smiled and chewed, the slightly shorter heroine's back arched in pleasure, pushing her breasts so far against her costume they threatened to burst free. Swallowing the mouthful of empty calories with a grin, Karen patted her hard stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'These are delicious are what they are,' Power Girl chuckled, unbuckling the rather useless red belt that bisected her white leotard and putting it over her shoulders, while taking off her blue gloves, 'I always thought of twinkies as tasting like shit but daaaang they're good fresh.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But...but, you could get fat!,' Diana hissed, even though the twinkies did smell heavenly, 'your immunity could turn off at any bite!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I might, but I might not,' Karen shrugged and ate another twinkie, 'the world can be unfair, we both know that but lucks been with me so far. I'm not from this dimension, whatever worked on Supergirl won't work on me. I know that's what you thought of course, when everyone else was getting fat but you were eating to your hearts content with a six pack. But I'm as addicted as any of you really even if it doesn't show on me. It was hell walking through that factory and only eating a few boxes, when I was off in space there wasn't any junk food at all and I've been in withdrawal. I'm gonna glut myself and not care about what might happen. But if it did...how do you think it would sit on me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman stared at the other super in shock, 'How would it sit?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, how would I get fat? Would I get super curvy with floppy MILF tits and a great big ass framing a paunchy belly like Starfire?,' Karen described as she kept eating, cheeks filling with dissolving confections,'Do you think I'd be like Raven? Or become a pear with thighs so thick I could barely walk and an ass that gets lodged in the car like Batgir? Maybe I'd get a big carb gut like Supergirl?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana heard herself pant and felt herself sweat as the bustier woman walked forwards, snatching handful after handful of piping fresh snack cakes with each step. Cream was on her lips, half of a bisected twinkie had plopped onto her breasts and her washboard abs had the small bulge of a food baby. Not much compared to the flabby lap fillers almost all American women sported anymore, but compared to the studded muscles she'd had it was a big change and Diana was both saddened to see it and intrigued to see how big it might get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No way to know on me of course,' Karen smiled, swallowing with a happy sigh, 'but we'll figure it out before too long on you, heh? Do you think you'll have a big set of birthin hips in a month?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, we'll stop them before that happens,' Diana told her, wanting to take a step back and flee while at the same time take a step forwards and embrace the suddenly erotic blonde,  when she spoke again her voice quivered, 'I won't get fat.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'll just have to see about that,' Power Girl winked, picking the twinkie out of her breasts and plopping it into Diana's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tasted like heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's eat while we walk girl,' her ally suggested, floating a foot or so above the ground and pulling the twinkies off one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went slowly, finishing each one before she moved on. Diana was already shaken to the core: by her weight gain, her momentary loss of flight, by her addiction, by the strange comments of the Kryptonian who seemed completely blase to over eating despite seeing the disastrous effects. Seeing the twinkies beginning to sprout again a moment after they were plucked from the stem wasn't something she needed to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwift as Hermes Diana ran, soft dirt flying from her red boots. It took only a few heartbeats for her to reach the end of the snack cake field and the start of the forest and she was relieved to find her gift of speed from the messenger god was still intact. But she couldn't help but notice how her carefully practiced breathing was off, her chest was tighter against her armor and she couldn't breathe quite as deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know the doctor's say we can't out run our forks,' Karen said when Diana caught up, finishing off the last twinkie and rubbing a large food baby, 'but good for you trying to stay in shape as you get bigger.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not going to get bigger,' Wonder Woman huffed, then realized a vast raspberry bush was in front of her and that every berry was a steaming hot raspberry cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana froze stock still, a mouse in front of a lion. If lions were eaten by mice who found all that predator meat going right to their thighs. Her mouth hung open and she drooled, remember the cookies the cooks on paradise island had snuck her when her overweening mother had been focusing on affairs of state rather than her daughter's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know, I'm really too full to eat anymore,' Power Girl informed her, undoing a series of hidden snaps along the side of her costume and letting her tan, swollen belly be partly free, 'but these smell even better than the twinkies.' </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Diana was at this point a full blown addict. Over the last months Anonymous' chemicals  filled up her body the warrior princess had slowly lost restraint around the fattening goodies. For months she'd been trained far past the point of eating only when hungry, casually snacking whenever she could and when the first extra pound from the constantly improving Anonymous formula found its home on Wonder Woman's abs she had begun to eat well past the point of snacking and occasionally even to pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'These are so good,' Power Girl said from beside her, popping cookies off the vine and into her own mouth, 'I don't even like raspberries.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it had been Karen's odd words earlier about not caring if she gained weight or not or the way the Kryptonian's waistline, flat as a ruler at the abandoned diner, was now a food baby testing the limits of her costume. But Diana paused and watched the blonde gorge herself on her favorite snacks instead of digging in herself.She saw a woman famed and praised for her figure, a combination of muscle and curve unattainable to almost anyone actively eating herself out of her costume. Diana felt shocked, disgusted at herself but attracted at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really, are you sure you don't want one?' Power Girl asked, turning around with her cheeks bulging with cookies, 'Just a few won't hurt, I'm sure...duck!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething hit her from behind  and sent her flying forwards through the raspberry bush. She was up in a flash, finding that her mouth had gotten several of her favorite cookies inside it somehow during the brief trip. Diana's jaw worked furiously as she saw a blast of Karen's heat vision and heard a steaming hiss, swallowing she went to jump into the air and get a better view of the battle that didn't involve her going through the cookie patch again but once more her gift of flight failed to start on time. Tripping, she landed awkwardly and stumbled as a broad shouldered shape barreled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Diana had the impression of a gorilla, wooden one with a huge flower writhing with tentacles on its back. The beast swung at her face but despite the bulge at her belly, she was still a canny combatant. She blocked the attack on her bracer and grabbed the plant creature's wrist. Diana stepped in and turned to throw the thing over her hip but to her surprise the monster's arm with a gush of a thick, sticky red substance that shot right into Diana's snarling mouth. Her eyes widened as raspberry jam filled millimeter in her mouth, she felt a whole body shiver run from her slightly thicker ankles over her lack of quad definition through the slightly lower slopes of her ass, up a not quite visible backbone and into the back of her blanking mind. The beast's tentacles wrapped around the Amazon and pulled her straight up over its humped back, forcing her head straight down into the opening flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Diana found her face engulfed into the same sticky substance. By reflex the heroine opened her mouth and sucked in mouthful after mouthful of the delicious stuff, the rush of eating overcoming the struggle. She forgot the urgency of her mission, she forgot the panic of faltering powers, the shame of losing her perfection. Diana felt peaceful relaxation, the kind one only got after a week of vacationing or post orgasm bliss. Only a slight pressure interrupted her perfect pleasure, it turned into a painful stab and the Amazon snapped out of it upon hearing her armor groan from the pressure of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwakening from the ensnaring food with all the rage of the slighted Olympian she was, Diana took her revenge. Snarling, Diana spun in the air with the force of a tornadTo. This time her gift of flight activated and she popped free like a wine cork, but trailing shattered vines, petals and sticky filling instead from the maimed tree beast. he Amazon lashed out with her lasso, the perfect weapon catching the monster around the shoulders. With one mighty tug Diana ripped it to pieces, which became just dead wood on the ground. Another jam bearing foe leapt at her but the Amazon spun to the side, her boot crushing its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she hung in the air panting, each breath jamming her painfully full gut into the unforgiving metal of her armor. The Amazon felt sick, ready to vomit from the sudden exertion when her body wanted nothing more but to recline and digest its mountain of carbohydrates. But two laser beams flashed by, a flare of heat vision alerting her to Power Girl. Breathing heavily, snorting raspberry jams out of her nose, imagining the nightmare of getting it out of her hair,  she dashed over to find her cohort floating heavily in the air: her short blonde hair a mess of icing, her face utterly relaxed and scooping thick white cream out of her cleavage. Beneath her six of the gorilla beasts lay in burning ruin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This place is heaven. A good fight that brings snacks to you?,' Karen smiled up at her, 'And all of mine had coconut cream in them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superheroine's arms, legs, shoulders and hips were still as before. Her enormous breasts were still gravity defying perky and her strong jaw and sharp cheek bones radiated strength. But the Kryptonian's stomach on the other hand was now a beach ball sized sphere packed tight with force fed coconut filling. Strange growls eminated from its depths and tan skin was starting to show through minute rips along fabric proof against tank fire as the relentless pressure made the seams fail. The once invisible snaps were now quivering with metal fatigue, diamonds of tan flesh showing. Karen's tit window was stretched so low Diana could see her pink bra, as well as the bowl worth of filling resting between the quivering breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I fucking love coconut cream,' the sticky woman sighed, scooping a handful out of her tits and plopping it into her mouth, 'want any?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana realized that she was drooling as she watched. She closed her mouth and looked away, trying to come up with an excuse. Coconut wasn't as good as raspberry but it was creamy and delicious and would surely be warm and melty from where it sat in that perfect canyon of cleavage above that groaning testament to gluttony...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm allergic actually,' the champion of truth lied, 'can't take a bite of it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure you are, I can hear Starfire's ass ripping its way out of her jeans now,' Power Girl yawned, 'but first, well this costume isn't built for a girl with a gut like this. Hold on, I want to try something.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren arched her back, sticking her arms back while exhaling. Her already bulbous stomach surged, seams popped and the snaps groaned before suddenly releasing in a staccato burst. Her tan gut broke free, so round and hardthat Diana would have assumed her in an advanced pregnancy had she not seen Karen's appetite that day. So consumed was she at seeing the white fabric fail across the tan skin that she missed a button hitting her tiara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have always wanted to know what that felt like,' the kryptonian giggled, ripping away the remnants of her costume to show the sports bra and lacy blue panties she wore beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood, watching Diana drink her in, angling her hip so the Amazon could see both the front and side of her gut. Lightly, she ran her nails over the hot surface of her now spherical midsection and sighed at the tingle of pleasure. Karen could feel the pleasurable gurgle of her stomach as it sat about digesting the several gallons of pure sugar and fat she'd sucked down. If she was lucky she'd finally wake up with some fluff in the morning, but in all likelihood she'd just have her customary four pack despite her eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana though was clearly lucky enough to be putting on weight, even if she didn't see it that way. Karen's enhanced vision could see the slight widening to her face, the barest sign of puffiness beneath her drool slick jaw, the way her breasts were beginning to overflow the bronze eagle at the top of her armor and how her thighs were heart beat by heartbeat creeping towards each other, to say nothing of her own plush food baby surging around her enchanted belt. That trade mark wasp waist wasn't going to last long if Karen had a guess. The Amazon looked to have only been force fed a single tree monster's worth of filling (Karen had upon destroying the first and realizing what it held, let herself be forced fed the five) but that belt looked ready to go at a heart beat. She was lucky to have caught Wonder Woman right at the start, now she could enjoy the whole ride if she did it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I always knew you were a good grappler,' Karen said to the shell shocked Diana, strutting closer to the taller woman and getting slightly into her personal space, 'looks like you escaped more quickly than me. Later do you think you could give me some lessons?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure!,' Diana squeaked before coming back to her senses, 'I mean, of course. I need to focus harder on staying in shape and sparing with someone of your weight, um, weight class, um power level would be a big help.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll hold you to that,' Power Girl smiled, stepping forwards until her gurgling gut was almost touching Diana, 'but for now, don't you think that's a little too tight?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, its just a little snug,' Wonder Woman denied as Karen tapped the belt buckle, 'I'll be fine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That armor's cutting into you. Its a nice suit, but we've got to dress for the body we have,' Karen told her, 'a strong enough punch' and here she jammed a finger into the armor, Diana winced, 'and you could get hurt.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't just fly around in my underwear!' Diana protested, 'what would the others think? I've got to get them to work together and follow orders!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry, I know how it is,' the blonde nodded, 'you've got to be stern and fearless to be the leader, you can't show fear. I've been there but as I have, know you can relax around me some. Why don't you let me help loosen that armor up though? Can't command if you're distracted by pain. So why don't I help you at least loosen it up?' </span></div></div>",

Each of the current holes, several notches from being fastened at the start of the evening, were stretching out under the pressure and all of the straps had small tears along the sides. Wonder Woman would need to either get new leather or a new costume, Karen thought, hopefully one that let her new girth breathe some. Diana sighed in relief as the belt around her waist was released, the pressurized stomach pushing the garment out so quickly Karen almost dropped it and had to set the buckle on the fourth punch from the end, covering a tan belly that was a layer of squish over hard packed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything was undone, the prominent slope of the Amazon's food baby was clear to see: not as big as Karen's ludicrous gut but far from the flawless abs of a warrior princess, vying with Diana's large breasts for prominence. Unable to resist temptation, Karen massaged the tan flesh showing between the plates and Diana's sigh of relief turned into a groan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know you've rocked a one piece forever,' Power Girl told her, 'but I'd recommend a two piece in the future. If this keeps happening our bellies are gonna need some air.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not giving in that easy,' Wonder Woman shook her head, making her breasts jiggle pleasingly in Karen's eye, 'and we're going to stop them before replacing this costume is necessary. I'm going to lose every ounce of this weight.'\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'll that's a bit of a shame,' Karen smiled at her, wondering if she should press her luck and deciding to go for it, 'because I think...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped forward, smiling in painful pleasure as her enormous gut pressed into Diana's merely large food baby. The Kryptonian leaned in, sticky cleavage feeling the cold metal against Diana's full rack and put her face very near the Amazons. Karen took a nervous breath, happy that the gorgeous woman in front of her wasn't stepping back but instead fighting not to look at her cleavage. She ran a finger down Diana's slightly softer face and smiled, lust layered atop bashfulness.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think it looks, dare I say, wonderful on you,' the superheroine whispered and kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana kissed her back, by more than reflex. Between her corded limbs, sharp features and pneumatic bust the blonde radiated sex appeal, to the extent her gravid seeming belly only added to PG's allure. With every breathe she oozed fecundity, power and indulgence and Diana felt her self control slip as she tasted the sugar on the other heroines lips. She got a hand behind Karen's half cape and onto her naked back, its muscles so far removed from her gluttonous belly. Diana pressed the other woman into her while her tongue darted into Karen's mouth, but unaccustomed to either kissing a large bellied woman or being one herself the amazon gave a pained grunt as she drove the other woman's sphereical gut into herself. The loosened armor plate pressed hard into her own sensitive gut, driven by Karen's heavy but invulnerable waist.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oofff,' Diana grunted in pain, dropping the shorter woman and rubbing her gut, 'sorry I didn't account for my new weakness.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Heh, it might not be the time for that anyway,' Karen smiled at her, 'we better get this data and get the others out of here while we can fit up the elevator shaft.'\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found the other three peacefully napping off the effects of their immense snack binges. Raven was stuffed near spherical, her stretch mark striated gut having broken free of her costume into the cool air. Not far away Starfire napped beneath a tree denuded of chocolate covered cherries, her coy smile sticky and the remnants of her short shorts painted on. Wonder Girl's t shirt merely looked a little bit pregnant and it would take super human strength to pull her out of her skin tight blue jeans, which had half a dozen tears at various seams, with soft tan flesh showing though. To Diana's shock and Karen's joy, each of them was a little chubbier than when they'd entered the factory, even aside from their immense food b**s: Raven's round face had the start of a new chin, Starfire's already hefty breasts were drooping a little lower and Wonder Girl's thighs poofed out just a bit more from the holes in her jeans.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They're already getting fatter,' Diana winced, knowing it would happen to her in minutes, 'Athena guide me but we've become pathetic. We're the fittest remaining heroines on this planet and we get defeated by food? If there'd been real resistance here...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'd have kicked their ass and then over eaten,' Karen assured her, rubbing her own stomach and then pulling a flash drive out of her bra, 'You get them to the elevator, I'll find the server that should be around here somewhere.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving the heroines took some time. Diana's mighty strength hadn't failed her and their slightly chunky, over plush and just plain fat weights weren't much to a woman who could throw a warship, but they were awkward with their swollen bellies and hers to contend with. Several times the bronze edges of her armor cut into her soft body and she knew that stripping would have made it easier. But she carried each one of them all the way to the elevator and was glad of the exercise, running with weights was a good work out.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so good that Diana had decided to award herself with a piping hot snack cake or five before lifting Raven's bloated body.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I told you they're good,' Karen smiled at her, walking up sedately with two baskets brimming with fresh goodies, 'i've got all the evidence that we were here. Those monsters have rotted into mulch already and the food is already growing back. I doubt they'll realize we were here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd retrieved her belt and gloves too and they were strapped ludicrously around her waist on the very last hole, along with the remnants of her costume thrust between engorged belly and straining fabric. One of the baskets was full of twinkies and the other was full of raspbery cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you crazy, we're already fat!' Diana told her, grunting as she bent to pick up Raven.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, two of us are fat, one of us is stupidly curvy, one of us is plump and two of us are a little soft,' Power Girl listed out, 'I'm the odd girl out and these are for me. I want to see how long I can keep this gut going.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now I know you're crazy,' Diana sighed, standing up with 200 plus pounds of titan in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not crazy, I just have...a bit of a fetish,' Karen admitted, walking along beside the brunette, 'and its not one I can indulge in meaningfully.'\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You want to get fat?' Diana asked incredulously, 'You see what its doing to us and want that?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl blushed, looking away in bashful shame, 'I want to keep my powers but, well, I want to be squishy alright? I've always wanted that but well, Kryptonian under a yellow sun means a super metabolism. I've got these tits at least and when I lift my muscles build but I've always wanted to be big and puffy and round and soft. Instead most of me is all hard and angular, when all I want is to be all soft and feminine...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you like other women heavier?' Diana asked, trying not to be judgemental.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm bi, usually I like dudes, but a woman with some extra weight, whether its just a little bulge on her jeans or if she's too fat to get through the door, it drives me nuts,' Karen admitted, 'Its like a switch gets thrown. Don't get me wrong, you were pretty and all, but you were all bones and angles. Now you've got some squish to you and holy crap does it suit you well and you probably think I'm crazy and don't want anything to do with me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana looked over at the blonde woman, who couldn't even meet her eye.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Diana felt a heartbeat or two of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer humiliating rise in weight had just been brought up. Moreover, it had been brought up by a woman so far immune to the spreading obesity epidemic: Karens bare arms and legs didn't jiggle with fat like her own had begun to, they rippled with muscle. Her ass, half exposed in her lacey cheeky panties was rounded but hard and smooth where Barbara's were gelatinous bags that got stuck in chairs. Her food belly may have rivaled supergirl's carb gut, but come morning would probably be so flat you could write on it. Her breasts were enormous but so firm they didn't really need a bra, where Starfire's large set were now sagging heavily, with the left breast starting to overtake the right. Diana was jealous of her since she, chosen of the Gods, was now being called fat by a woman not only perfect but willing to risk it was infuriating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it had been a compliment, an unexpected one. And it had come from a woman hard as any Amazon, even if the near six foot Kryptonian blonde was a bit short in comparison she was as close as a fellow Amazon as could be found. She was brave, strong and intelligent, a warrior and a scholar both. Her boldness and stiff upper lip were admirable qualities, yet the vulnerability she was showing was inticing. And She did have a rack worthy of Aphrodite after all and well, if she liked the thickening layer of squish forming on Diana's body, well at least some one was benefiting. Karen's fat fetish might be a little strange but if she was already putting on weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have to say I'm flattered. You're an admirable woman and I won't judge you for liking what you like,' the champion of Themiscyra told the stuffed blonde, 'I'm not enjoying this weight and by all the Gods I swear I'll be back in shape again, but well...while it lasts, while I'm f...f...fa...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren turned to the Amazon, taking in the way every step sent a faint jiggle up her now untoned thighs which were millimeters away from brushing. How her stomach now had a noticable curve and that stuffed belly flesh was visible in the gap between cuirass and skirt. How her soft, no longer muscle arms bulged around her bracers. How her heavy, tan tits were starting to overflow the bronze plates, with extra fat mushrooming under her arm pit. How her almost eerily symmetrical face now had a little bit of extra under the jaw when she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fuller than normal, you may admire me as much as you want,' the Amazon finished, as if in a dream, 'we can even perhaps go on a date if you wish...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren almost tripped, nearly dropping her cache of snacks but recapturing them with super speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You mean it?' she asked, eyes huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, as long as you don't...interfere with me losing weight, I'm happy to be admired,' Diana told her, 'I may not share your ideas but well, I can't yet do much to change my body for a while and well...you're not bad to look at yourself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smacked the blonde's muscular rear, which felt like hitting a slightly bouncy brick wall even to Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I prefer my women muscular and busty, two qualities you currently exemplify. Except for that belly,' the Amazon princess teased, 'but I suppose...there were no fat girls on themiscyra. If you start putting it on, I'd let you be my first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiled at her, 'In that case I think I know where we should head next. I've got a little research lab my tech company has set up out in the mountains near Smallville. Its got a pretty lake, some nice trails and plenty of good restaurants nearby and can house all of us easily while having all of the computers and equipment we'll need to crack anonymous' data.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sounds  like a good head quarters, the league bases are probably being watched,' Diana nodded, 'lets get them to the SUV and let Barbara and Kara know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up the elevator shaft wasn't completely easy. Wonder Woman took off immediately but found herself flying a little slower than Power Girl. While that gave her a good view of Karen's muscular butt, Diana couldn't help but snarl at her slowness nor the slight perspiration that broke across her brow from the effort. But they got the food coma trapped heroines upstairs, where Karen used her heat vision to seamlessly fix the vault door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No sign we were here beyond the padlock I broke and the food we stole,' Wonder Woman nodded, 'let's get going.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right behind you,' Karen agreed, throwing the overly curvy softness of Starfire over her shoulder and then an absolutely huge mouthful of baked treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked behind the Amazon, similarly laden with Raven and Wonder Girl and kept her eyes glued on the soft cheeks starting to peak out of Diana's panties. The Kryptonian could see anyone naked whenever she wanted but the little hint was driving her wild, as much as her own false gut was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, what's it feel like?' she asked Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's what feel like?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Getting, you know, bigger,' Karen asked, 'whenever I eat my stomach just goes down and everything stays all hard. Can you feel yourself getting jigglier?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My suit is too tight and so are my underware,' the amazon admitted, 'everything jiggles when I walk now and my face feels puffy. I feel a little more tired than usual and I can feel myself getting weaker and slower. Not by much but I feel disgusted, like I'm getting sick...this is turning you on, isn't it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of Karen's panties were turning a darker shade of blue, 'More than a little bit I have to admit. Sorry, when I say a switch gets flipped when I see a girl with some meat I mean it. I'd probably do anything you asked me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In that case,' Diana turned on her, strutting closer, 'I've got a question for you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe angled her back, so the full Kryptonian could see her expanding rack surging at her armor. Karen was shaking in blue boots, sweat breaking out across her brow. Her brash self confidence was gone, replaced with nervous sexual excitement and making Wonder Woman grin. Diana knew the power of her looks. She had ever since she'd arrived in the mortal world and found herself so much more than mortal. She was taller, faster, stronger, thinner, bustier, curvier, fitter, with long, lustrous jet hair and flawless bronze skin. Even though she was thickening, knowing that Karen viewed her extra weight with delight put some self confidence back in the Amazon's step. If one person was still drinking her in, she'd ensure that they were wrapped around her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Y-ye-yeah?' Karen stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Think about it while we walk, but keep those super eyes firmly on me,' the Amazon said coyly, glad to be back in the proverbial driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to the SUV fairly quickly, although Karen walked into a conveyor built and spilled a load of caramelized apples while she was watching how Diana's back now had enough fat to bulge over the back of her armor. There they found Barbara passed out in the back seat from a food coma of her own, the morbidly obese woman's pot belly rising and falling as she snored loudly, surrounded by Anonymous wrappers and with cellulite coated thighs showing through rips in her leggings. Supergirl was eating nervously by the door, a small pile of candy bar wrappers by her feet, chocolate stains on her lips, the start of an acne outbreak across her forehead and her stomach so swollen the top three buttons of her blue skirt were undone. The garment hung onto the thick Kryptonian for dear life, her spreading fupa and widening hips putting its bullet proof fabric to the test even as her chubby fingers shoved more and more food into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh thank Rao!,' she said, invoking the Kryptonian sun god, 'I thought you guys were dead and I'd have to go in there!...why are you in your underwear? And what happened to your stomach?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We got attacked by some feeding monsters,' Karen said, putting down her junk food basket and patting her gut, 'nothing we couldn't handle but it was a bit filling.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Last thing I needed,' the bulging heroine sighed, eating another bar, 'what next?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Power Girl has a location for us,' Diana said, 'we'll load the others into the car and meet you there.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren had already pulled her WaynePhone from her seemingly bottomless bra and her fingers flashed as she texted the coordinates, 'Take care of yourself kid. We'll talk in the morning, you might want to bring some new clothes though. We'll be there a while.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara nodded, with effort dug her own phone out of a skintight pocket of her skirt and let her eyebrows raise up, 'Near small ville? That place is a total fat trap. Everyone there was fat before this started!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we'll fit in easily then,' Diana told her, sending the gut heavy alien flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two put Starfire, Raven and Wonder Girl into the back seats, only bothering to buckle in the non-invulnerable psychic and Batgirl. Karen had just finished fitting the buckle underneath the red haired vigilante's thick muffin top when she felt cold pressure on her back. She froze, realizing Diana was right behind her, leaning down to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How do you think I'm going to gain?' Diana asked with predatory glee, leaning in a little more, letting her breasts spill onto Karen's back, 'You asked me that, I want to know what you think. Shall I have the maiden's blessings of Aphrodite and gain the enticingly round hips, lazy thighs and wide ass of the goddess of love, so shapely that when I dance men will fall insensible? Or shall I be like Hera the matron, with a mother's belly so huge I could grow an army in my womb and breasts so vast their milk could drown a city?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't how it was going to go in Karen's wildest dreams. She was going to swoop in, fit and confident, to tease the soft Amazon a bit and then slowly worm her way into Diana's bed while complimenting her growing curves, fully in control the whole time. Diana wasn't supposed to grab her fetish and use it against her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, what do you think?' Diana asked again, 'I'm not getting any thinner.' </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> 'Tits,' Karen squeaked, as Wonder Woman's still firm finger tips ran across her own full chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why? Don't you have enough of your own?' Diana whispered in her ear, while giving her breasts a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'N-nnn-no,' the woman sighed, 'I've always wanted bigger ones. Huge ones, tits like a potato sack full of ice cream that go down to your waist.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And what about my stomach Karen?' the amazon asked, 'do you want my abs to come back?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, no, its gotta be flabby. A big fat apron that  hits your ankles,' the kryptonian moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana released her, standing in front of her oozing confidence and power, broken only by the stuffed belly pressing against her armor. She raised her arms up to the light pollution blighted skies in prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In that case then, I beseech mighty Hera for her blessings,' Diana asked the heavens, 'if this curse must continue, may I grow the top heavy figure of a matron. May my stomach bulge fill my view and my tits groan with fat, while my ass goes flat and my legs thin. May this woman before me see me grow and grow, by this curse and her hand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo lightning split the sky, nor did Diana's still mostly fit body bulge out any further. But to Karen it seemed the air was heavy with some sort of magical energy. Diana lowered her arms and walked past her, sliding into the passenger seat of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, let us be going,' Diana told her authoritatively, 'after tonight I need rest. Drive on.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Karen a moment to get into the driver's seat, near overwhelmed with sexual desire. She was stuffed to painful capacity with calorific goodies that had an actual, if small chance of fattening her up, while Diana, fucking Wonder Woman, the most beautiful woman on earth, was not only bulging out of her armor, was not only gaining weight, had not only effectively said sure to a relationship with her but had essentially agreed to let Karen feed her? The heroine was monumentally wet and every step that made her tight underwear ride against her clit made her almost orgasm and sigh with pleasure. It didn't help that Diana was eating again, munching from her snack basket when she got to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I thought you were trying to slow down your gain?' Karen asked as she got into the door, stuffed gut almost hitting the horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What are you talking about?' Diana asked with a full mouth, 'I'm not...damn this food to Tartarus!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, you being so into eating that you don't know you're eating? That's kind a hot,' Power Girl laughed as she tried to start the car and failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's wrong?' Diana asked, still eating cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its not turning,' the Kryptonian answered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Turn harder,' the Amazon said unhelpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I turn any harder the key will break,' Karen muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This vehicle is programmed to only activate when the driver's seat belt is fastened,' the car computer chirped helpfully, 'this safety feature brought to you by Wayne Enterprises!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit, I don't know if I can do that,' Power Girl sighed, trying to find room to buckle the seat belt past her groaning stomach and failing, 'I'm...holy Rao, my stomach's too big for me to buckle the seat belt!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana raised one perfect eyebrow as the muscular woman tried and singuarly failed to find room to maneouver. Karen had eaten so many dozens of cookies and snack cakes and hand pies, she'd sucked down so many gallons of coconut frosting that and then eaten even more junk that her stomach was too big for her to perform a basic function. And she'd started out the night with a stomach flatter than a pool table. Although she didn't share Power Girl's odd preferences, Diana had to admit she was impressed by the feat of gluttony worthy of Bacchus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why don't you fly us out?' Diana asked her, realizing she'd taken another mouthful of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurse her fat girl's will power! Even though she'd found a suitable admirer, the Champion of the Gods wasn't thrilled that her mind and body were completely betraying her. She stared furiously at her hand, willing it to stop but it still brought another handful of food to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure, let me get out of here,' Power Girl sighed, struggling and trying to get out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren could outrun a bullet. She could pick up a battleship. She could take an armor piercing bomb to the face. But her own gluttony and the dimensions of a car built before the obesity epidemic had become total had completely defeated her. Diana watched her wobble helplessly, trying and failing to find a way out of her seat that wouldn't jam her turgid waist into the car horn. All that several minutes managed was the Kryptonian's overloaded belt snapping in half, letting her tattered outfit fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, do you mind? I'll navigate,' Karen sighed, pulling her phone out of her bra and wiping crumbs from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure,' Diana sighed, sliding out of the car with relative ease, save for when her armor pinched her rapidly softening figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the car was easy. Her powers were immense afterall and she didn't even jostle the napping fat girls that were earth's sole hope against this menace. But as she stood beneath the car, ready to fly, the burgeoning fat woman really hoped her powers of flight didn't decide to crap out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed in, breasts straining against her armor while the pressure on her gut decreased and then exhaled, several seams popping. Her legs bent and she jumped, aiming to fly into the air...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a car packed full of over stuffed, over weight superheroines held above her head, Wonder Woman felt a spike of fear. Her flight was becoming unreliable and now she was trusting, if not the lives but at least the safety of her friends to the rapidly fading gift. She took a deep breathe, straps straining and sighing against her swollen body, and prayed softly to the Olympians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mighty Zeus, Cunning Hera, Wise Athena, Loving Aphrodite, Bright Apollo,' she said softly, near begging, 'sustain me until I land, I beg of you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana felt her tan skin flush, like it would in direct sunlight on a warm day. The Gods were hearing her! Smiling, the Amazon squatted her thick, freshly untoned thighs and jumped into the air, the far too fully loaded SUV feeling light as a feather. Exaltation from their attention made her shoot up several thousand feet in moments and she rocketed out of Gotham at the speed of a fighter jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as she smiled at the surge of power, Diana detected that something was wrong. Beads of sweat were breaking out on her forehead and her breathing was coming faster, a tiredness seizing her body that would have been familiar to any athlete who'd tried to reach their previous speed levels after a period of inactivity. By the time she'd crossed over New Jersey she'd dropped a hundred miles an hour from her speed and a thousand feet from her altitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's happening to me?' the freshly out of shape superheroine gasped to herself, totally unfamiliar with having to deal with a less than perfect body rejecting the demands she made of it but too proud to admit defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was past the eastern sea board a sharp pain was shooting out from the princess' side: the first stitch the sculpted warrior woman had ever felt. She was gasping by the time she got to the midwest, coated in sweat and moving at the speed of a commercial airliner. Shin splints were hammering her calves above Saint Louis and the trip across Missouri took longer than all the states before it. Kansas city passed only a thousand feet beneath her and on its highways a few late night speedsters were actually out pacing Wonder Woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Doing okay down there Di?' Power Girl asked her, craning out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'F-fine,' Diana gasped, trying to blink away some black spots in her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cool, follow that road beneath us for a while,' the Kryptonian said, 'maybe push up the pace a little though?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, gasping, the Champion of Olympus staggered on. The sun was starting to glow on the eastern horizon as she passed smallville, its endless corn fields abandoned and choked with weeds while its mainstreet featured a brand new Anonymous Bakery assembly yard, and approached the Star-Tech research complex in the nearby mountains. By this point Diana's altitude was rapidly falling, her boots barely cleared its security fence and she went along at the speed of a mobility scooter. At last  her feet touched the gravel and the Amazon wheezed as she sat the car down, immediately collapsing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Urghurrrkk,' Diana groaned as Power Girl got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underware clad blonde looked stunning. Her immense, two months overdue with triplets food baby had faded away to a freshly knocked up bump, barely noticeable beneath her mountainous cleavage. Indeed, her kryptonian metabolism had so quickly vanquished her unbelieavable binge that Wonder Woman barely noticed her tiny swelling. Diana gave her a brief glare, marveling at her perfection, both hating and desiring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm gonna hit the shower while the lazy piglets sleep off their feast, then get breakfast and then nap,' Karen announced, before noticing the prone, utterly spent Amazon, 'Crap, are you okay?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think...I think I might be...slightly out of condition,' Diana admitted, trying to push herself up and failing, her exhausted arms unable to bear her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl zipped over to her side, picking up the tall woman and marveling at how soft her thighs and back felt. Diana was oozing out of her armor, her breasts were popping out of the breast plate and her soft arms were cutting into her bracers. Karen felt her mouth go dry at the sight and feel of her, the pleasant heaviness and new softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, don't worry about that,' Karen smiled, showing perfect white teeth, 'While the data is decoded I'll put you through a nice little boot camp. Before long you'll be in the best shape of your life.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really?' Wonder Woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh yeah,' Karen promised, smiling like a lion with a gazelle, 'now, lets get you to bed. You need to relax before we get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe hadn't really been lying. Karen had a good crop of chubby heroines ready to be grown into the chunkiest, waddlingest, fattest versions of themselves before she was done. She'd make them fatter and fatter and fatter and ingrain so many bad habits into them that even if they were magically trimmed down they'd be doomed to obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlll she needed to do was decide how it would be done as the recover data was decrypted. Would she do it the easy way or the hard way? fatten them up naughtily or nicely?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a good guy after all, even if she was also raging pervert with a near uncontrollable fat fetish. She'd insure each of her friends continued to get flabby and jiggly and soft and lazy but do so in a way that they'd enjoy so much they'd never want to be thin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"theyll enjoy getting fat so much, they'll thank me,\" PG told herself, feeling her hardening nipples and dripping pussy at the fantasy, \"especially Diana, who'll get fat tits so huge they hit the floor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fantasy continued for a while but she was more than ready to begin when Starfire hovered in to the kitchen later in the morning. She was the first to awaken, her room strategically placed right next to the kitchen and the redhaired alien was drawn out of bed and then out of a rushed shower by the smell of burning bacon. The overfed hour glass spotted the still fit  power girl, clad in leggings that showed off her hard legs and sports bra, laboring in front of one of many stoves in the compound's immense kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PG, should I call the department of fires!?\" The Tamaranian asked in alarm.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ha, nah I'm just having problems cooking,' Karen said, turning around and feeling her jaw drop open, \"goddamn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire had always been hot, in a profession known for having some of the hottest women in the known universe in it she'd been at the top. And getting fat, she was now right on the cusp of true cattiness rather than just being plump, had put her firmly in the sights of Power Girl's fetish. When skinny she'd been unnoticeable, but now that she was fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Rao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the compound's suites came with clothes: grey shorts, leggings and sweats and the ones in Star's room would have been scandoulsly tight on her before she'd blown up. Now they were near obscene The tan alien ginger was in an extremely tight pair of shorts, nearly panties themselves, which showed off her long decadent legs. Although thick, more than a hint of their once lithe shapeliness  remained and as she stepped the soft thighs rasped irresistibly, made better by the healthy patches of cellulite running up them to her spherical cheeks which had a fresh ripple of new fat to them and were so wide they stuck out to the side, wobbling back and forth with each step. Karen bet that ass was soft as butter and bouncy as rubber, she wondered how much pounding it could take if she got a strap on and guessed it would be immense just by its pure volume.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was very tall, the size-small Starware t shirt didn't cover her midriff and after the caloric rampage of the anonymous plant there was new ground to explore. Last nights relatively small tummy had a new soft bulge to it, a bulge Karen longed to explore every delicious inch of. It hung over the rim of her shorts, a doughy muffin top and yeasty bear belly all at once, although it was literally overshadowed by her heavy MILF tits stretched the shirts logo deliciously, clearly having sucked up as many calories as her ass.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had the sag of a woman who'd had two kids back to back and lefty was a cup size ahead of righty, but Karen was jealous and a little intimidated to be the smallest tits in the room for once. She'd clearly been in the shower given how the damp outlines of her now down pointing nipples could be seen. Just the barest sliver of saggy lefty was starting to poke out of the far too tall t-shirt.  Kori had put her fiery mane into a pony tail, which showed off her rounding face and new chin to good effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Are you ok?\" K'ori asked again, drifting closer, soft bod pressing amazingly into Karen's hard one, 'let me look! Bacon grease is delicious but scary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" the invulnerable woman played off, feeling her panties dampen, 'just annoyed I ruined breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite masturbating earlier, Power Girl was immediately ready to go again. As it was, she had to put thoughts of the thickening Amazon into her mind to resist taking the tubby Tamaranian then and there. Biting her lip, she picked up the skillet, no mitt required, to show lumps of bacon shaped charcoal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but don't we have the nuts of dough?\" Starfire gestured, pointing at a 24 box of Anonymous whipped cream stuff fried goodies on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but they're what's making you all fat and will probably fatten me eventually,' the superbly fit heroine tapped her ruler flat belly, which held half a dozen of the calorie bombs in it, 'so I had an idea...have you ever heard of addiction displacement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. Dick was very serious when he said I had to be gentle because it wouldn't grow back,' K'ori nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'not what I meant,' Karen grimaced, 'so, we're addicted to the chemicals in this anonymous crap, right? And we feed that addiction by eating their food, which is almost all food anymore. But what if we eat something else instead? If we eat so much were too full to go get anonymous junk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I'm guessing that if everything we eat isn't anonymous stuff, we'll eventually break the addiction and be able to lose weight,' Karen finished, munching on another donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUgh, it was jelly. She hated jelly. She chewed quicker so she could wash it down with a better one.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'But I suck at cooking,' PG told the nearly fat red head, 'everything just gets burned.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Oh! I love cooking. It's like working but with food afterwards!,' K'ori laughed, 'can I try?'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'I mean...if you want...,' Karen told her, in false hesitation, 'but it would be a lot of food. You'd have to cook enough for all of us, every day all day, you'd practically live in the kitchen.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn a moment the alien princess was zipping around a kitchen full of hissing skillets and bubbling pots. Karen watched her jiggling butt wiggle around while she polished off a whip cream long john, smiling as the Tamaranian sampled every dish. She knew the Titan leader's MILF figure was an outward extension of a maternal mind, she'd stay in the kitchen cooking all day long, gradually bulking up while also fattening everyone else up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'But PG, what if eating the cold turkey is bad for us?' Starfire asked out of the blue, turning around with a jiggle of boobs, 'the chemicals might hurt as they withdraw.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Good idea,' Karen nodded, 'we better keep some anonymous snacks around to keep us from going into withdrawal. We can tapper them down over time.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'This was so smart of you to do,' the red head laughed, as nearly an entire side of soy bacon sizzled, 'soon we'll all be skinny again!'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Oh yeah, I'm sure,' Power Girl grinned, hand trying to find a donut from the empty box.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer hard, muscular belly grumbled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNot it in protest but in hunger. She shushed it, knowing she'd be too busy to go full glutton now. With one last glance at Starfire's round ass, which was very symmetrical, she set off to help her next friend embrace obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, who? Diana would still be sleeping, but Raven, Barbara and the Wonder girl/Supergirl pair would probably be up. The later hadnt showed up yet, probably delayed feeding that carbo gut and Wonder girl would need to be caught in the act of feeding her friend for Karen to hold their shared fetish over her. That left the rotund goth and the butt heavy bat girl</span></div></div>",

She'd intentionally put the fatty Titan in a long hallway far away from the others, knowing just a bit of the goths bitterly anti social tendencies. No one answered her, probably because Swedish death metal at an ear damaging volume was blaring past the door. In all likelihood, it was meant to cover up any knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young people,' she muttered <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl waited a moment longer and gave the door a sharp rap with two knuckles. The lock shattered and it slammed into the opposite wall, hanging on one hinge. Karen walked in casually, wide but hard hips swaggering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone home?\" She asked, slightly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery other room in the complex was like a hotel suite, nice but blandly furnished. This room though had changed in a few hours: black carpet, black wall paper, black ceiling, black books on black book shelves, black bed, black speakers blaring black metal and black candles burning low. How the fat girl had gotten this here so quickly was a mystery, but for now Raven sat unaware of Karens entrance in the bean bag chair, large black head phones encasing her ears and a laptop flickered in her plush lap, while she devoured an entire family sized box of sugary breakfast cereal with one hand and sucked soda with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fattest Titan was only wearing a bra, it's strap cutting deep into milky pale flesh. So deep did it pinch that a meaty set of back cleavage had formed and the arms that shoveled cereal wobbled with useless adipose in a way a twenty year olds shouldn't. There was no muscle tone or bone outline visible, just as Ravens once hour glass waist didn't taper. In fact, she didn't seem to have a waist at all from the back, just a saggy sprawl of love handles that matched her meaty hips and went up to her beefy chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Starfire, who had a plus size models enticing curves, Raven was just big and sloppy. You could believe star used to be thin, a picture of svelte Starfire would clearly be a younger version of the same woman, although the time scale being months and the number of pregnancies being zero would surprise you, but Raven? Raven looked like she'd been fat for years, Karen had to jog her memory to recall the Titan had once been a lean hour glass. She had to have been a hundred pounds over weight before last night's stuffing. A photo of the same woman wouldn't be recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren mused to herself: Would she be like that one day? So fat as to be unRecognizable? Not if she just stood here ogling a fat chicks  back rolls. She'd have to work to get that big, unlike some people who took obesity for granted ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Rav, sorry about the door,\" she said, only for the borderline obese goth to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, PG stalked forwards, seeing the Half Demon had a laptop on her thighs. Thighs like bread dough, with stretch marks, spider veins and cellulite flaring across them to enticingly she needed a moment to notice the laptop was playing a colorful cartoon about magic ponies. Vibrant colors flickered over Ravens moon round, unhealthily pale face,  which displayed wide eyed innocence and joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rao, this is perfect,\" Karen giggled, then pulled the headphones off in a swift movement, flicking them off and leaning down to ask, \"Is this the one where they learn about friendship? I never took you for a pony lover, I mean, I was, when I was six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Raven sat in frozen shock while the show ended and PG grinned, a grin that ended when she noticed the candles had gone out. Raven reared up from the bean bag with a fat girl grunt, turning to present a Buddha belly just starting to get a double gut and low hanging, fat girl boobs that slumped so nicely into their cups Karen almost didn't notice the goth now had four blazing red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INTERLOPER,\" the not so friendly psychic hissed, flinging one bingo winged arm wrapped in evil energy across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren grunted in real pain as a crackling field of jet energy entrapped her. She struggled, finding herself totally helpless, which caused a perverse thrill almost as good as looking at fatty porn to hit her. Invulnerability didn't go over to magic and she was utterly at Ravens mercy, not that there was any to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare to mock me? You brainless, skinny, over sexed, over breasted bimbo?\" Raven growled, constricting Karen tighter, driving breath from her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notlikethat,\" Power girl gasped, both from lack of air and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knew losing a fight was so fun? The hate from Raven over her unaffected figure was as sexy as being helpless...okay she might actually die here though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flaunting that killer bod, eating whatever you want and staying thin, while the rest of us swell into hideous lumps?\" Raven continued addressing the fit alien, who was wearing tight leggings and a small crop top that showed enough cleavage to kill a man and a hard abdomen, \"how'd you like it if I stuffed you so full of curses you were the fat one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Karen managed, barely able to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit, she was offering to fatten her up? Was she in chubby chaser heaven? She watched in glee as Raven summoned most of a box of anonymous laced Cinnamon Toast Crunch from the box and the river of sugar bombs raced into her mouth. Karen chewed with glee, munching until it was empty and then guzzling a liter of fizzing soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this it? Could this crazy half demon curse her into obesity at last!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, the next episode auto played and Raven sighed. Her eyes went purple again and she let Karen fall down as she sat in the bean bag chair, her tubby body too much of a chore to keep airborne. Karen coughed as she noticed the Goth adjust her lower belly fat against her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you bothering me, bimbo?\" Raven growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted...to...pick your brain,\" the kryptonian from another dimension gasped, 'cause you're such a, such a strong wizard...witch...warlock...um, Mage? Listen, my company has a bunch of spell books in storage from a study on curses and I thought there had to be a magic component to anonymous, right? How'd they get you otherwise? Maybe the key to reversing this is in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven growled at the reminder of her dumpiness, but levitated the books over anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. Read it. Crap. Crap and I've read it.. Fake Christian crap. Fake neo pagan crap. Fake old pagan crap,\" the goth grumpily dismissed, \"wait. This looks interesting. It's even on curses to make your foe big bellied, weak willed and impotent. Wait, it's Minoan-D. Untranslatable. And thus crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a book on learning it,' the muscular blonde told her, fishing a waynepod from her cleavage, \"an audio book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,' Raven grunted, but accepted it, looking at the screen \"Wait, 400 hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you've got anything better to do?' Karen asked, \"although I do like that cartoon. Maybe we can watch it in the main room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can never mention that,\" the goth snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Cross my heart and hope to get fat,\" Karen promised, tapping one pert, heavy tit, \"the snacks are yours btw. Thought you might like some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, cause I'm fat!?\" Raven snarled, 'it won't seem as funny when you can't see your feet!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren had barely seen her feet in over ten years, since her immense breasts had hit their full growth. But she got the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we all eat like fat girls. I just don't look like one yet,' she defended, 'although I could any day. I check all the time to make sure I'm not bulking up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true, she did check everyday and was disappointed to find hard muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping you do before the cure is found. Then you'll learn what it's like to feel wrapped in fat,' Raven mocked, picking up her beer keg belly and jiggling it, \"look at this! This is your future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh no,\" Karen managed, lips trembling, nipples starting to cut into her sports bra, \"oh. I better, uh, go, but uh, Star says breakfast is in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuper speed was handy getting back to her room. And handy caressing her sopping clit and erect nipples for the short time her second orgasm took. She wanted to scream and writhe, but bit her lip in silence until the orgasm was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be a problem,\" Karen sighed, lifting up off the bed and going to wash her hands, \"surrounded by fatties all day? Having a real chance of fattening up? I'll be going every ten minutes! Damn fetish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in the mirror. Her muscles bulged, her abs seemed to be getting more defined, her tits wobbled free of gravity and her thigh gap, um, gapped. Sighing in disgust, the heroine decided to turn her attention elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other self, Kara would need attention when she arrived to get into the right mindset and Karen recognized a kindred, perverted spirit in wonder girl that needed nurturing. And Babs had surely hauled her heavy traffic stopping buns out of bed by now...</span></div></div>",

Wonder Girl was at a delicate time, grappling with a fetish and a friendship maybe turning\ufeff into something more\ufeff. If handled well it would not only win Karen an ally, but help continue to let her vicariously gain weight via her daintier doppledanger Kara. Supergirl and her new vulnerability to weight gain could be the chunky Kryptonian Karen couldn't. But Wonder Girl would need a good role model and some good advice from an experienced feeder to keep her on the curvy and thick.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Karen had ever actually gotten to feed anyone before but...anyway Barbara's marshmallow legs would still be waddling down the hallway after Karen got done with Wonder Girl. She listened out with her superior senses, hearing try and fail to get her skirt buttoned up in her room and Cassie's newly plush thighs schwishing down the hall. A little burst of speed put Karen in a good ambush position in enough time to nonchalantly lean against the wall as Cassie Sandsmark rounded a corner, clad in loose grey sweats and a matching hoody that hid her body. She'd made the effort to put on make up though and her super strong arms carefully balanced four plates swimming in crispy soy bacon and veggie sausage, biscuits and gravy, pancakes and french toast and waffles drowned in syrup and powdered sugar and butter, eggs and one pathetic slice of melon from Starfire's kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's a lot of food you're carrying there, Cassie,' Karen observed as the demi-god jumped to see the waiting kryptonian,dropping one plate which Power Girl easily caught, rescuing every drop of gravy, 'planning on putting on a few more pounds, filling out those sw\ufeffeats? Or are they for someone else? You planning on feeding someone out of their bright red skirt?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Girl turned beat red, glaring as Power Girl started eating bacon, 'I'm just bringing her breakfast, I'm not trying to make her gain weight or anything. I'm just being nice.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, you're real nice,' Karen smiled, taking the melon slice and dunking it first in gravy and then in syrup, making a mockery of its healthyness before she sucked the greasy, sweet concoction off it, 'you're always bringing her snacks. Picking out her favorites. Making food runs and giving her extra. And you know, she's looking a little bit chunky because of it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Everyone's gaining weight,' Cassie said defensively, 'except you, but I couldn't even button my jeans this morning after the binge at the factory last night. And the aliens starting gaining weight earlier than the demi-gods.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Funny thing about that though,' Karen mused, 'when Babs was showing us the data yesterday, I watched the starting weights and the current known weights for everyone. And you know what? Kara's gained about forty five pounds in a month, a pound a half a day. While Starfire who started off a month earlier has only gained sixty, Raven's been at a hundred days and gained about a hundred, same for the normies. A pound a day. Even the same for you demi-gods I bet, minus last night.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren downed a biscuit covered in gravy, smiling as she patted Cassie's small stomach under her hoody, making the freshman heroine flinch 'Maybe she just has a slow metabolism.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kinda weird that Kara's gaining fifty percent faster than everyone else,' Power Girl smiled, 'almost like a room mate or somebody close to them was feeding them. Making sure that snack food was always at hand, waiting on her hand and foot, watching with glee as all her ribs got covered up. Because her roommate had a fat fetish so overwhelming she didn't care she was depowering her friend with every snack she pressed into Kara's greedy fingers. You know she's lost her most of her invulnerability right? She's all weak and vulnerable right now, her senses have gone too. She can't even hear us out here. And if it hadn't been for you, she'd just be a little chubby.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie cringed in her oversized sweats, looking scared, ashamed and angry at the smug heroine before her, 'how...how did you know?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because, Kara's family. Younger, sweeter, a little angrier on the inside, but shes' the little sister I never had...who's also me,' Karen said, 'I notice when Zeus' daughter is staring at her navel and thinking about putting her head under her skirt. And you know what?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl leaned in, smiling evily as she put the last of the sausage into her mouth. She was a big woman, even without powers she'd have been intimidating given all her muscles, not to mention the immense swell of her tits, and had several inches on Cassie. She swallowed and pinched Cassie's slightly softer cheek affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I approve,' Karen told her, voice instantly lightening, 'you want her fat, happy and protected. But you've made a few mistakes in the feeding business, if I might say.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Girl blinked, shaking her head, 'what...you...you think its okay I'm fattening her up?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, nothing nicer than plumping up a thin girl, eh?' Karen said, thinking of Diana, 'seeing all that hard muscle getting covered up in flab. Its tantalizing isn't it, that she's got such a big stomach? Its unflattering, it must be so embarassing for her to think she got so chunky so quick? A little schadenfreud gets the juices flowing right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was staring, wide eyed. After years browsing deviant art of feeling ashamed and guilty, of feeling like a hypcrite everytime she worked out, finding out someone else had this fetish? Someone else who just happened to be a superfit heroine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But that can't only go so far,' Power Girl reminded her, picking up another plate, 'you really like Kara right? The way she snorts when she laughs too hard? The way she geeks out over Black Canary songs? The way she gets pissed off when something bad happens to someone? Not just the way her stomach expands over her waist band now when she exhales?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course!' Cassie squeaked in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then she can't be miserable,' Karen told her, 'shes' gotta feel happy. She's gotta feel accepted. You want her to smile as you hand feed her right? Does she even know you're head over heels for her?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, I'm...what if she says no?' Cassie asked fearfully, watching a waffle disappear between Karen's flashing teeth while more and more white showed on the kryptonian's second plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then she says no, but first you gotta butter her up,' Karen told her, 'you eaten breakfast yet?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was gonna be my plate,' Wonder Girl  said, 'I was gonna suggest a breakfast date...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Two plates each, but you'd only eat one and say you were full? Good idea,' Karen said, shoveling in the last bacon on the plate, 'but not dressed like that you're not.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nothing else fits me,' Cassie said, looking down, 'in case you haven't noticed, I'm not as thin as I was. Especially after last night. I swear I gained ten pounds since I went into that warehouse!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So you're at what, fifteen over what you were? Wow, maybe you're at a normal weight,' Karen's eyes rolled, suppressing a shudder of sexual thrill, 'how do you think Kara feels having put on forty five when she's four inches shorter than you? Do you think she's gonna jump at getting fatter when you're hiding a little vanity weight?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine, I'm a hypocrite. My pants don't fit and my thighs started brushing,' Cassie sighed, 'what can I do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl smiled and took a third plate, 'Eat that last plate, go get two more from Star and eat all of them too. Bloat that belly up as big as it'll get, into a food baby as big as Kara's.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren patted her own waist, which after twenty four doughnuts, a family sized box of cereal, a two liter of cola and three plates of sugary, greasy breakfast had at last bloated up into a nice little food baby despite her immense stomach capacity. She adjusted the fit of her leggings and let the slope of her somewhat puffy stomach stick out. she smiled as Wonder Girl was enraptured by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then go eat breakfast with Kara?' Cassie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, you'll go down that hallway and into the sustainable cloathing lab. We've got a 3d fabric printer there that's pretty easy to use,' Karen said, pointing with a cinnamon toast slice, 'there's a terminal there that'll print you out a bikini so tight, so flimsy, so skimpy that skinny you would look like a hippo into it. Pour yourself into it and sashay belly first over to Kara's room and suggest you go sun bathing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sun bathing, why would she want to go sunbathing...she...wait,' Cassie said in dawning realization, 'she's kryptonian. She's afraid of losing her powers and she gets them from the sun!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now you're thinking! She'll be nervous to get into a bikini, but remind her that I didn't get this body by working out. Her hiding inside cause she's chubby is probably why she's losing her powers so fast,' Power Girl told her, taking the last plate and patting her gut, 'let her pick out her own bikini, but compliment her. Tell her how good the skimpy ones will look on her, tell her how good being soft suits her if she disagrees. Say you're happy to have a gut now and, if she takes it well...ask if she thinks the same about you. While you're laying out, bring in plenty of snacks and eat a lot of them. Then you can ask her if she likes you romantically.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren adjusted her pants, which were being pressed down by the heavy sphere of her stuffed belly. She wasn't as big as yesterday yet, but the day was early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, I'll try and follow your advice,' Wonder Girl said, not able to tear her eyes away from the gorged woman's stomach as Karen handed her the empty plates, the contrast of ripped arms, G cup knockers and swollen belly drool worthy, 'do you think it'll work?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think its worth a shot,' Karen burped, 'if we're gonna be stuck in an obesity epidemic, might as well enjoy it right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, thanks Power Girl,' Cassie nodded, mustering her courage, 'I appreciate the advice.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, us perverts have to stick together huh?'

She'd probably need help getting her 300+ pounds settled in comfortably, preferably into an XXXL thong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding her wasn't that hard for Karen. She just had to use her super hearing to isolate the loudest pounding heart and the grind of the of the most overloading joints to the hallway between computer lab and kitchen. Power girl didn't hurry on her way there, Babs wasn't exactly sprinting, and had time to grab a box of leftover bacon from the kitchen, where a stuffed Starfire was lazily cleaning while cookies and cakes rose in every oven. Passing a gargantually stuffed Raven trying to muster the energy to levitate back to her own room, winking at a now bikini clad Wonder girl stuffing herself and complimenting Star on her cooking, Karen went to find the once award winning gymnast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly saw Barbara on exiting, a small hill of slow moving cellulite that made the stuffed Kryptonians jaw drop. Karen had long written Gotham off as a city of weirdos, but had known Barbara Gordon had been a tall, graceful woman with a gymnasts hard muscled legs and a toned bubble butt a quarter would bounce off of.  Everything about that had changed and was well displayed by a pair of XL purple Gotham U athletic shorts hanging onto dear life to the avalanche of cellulite pouring out of them. Karen was a tit girl, hard not to be given her G cups, but she almost forgot tits existed at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabs ass was now a maze of creases, folds and bulges that an arcade worth of quarters could disappear into. Each globular cheek had more fat than Karen's entire body did and by sheer force were slowly eating the shorts into a thong. There wasn't a patch she could see that didn't have Cellulite or angry red stretch marks from her rapid growth and they jiggled like jello with each halting step. Karen would have put her hip measurement at fifty inches minimum, probably more like sixty, and made a mental note to keep the armrests on the building office chairs, just so Babs could get stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were more like plastic bags full of gravy than limbs capable of running across roof tops. Unlike Stars silken rasp, Babs thighs constantly slapped together at her pathetic wobble. There was no muscle tone at all to their milky sprawl and they quivered with the strain of their own weight, when the jiggling of a step stoppe that is, and wherever cellulite wasn't spider veins were. Her knees were wrapped in black supportive braces, irritated red fat mushrooming out, under and over them. There was neither calf nor ankle, just one bulge of swollen, linebacker ham hock cankle between brace and sensible shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts not that her flabby bingo wings, love handles  or slightly humped shoulders weren't there, but Barbaras upper body was merely that of a fat girl, while her lower body was so immense to be almost useless already. Indeed,  Her right  arm, flabby and small only by comparison, leaned heavily onto a medical cane, while her left struggled with a courier bag.  She panted like a race horse and her t shirt was dark with sweat from walking down the air conditioned hall. Her physical condition was awful, pathetic given that six months earlier she'd been as fit and as dangerous as a squad of Navy SEALS. Karen felt a surge of lust and pity to see her hobbling display and wiped away drool to call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey B-Girl,' Karen shouted, \"need a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara turned with the grace of an 18 wheeler, laboriously shuffling to see Power Girls hard body floating in the air, marred only by a food baby. Babs blue eyes glared as she felt the fit alien smugly eye her ruined body up, but relented considering the length of hallway to go. She wasn't the girl who'd been an Olympic prospect gymnast anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure if you could just,\" Gordon began only for a whoosh of air to sound and to find herself plopped gently in a sturdy, reinforced computer chair before a wall of screens and keyboards, the screens showing a super computer slowly decrypting the anonymous server data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to help,\" Karen smiled, skin tingling where the obese woman had touched her, 'need anything else Batgirl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara slumped, \"I'm not Batgirl anymore, just lardass Barbara Gordon, too fat to walk down a hallway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Of course you're still Batgirl, you're more than just Kung fu and thin legs,\" Power Girl told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was planning on retirement before this. Four years of crime fighting after fifteen years of gymnastics aren't good on the knees, even when you're thin,\" the red head gestured depressively, \"then my trainee Stephanie took me to an anonymous bakery to celebrate and well...we both got fat. At least I didn't go missing too, even if Im gonna need a wheel chair soon. Like, the end of August soon if we don't find a way to reverse this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, best stay off your feet until we find a cure,\" Karen told her, 'fortunately that chair is an all in one wheel chair, bed and computer desk for the disabled, first of its line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara bristled at being called disabled but stopped when Karen started tapping keys on a computer. An android appeared out of a metal tube and with a click and a whir of a hologram it turned into a fit, muscular man in a speedo. A well packed speedo Babs, who'd been too disgusted with herself for sex, instantly stared at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and this is our proto type assistance-bot, programmed to meet every need. And I mean every need,' Karen smiled, slapping it's hard ass, \"and I'll send you an actual lab assistant later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Barbara managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, she's Kryptonian science guild and at the rate she's shedding powers mental work is going to be more her speed before long,\" Power girl said, especially given that she planned to help Cassie turn Karas pound and a half a day gain into a quaint number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arent you science guild too?\" Barbara asked, still looking at the sex bot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm more physical for now,\" Karen smiled, tapping a bicep, then smiling as she heard Wonder Woman's armor rustle, 'now if you'll excuse me, I've got some training to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swaggered off, leading with her gut to find Wonder Woman in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nKaren went to find Diana in the gym, hearing her diligently pumping iron like she wasn't cursed to slow motion dive into obesity. Her heart was beating a little harder than it should have been, clearly having to work harder. And with each breath, a deep breath coming evenly but quickly, came with a strain of too tight armor against burgeoning flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl felt herself drool. She wanted to see how last night's binge had distributed onto the Amazonian Anonymous Addict's tall figure, to see the damage her over exerted flying had done to once steely muscles. To perhaps see the warrior princess struggle with basic exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated in a daze, going right past Wonder Girl and Super Girl going towards the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's stomach was as stuffed as Karen's, groaning at the sudden influx of greasy breakfast food past the point of satiation and on the border of pain. Before the Demi-God had the body of a medal winning track captain, but after a week or more of Anonymous junk food and a Bacchanalian binge she had the physique of a college freshman cheerleader who'd unknowingly lost the first skirmishes of the battle of the bulge. A tiny red string bikini, made essentially of dental floss, showed every new inch and new ounce: There were no muscles on her now and apart from her overloaded stomach she was fattening up evenly. Her slightly brushing thighs quivered with each step, the jiggle running over the widening layer of fat on her hips, the new infant love handles swallowing the miniscule strings of her bikini. A once perky, only slightly rounded ass was wobbling back and forth, eating her thong with animalistic hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts, between a C and a D now, bounced and quivered in tiny cups that barely covered her nipples. She had Australian cleavage, suddenly heavy and low breasts literally pouring out. It was an equally enticing and embarrassing display, her curves were enticing but the curve of her food baby suggested that they'd rapidly increase and the soft wiggle of her body, from her slightly thicker ankles to a tiny bulge beneath her chin when she looked down, would have made a somewhat more forgiving swimsuit more suggestible. But the side kick and occasional teen Titan was putting everything into acting happy and confident, as if she had no concern of the freshman fifteen that had made its way across her body.  She wanted to make her fat look good, to entice the porky Kryptonian next to her to strip down and let go, and to that end was actively pushing out her enormous food baby to increase its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast, the shorter Supergirl was in a blue one piece that tried to hide her mushy stomach. It failed, because as the measurements of the clothing printer had shown, even empty her pampered gut was a foot bigger than her dainty waist had been before her addiction. Her fupa pushed out at the groin, right above where her squishy thighs almost touched, and the one piece didn't even fit around her gut. She'd shotgunned Breakfast sandwiches in her newly developed nervous eating as she anxiously awaited her new swimsuit to be printed out and her moderately stuffed gut had gained an extra four or five temporary inches from the binge. The blue fabric was stretched near transparent around her stomach, pulling down the neckline and magnifying her new B cups while showing off her meaty love handles on the side, starting to sag over her still mostly narrow hips. She grinned nervously at her floating quasi-family member, showing new dimples on face that was rounding rapidly underneath an unfortunate case of acne and above a full double chin. Kara was quiveringly  nervous, near an anxiety attack: she was afraid that someone would point out her unsightly weight gain, terrified that she'd continue losing her powers, angry that she was losing her powers to her new appetite, anxiously hopeful over the chance to slow their decline and ready to faint over her desire to tell Cassie how good the new bounce to her ass looked but too afraid to mention it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie had Kara's hand clenched nervously on her left side, while her right hauled a heavy cooler surely packed with a weekend's worth of soda, snacks and a few smuggled 'light' beers. Anonymous owned most of the breweries now and the average light beer was packed with Poison Ivy-bred chemicals rivaling crack in their addictiveness and over a thousand calories per twelve ounces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir nerves and chubbiness as they both slowly rolled towards romance was impossibly adorable and normally Karen would have cooed to make that  match. But the two might have been invisible to Power Girl,\ufeff\ufeff because her super hearing had heard an armored belt be grudgingly let out a notch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman voluntarily letting her belt out? The entire lineup of Victoria's Secret Angels in an eating contest couldn't tear her away from that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren paused outside the gym, wishing she'd done her hair better or put on make up. Her clothes were alright, Diana had mentioned she liked muscles and the leggings showed muscle and curve very well, but the packed bowling ball of her temporary belly didn't seem exactly fit. Damn, she knew she should have kept to one dozen long johns. As presentable as she could be, stomach ever so slightly tucked in, Power Girl went inside, trying to swagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the towering brunette was at a butterfly press, arms pressing the maxed out paddles. Wonder Woman easily moved it, not a surprise, but had a look of intense concentration on her face and her biceps didn't pop like expected, having declined noticeably in tone. That puzzled Karen, the 500 lbs was as effectively heavy as a piece of paper to someone at their level of might. Bar military vehicles and geographic features there were few things on earth that could strain their muscles enough for exercise to matter, one reason PG didn't bother lifting. But surprise was undercut by lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was wearing her armor and needed a new cuirass knocked out pronto, before someone got hurt. She was soft all over, not a hint of muscle tone to be found. Maybe a new poison in anonymous Arsenal had turned them into fat, maybe the aftershock of her overextended flight had decayed them, but for whatever reason, Diana was soft as butter. Not fat, no, not even chubby. But soft, clearly out of shape, like she'd been desk bound and couch prone for a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she'd gone up a cup size, new cleavage mushroomed over her breast plate with every press. The steel groaned against the massed boob flesh arrayed before it and Karen heard leather starting to snap. She barely noticed the delicious muffin too forming beneath it, pushing a ring of bronze belly fat into the gap between armor and skirt, straining against a belt ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl opened her mouth to say something as Diana locked eyes on her, the two heroines vying for dominance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would speak first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Power Girl tried to play herself off as cool, calm and in control. But the sight of slightly ruined perfection was driving her too crazy. Diana gave another press and with a pop a crack ran across her breast plate, the metal failing to contain too much nigh invulnerable boobage. Karen blinked, permanently losing a couple IQ points and felt her mouth hang open. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWonder Woman seized the initiative, just as she'd been trained to on her island home. The woman before her had the hard arms of Athena and the runners legs of Artemis, combined with the bust of Aphrodite she was gorgeous, but that she sported the belly of Hera was a bad sign. With her own powers crumbling, Wonder Woma\ufeffn needed someone to rely on and it wouldn't do if Karen got fat and weak like the rest of them.\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Karen, you're looking well fed,' Diana nodded and the Kryptonian felt a bit of shame over her bloat, 'a bit too well fed.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Oh yeah, had breakfast before heading over,' Karen said, leaving out the other three breakfasts she'd sucked down as well, 'nothing compared\ufeff to yesterday though. Say, why don't we go get some lunch together?'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Are you sure that's a good idea?' Wonder\ufeff Woman asked with the raise of one perfect eyebrow, 'Preserving your powers would be the strategically wise solution.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Pfft, I can take it,' Power Girl shrugged, patting her stomach, 'and if I can't, whatever. We get to make the beast with two chunky backs, eh?'\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Whatever?' Diana said, standing up, letting Karen see just how little muscle tone remained to her runner's thighs, 'I don't think you've grasped the seriousness of the situation. We're gaining weight like no tomorrow and losing powers faster than ice melts in July. Super girl has to squint to see across a room, Star Fire's bolts have gone from cannon shells to pistol rounds in force, Batgirl can barely walk and my powers are barely working! By the time that data is decrypted none of us could have powers.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Amazon was getting more and more worked up as she talked, chest heaving against her cracking armor. There was sweat on her forehead and as she turned, Karen saw that her once perfect profile was marred by a new belly bulge. Not huge by any means, she was still at a normal BMI, but as the tall brunette spoke Karen realized she had no muscle tone anywhere. She looked completely out of shape!\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDiana was a warrior called up from peace time work by a bakery. A panther hand fed sweet meats till it lost its graceful gate. A retired model stuffing herself into clothes that no longer fit.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Your powers aren't working?' Karen asked with real concern, shaking away lust, 'Is that why last night...'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'That last binge at the factory it did something to me, pushed me over some sort of edge. Before I'd been muscle with a little fat over it, but now I'm fat with some muscle under it despite being about the same size. Those gallons of raspberry filling I sucked down, after I digested them my muscle decayed and my fat multiplied,' Diana sighed, 'My powers have always been tied to my physical fitness. Before it did't matter, I was fit but now...'\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Amazon made a muscle with her right arm. It bulged, but bulged less than the former resting size of her bicep. For emphasis Diana's other hand grabbed hold of a new softness covering her decayed tricep and wiggled it.\ufeff<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\n'I am in pathetic shape anymore,' Wonder Woman admitted, 'I can lift these weights easily but I start sweating and getting tired after a few sets. And last night I should have had you fly but I couldn't admit that I'd gotten too weak...too fat.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe sat on a weight bench, arms crossed under even more impressive than normal breasts. Karen followed and put an arm around her. As she did, the Kryptonian marveled at how soft the shoulder she touched was. Diana's lean lethal arms were now pillowy and plump. And how deep the canyon of cleavage was: at least an entire cup size of new fat had found its way to Diana's now heavy looking chest. If things kept up, Power Girl's famous chest soon be the smallest one in the league.\ufeff<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\n'Hey, I wouldn't have thought any worse of you,' Power girl told her, 'Like I said, I like fat girls...and well, we're all addicts one way or another. I wouldn't think worse of you if some evil wizard or alien warlord used a no-fly Ray on you and I won't think worse of you snacking a lot.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDiana sighed and put a hand on Karen's thigh. The hard muscle on display was a reminder of what she lost and very attractive. Power Girl's warrior physique and feminine curves were catnip to the Amazon. But the stomach bulge was a display of the mission being endangered.\ufeff<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\n'That's why I wanted to talk to you,' Diana said, 'you have to stop eating like this. You have to stop eating like a fat girl. You have to diet.'\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'I'm sorry, but what did you say?' the stuffed alien asked, 'Because it sounded like you said the D word. And that's not a word I want to hear.'<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\nStop over eating? She hadn't stopped over eating since she'd gotten to earth!\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'I know you have well, preferences to be heavier,' Diana told her, 'and if this was a more peaceful time I'd let you do that with a smile and a nod. But right now you're the best weapon in an Arsenal where everything else is rusting away. If you can keep your powers up then we have a chance against them. But if you succumb to whatever constantly changing slop Anonymous puts in their poisonous products then we lose. Big time.'\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'I get what you're saying but like I said, I'm an addict,' Karen reminded her, patting her gut and then poking the new muffin top separating Diana's breast plate from her belt, 'it hasn't shown on me but I'm as bad as you. Or as Barbara. Hell I probably eat more than any of you!'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'I know, your gluttony has no bounds,' Wonder Woman sighed, tugging at her armor and regretting trying to see if it still fit. Her new figure had plenty of soft bulges in her upper body for armor plates to painfully pinch.\ufeff<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\n'So case closed, no diet for me,' Power Girl smiled, hoping up, 'Come on, there's a great buffet nearby we can try while Starfire gets lunch ready. I want to see if we can break you out of that armor.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Karen...there is a way,' Diana admitted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'What? What do you mean there's a way?' Power Girl gasped.\ufeff<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\nDamn, someone had cracked the code? Was her fat fetishest holiday about to end prematurely before she'd gotten Wonder Woman so big she needed a scooter? Before she herself at last reached her righteous state of obesity?<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\n'It's simple but it's not replicable,' Diana sighed, picking her lasso out from her belt, 'the perfect can cure any mental issue for a twenty four hour period after its wrapped around someone. This includes addiction to evil junk food.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKaren grimaced and looked at the holy relic like it was poison, 'Then why haven't you used it?'\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'I have used it,' Diana sighed, poking a finger into the roll of fat pouring out the side of her armor, 'but I didn't use it fast enough. I couldn't admit I was addicted but once Anonymous found a way to overcome my resistance to gaining weight...well, getting fat is part of who I am now. Now it won't work on me but if I use it on you, it'll break your addiction to Anonymous products. You can eat as much of Starfire's fried junk from the stores here as you want, but your chance to gain weight for a while will be gone.'\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'You're not asking for much,' Power Girl grumbled, getting up and pacing, enormous tits and soft food baby bouncing in unison. \ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe knew if the soft-thick Diana asked her anything she'd say yes. There was too much chubby Amazon to pinch and explore otherwise. But not getting fat when she had her chance at last? When she could stuff herself sick at any opportunity and have the chance to finally pork up for real?\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'I know this is a sacrifice for you and in exchange, I'll go on a diet with you,' Wonder Woman promised, even as her steel imprisoned stomach gurgled for food.\ufeff<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\n'You losing weight is the last thing I want,' Power Girl sighed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'You misunderstand me. I will eat anything you don't. Every meal you skip I will have. Every fattening portion you pass up on will go to me. You can feed me, bind me and fatten me up to your heart's content if you go through with this. We'd agreed before to explore my new body but if you agree to this, you can put as much weight onto me as you want, I'll go along with it cheerfully even though I lose my powers,' Diana told her, slightly afraid to say it, 'if not, well I'll try and gather my own strength. Nothing says the weight I gain has to be all fat does it?'<br>\r\n \ufeff<br>\r\nThe look on the Amazon's softer face said she was nervous. That PG would accept her offer and Diana's coming expansion would make her previous seem like a starvation March or that she'd decline and the success of the mission would rest on her own crumbling strength. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nA chance to feed Wonder Woman? That was a once in a life time opportunity to turn the perfect, although soft now, woman into a wheezing hog needing a motorized scooter? How could she resist?\ufeff<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOr a chance to maybe bulk herself up instead? The first was a sure thing that would see immediate results, Karen was sure she could have Diana's gut too big for her suit by lunch time tomorrow, the other a possibility in the future.\ufeff<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her stomach capacity, always large, was massively expanding in the buildup for something. The bulwark provided by her alien physiology was preparing to crumble at long last before the caloric siege, as she started down four or five thousand calories per meal. Bloating was coming easier to her now as the possession of a food baby was becoming a permanent fixture to her midrift. A few more weeks, given the ever increasing skill of Anonymous' chemicals and her immunity would surely completely dissolve. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat. Adipose. Flab. Chub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn end to her hard, rippling muscularity. A rest from perfect fitness. Liberation from the tyranny of her thigh gap. Awakening from the nightmare of hard rippling abs. A change from envious and lustful glances as she walked or flew to disgust and mockery as her perfection turned into debilitating fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom super fast to waddling and weak. From impossibly strong to unable to move her own weight. From incredibly resilient to weak vulnerability. The loss of superhuman power, the loss of its concurrent responsibility and the assumption of weak, helpless dependency...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same call to heroism that had prompted her to put on the spandex, that same duty to use her sun given abilities against the evils that threatened her adopted planet/dimension, the sense of responsibility that motivated her to put life and limb on the line against alien warlords and costumed lunatics told her that it wouldn't be right. Blimping up into depowered weakness when she was one of many heroes was one thing, when she might be the only one left was another. It was alright for her to choose to get fat, it was okay to feed someone who wanted it and not particuarly evil to encourage someone already gaining to keep fluffing up but dooming everyone else for her own perverted pleasure? That wasn't exactly a super thing to do...even before considering the near chubby Amazon giving her big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine, I'll go on your stupid diet,' Karen huffed, buff arms crossing under her heavy breasts as her stomach rumbled for yet more food, 'put your rope on me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting tied up by Wonder Woman wasn't as fun as it sounded. Diana wrapped the strange golden lasso around her wrists and invoked Apollo's healing power. Karen felt something crackle across her skin and a constant hunger she'd barely been aware of faded. The pleasant bulge of her food baby became unpleasant and sickening and she was overly full for the first time in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How do you feel?' Diana asked, looping the lasso up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still want to get fat but not immediately, and I'm not hungry for once,' Karen sighed, looking around the gym before her eyes settled on Diana, roaming up her soft legs, new tummy and over flowing bust 'for food anyway.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For food, what do you mean?' Wonder Woman asked as Karen loomed over her, hovering effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kryptonian's arms looked cut from diamond and her mighty legs rippled with tensed strength, making Diana suddenly feel weak. She felt the small hairs on the back of her neck stand up, as if she was threatened. Karen kept leaning in and Diana amazingly took a step back and another, until her back bumped up against the wall. Power Girl kept advancing, getting into Diana's personal space, running a finger under Diana's chin and pinching the little bulge forming under her strong but feminine features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I mean, say good bye to the gym little piglet,' Karen cooed, 'because your butt is going nowhere near exercise until the next mission.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Umm, surely, surely I can exercise a little,' the chubbing Amazon stammered, beginning to both break out in a cold fear sweat and feel a tremble of sexual excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, no strong fat for you sweety,' Power Girl growled, heat vision making her blue eyes glow crimson in lust, looming like a goddess of sex, violence and debauchery before Diana, 'you're gonna be weak fat. You're gonna struggle going up the stairs, hell you're gonna struggle getting up off the couch. Now, pose for me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'P-pp-pose?' Diana mumbled, a long vanished childhood stutter coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, we need to document your gain,' Karen said pulling a phone from her bra, 'it'd be better to have a professional photographer but well, these will serve. I want a nice scrap book of this gain if we can cure you, so I can treasure your journey from warrior princess to lardass couch potato.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana sighed and posed like the overpaid models on the hideous magazines of man's world, going along with it as Karen clicked hundreds of times, focusing on the gaps in her armor and the split in her breast plate. If Karen was going to deny her own fetish for the cause, the least Diana could do was pose for her. Besides, how fat could she get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, look at you in these,' Power Girl grinned, 'you're getting back fat and ooo, a patch of cellulite on your ass. But enough before pictures for now, you skipped the most important meal of the day coming here. It's time for lunch almost and I'm getting hungry. Do you know what I want?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mmm-may--may-be some fresh greens and a light drr-drrr-ess-sss-ing,' the terrified Amazon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no, what I want is to see you Diana, I want to see Amazonian flab break through Amazonian armor,' Karen cackled, tapping the crack in her lover and victim's breast plate, 'now what food do you want to break free with? There's a great milkshake place in smallville that was giving the cheer leader's thunder thighs since before I could fly but if you don't want to travel, I think Starfire had a whole tub of gravy left over from breakfast...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're kidding me,' Karen laughed, slapping her thigh hard enough to dent tank armor but just making her own invincible muscle ripple, 'Wonder Woman's secret weakness is dairy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'N-n-no, it won't kill me or anything,' she objected, trying to stand tall, 'it'll just make me a little gassy and bloated...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the look of sexual glee that came over Karen's eyes, it was perhaps a bad idea to mention that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then milk shakes it is, my sexily soft siren\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff,' Power Girl decided, 'you head to the garage, I'll go get you some civies.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh good,' Diana sighed, so relieved her speech improved, 'this is getting painfully snug, I'll go with you and change.'\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no no no my stuttering sweety pie,' the Kryptonian smiled, tapping the breast plate hard enough to dent it and making the buttery flesh inside bounce,'the only way you're getting out of that armor is by breaking out of it. You'll get a hoody and sneakers, I'll watch what's happening underneath it with X-Ray vision.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'M-mmmm-aybe I'm not not not that hungry,' Diana got out before her stomach gave out a roar loud enough for a Jurassic park sound effect<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Liar liar, pants on fire. I ought to wrap that lasso around you and spank you...after you eat,' Power Girl grinned, 'meet you at the car.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glided away, confidently displaying her formidable and no longer in danger powers. Diana in comparison fell to her knees as stabs of pain worthy of Tartarus shot through her stomach. She arose up weakly, wobbling and weaving like a drunk out of the gym  and into the hallway.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana stumbled to the garage, stomach full for once only of butterflies of anticipation and fear over the experience to come. But even that was tempered by her rising, budding hunger. It was as if the cravings taken from Power Girl had gone into her as pain, real pain, and it all was starting to radiate from the empty organ as it began to rage at the denial of its now customary stream of junk food. Anonymous addiction could only be ignored for a little while and the cravings the tall brunette felt as she hurried through the compound were like nothing she'd ever seen before.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to fall down and cry, to rage at the low state she'd been brought to...but mostly Wonder Woman wanted to eat. The Champion of Peace and Ambassador of Love was an addict in full withdrawal from not having stuffed in a few hours and her body was craving grease, sugar and fat. There were tears welling in her eyes as she went down the hall, starting to break out in a cold sweat from her cravings and a hot one from her increasing exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Starfire emerged from the kitchens in her path, with flour dust on her face and hands, holding a plate of steaming white chocolate chip with golden raisens and macadamia nuts, Diana didn't think twice about accepting it. The cookies tasted like heaven and started disappearing as she went down the hall way, having vanished when she entered the courtyard pool save for the crumbs on her mouth and the dying groan of her buckling armor. But it didn't scratch the addictive itch needed for anonymous' products one iota, due to the instructions Karen had left Star hadn't used one drop of their products. \ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'These will help make you skinny,' the gorged Tamaranian promised after handing over the pile of chocolate and sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough the theory Karen had haphazardly created to justify keeping the redhead in the kitchen was entirely accurate: the cravings could be broken with an excess of regular food. As a result, with four thousand calories of sampled food gurgling in her stomachs, K'ori had no cravings at all. Of course, her super metabolism was already ruined though and those calories would go right to her hips and bust but she would be cured of Anonymous addiction in a matter of years. Not that this helped Wonder Woman, who was panting and weaving down the hallway, almost tripping when she went through the double doors into the court yard pool and almost fell into the cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Cassie and Kara stretched out on deck chairs, half asleep and half drunk with enormously full bellies reaching towards the unusually cool July sun. Each had the others hand grasped limply in the space between them and Kara had a fresh hickey on her suddenly not-invulnerable neck, while their free hands grasped empty beer bottles. Diana barely noticed the romance between the two girls but did notice the open cooler between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to grab it but fell splashing into the pool she hadn't noticed. Confused, she splashed in the cold water and only belatedly remembered she could fly. Focusing hard on the power, Amazon arose out of the water like Venus nearing Cyprus only for a cramp to spasm across her thighs and she fell back in the pool for another spasm of near drowning.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't...get out of...the sun,' Cassie slurred drunkenly, thinking it was Kara, who hiccuped in her sleep.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana spluttered in the water, only to suddenly feel firm pressure under her knees and behind her back. Power Girl rose up out of the water, Wonder Woman's shivering form held in a fireman's carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I knew you'd come to enjoy this, but I didn't expect you to get this wet already,' Power girl smiled, 'let's get you dried off. You've got some burned calories to replace.' \ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should stay home,' Diana whined.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lulubell\ufeff Lang's Malt Shop was an institution in Smallville, having operated under the same family since the depression. But it was\ufeff only wi\ufeffth the Ascension of\ufeff its current owner that it's true destiny of turning every belle and beauty in town into a plus size blimp had become apparent. Before Lulu had taken the keys and turned one breakfast spot into a milk shake focused burger stand, Smallville's girl athletic teams at high school and the local small college regularly made all state and the then budding obesity epidemic of the late 90s hadn't seemed to touch the prairie hardened thighs and plain flat bellies of the athletes who generally competed against each other for gold, silver and bronze rather than neighboring towns or schools.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff\ufeff Lulu herself had been one of those athletes: generations of strict methodist entrepreneurs had mutated to spawn a scion of beauty, brains and brawn that had ruled Smallville High in the late 80s. At 18 she'd been 5'8 and 120, with a string of all state track medals under her belt earning her several full ride athletics scholarships, years of straight A+s and extracurricular excellence putting her as a shoe in for valedictorian and soft creamy skin, deep green eyes and fiery red hair combined with a hard but vavoom figure earning several modeling offers. She planned on becoming a Nutritionist and Dietician at Metropolis' university and supporting herself through modeling in the meantime. The world had been at her finger tips and escape from the boring town loomed until the quarter back's broken condom on homecoming night had ruined her dreams.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bout of morning sickness had revealed her condition to her parents mere hours before her scheduled ride to a clinic and she'd been shotgun married to the same quarter back by the time the leaves changed. A pregnant cross country captain violated the conservative school's abstinence only pledge and she was cut from the team. Without her senior season she lost her athletic scholarships and without exercise she started plumping up quickly and was undeniably showing before the end of her first trimester. Poor sleep, naus\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffea, disdain from once caring teachers and constant whispers about her thickening ankles and now very round stomach caused Lulu's regularly straight A report cards to turn into Straight Fs, costing her her academic scholarships. The teasing from that got so bad that by spring the town's star athlete and academic was not only a pregnant teen but a high school drop out, working for minimum wage in her parents greasy spoon with greasy plates held in her plump hands and a bowling ball belly stretching her apron.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff Many, most girls in such a situation would have despaired, falling into a cycle of self neglect and depression. But Lulu was pissed and crafted her revenge, surprising everyone by getting her G.E.D and starting night school as a culinary major before giving birth to her daughter Lana. She pressed her hastily married husband hard in college, keeping him from straying and getting good grades, while getting him into a good job banking after graduation. Her figure never recovered to its youthful perfection, it had wrecked her metabolism at a young age, but she kept herself athletically plump through hard work. Her football star husband though seemed to balloon the moment he was done with playing in college, becoming the fattest man in town with moobs larger than his buxom wife and a sixty inch waist by the time he was twenty five under her cooking.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really should have been a warning to the rest of the town, but they didn't heed it, instead mocking the obese ex-jock as he gasped and waddled the short distance from executive parking space to his office. It was only when Lulu had earned her masters in culinary arts and nutrition in night school that she truly struck. A few accounting tricks and some blackmail forced her parents into early retirement and it turned out that the retirement house the conservative couple had bought on her advice in Florida happened to be literally surrounded by extremely loud gay nightclubs. With those who had had immediately ruined her life dealt with, Lulu moved onto the town.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff The building was renovated into an ice cream parlor and burger joint catering to young people, seemingly an odd choice in the 90s. Lulu made all of the recipes and ice cream herself, using every trick of culinary science to pack them to the brim with so much fat and sugar it technically violated FDA guidelines for ice cream and veered towards butter. And when she opened it was with a 50% discount for athletes in their senior year and with invitations towards those who she remembered mocking her.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe average weight of Smallville's female inhabitants increased by ten pounds, in the first three months, and it was worse among the athletes. Mile times inflated along with track runner's thighs, the cheer squad suddenly had too many girls who were suited to the bottom of the pyramid and the swim team began to find their bodies a bit too buoyant. For the first time in memory the entire cross country team failed to make state, a scandal compounded by Smallville's quickest runner having to drop out of the state race when her shorts catastrophically ripped apart a hundred yards from the starting line.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next year no one in any varsity team was all state. The year after that, the varsity cross country team failed to win a single medal the entire season. Their coach (an old team mate of Ms. Langs) went to Lulu's to speak about the removal of the discount and went away finding that it was extended to teachers as well. Fast food joints were disproportionally likely to receive loans from the local bank as well, indeed the town began to fill up with junk food and the new obesity epidemic swept through the housewives until the plump Lulu was notably smaller than everyone else.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff Smallville, once a regular stop for college athletics recruiters and modeling scouts, became a notorious fat trap. Girls here were big, not just chubby or fat, but big. Superman's first girl friend Lana Lang was the only girl with a healthy BMI in town, mostly because her mother pushed her into the same athletic and academic excellence she'd had. It warmed Lulu's moderately taxed heart to see her daughter, town valedictorian and cheer captain as well as sole girls track member, lithely step up to receive her diploma on her way to a full ride scholarship, looking half the size of other students.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer revenge had been complete and she kept it up as her daughter got several magazine covers, turning her restaurant into a chrome lined temple of dairy products and obesity even before she started buying from anonymous' new creamery. The town got fatter and fatter: it became odd to not have diabetes and the number of mobility scooters rivaled those of tractors. Lulu's portions were huge and her prices cheap, any girl who looked to be keeping any sort of trim figure was instantly offered a well paying job as a server with attendant discounts, ensuring that they soon took their proper place as another bulky fatso. \ufeff\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to this temple of growth and poor dietary decisions that Karen took Diana. The restaurant was just stirring to life when they arrived in a Starr ware electric speedster, a great deal of time from the lunch rush, which was more a waddle since the rise of Anonymous and the location of a packaging plant had made the town's previous obesity epidemic seem quaint. Diana got out of the car, where her boots, bracelets and tiara waited beneath a towel, her armor hidden by a bulky hoody and her boots replaced with soft sneakers. An emergency liter of coke had taken the leading edge of her cravings away but she still had the shakes. A great deal of tan, still rather shapely leg was on display beneath the hoody, a sight that Karen ate up as they walked in.\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff\ufeff 'I think I'm getting fatter just smelling this place,' the Amazon observed, sniffing smells of grease and cream as the creamery door (up a scooter accessible ramp) neared, a prominent red A for anonymous brand products stuck to its polished glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff Her stutter had vanished when the edge went off her cravings and Karen had stopped being so predatory. Her confidence and faculties returned, Diana had perfect mastery of speech again.\ufeff\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff 'Oh no, that's just in your head,' Karen smiled, kissed her and gently patted Diana's hidden stomach, 'you're getting fatter from the cookies Star gave you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm I'm I'm,' Diana stalled, thrown off track, 'it it it wasn't that big a plate...\"\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff 'Welcome to Lulu's, ' a red haired girl who could be charitably called pleasantly plump told them, the buttons on her white top ready to burst, 'I'm Luna...say, are you two not from around here?'\ufeff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood out like sore thumbs. Aside from being at least six feet tall, they had effortless cover girl beauty and the type of physique that demanded attention. Even softened, Diana had legs of a quality not seen in Smallville for years and Karen's muscle tone was as alien as green skin in a town of tubbies. It wasn't that the waitress felt bad, but a weird sense that she shouldn't be over 200lbs nagged at her. Everyone in town was fat, that's just how it was and now you didn't have to worry about out of towers making you feel bad. Fashionista Lana Lane was a plus size pear now a days and even the occasionally visiting Lois Lane had begun sporting a matron's physique. But these two were thin and fit, ignoring the swollen belly on the blonde, They almost looked familiar...</span></div></div>",

Down and down the level of ice cream in the glass went and out and out Diana's stomach surged, pressing against her already tight armor, until at last there was a loud sucking sound and Wonder Woman tasted only air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, we'll need another one,' Power Girl told the waitress, after wiping some drool off her chin, 'she's got cravings out the wazzoo.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I-I-I nnneedd to lllooosen my aaaaa,' Diana stuttered as the waitress waddled away, trying to loosen the strap of her belt and armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no you don't,' the Kryptonian leered, poking her stomach through the hoodie and plate, 'you're breaking out of that remember? You eat what I want you to eat whenever I want you to eat it or else I start eating whatever I want and you'll never be skinny again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn her, Diana thought, how perverse was it that her desire to lose weight was being used against her to gain weight? Before she could say anything, not that she could say anything, so deeply had her fears overcome her. The comments Karen had made about her being pregnant and turned into an obese housewife didn't seem like pure jokes, the Kryptonian woman might try some lost magic or new tech to actually turn her into a semi-permanently pregnant hulk. But all her fears of becoming flabby and weak faded before the chocolate joy and she her smile split her face, showing off a new set of dimples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here, I'll hold the glass for you. Wouldn't want you straining yourself in your condition,' Karen smiled, holding the straw to Diana's lips as the ice cream level started to fall and a look of pure bliss covered Diana's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Rao bless Diana, Karen thought, how amazing was it she was using Wonder Womans' desire to lose weight was being used to make her gain weight? She had Wonder Woman literally eating out of the palm of her hand, stuttering adorably and looking happy to plumpen. The weight looked so damn good on her, even if they cured the anonymous addiction she'd have to convince the Amazon to stay fat. Probably even someway to knock her up for real with triplets and put some mommy weight on her. Magic existed, it shouldn't be impossible for her to keep Diana barefoot and pregnant, her own personal plumper with an apron belly to her swollen ankles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slurp announced that Diana had finished her milkshake. Power Girl's mouth was hanging wide open in panting lust, her fingers pressing hard into Diana's leg. Wonder Woman's gave a long groan of joy from the milkshake and a small one of pain as her belly kept swelling out against the armor. The pain shook her a little bit from her mental fugue and she realized that Power Girl was near completely drooling over her. Diana realized that every thought not relating to her own softening form had been driven from the fat admiring alien's head and she realized she had that she had an edge over the blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Get me a soda while we wait for the next shake,' Diana told her, managing to not only get the words out clearly but putting a husky tone of seduction into her voice, 'it'll help me digest all of this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged down her hoodie, showing off the soft valley of her cleavage, ran her finger around the glass to gather whipped cream and then sucked it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Est'iralla, seepa'nik,' Karen gibbered so stupidly horny she'd regressed into her native Kryptonian, 'uh, ske'lipitz...sure thing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood up there was a loud smack against her muscular buns, one hard enough to make them jiggle and the gaudy wall decorations vibrate. Power Girl partly turned, seeing that Diana was giving her a wicked smile. The Amazon met her eyes and pinched her ass, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're putting you on a diet and work out plan though,' Diana chided, 'the princess' consort needs to have a much tighter ass and you've let yourself get flabby.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Karen three tries master English enough to order a soda and even then the accent of her dead home world was still incredibly thick. Diana was half way through her third one when she returned, the milkshake vanishing with a terrifying speed and Diana's stomach bulging out enough to be a bulge visible through her hoody. Wonder Woman smiled at her and as Karen sat, it was her turn to have a super strong hand squeeze her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm, your thighs are pretty nice,' Diana said after the third one was gone, 'but you're not nearly as fit as you could be. For a human...maybe you've got an acceptable physique, but by Amazon standards you're shrimpy and chubby.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dig cut deep. She was ripped to shit, what was she saying? And she wanted to get fat anyway, so she shouldn't care if she was flabby..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana smiled at her, glad to see her new lover put back in her place. This place was of course at the bottom, beneath the heeled boot of the Princess of the Amazons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slurp, the Soda vanished and the next milkshake arrived. Wonder Woman took a deep breath before drinking it down and Karen watched in awed joy. Milkshakes came and went: five, six, seven, eight, vanishing as Diana's stomach swelled until she looked like she did have multiples in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy nine she was going noticeably slower. Months of gluttony before she'd started gaining and her own immense durability had given the Amazon an insane stomach capacity but she was starting to fill up, with pain starting to ripple across her tender belly from the armor's pinch. As the shake neared emptiness, there was a metallic clunk from the table that shook both women from their revelries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Was that your stomach?' Karen asked in her returned accent, crossing her legs in lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, Wonder Woman's stomach was so swollen it was pressing against the table. A variety of unhappy, painful and down right angry groans were coming from the Amazon's digestive track and her armor. Diana let out a pained whine as the chocolate taste faded from her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Urrrrr,' the Amazon moaned, hesitantly touching her stomach with its gallons of heavy chocolate inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gut filled her lap, pulling the once bulky jacket snug enough that the end of Diana's armored skirt and the tan slopes of her cleavage were showing at the top. Wonder Woman's chocolate and cream stained lips hung open and she breathed shallowly and rapidly in discomfort, her stomach a ball of pain and cold even as sweat was on her brow. Diana hesitantly touched it, her hand clinking as it touched some breaking piece of armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh wow, you're right there,' Power Girl said, unnecessarily pulling up the jacket and glimpsing the groaning sphere, 'you're one snip away from busting out of that armor.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazons armor had been forged to be form fitting by master amazonian smiths, able to hide under a thin dress but resistant to the heaviest blows. Its multiple interlocking plates no longer touched, now suspended by a web of fraying leather straps. The entire edifice was a flimsy web of painted metal ready to fall apart with a sneeze, vast amounts of bronze skin was visible in the gaps. Skin that was starting to get stretch marks across its once perfect surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Has your water broken?' Karen whispered into her ear, 'cause you look ready to go into labor.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna waddled up, placing the tenth milkshake down on the table, 'Just to let you know, if you finish this you'll get to go on the wall for ten in a row!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress gestured at a bulletin board covered in pictures of customers who had managed to down ten. It was a perverse apocalyptic log of the death of the town's athletic program: thin girls in cross country uniforms after a meet happily bearing full bellies and gold medals gave way to increasingly plush girls with fewer medals and more chins, eventually there were no thin people in the picture. Save for one of red haired Lana Lang, super model and fashionista, at the very beginning of her Anonymous fueled expansion looking down in shock at what she'd done to a waist she'd had insured for thirty million against weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That means you've gotta finish honey,' Karen leered without a hint of accent, holding the glass to Diana's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman didn't stutter, stuttering was beyond her now. All she could do was try not to drown in a tide of malt. She swallowed and swallowed, the milkshake having gone from cool comfort to cold tormentor. A series of small rips sounded under her jacket as several leather straps finally failed and the pinching armor loosened, hanging along the sides of her torpedo gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Does she need a doctor?' the waitress asked, 'she doesn't look well...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah she's fine, Get the camera, she'll want to show it to our kids,' Karen smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later and Diana, sweaty, miserable and about to snap out of her threadbare hoody, was immortalized onto the corkboard as the latest to have 'conquered' the malt shop's milk shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual Amazon was groaning in the car as Karen raced back to the compound. Her seat was fully reclined and she was running her hands over her stomach in an attempt to massage it, while chugging pepto bismol with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hate you, ugh, i hate you,' she grunted at the kryptonian.<br>\r\n. </span></div></div>",

Rheumy, piggish blue eyes blinked open and she let out a hung over groan, customary triple chin bunching against a new fourth one as she brought her puffy hand to her mouth. Babs had had rather strong fingers once from all of her martial arts training and parkour, but still nimble due to her computer hacking skills. Now though her hands soft and plump, her knuckles dimples and her fingers clumsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up with a pained grunt, momentarily puzzled at the rolls of fat that rippled over her paunch before she remembered that she had fallen hard and fast from the apex of human fitness and fell deep into depression when she realized that those sausage thighs and wobbling cankles were hers. Once Babs had been at an olympian level but now a scale reading a mere three hundred pounds would be a huge relief to the swollen heroine. She was only getting up two or three times a day anymore and each second was a nightmare of pain on her joints. Better to stay here, on this immensely supportive chair rather than try and get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabs tried to reach for the mouse to turn off the alert flashing over her computer screens, flab canyons forming across her a relatively small stomach as she struggled. Relatively small, she was ashamed of her gut even as it was dwarfed by her bean bag wide hips. When Babs had first sat her puffy buns into the chair the seat had been wide and spacious but after weeks of shoving six thousand calories into her mouth and burning less than a thousand every day it was the manifest destiny of her ass to spread across every available inch.Her delicate, atrophied muscles had to pop her out of it already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl's had once been able to kick past her own head, powerful strikes that could shatter jaws. But now flexibility was now a thing of the past and she struggled to reach the mouse, her breathing rising higher and higher as she panicked at her own helplessness. She was at least four hundred pounds if not more, a ball of cellulite oozing away towards her own destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long until she couldn't reach the mouse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long she was wider than she was tall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long until she could never get up again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts shot through her head even as her free hand began digging into a mostly empty box of doughnuts, delivering grease, fat and calories into her mouth. It calmed her brain, emotions mellowing out as customary fat entered her mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last she managed to grab the mouse and shakily clicked on the alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FILE DECRYPTED\" greeted her eyes and a smile split Bab's puffy lips as she saw reams of data on formulas, locations and accounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jackpot,' the hacker smiled, then winced as her tyrannical stomach began its demanding growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thought of sharing the news with her comrades ended. Right now she needed to eat something. Just a little something, just to tide her over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hunger detected,' her android servant chimed, activating immediately, 'assessing daily calorie needs.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara relaxed as it began to work, raiding several refrigerators and cabinets set up in the computer lab so she'd never need to leave. In a moment she was being hand fed heavy scoops of vanilla ice cream, loaded with whipped cream and drowned in chocolate. Babs was fed and fed, stomach rising and rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite some time before she was able to tell anyone else of her discoveries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Crimadently, but you're slower to show up than a period a month after prom night!' the former blonde minion yelled on the inside, but on the outside she was chill professionalism without a hint of her thick Jersey accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handful of security staff, all female, were huffing and puffing as they pushed their rotund bodies to the limit in the hopes that they could actually get into a line. Five minutes after Harley had activated her stop watch they were all lined up, spherical bellies jutting out a few feet further than they had less than a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Productivity is down significantly here,' Harley noted coldly, checking off a list on her tablet from where it rested on her stomach and looking at the foreman with a raised, perfectly plucked platinum eyebrow, 'are your crew sampling the product?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security chief began sweating bullets over her tan skin as she tried to think up a lie, 'Uhh...no. Its just...its a lot of facility to cover...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another life the chief had been called Lady Shiva and been perhaps the deadliest assassin on the planet. Lithe, graceful and fit, she'd had such a perfect command of human body language and flawless skill at martial arts that she could face the big league meta humans with a good chance of winning. The day she'd stormed Anonymous HQ over a slight muffin top had almost seen the doughy conspiracy end but fortunately Harley had been seeing Zatanna for a little reality warping pick me up and rewritten the dangerous assassin into an obese, inept security guard chief with a penchant for snacking and naps. Several months spent 'guarding' an anonymous facility had seen her balloon up an extra hundred and fifty pounds from the lard Harley had wished onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripped of the benefits of balanced diet, harsh exercise and a high flying life style Shiva was revealed as the very short woman just past forty she really was. Legs that could kick apart armor plate trembled from the task of holding up her elephantine torso, once eight pack abs turned into a triple belly that hung down to her knees. Shiva's grey sweat pants, large as a baseball stadium's flag, looked ready to burst off her sausage thighs and all the buttons on her tent like blue shirt up to her small bust had either been undone or burst. Her apron gut was livid with furious red stretch marks, some part of the once destructive woman's demonic temper still showing fury at what had been done to her. But fortunately she was also timid as a milk cow, cold black eyes had turned brown and watery under the deluge of treats she casually munched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is that why it took you so long to report a break in?' Harley asked calmly, manicured finger pointing at a snapped lock to the basement before plunging into the waterfall of adipose hanging towards the obese asian's dimpled knees, 'Or did it merely take that long for you to manage to dig past your gut to find your phone?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You were probably laying under the conveyor belt drop off letting food fall into your mouth again, ya fat turd! I ought to kick your ass, if you could pick it up off the floor!' went unsaid, but heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed assassin flushed in anger and fear, trying to speak but failing to get out a word in terror. This was Dr. Quinzel, the iron hard head of Anonymous Security, Productivity, Research and Development, Marketing, Logistics and Quality Control! Her word was law! If Shiva was fired how'd she pay her half of the rent for the dingy apartment she shared with her fat ass daughter! Anonymous ran everything, they were the biggest company on the planet five times over, with a virtual monopoly on employment, food and transportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In that case, you and your team will be receiving tactical mobility assists within the week,' Harley informed Shiva and her team, who had in past lives been the villainess' Volcana, Killer Frost and Giganta but were now merely various flavors of obese renta cops after trying to attack Anonymous, stripped completely of power and memory, 'I will continue my own investigation.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not like ya fucking idiots could find anything! Even if it was right in front of you your fucking guts would get in the way! And you'd rip your pants if you bent over!' Harley yelled mentally, adjusting her stylish but deeply needed glasses and reflecting that the scooters should at least fatten up the guards even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley wanted to see the world's most dangerous woman wider than she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stalked away, snatching a box of double peppermint fudge from an annoyed robot arm and beginning to gorge on it as she went. Harley knew she didn't need it: She'd kept 180lbs, of soft hour glass curves over a strong core of gymnastic muscles, as her absolute limit before she went to see the captive magician Zatanna for a little reality warping to get herself back to the 120s but given her work load she hadn't had the time to visit HQ in weeks. And the resulting forty pounds of fat she'd put on from eating her own product and the extreme atrophying of her gymnast muscles meant that it took a lot of effort to keep up her harsh, high heel click pace. Her thighs slapped like a hand flattening chicken, her ass bounced back and forth like a bouncy ball, her pot belly was getting so big she could only button one snap of her suit jacket and her boobs would slap her in her double chinned face if she actually tried to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill though, Harley reflected as she took the elevator up a set of stairs to the security office, she was in far better shape than most of the Anonymous heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was so enormously fat she could barely move. The last time Harley had seen her the plant hybrid redhead had to be over a ton of photosynthetic blubber, intent only on willing new and ever more fattening plants into being. Catwoman and Tahlia Al-Ghoul weren't much better, the two were being hand fed and hand stroked by muscular, brainwashed cabanna boys all day long and both lithe cat burglar and the demon's daughter had joined the five hundred pound club.That left all the work on Harley's soft shoulders to run the world's largest and fastest growing company: opening new stores, bribing the FDA with more free samples, brainwashing super heroines and trying to keep the world under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's see who broke in here,' Harley muttered to herself, plopping her plump rump into the computer chair before a bank of terminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion caused her overloaded skirt button to break off her stomach, firing through the air to shatter one of the screens. Harley glared passed her saggy DD cups to the treacherous garment and the pale flesh that poured out of it. That settled it, she'd see Zatanna that night and with a few words from the immobile, brainwashed magician Harley would be back to her hyper fit figure, maybe bringing a perked up version of these boobs and a taughter version of her 44'' rear along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this time, she'd keep it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn, Wonder Woman,' Harley snarled, seeing who ripped open the main doors on the camera feed, 'just my luck its the heavy weights.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman, Super Girl, Starfire, Wonder Girl, Raven...damn, those really were heavy hitters. And not heavy enough, yeah they'd probably plumped up and weakened some in the resulting time but that was a lot of super powered fire power to deal with. All of them looked addicted and softening to some degree though: Wonder Woman's guns didn't pop like they used to and her boobs threatened to pop her top, while Starfire was a MILF soccer mom shoved into a trophy wife's short shorts and bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least they're all addicts,' Harley Quinn sighed as she reached for another box of snacks, 'that'll make em easier to fight. Heh, WW's looking more like WideLoad every bite and Starfire looks like she's ready to give birth to kid number four. They won't be much of a threat for long.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, they all showed extreme signs of addiction, eating like pigs as they entered the mostly automated facility. Until another figure in a white leotard showed up, with perfect muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh fuck, Power Girl,' Harley shivered in real fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh fuck, oh fuck, oh FUCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley looked down at her trembling fat, which was shaking in pure terror. The last time she'd seen Power Girl had been on a zany space adventure that had lasted about two weeks of real time. It had taken months for Harley to shrink her ass down small enough to fit into her cut offs again, after all of the weird ass alien food she'd been pressured into eating again and again and again and she'd been skinny to start off with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright Har,' she quivered to herself, 'she's probably addicted too now. Yeah, she's probably nice and fat and powerless right about now, you know how she eats...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the film, the busty Kryptonian looked at one of the cameras. There was a faint flicker on the screen as she moved faster than the camera could pick up and was suddenly back with her friends. Written on the lens, in fogged breath, were the letters: 'I C U'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley squeaked and squeaked again when she saw what the Heroines had stolen. Enough data to shut down the whole operation! Fuck, how long could you go to prison for for making every woman in America morbidly obese? Forget that, if the heroes got their hands on Zatanna all the villains would be slim again and Harley's ass would be grass in Arkham! And she couldn't just use Zatanna to take them out either, the hoggish wizard needed a clear line of sight to affect a target and was far too heavy and delicate to cart around anymore outside HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright, alright,' the doughy former hench woman said to herself, 'I gotta...I gotta get a team together! I know where they'll hit next after all...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the obese, oblivious super villainesses comfort eating from the production line and smiled,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Princess Diana of the Amazons crouched nude in the sand, over six feet of perfection from her arched feet to her long black hair. Every muscle on her body stood out as she stared at her opponent: hard thighs bulging and ready to lunge, corded arms flexing to deliver an earth shattering punch and chiseled abdominals ready to take a battering ram's blow. Jet curls were tied back, leaving her chiseled face on display. Perfect breasts heaved up and down steadily, despite twenty fights already won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rival stood across from her, an equally hard bodied Amazon named Artemis but with bright ginger hair. Hundreds of other fit and stunningly beautiful warrior women filled Themyscira's vast arena, watching which combatant would be favored by the Gods. On the royal dais, Queen Hippolyta (her daughter's mirror) raised a razor sharp bronze sword and brought it down with a swish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana charged forwards as Artemis hopped back and threw a handful of sand at the Princess' face. A dirty blow, but not illegal. Nor unexpected: Diana ducked, rolled forwards and when Artemis tried to kick viciously with her knee, Diana twisted aside and kicked out with her powerful legs to catch Artemis in the belly. In a moment the red head was tripped and pinned, a perfect take down in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers and claps sounded from the spectators as Diana took a bow, not even breathing hard, before bowing to her royal mother. The Queen advanced flanked by two attendants bearing the sacred armor of the ambassador: a many plated, figure hugging cuirass hammered by the smith god Hephastus himself and prophesized to fit only the island's true heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Daughter, by your courage and skill at arms you have proven yourself the greatest warrior here,' the Queen said with a smile, 'rise and don your armor and assume your role!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen armored her personally, her warrior's hands quickly covering up Diana's sweaty body with armored plate until all that remained was the short skirt of armor plates, hanging from the near mythical belt of atlas. Diana felt her tug repeatedly on the belt without the resounding click of the buckle. Her the Queen paused, puzzlement forming on her perfect face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mother? What is wrong?' Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This belt...Diana, have you been getting at the cookies again?' Hippolyta demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cookies? What?' the amazon asked in puzzlement as the Queen dropped the sacred belt to the ground, 'what are you talking about?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This chub!' the Queen snarled, pinching the layer of flab bulging out from under Diana's cuirass, 'this miserable state you've allowed yourself to fall into! You shame me! You shame us all! Guard's seize her!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmored Amazons seized Diana before she could react, muscles that had minutes before toppled the island's best suddenly weak and lightning reactions mired in tar. Their callused fingers didn't grab hard muscle but instead dug into softening fat, the Princess' muscle definition fading away by the second. Her cuirass tightened and straps started to complain, while her breasts began to painfully mushroom out over the bronze breast plates and her stomach pushed out more and more, forming a FUPA of a scale never before seen on the island of perfect women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's happening to me?' Diana screamed as her new gut covered up her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All of your bad decisions are coming home to roost! Showing us just how much of a failure you are,' the Queen snarled, 'I should never have shaped you out of clay. Guards! A feast was to be held in honor of this...thing that thought itself my daughter. Clearly all it loves is food, thusly, feed it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bucket chain of food formed from the hall to the arena. Every bite was shoved down the prone brunette's mouth, traitorous jaw gnawing without thought. Straps broke and armor ruptured. Pert breasts bulked, bulged and broke through their bronze barriers to hang in head sized, floppy repose atop her gut. Corded arms grew wing like protrusions of weak flab, nimble fingers swelled up like sausage and her sword's woman's wrists disapeared beneath puffy fat.Her belly grew by the foot, first a bronze dome that continued sagging down over her bloating thighs. At the size of a pregnant woman it began to bifurcate: the first roll hanging down almost to her dimpled knees while the second tottering blob tettered on the brink of following it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards released her in disgust as a trough was dragged in. Of her own volition she ate and ate, until her trembling legs gave up on supporting her and she collapsed backwards, a one ton blob barely recognizable as a human. Dulled instincts told her to rise, but she couldn't move her immense body an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is who you truly are Diana,' her mother sneered, 'fat, weak and useless. Guards, I tire of seeing this polluted beast of a woman. if you can, drag this fat lump of lard to the invisible plane and dump her somewhere befitting her stature.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta raised a curious device to her mouth, a brightly colored tube of waxed paper connected to another roll of paper. Her cheeks puffed and she blew outwards, the roll extending straight out and making a long 'KA-VOOM'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rise and shine birth day girl,' Power Girl chirped, puffing the holiday blower out again as she wheeled a three feet by two feet sheet cake covered in two inches of frosting into the room, 'time to celebrate the big 300!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprawled out in bed, Diana blinked, head immensely fuzzy as she tried to remember what was going on. The dream was still echoing in her mind leaving her at a loss to explain why the blonde Kryptonian bomb shell was naked save for the numbers '300' written down her front in whipped cream, angled to cover the high nipples on her big chest and her tight sex. Stunned, she shook her head and tumbling images of intimate conversations and moments with the fellow super swept pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was a little short for Amazonian but not something to kick out of bed. Very busty by any standard,, the Kryptonian was also smart, brave, funny and plenty muscular...or at least had been. The blonde was busy rapidly dotting candles onto the thick icing and the backside that faced Diana was positively svelte. Full thighs were sporting a very wide thigh gap and a muscly round backside had flattened noticeably, when she turned around, the Kryptonian's firm waist was decidedly narrower even as the big four pack muscles looked less defined. Even the national treasures had deflated, PG's immense chest was sitting differently. Each heavy globe had always defied gravity, but now they seemed to be sitting higher than normal, evidence of a lost cupsize. As the blonde stopped and rapidly counted the new forest of candles, Diana noted that her formidable bicep had lost a bit of bulge. Her skin had changed as well, normally golden tan she was looking paler by a shade or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Power Girl,' Diana began, 'Karen, are you alright? You look thin, are you eating enough.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ha, good one Di. Yeah, I've been keeping up with the diet,' Karen giggled, lighting all the candles with a quick burst of heat vision, 'now make a wish.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A wish...Karen, it's not my birth day,' Diana asked, trying to sit up and finding her body slow to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know, you've got a different calendar, we talked about it before you got drunk last night. Now hurry up and go with the bit,' Power Girl sighed, 'hurry up. The wax is gonna get onto the cake and this was the biggest one they had.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The biggest?' Wonder woman asked, managing to sit up at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGods', her head...she felt sore all over. Her shoulders ached and her knees complained as the princess set her feet onto the carpet. This was worse than any mortal wine could do, had she been in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wanted to pop out of it but it turns out you can't eat that kind. Not that any strippers can fit inside them anyway,' Karen shrugged, making the three covering her nipple slide off, 'Damn it, I'm melting! Ugh, you have no idea how much i want to eat this but can't even want to eat it...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three was beginning to slide off and both milky nipple and the cake were making Diana flat out drool. Hung grumbled in her belly and she put a hand there to quiet it. Odd, had she landed on a pillow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now blow quick and let's get started,' Karen smiled, 'once you're done with the cake you've got to eat me...if you're still okay with that...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, of course,' Diana said in confusion, 'I'm just a bit hung over is all...what are celebrating again?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Duh, the big 3 double zero,' Karen told her, pointing at the huge red letters on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'PG, you know I'm at least ten times that age, right?' Diana asked her as the cake was pushed right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Duh, its not for the age,' Karen giggled, 'now make a wish.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana closed her eyes and inhaled, finding it...more difficult. Why was it harder? It felt like something was pressing against her chest....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething cold did press against her chest. Wonder Woman's eyes snapped open to see her nipples had pressed into the too close cake and were now covered in icing. But wait, her breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had high, firm tear drops. Larger than most Amazon but not like this... They didn't sag like that, her nipples weren't that big and what on earth was that under them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren hovered over the cake, licking her lips. The svelte blonde dipped lower and picked up Diana's very heavy breast, licking frosting off the tip and sending a spike of pleasure shooting into Diana's brain even as her mind screamed that something wasn't right....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry, Star made the frosting and the cake. No fat's going onto me,' Power Girl promised with a wink, slapping her smaller butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Peeg...Peeg...what's going on?' Diana asked, heart beginning to thunder as memories began shoving themselves past the alcohol, including the memory she should be immune to alcohol...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going on? It's Happy 300 lbs day, Di,' Karen said, shoving a handful of cake into Diana's mouth, 'Let's see how high we can get before the day ends...' </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> 'Thirty-uff-two,' Cassie huffed, arms feeling the strain of lactic acid as she pressed the bar bell (gravity adjusted to weigh as much as a tank) off of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving spent her childhood as a geeky nerd, Wonder Girl had embraced the athletic potential of being Zeus' daughter. A little tall at 5'8, she'd had the slim but fit physique of a track captain: long hard legs, almost no hips, a washboard flat belly with firm girl abs, pert B to C cups and corded, sinewy arms. She'd liked exercising, training and practicing even before coming into her divine powers and had been strong and confident, she wasn't going to let a little thing like junk food addiction and magical weight gain get in the way of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thirty-munch-two,' Kara gasped, waist band feeling the strain of a swollen stomach as she swallowed yet another pancake into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore its destruction, Krypton's genetic engineering had created an aesthetically perfect race and Kara had been a shining example of their style. Thin as a rail with a cavernous thigh gap and an hour glass figure soley from her incredibly tapered waist, the aetherially slender scientific genius had been modelesque save for her somewhat short height of 5'4. On Krypton she'd been rather lazy and shy but the self confidence she'd gotten with invulnerability, super human strength and bullet beating speed had given her an ability to stand tall...something junk food addiction and magical weight gain was changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thirty-uff-six,' Wonder Girl finished with a grunt, racking the bar and hopping to her feet, stomach splitting into rolls as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked herself over in the mirror: weeks of having little to do but strength and endurance training had changed her notably. Her biceps and triceps had a heavy bulk to them, her already firm abs had bulked up in size and strength to eight pack size and her tight bubble butt had exploded outwards into a perfectly round gym booty, all while her thighs had gone from sprinter lean to power lifter thick. Her current attire, spandex short shorts and sports bra, showed off the result of all that exercise masterfully, but also showed off the results of six weeks living in earth's heaviest fat trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as sit ups and planks had multiplied her abs, downing two six packs of illicit anonymous brews every afternoon had layered fluffy lovehandles and a just beginning to droop beer gut that hung over the spandex hem of her pants. Squats and lunges had given her a stunning set of glutes but three pizza's for dinner had layered it over with a thick coat of droopy cottage cheese that merged with her now meaty, child bearing hips. The thick lard a four course breakfast every day had coated over her thighs covered up all of their shape, strong they might be but Wonder Girl now walked with a waddle despite her squat weight having quintuppled. Cassie had gone from working hard on bench pressing scout tanks and curling small car weights to easily benching main battle tanks and curling semi trucks to the point that her arms were still cut, but despite all the butterfly presses and push ups her E cup chest still drooped. Alone among the ballooning heroines, Cassie epitomized fat but fit, having worked out to the point that her strength and durability were actually increasing to Wonder Woman's old, pre-fat levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not sure about this gut though,' the sweat coated wonder girl mused to herself, patting her rolly poly stomach and giving it a shake, 'I'd rather have abs than flab...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's strict exercise regiment might have layered an impressive thirty pounds of muscle onto her body, testament to her half godly nature, long hours in the gym and a ludicrous caloric intake. But the fifty pounds of fat that had followed kept that muscle from being obvious. She'd severely over eaten every day for six weeks, super human capacities ruining her figure even as they rapidly bulked out her strength. If she could ditch that appetite she'd soon dwindle into a spectacuarly cut body builder...but likewise if she ever stopped her exercise regime she'd soon see her fit-fat nature turn into just fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Brought you breakfast!' Super Girl announced chipperly from the gym door, hovering in with a heavy tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie briefly noticed that there were a few empty plates on them before looking back at her...well, girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara decidedly didn't epitomize fat but fit. Already pot bellied and lazy before this, Cassie had spoiled the maid of steel into blubbery uselessness. There hadn't been a waking moment for the past few weeks that she wasn't eating something, even now she was sucking on a thirty two ounce soda bearing the anonymous A on its bio-plastic bottle. Apart from her own body and Cassie's tray, it was probably the heaviest thing she'd lift all day...if she even lifted her body. With her flight slowed but still functioning, the kryptonian was hovering as much as she could to spare the chubby rubbing of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Looks like you're a couple plates light there, Big K,' Cassie teased, nodding at the suspiciously clean plate before pinching Kara's upper belly, 'where could they have gone?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm, I don't know...,' Kara sniffed, scrunching the coke bottle glasses she was wearing, 'I, ummm...must have grabbed an empty plate...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanning in the warm Kansas sun and mostly being denied Anonymous' power draining foods had helped Kara somewhat hold onto her power set. She still had her strength and her heat vision and flight, although each had weakened from its peak. But what was gone wasn't coming back, Anonymous food was halfway through turning the girl of steel into less than mere mortal. Not only was the Kryptonian's super vision long gone, her eye sight had deteriorated to deeply below normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, you get a belly like this by grabbing empty plates,' the half olympian kept teasing, needing the pillow soft, cinnamon tan gut in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuper Girl's tiny arms had gotten soft and flabby, from her beginner bingo wings to her soft wrists. Her pencil thin legs had gotten soft and doughy from new cankle to saddle bag. Tiny breasts had grown into big, saggy Cs. If the rest of her body had gained at the same rate she'd have just been chubby, just above the still overweight normal of pre-Anonymous America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I...thought you liked my belly,' the sensitive alien huffed as Cassie's strong fingers kneaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I love your stomach, Kara,' Cassie promised, traveling from the flabby upper roll beneath her fellow heroine's floppy breasts and into the deep crevice of tan skin right above her belly button, 'but I don't want it full of my first meal of the day.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Kryptonian genetic engineering, Kara had possessed an absolutely tiny twenty inch waist. There'd been no fat on it at all, the type of skinniness attainable only by lunatic dieting or blessed genetics for a short time, but would be the Kryptonian's normal resting weight for her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to League of Assassin's produced synthetic pink kryptonite, Ivy's soy based retro viruses and Zatana's reality rewriting spells, Kara now possessed a waist easily twice that size. A wobbling apron belly that sagged to her lower thighs, with a spare tire like a semi truck's. It was a mess of ever increasing stretch marks around her deepening belly button, hidden only by her nut brown tan skin. She was wearing a string bikini, her breasts loose in the cups, the thing back vanished up her flabby ass and its front hidden by soft thighs and the waterfall of her lower stomach. Even mostly denied more anonymous retro viruses, Kara's DNA had been rewritten so her resting weight was at least four hundred pounds and her metabolism, convinced it was starving to death, was desperate to eat its way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was only a little hungry, you don't have to be snide,' the once kind but determined girl whined nastily, crossing puffy arms under her chubby breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry Kara, you can have whatever you want off of it,' Cassie told her, picking up a french toast stick and patting her friend's drooping double gut, 'I just don't want you wasting away.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and the two were leaving the gym. Kara, utterly toneless legs hovering eight inches above the ground, hurried to the pool, hoping that twelve hours lounging by the pool would restore her now long lost invulnerability. She stopped only to fill up a cooler from her and Cassie's private stash, filling it with beer and soda bearing the Anonymous A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie, stuffed to the gills and a bit sore from her work out, showered off. Lathering up, she smiled when she felt the muscle on her arms and legs and glowered when she felt the bulge at her waist and sprawl of her butt. Pouring herself into an undersized, backless red one piece and grabbing a cooler of snacks and pool acessories, she hurried outside to find Kara already passed out on a deck chair, three empty soda's beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Cassie picked up the sun screen. Kara never remembered to put it on and even though it might block her solar absorption...Cassie would never pass up a chance to massage all of that blubber... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> 'So, how is the taste?' K'ori asked as she stirred a bowl of batter, leaning forwards in anticipation and sending tan-orange rolls pouring over the waist band of her workout shorts, 'Less of the butter? Or more of the butter?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months ago Starfire had looked like a wet dream: impossibly curvaceous, improbably tight, ludicrously busty, all crammed into size small shorts, skirts and figure showing tops that even at her tiniest had been tight. She'd gone up to a medium once her beefy arms and thickening thighs had gotten too big for a small, as those months of overeating had transformed her figure from slinky fitness model to freshly post-partum trophy wife to extra-large stay at home MILF to four very heavy offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Umf, I can't tell,' Raven grunted through a mouth full of muffin while looking at the pony video playing on her phone, 'I'm not a chef.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire frowned, full second chin creasing. A few months ago, when she looked like the early 20s sex bomb she was, the alien red head would have just shrugged at the rudeness. But now that her swimsuit model curves were buried a hundred and twenty plus pounds of matrons fat, her teammates' rudeness was intolerable. An easy going airhead might have floated into the kitchen, but the obese chef who floated a little lower in her place wasn't going to take any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar stopped stirring the muffin batter, the jello fat that coated once firmly muscled arms shaking a few seconds after she ceased. Pulling out the spoon, and sucking it clean in one swift motion that would have caused a watching man/Power Girl to have a stroke, Star floated around the kitchen counter (an errant bulge of hip fat knocking over the salt shaker) and slapped the seated Raven right in the ass, where inches of cellulite coated fat stretched Raven's ultra-relaxed fit stretch jeans to near transparency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'YOWCH!' the goth shouted loudly, purple eyes immediately splitting into four glaring red slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At the table are no phones!' Starfire told her, shaking the spoon back and forth, 'and no talking with the chewing!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'DARE TO TOUCH ME! I\"LL EAT YOUR SOUL!' the angry, obese psychic shrieked, mental might raising rotund form up off the overloaded kitchen stool by several trembling tentacles of shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike most of the team, the demonic psychic's powers hadn't faltered but she'd grown to such a size that they were having trouble levitating her. Once possessing a waifish ballerina figure, Raven had inflated into a shapeless doughball a few meals past three hundred pounds while at Power Girl's compound. Constant access to Starfire's near 24 hour kitchen and a limitless Starware credit card for when the cravings for Anonymous brand goodies got too much had made the goth heroine completely porcine. From her moon round, near chinless face to her saggy fat girl DDs to the upper 40s double gut that merged with equally wide bean bag hips, Raven was clearly another casualty in the battle of the bulge. Milky pale, stretch marked covered flesh bulged over the front of her blue jeans in a tidal wave of lazy gluttony and the cottage cheese pouring from the back was emblematic of how her tree trunk thighs now resembled a moonscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You'll eat the nothing unless you make the apologies!' Star told her, hands on her hips, which were just as big if not bigger than Raven's dumpy lower half but had somehow maintained a womanly roundness that defied belief, even though her shorts looked like a basketball was stuffed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with the slight disagreement, Raven crumbled. She landed with a soft crash, the momentum of which tore the front of her jeans open to let even more lardy gut pour forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm...sorry,' she muttered, shoving her phone into a back pocket, 'let me try another bite please.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good!' Star smiled, meaty arm digging deep into the batter, plopping it deep into Raven's mouth and then spooning it into her own, 'more of the butter!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA timer dinged, showing that the first regiment of today's army of muffins was done and the Tamaranian jetted slowly over to the oven, feet half a foot off the ground. Starfire's powers had already been dipping before the big team up, declining in strength rather than losing whole branches of her superpowered tree. But given that she'd only stuffed hand made food into her maw since then, the red head hadn't lost anything. She could go faster but she wasn't sure where her rapidly expanding body ended and didn't want to upset any of the ingredients or cooling cinnamon rolls or sizzling bacon or cooling pies she'd been cooking since before sun up. Not needing gloves, the alien woman popped two baker's dozen muffins out of the oven and sat to sampling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's A+ curves had added several other pluses since she'd became the team's live in chef, as a result she'd gone from a small to a medium and was still about to tear her way through the clothes. She was still an hour glass but it was a daily contest to see whether her flabby midsection would catch up at last with her heaving breasts and door scraping hips. Childbearing dind't even describe Star's once smooth hips, the hypnotic roundness straining her shorts sheer seemed able to repopulate a wartorn nation. Her basketball buns had continued inflating, turning the short's backside into a thong as the hung in the breeze, even though the first layers of cellulite were starting to form on the lower slopes. Near perfect legs had gotten lazy and beefy, rubbing deliciously half way to the knee and with meaty cankles unzipping her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready stuffed with batter and the pre-dawn disposal of yesterday's left overs, Starfire's once solid abs were a pleasantly full bulge one big binge from catching up with her tits. She hadn't let herself have a hunger pang since her first day cooking and thanks to her long torso it hung as a meaty dome, a sphere looked ready to kick if touched. Star's enormous breasts hadn't been continued growing but had at last began to suffer from the gain, there'd been two weeks of further outward growth and then four of downward plunging. Previously playboy quality in both size and firmness even when big, the total loss of her athleticism and never wearing a bra meant Starfire's chest was now sag-city and decidedly uneven. Her left breast had begun pulling away a bit when moving into the compound, but now it flopped out at least two cup sizes ahead of the right and an orange aerola was half visible beneath the hem of her cut off top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm, these muffins are the done,' Star smiled, showing a face that had only gotten a thin layer of dough, mostly in her second chin, her face still that of a sultry sexbomb even if her body wouldn't look out of place at a PTA meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why'd you ask me if you already had them cooking?' Raven questioned, even though she ate another muffin herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So a batch could be the yours!' Star laughed, sliding over an entire tray to her friend. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Come on tubby tubby, we've gotta get to the briefing room,' Power girl cooed as she floated down the hallway, beckoning Wonder Woman on with a forkful of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana lumbered forwards after the floating blonde alien, her waddling step as far from an Amazon warrior's confident strut as could be but still be walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mighty threws, graceful as a gazelles, rasped and slapped with each drastically shortened step. Drastically weakened muscles had to work against constant resistance, from the doughy diameter of her swollen thighs pressing constantly against each other to the heavy apron of her gut flapping against her upper thighs. She was shoved into an XL pair of blue leggings that were stretched near transparently tight over her adipose coated limbs, swollen from the pinnacle of womanly athleticism into lazy sausages. Graceless cankles puffed out from the bottom, while the seat was stretched so tightly over her toneless buns Diana's star spangled panties were easy to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This would be easier if you stopped feeding me,' Wonder Woman muttered, 'I've already eaten enough cake for a month this morning!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe but I don't want this shrinking from your first workout in...six weeks isn't it?' the busty feeder giggled, spearing the cake covered fork toward's Diana's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon's mouth opened automatically, taking in another bomb of sugar despite her protests. Diana swallowed within a second and for a brief moment her eyes rolled back into her head in such pure pleasure that her cherubically bulbous cheeks turned red. She blinked away thoughts sent by Aphrodite and Dionysius, shooting a death glare at her floating tormentor that would have peeled paint from steel, but made the invincible Kryptonian laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This isn't funny,' Diana muttered, 'I'll barely be able to fight a house cat in this state and you keep feeding me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, that's what you asked for,' Power Girl giggled, 'and you look so cute when you try and be intimidating! Its these fluffy cheeks! You look like a big hamster!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughed at the next glare and sped forkful after forkful of cake into the brunette's mouth. Not one crumb fell onto Diana's sagging breasts and not one scrap of icing smeared her lips, every single calorie going right into the Amazon's stomach. After the flurry of feeding, the quasi-immortal swayed slightly in pure joy, having become such a glutton that the idea of being force fed was bringing her to the brink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ufff,' the portly warrior groaned, putting a hand on the wall to steady herself, 'Aphrodite, I don't know if I hate you or love you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's figure out which later,' Karen chided, trashing the plate and gliding near her taller bedmate, settling her feet at last to the ground, 'although I can give you a hint now...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slim herone leaned into the obese one for a kiss, but was blocked by the edifice of lard she'd built, a vast dome of a belly that no shirt in the compound could hope to contain. Diana groaned as the enormous, sagging bulk of her waist, somewhere between a swollen ball and a drooping apron, pressed into Karen's still firm midsection. It brought Karen to a halt as much as the expansion of her lover's belly had and her slim fingers inserted themselves into a crease forming at the level of Diana's belly button. Her warrior's abs and huntress' obliques were dead and buried beneath the layers of blubber to such a degree the idea of her doing even basic exercise, let alone being perfectly fit was laughable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Remember how pissed you were when Superbabes magazine kept naming you as having the best abs? Wonder what they'd say if they got a look at this double belly you're getting,' Karen cooed, pinching the pillowy lower gut and the slightly firmer upper gallery, 'by the time we bust this anonymous case wide open, I'm betting this is gonna be past your knees. I wonder if I can get you wider than you are tall. Imagine that, the Amazon Princess to big to fit into a door...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana, already in a faint sweat from the slightest physical activity, broke into a heavier coating as the hemispheric bulk of her waistline was massaged. Absolute shame at her warrior's physique ballooning into such an embarrassing bulk locked itself in a citadel besieged by armies of joyous eroticism at her laughably rapid transformation, born from six weeks of round the clock overeating and almost no physical exertion beyond kissing and the occasional suck. Her Gods given powers had faded away to almost nothing, what was once second nature could only be reached by intense focus and held for a very short period of time. Diana hadn't tried even the slightest use of them in days out of fear they'd completely fail her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I\"ll...I'll nnnn-eevvvver bbbbee th-th-that bbb-iiggg,' Diana tried to say through her stutter, which raged free of its bonds now that she was no longer correcting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its just a matter of time baby,' the victorious Power Girl cooed, 'although by then your tits are gonna be so huge you won't be able to see past them. I'm tiny compared to you anymore, I bet your an I cup.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana's stomach might have been too big for any quickly available t shirt to  cover, but when the alarm had gone off she'd just been able to shove them into one of Karen's sports bras. Built to support an impossibly busty woman undergoing immense athletic strain, the kevlar reinforced garment was barely able to contain the bouncing orbs of the Amazon's bosom. Bronze tan spheres rose above and beneath the blue fabric, swelling like far too much dough poured into far too small a muffin tray. They wobbled at every strained breath, fighting against the fabirc that was trying to force them into something resembling firmness, for when unconstrained the warrior woman's breasts now sagged to depths no Amazon had ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana tried to speak, but found herself rising up off the floor. Power Girl had her in a tight embrace, her own hard arms and long legs wrapped around the obese form of the world's greatest heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The alarm can wait another five minutes I think,' the blonde whispered. </span></div></div>",

But rather than the cop turned masked detective, her baby blues could only traverse the immense hunk of man meat wrapped up in the dorkiest outfit she'd ever seen. Armed with a pen and notepad, their visitor bore the insignia of the Daily Planet on his blazer. \"A reporter?\" Harley whispered to herself, much yet one who hadn't blimped up like the rest of Gotham's population. \"He must have <i>some</i> willpower...\" Harley mused as she scratched her mindboggling tummy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sweeped the door open without a second thought, lest fuel Reporter Boy's curiousity. No doubt he had gotten the same leak that the Question had, but it almost seemed like such a shame that she would have to chase him off; he just seemed like such a nice guy- like a big boy scout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya!\" she greeted her guest with her usual fervor and friendliness, \"How can I help you?\" Harley casually leaned on the doorway, generous frame suffocating the wood. \"I'm with the Daily Planet and- er... I can um, wait a minute for you to get dressed...\" the musclebound articlist seemed somewhat put off by Harley's illfitting taste in pajamas, combined with her lack of general shape. Harley looked down, catching that his point lay in her boyshorts and her tee; both very tight and allowing her bulk to spill out in plain sight. She turned bright red and showed him in, \"O-Oh right, you wait here and I'll be out in a minute.\" she pranced off past her rotund roommates, \"Girls~ company!!\" Harley chirped as she retreated to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy caught herself watching Harley's bloated heartshaped rearend yet again, turning a slightly darker shade of green as she turned away. For some reason, that had been happening a lot more than usual lately; she counted herself lucky that Talia was too busy whining about how stuffed she was to catch her in the act. She had her suspicions on whether or not Selina had caught her wandering eyes; but if she had, her bloated kitty had certainly spared her. \"Ms. Isely?\"a voice, one somehow familiar from her villainess career, caught the couch potato's attention, \"Ms. Isely?\" he asked again, now with a definate sense of shock in his voice. She had long grown accustomed to that tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" she purred seductively at the brick wall of a reporter, \"My, you're a big boy aren't you?\" she pursed her full lips at him and rested a soft hand on her upper cleavage invitingly. Selina giggled at her girlfriend's little game, it was pretty fun to watch Poison Ivy be Poison Ivy again, especially at her current size. Clark Kent remained unphased for now, \"And you're pretty big yourself, Pamela.\" he said matter-of-factly, \"I wanted to talk with you and your roommates... namely you and Ms. Harleen Quinnzell.\" Ivy narrowed her eyes, what did this brawny buff know? \"Oh, sweetie, I'm sure you'd love to get me and my friend back there in that room, but wouldn't you rather be surrounded by <i>four</i> beautiful women instead of two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent stood strongly, not affected at all by Ivy's hollow advances. For underneath his simple disguise, Clark Kent was really a certain blue-and-red clad battletank of a superhero who had long assisted his cowled counterpart in foiling the plots of these criminal sirens. As such, he was completely aware of the eccentricities that made up Ivy's personality. His eyes travelled over to the latter fatties in the room, a whopper of a Selina Kyle wiggled her plump fingers at him innocently and a super stuffed Talia al Ghul rubbed her stomach and gave a pained smile in his direction. \"I don't think so, Ms. Isely, would you mind?\" he repeated himself in a little more personal manner. \"Oh fine, you're no fun.\" she pouted, \"Girls, Harley and I are going to go have some fun with the paper boy, don't wait up.\" she teased. Selina giggled, \"Like you can get up by yourself.\"</span></div></div>",

As she drummed her thick fingers over the chloropath's belly, Selina could just faintly hear the gurgling sound of digestion that emenated from underneath the thick, thick apron that was Ivy's middle. The former eco-terrorist sighed lightly as she bathed in the affection her precious \"kitten\" showed her, humming ever so slightly as she stroked Selina's short black hair with her once elegant fingers. Selina giggled, an act that would reverberate in her immense mass, as she felt the slight vibration that Ivy's modest tune left echoing in her middle. By mistake, Selina's chubby index finger plugged Ivy's naval, \"Oops.\" she purred sultrilly, looking up at Ivy's fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, having immediately undressed after Clark Kent took his leave, bounced back into the room; her bottomless resevoir of enthusiasm allowing her to quickly dismiss the nerve-wracking interview that had preceded as nothing. She sighed, completely at peace back in her skimpy pajamas and her bulbous bulk clammoring for an audience. \"Well, that was an ordeal!\" she stretched, bringing one thick leg up in the air and wrapping her hand around a soft arm, \"I'm headin' to bed, it's late and I can't miss those late night cartoons~!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia's eyes narrowed sharply, watching closely as Harley's chub spilled over her ensamble. She knew how to take a hint, Harley obviously wanted a piece of her for tonight and wanted to be polite about going about it. \"Love, would you like <i>me</i> to join you as you watch your... er, 'cartoons'?\" the enormous brunette lifted her swollen stomach up slightly to signal that she clearly recieved her lover's message, \"Is it the one about the <i>cat and mouse</i>?\" Talia loved a good chase, of course not literally, between herself and Harley; a good challenge was hard to pass up. \"No, I think it's the Powerpuff Girls.\" Harley answered innocently, while Talia usually had Harley wrapped tightly around her little finger, no one came between her and Blossom Bubbles and Buttercup. \"But yeah, sure, I'll help you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter two fatties didn't lift a finger to help their pampered counterpart from her seat, simply watching innocently as Harley heave and Talia ho her mighty bulk from the loveseat. \"Y'know, if she would just sit up like normal people, poor Harl wouldn't have to work so hard.\" Selina hypocritcally mumbled to her fellow spectator, \"True, but aren't you the one using me as a pillow right now?\" Ivy quipped, eyes not leaving Harley's giant heartshaped rear as it wiggled and writhed about in her desperate attempt to manuever the Demon's massive daughter from her lounging position. \"Al.most. there...\" Harley grunted as she and Talia struggled to heft her girlfriend's bottom from the couch, until finally the lazy woman had been lifted from her seat. \"There!\" Harley cupped her hands together lovingly and jumped up slightly, \"Lifting you guys alone is gonna make me the next Supergirl.\" Harley jokingly flexed her pathetic anti-muscle. \"If she spent a month in a bakery maybe.\" Selina quipped. \"You hush, Kitty.\" Harley snapped back lightly, \"So, want some chips or something while we're in there?\" Harley asked as she turned back to Talia, who purred slightly as she considered the question. \"Now that I think about it, yes, I would love those barbecue flavored ones.\" she gave Harley the reacharound and pinched her plump tush<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy felt herself blush as she watched Harley's plush bottom is squeezed between Talia's own undefined fingers. For some reason, Harley swatted her hand away innocently, \"Oh, Tallie!\" she squeaked, \"I really just wanna watch cartoons; honest!\" Talia waddled ahead of her, putting out her cigarette in an ashtray along the way. While Talia's bum looked really huge in those jeans, it did nothing for Ivy- it seemed like only Harley could make her blush like that. \"We'll see how the evening plays out.\" Talia winked seductively at Harley, who eeked yet again as she watched Talia's massive hips sway. \"I love that girl.\" Harley practically floated out of the living room after her girlfriend, clutching the desired baggie of Lay's in her chubby hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy shook her head, attention returning to the television as it had before that ever-so attractive distraction diverted it. Her green eyes locked on the screen, though they were somehow unable to comprehend the documentary in front of them. She was still distracted, still thinking about the swirling emotions inside of her. And perhaps by the smell of a lovely roast that occassionally wafted up from the air ducts. Selina, who's head had still not left the excellent cushion of her girlfriend's belly, seemed aware of Ivy's inner conflict. \"Staring problem?\" Selina asked, breaking Ivy's silence, \"I know it's big, but you don't have to stare at it all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy started to sweat, \"Wh-What do you mean?\" she feigned innocence, \"I thought we were watching television together?\" she pointed at the wide tv across from the couch. \"I meant Harley's ass.\" Selina raised an eyebrow, \"It's okay, no need to be ashamed.\" she said calmly, pathetically trying to lift from her lax position to grab at the remote, \"It's big, it's perky, it's cute.\" she kept going on, pawing at the clicker, \"I just thought... that mine was, well, I thought that you were attracted to <b>me</b>.\" she huffed. \"No no, I love you Selina!\" Ivy looked down to meet her gaze, \"I swear I do!\" Kyle huffed again, patting her stomach, \"I mean, I know I'm a fatcat and all, but I thought you liked me this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's not your size that counts.\" Ivy stroked Selina's chubby cheek, \"I love <i>you</i>!\" Selina smiled devilishly, \"Well, if you really love me, then get someone to break into Ms. Katrowskie's apartment and grab that roast, it's driving me crazy.\" she licked her full lips hungrilly. Ivy grabbed a coffeecake from a box on the end table and substituted it for the roast. \"Mmmmm...\" Catwoman purred, closing her eyes in her passion, \"There's the love.\" she shifted herself into laying on the couch instead of lounging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she fed her girlfriend, Ivy couldn't help herself from listening in on the giggling coming from Harley's room. And how she suddenly regretted what she said about loving Selina....</span></div></div>",

She also realized this was the first time she had allowed a guy to be in control since she went from being just Pamela Isley to Poison Ivy. She in no way wanted to go back to just being Pamela Isley. Armed with this new knowledge, she took a deep breathe and let her confidence return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing more to say Superman. I don't know what has caused Gotham's gaining but as you can see it has affected me as well. Do you really think a young woman who relies on her looks as much as I do would allow myself to get fat if I was fattening everyone else? No! I would surely have the antidote or know what I would need to do to stay thin and do it. So with all that being said, I think my being fat is a sign of my innocence\" she replied in her sexy husky tone very matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman wasn't surprised that Ivy was not getting him information. It really had seemed too easy when he had scared her by holding her by one of her legs over the side of the building. Batman had told him to be careful when dealing with Poison Ivy and he knew the dark knight was right as he had had run ins with Ivy before. He was a little disapointed though. He thought that maybe her new fatness had made her more vulnerable but that was not the case. He began to loose his hand around Ivy's leg again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh give it a rest mr. goodie.

He then pulled her back up and set her down on the ground. Though he was super strong, his arms started to tire after holding the corpulent Ivy for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy had to lean against one of the walls on top of the room to catch her breathe and slow her fast beating heart.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A swirling torrent of shame and humiliation washed around Renee's head as she stumbled out of bed the next morning, the feeling of defeat still weighing heavily on her as she tried not to recall the events of the night that preceded. Taken advantage of by a gaggle of fattened supervillains, what a new low. The only upside was that poor Vic wasn't alive to see her descent into gluttony, lord knows what words he would have had for her if he had seen this disaster. For weeks now Renee had been futilely struggling to keep her weight and her appetite under control, to no avail. Renee was spiraling out of control, and she knew if she didn't crack this case soon she would be just as far gone Roxy Rocket or the Sirens, a fat glutton too obsessed with filling her gullet to focus on anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee knew she was't too far off. She gave herself a quick look over in the full body mirror situated over her closet door. She had long passed the threshold into fatdom, but her recent experiences with Kate Kane and the Sirens had begun to amplify it. Her enormous behind had been the first part of her to experience her onslaught of weight gain and soon grew to be her most prominent feature. Many a pair of jeans had fallen prey to her behemoth backside in the past few weeks, and it's outward journey didn't show any signs of stopping. The rest of her lower body was also no stranger to her massive gain, her legs and thighs keeping in lock-step with the expansion of her sizable rear. Renee feared that it would only be a few more weeks before wearing denim jeans and slacks would no longer be feasible and she would have to make the permanent transition into sweats. Her belly had also begun to see some emergence, as the pendulous gut made itself known. Where once she had only a beer gut, it had grown into a bonfide apron, one that had begun to pour down past her nether bits. The rest of her body had remained, mostly untouched in it's expanse, the only exception being a pair of chubby cheeks, a new chin, and a pair of flabby arms. Though Renee knew it wouldn't be long before that changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee poured through her case files, looking for more evidence. Interviewing the Sirens was a mistake, she knew that they had to be involved, but they had done a good job of covering their tracks. Renee looked over the chemical anaylsis of the pastries that she had sent out for weeks ago, they had come in the other day. She had already known that the confections released a chemical agent that trigger a massive release of dopamine in the brain. Not only that, but the pastries were also vital in numbing the hypothalamus, causing the victim to lose all control of their appetite. A striking combination, which was compounded by the fact that a single serving contained a week's worth of calories and saturated fat. No wonder Gotham was blimping up. Renee tapped her pudgy fingers against her desk, there had to be someway of tracing this back to Ivy and her cohorts. Renee thumbed through the analysis again, the chemical agent was a compound that the examiners had never seen before. It must've been some concotion of Ivy, but there was one aspect of the agent that she had heard of. Triophloricide, a chemical that was manufactured in a processing plant not far from here. \"Looks like there's a few questions that need to be answered...\" Renee said to herself as she lifted her enormous rear out of her chair and headed towards her closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee grabbed her mask and her suit, there was investigating to do. Of course Renee had quickly outgrown her wardrobe and soon found that close to nothing fit her. She had torn through her last pair of jeans the night before during her stuffing session with the Sirens, and it semed the only thing that could possibly contain her flab were an old pair of bicycle shorts and an old wifebeater. Renee shimmied into both pairs horrified to see that it exemplified her fleshy body. The flimsy shirt barely fit past her breasts and left her belly completely exposed as it spilled underneath the white cloth. The booty shorts themselves didn't offer much decency, as they barely contained the upper portion of her thighs and her massive ass. Renee considered for a moment, doing a little shopping before going out, but there was no time to waste. The more she waited around, the fatter Gotham's citizens were bound to get and the fatter she herself was bound to get. Renee, crawled out of her window, barely able to squeeze through the small frame, and climbed down the fire escape. There was no way she was going to leave her apartment complex through the front door dressed like this. But, at the bottom of the fire escape waited a face mostly unknown to her, one of the Bat's clan, but one she had no proper dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to help. </span></div></div>",

The yellow bat symbol was being stretched outwards by a pair of massive breasts to say nothing of how tight the middle of the costume looked on the belly heavy young woman. Renee, obviously larger and therefore not one to judge, chose to initiate conversation first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know anything about the mass fattening that's overtaking Gotham?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costumed young woman shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really look like I do? I mean I have a couple leads but nothing concrete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's combine what we have and see if any match up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman nodded and waddled towards Renee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of conversing, one lead in particular seemed to fit the bill: a pastry factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been shut down in the 70's but had recently been reopened last year, around the same time that the first cases of fattening had been observed, according to Renee's records.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they decided to start there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl fired a grapple gun and wrapped an arm as tight as she could around Renee's quite prodigious waist, Renee having no time to question why she was doing this as the line attached to a gargoyle and sent them flying through the air. As they managed to land on the roof, Renee stumbling onto her enormous rear in the process, Batgirl smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That line can hold up to three tons, giving us fast travel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee, after being helped up by Batgirl, was grateful for that at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have nine blocks to go,\" she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl nodded and Renee again took stock of her stout companion. Batgirl's weight was largely in her belly, with her breasts the next in line in terms of size. Her rear was merely chubby, not the monument to obesity that Renee's was. Her face had an extra chin and her eyes were a bright blue as she smiled, her fat cheeks jiggling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we waiting for?

Despite cooking a veritable feast for Talia, over half the food had somehow ended up inside Harley.  At first, it was just a little bite here and there, at Talia's encouragement-  \"Come on love, it's delicious, and I wouldn't want you going hungry while I sit here and eat all this food you spent so long working on!\"  But it had quickly turned into Talia feeding Harley, well, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley let out a small belch, unused to being stuffed, usually doing the stuffing herself.  \"Talia, I wanted you to eat this food.  I made it for you and I wanted you to enjoy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But love, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I made it for you!  For you!\" She yelled, jumping up.  The sudden motion caused the button on her pants to snap off, causing her face to flush red. \"Now look what you made me do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love, that wasn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Just don't say anything!\"  Harley yelled, stomping her feet.  She was in tantrum mode, and Talia wasn't going to be able to get a word in.  \"You're getting stuffed too, even if it takes all night\"  She said, before pushing Talia onto the couch.  She grabbed a box of cookies and began shoving them into Talia's face.  Talia was certainly hungry, after all she WAS used to stuffing herself, and she eagerly chowed down the cookies by the handful.  Harley grabbed a carton of milk and pushed the opening to Talia's mouth, pouring the milk down her throat at a quick pace.  She made sure the carton was empty before throwing it to the side.  Talia let out a small burp, groaning slightly at the pace she was forced to drink.  \"Harley, I don't mind eating, but can we go a bit slower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  You're being punished!  I can't believe you stuffed me like that, that's my job!\"  Harley was a woman possessed, grabbing some pasta salad from the counter and spooning it quickly into Talia's mouth.  Talia wasn't used to being ordered around by anyone other than Ra's, but for some reason when Harley did it she didn't mind too much, and willingly allowed herself to be filled with pasta salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Meanwhile, in Ivy's room-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth is that noise?\"  Inquired Selina as she took a bite of fried chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it sounds like Harley's having a hissyfit.  Seems like spending time with Talia isn't as fun as she initially though\" Said Ivy with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... well, -urp-, at least we're having fun together.  Here, try some of this chicken, it's amazing.\"  Said Selina, sliding the remaining two thirds of a roast chicken towards Ivy, while suppressing a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you say so...\" Said Ivy, starting to grow a bit tired of eating.  It had seemed like Selina had been passing more food towards her than usual.  However, Ivy's appetite was nothing short of monstrous, so she had been dutifully eating everything heading her way.  However, she was feeling stuffed quicker than usual, as a result.  However, the chicken was, as Selina had assured her, absolutely incredible.  She quickly tore into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was eying Ivy thoughtfully.  Her gut was clearly stuffed, pulling her tight green outfit to the max.  Selina was feeling content, but nowhere near stuffed, as she had been, at least in her mind, stealthily passing her food onto Ivy after a few bites.  After their last weigh-in, Selina had felt embarrassed to be the heaviest of the group, and was determined to fatten Ivy up beyond herself.  On top of that, she thought Ivy looked damn good with the extra weight.  She pulled out a large chocolate cake from their stash, jamming a fork into it and taking a large bite as Ivy devoured the chicken.  Within moments Ivy had finished, and Selina had eaten about an eight of the cake.  \"Here Ivy, try this AMAZING cake... It's truly decadent.\"  She said as she slid the cake across the table to Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy stared at the cake for a moment, before realizing what exactly Selina was up to.  \"Selina, dear?  Could you...\" She started to say, before an incredibly loud belch forced its way out of her. \"Uuuuuurp!  Oh my!  Excuse me.  Anyways, I'm feeling a bit full... Would you mind feeding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's eyes widened.  \"Of course I wouldn't, Ivy!  I mean, you don't think it'd be weird, would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously not, I'm the one who's asking, aren't I?\"  She laughed, before opening her mouth expectantly for the next piece of food.</span></div></div>",

And yet, Talia found Harley's predicament to be quite adorable coming from the former psychiatrist, even though it wasn't in the plump harlequin's plans for tonight. So, in response to Harley's fattening accusation, Talia displayed such a convincing innocent and naive demeanor and teasingly said, \"Why Love, whatever do you mean? I was merely helping you... Howdoyousayit, \"Bulk up\".\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to go the extra mile, Talia began to slowly grope her voluminous breasts confined within her strained Double F-Cup bra, using her plump hands to great effect on her fattened boobs, causing the Demon's daughter to explicitly let out a sexually pleasured moan as she said, \"And besides... Don't you want us to smother one another with each other's bellies, Love?\" At first, Harley wanted to ignore the fattened League of Assassins member for such trickery. However, knowing Harley Quinn, that display of ignorance would not last long, as Harley couldn't help herself but become sexually aroused upon seeing the plus-sized Talia Al Ghul groping her fattened breasts just to gain the blonde Harlequin's affections, which happened to be very effective on Talia's behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as Talia had expected, Harley quickly but absentmindedly forgave the rotund daughter of the Demon, leaning against Talia with a pair of arms wrapped around the rotund woman's fat paunch of a belly, where Harley then spoke toward her with an ecstatic relieved tone in her voice and answered, \"Aww, Tallie! How can I stay mad at ya?\" From there, Talia wrapped her chubby left arm around Harley, pulling her closer toward the Demon's daughter while also smooshing her against her belly fat and luxurious rolls, cuddling the stuffed former psychiatrist with an air of romance.</span></div></div>",

Of course, she subconsciously shrugged off the glaring beams of sunlight upon her face, shifting her position on the couch. However, it was the delectable scent of freshly baked pastries that began to stir the semi-immortal woman from her slumber, as she slowly opened her eyes, only to see an already dressed Harley preoccupied with making a pastry-filled breakfast for her favorite Al Ghul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Talia easily noticed the aftermath of forcefully feeding Harley the previous night and it's effects on the blonde jester's physique. Aside from simply wearing a now ill-fitting Gotham Knights T-shirt, Harley's small bump of a belly now billowed out a little further with additional adipose, pooching out slightly above the waistband of her red panties, along with the developments of a prominent muffin top. But as for the T &amp; A side of the spectrum, Harley's breasts ballooned out from a round D-Cup to a noticeable Triple D-Cup, easily noticeable underneath the snug Gotham Knights T-shirt, while the blonde jester's butt became rounder and fatter as well, jutting out and stretching the red panties almost to their physical limit. And finally, Harley's thighs became much thicker and plumper than they were previously, while the blonde jester's hips jutted out, easily becoming almost 2 and a half feet in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Harley's newly \"improved\" physique, Talia couldn't help but display a sultry and seductive smirk on her slightly rounder face, obviously satisfied with her so-called \"handiwork\" on the blonde jester's formerly lithe frame. After all, even though she was one of the daughters of the Demon's Head, she was certainly a woman with special \"tastes\" when it came to finding the perfect lover. And Harley was definitely no exception to Talia's tastes, just as the plump blonde jester made her way toward the statuesque but nude Al Ghul, carrying a tray full of heavily frosted cupcakes in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin', Talie!\" Harley quipped, being her cheery usual self as always, administering a tender kiss upon Talia's plump lips, as she then placed both trays down on the coffee table in front of them, prompting Talia to sit up from her laid-back position on the couch, eagerly anticipating the succulent sweets that Harley provided for her. Licking her chops with gluttonous and lustful hunger on her conscious, Talia somewhat swiftly began to grab two cupcakes at a time, whilst still retaining her lady-like composure as she took her sweet time devouring the cupcakes, savoring each mouthful of the delicious yet addictive creamy frosting that entered her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I take it that you have forgiven what has happened between us last night, my dear Harleen?\" Talia asked, speaking toward the former Arkham Asylum psychiatrist with that somewhat thick but seductive Al Ghul accent of hers. Of course, in response to such a question, Harley gave out a light chuckle and replied, \"*chuckle* Nah, it's alright! Just water under da bridge now, Talie.\" However, it was then that Harley leaned forward to speak into Talia's right ear and whispered, \"...But if you try ta do that ta me again, I'll make sure ta feed ya so many cupcakes that you'll be too fat ta even waddle under ya own power.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the blonde jester gave her such a legitimate warning, Talia could easily tell that the way that Harley said it had these subtle but noticeable hints of arousal and enjoyment on Harley's behalf. In turn, this made the tubby and curvaceous Al Ghul display a sultry, lustful, and gleeful grin on her plump face. \"*giggle* ...Oh? My dear Harleen, is that a threat...or a promise?\" Talia coyly asked, as she playfully patted her much softer belly and cupped one of her fattened breasts, lightly shaking the mass of cleavage, making it jiggle some in the process. Obviously, this was a noticeable turn-on for the plump blonde jester, as she took a sip of orange from her cup to swallow some of the cake matter she devoured moments ago and answered, \"...Maybe. But dat all depends on how ya behave, Talie. So? What's it gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing of said potential \"bargain\" coming from the formerly lithe blonde jester, Talia decided to weigh her options on the matter at hand, devouring another one of Harley's frosted cupcakes in the process. Eventually, as she deliberately licked her slightly plump fingers clean of any remaining frosting residue, Talia decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tuesday was always such a bland day for most people. A workday that fell in-between the anxiousness of Monday and the feeling of slighted optimism that came with Wednesday, 'Hump Day' as was its blue collar monicker. Along with the insipid feeling of this dreaded day, the sweltering Summer sun that loomed overhead the gothic city of Gotham made it all the more unbearable as denizens slowly baked in their own apartments; the pleasant breezes of Spring fondly missed in wake of their harsh unforgiving cousin Dry Heat. To put it shortly, no one could quite beat the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in Wayne Towers, famous for its posh accommodations and luxurious handling of tenants, was experiencing a slight overheating problem that had blown out the circuits its highly overtaxed air conditioning unit. The maintenance men claimed that only a few hours of blistering heat would have to be endured, though no one was entirely reassured by the simple logistics of it. They wanted cold now; anything short of instantly would just be an insult to their blue blood. And though the underpaid specialists worked their fingers to the bone to satisfy, they simply could not produce results fast enough. However, there seemed to be one tenant who rather enjoyed the blisteringly hot environment that Gotham found itself plunged into; this being of course the only truly solar-powered woman in the city: Pamela \"Poison Ivy\" Isely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the Man of Steel, Poison Ivy seemed to be filled with energy today on this first \"true\" day of Summer. Whereas most women dreaded the sweat that drip from their brow and the matting of their hair, Ivy seemed to relish in the experience; she seemed to flourish as the perspiration from her own brow ran smoothly down her rounded cheeks, and her vibrant red hair gaining a lustrous sheen as it absorbed precious energy from the blaring yellow sun. Her mood was upbeat, swaying her full hips as she hummed lightly to her precious children taking residence in the botanical garden Wayne Towers had provided. Dressed keenly in a yellow sundress, Ivy's bubbly form shook and shimmied with each upbeat movement of her heavyset shape. She paused for a moment to gaze upwards lovingly at the sun, wiping the sweat from her forehead graciously and going right back to work; egging her plants to grow bigger and faster with the tender love and care she provided for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the clicks and low hums, Ivy discerned a pleasant thanks towards their mother for the gracious luncheon they had been provided with. She bid them farewell for the evening as she stepped out onto the roof of the building. Her tight juane attire began clinging to her every bulge, hugging her every curve as she grew damper and damper in perspiration. Her green skin glistened in the bright sunlight as the thin layer of sweat ran down her over ripened form. In the sweltering heat Ivy's tummy bulged out and about, jutting slightly and folding to lap her belt line. But she didn't seem to mind, lately she didn't seem to have a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny how a little weather could change a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside the elevator, Ivy expertly punched in the number for her floor, the seventh, and waited for the metal box to carry her down what could easily have been several flights of arduous steps. Finally a slight jerking motion in the container signaled that the elevator had started moving, her hands immediately falling down to ease the slightest pressure put on her stomach by gravity. The supervillain stepped out as the doors opened with a hushed 'ding', waddling down the hallway until reaching the Isely-Quinn residence; craving for its glorious view of the skyline and the bright weather she had been blessed with. Maybe with a little TV...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand a Popsicle or two. It <i>was</i> rather hot today...</span></div></div>",

Her blonde hair was down and not done up in her usual pig tails due to the heat.She had been laying out on the outdoor lounge chair working on her tan while drinking a pepsi. She had never particularily liked being pale and was taking the opportunity of this heat to work on her tan. She was being careful and using sun tan lotion however just giving her a nice slight tan which is what she wanted. The heat was also having another effect on her and it was the exact opposite effect of it's effect on Ivy. The heat was making her lose weight. While it hadn't brought her down to original size and she was still definitely a little chubby, it had caused her to lose a decent amount of weight. Her belly was still soft but smaller and didn't stick out as much. Her thighs still soft and thick but not as much and while she still had a big booty, it's size had gone down as well. She was actually pleased with this result. While she was enjoying seeeing Ivy get fat, she didn't want to get as big as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had gone back in to get a refill of her coke. She was feeling pretty sweety and planned to take a shower later. She brushed a loose strand of her golden hair behind her hair as she was about to head into the kitchen when she heard the door open and her roomate walk in. She couldn't help but smile as Ivy waddled in, all her soft fat jiggling, her green body glistining with sweat. She had thought she was pretty sweety but Ivy was even sweetier due to her overripened form. She thought that the fat looked good on Ivy and suited her well. \"Hey Red! Have a good time in ya Greenhouse?\" she asked her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy gave a small smile and nodded as she walked inside while the door closed behind her. \"Yes. It was good to see my babies and make sure they got fed\" she said in her usual husky tone. \"What were you up to while I was gone?\" she asked noticing Harley's bikini attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I was just workin on my tan. What are you going to do now?\" Harley. \"I'm feeling a little hungry so I was going to get a couple of popsicles and watch some tv\" Ivy said as she started to make her way towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That doctorate on the wall wasn't just for show, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....eeehhhh, I dunno, Pam,\" Harley floundered, rubbing her chin thoughtfully. \"I think hittin' the ATM's is a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was surprised. Harley, not wanting to do a simple smash and grab and get back to a lazy day of Runescape? Yeah, sure, and Batman dressed in rainbow colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're losing your edge, Harl,\" Ivy taunted with a hint of annoyance. \"I wouldn't expect you of all people to go soft!\" This was extremely ironic considering the belly that pooched over the plant lady's waist, but Harley held her tongue, not wanting to get tossed around like a rag doll by one of Ivy's vines for pointing out the obvious....again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't soft!\" she insisted instead. \"But...well, crime's like a good joke, ya know? You keep doing the same thing over an' over, people are gonna stop laughing. You get 'em with a surprise punchline, knocks 'em dead every time!\" Harley swung a triumphant fist in the air with a big stupid grin on her face, leaving Ivy less then impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is, don't do the same thing over and over again,\" Ivy concluded, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Harley said. Ivy groaned, but honestly Harley was probably right. They made the news with that ATM stunt the last time, doing the same thing all over again would be a poor idea, even if Batman didn't stick his nose into things, and he most likely would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good bit of advice,\" the plant woman continued. \"But unless you have another suggestion-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Harley vanished into her room to the sound of clunking and creaking furniture before returning with a giant sheath of paper rolled up like a scroll, unfurling it before Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've spent weeks workin' on this beauty, just in case we needed to pull off a really big heist sometime!\" Harley declared triumphantly. \"Poured my heart and soul into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can believe that,\" Ivy said, squinting at the crude stick figure drawings and chicken scrawl in the margins. They appeared to have been drawn in crayon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a flawless plan, I tell ya!\" Harley declared, dropping one hand to pull her chubby companion into a friendly side hug. \"We'll get in, get out, and no one will ever see it coming! We follow this plan, and come tomorrow, we're gonna be the richest gals in Gotham! It'll be PERFECT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I might have <i>slightly</i> overestimated our chances...\" Harley said as the masked thug hung her from the rail by her ankles, her pigtails brushing the dirty floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harl...\" Ivy said as she dangled next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harley swallowed and complied with that order, Ivy was still kicking herself for even letting it get this far (metaphorically, mind you, considering she was strung up by her ankles). She should have bailed after the milk truck and the flaming hula hoop, and indeed she tried after Harley took a honey-baked ham to the face, but thanks to her compulsive habit of shoving junk food into her face, she started choking on a Twinkie when she attempted to escape, and was rewarded with a crowbar and a nasty dark green shadow across the bridge of her nose. If she survived this, she was going on a hard, HARD diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I can't believe we caught these two!\" one of the goons said, nudging Harley with the toe of his boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" another of the guys said excitedly. \"Wait'll I tell the boys down at Goonies, I'll be drinkin' free for months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddaya think we can get for turnin them in?\" a mustachioed brute asked, poking Ivy's fleshy tummy with the barrel of his rifle, not noticing Ivy trying to bite at his ankles. \"I bet we get a cool mil just for the clown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, we can't keep em?\" a fourth goon said, grinning lecherously. \"I'd love to get my hands on-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't, <i>pendejos</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goon looked behind him and was immediately launched across the room by a powerful kick, landing in a crumpled heap on the far side of the warehouse. None of the other guys flinched at this display. After all, they knew who they were working for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her vantage point, Ivy saw the crowd of legs part and a pair of heavy boots approaching her. Glancing down, or rather up, she caught sight of the towering, hulking figure in the black and white wrestling mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Buenos dias</i>, Bane,\" Ivy said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pamela Isley, isn't it?\" Bane asked, crouching down to get a better look at her. \"I barely recognized you, because of...well, I'm sure you know.\" He chuckled darkly as Ivy's face flushed. \"That was an impressive display out front, I didn't expect that move from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my idea!\" Harley piped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the clown's...squeeze, I think is the term,\" Bane said, turning to Harley. \"That, I did expect from you. Let me guess, you thought stealing from me was a better idea then repeating your little ATM heist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant idea, wasn't it?\" Harley asked brightly. \"Well, except for this bit with the ankles upside down, I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, flawless,\" Bane chuckled, deeply amused by this deluded jester. \"You'll have to tell me all about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well you start with the giant rubber chicken and about twelve pounds of Wow, It's Not Actually Butter-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, boss!\" Bane looked up and Ivy looked down at the overhead balcony where a door had opened up. \"The guys in the back haven't checked in yet. Want us to go check it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. It's the Batman.\" Bane cracked his knuckles menacingly. \"He is right where we want him. Draw him towards the assembly room, I will confront him there, and then...I will break him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need a new catchphrase,\" Ivy said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave these two here,\" Bane ordered his men, ignoring the verbal barb. \"Carrion for whomever finds them, not worth the irritation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no we aren't!\" Harley shouted after the retreating men and their hulking boss. \"I am VERY irritating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo easy, Ivy decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red, I'm scared, what are we gonna do to get out of here?\" Harley gulped, her chipper attitude vanishing rather quickly. Ivy smirked as the small vine crawling up her ankle finished slowly dripping acid onto the steel bar holding them up. \"Whoah, what's that?\" Harley yelped as the bar suddenly bowed under their weight. \"I don't  -GUK\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar suddenly snapped, and both girls faceplanted on the grimey floor, their bodies flopping down afterwards in a very undignified manner. Ivy pushed herself up, tugging her leaf shirt back over her stomach and dusting herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red...pffft...\" Harley cheered, spitting hair out of her mouth. \"You SAVED me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because I couldn't save myself without freeing you too,\" Ivy snapped bitterly. She immediately regretted it after seeing Harley's best sad puppy eyes. \"L-look lets just get out of here before Batman shows up,\" Ivy grumbled, wondering if she was going soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but if you keep being rude, I won't share the goods with ya!\" Harley said with a knowing wink as the two dashed for an exit, keeping eyes peeled for sudden looming shadows overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What goods? We didn't get a damn thing! This night was a total waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, was it?\" With a very cocky smile, Harley reached into her pants (yuck) and pulled out...</span></div></div>",

Earth to Ivy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ivy opened her eyes, her jaw nearly hit the floor when she saw Harley, or at least saw the size of Harley, her jaded jester was now more of a 'Jumbo Jester', a big second chin that eclipsed her neck, big, meaty arms that barely had any strength in them, a massive stomach that protruded outwards, legs like tree trunks and a massive ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ! Harl', what the hell happened to you?!\" Ivy called out, but she felt something different...had her voice always been that deep and husky? However, the annoyed expression on the hugely overweight Harley showed that she was quite annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You spend your time bragging how we're the biggest and baddest bitches in Gotham and all of a sudden you're fat shaming me? This coming from the woman who bragged about being Immense Ivy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about!?\" Ivy grunted out, but it was like even talking was getting her out of breath and, when she tried to stand up, she was unable to, like a big weight was weighing her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as she looked down, she saw that the 'weight' was her own obesity, Ivy was even fatter than Harley, her belly was like a planet of fat that wobbled from Ivy's heavy breathing, which was a side effect of her ample bulk, it was to the point where she had a double belly and, when Ivy turned her head and caught a glimpse of her reflection in a window; it hit home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had three chins that eclipsed her neck and wobbled with every word, Ivy must've tipped the scales at 600lbs as she blabbered and started to sweat due to her mind not being able to process what was going on. However, Ivy looked around and saw that they were in more plush surroundings than usual, a massive apartment with all the finest features that the duo could've only dreamed of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harl'.\" Ivy grunted out as she sat there, unable to process what was going on, or heave herself up thanks to her own obesity. \"What's going on??\" as Harley just folded her fat, massive arms and snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Red, that 25 course cheat day must've done a number on you; OK, let me explain how we got here.\" Harley panted out, and what she said suddenly made the hallucination feel more like Ivy's idea of paradise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Ding!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, my grilled cheese is done!\" Harley said, clapping her hands together before waddling off into the other room, leaving a very confused Ivy behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, wait!\" she called out, trying to stand up again but shifting herself only a couple inches before flopping back down again. Grumbling, she braced her pudgy hands on her seat and heaved once again, using her weight to her advantage and swinging her bulk off the sofa. The floor let out a pathetic groan as her heavy double-belly slapped down against her thighs, hanging lower then her sunken knees. Instinctively, she reached up to pull her shirt down before realizing she wasn't wearing one; instead, she appeared to be naked save for the leaves that covered her breasts and nether regions. Because she had nothing to wear in this size, or because she didn't care enough to put anything on? Ivy couldn't say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step towards the kitchen and immediately found herself winded, panting heavily and sweating from the exertion of moving her immense body. Pushing herself onward was even more agonizing as she felt her whole body wobble and shake, and she had to pause to catch her breath, leaning against the window. She took a moment to glance outside and removed her hand upon seeing how high up she was. Was this even still Gotham? She could see the clock tower in the distance, no building in the city this tall was within sight of it! Looking closer revealed something else; green. Greenery flowed through the distant streets below, climbing up the buildings and overtaking the ugly concrete with vibrant flowering bods and twisted winding vines. Ivy was surprised she didn't notice, since the window she looked out appeared to be partially surrounded with flowering vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer desire to understand what the hell was going on pushed Ivy forward, and she eventually entered upon a rather massive kitchen, nearly as big as the previous living room. Harley had busied herself in front of an uncomfortably large microwave, bent over and sticking her massive rear end towards Ivy, and while she wasn't in the nude, Harley looked like she was a few meals away from bursting out of the panties stretched across her shelf-like buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harl!\" Ivy gasped, bracing herself on the counter. Harley turned around, revealing a massive platter of grilled cheese sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made them with the special cheese from that one plant, honest! Totally vegan!\" Harley insisted, a little too eagerly. \"Y-you didn't need to check on me to make sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that, I-\" Ivy started to say before her eye caught something hanging off the back of a chair...something with pointed ears. \"What the hell is THAT doing here?\" she demanded, pointing a pudgy finger at it. Harley, confused, waddled over to pick up what indeed turned out to be a rather familiar cowl, unceremoniously pitched over a chair like an old coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Ol' Bat's cowl, silly!\" Harley giggled. \"Remember, we got it off of the Bat's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy blinked. \"...body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh Red you get slow when you're hungry,\" Harley said, waddling back over and picking up one of the sandwiches. \"Here ya go!\" Ivy felt her gluttonous stomach lurch, and she instinctively opened her mouth to let Harley stick the sandwich in, chewing it up happily before realizing what she did. Something to deal with later, Ivy supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does feel like yesterday, don't it?\" Harley continued, picking up the whole platter this time and moving it to the center counter. \"Could you believe Bats was <i>Wynea Ercub</i> the whole time?\" The name came out differently then the rest of what Harley was saying, almost like it was played backwards, though the jester didn't seem to notice as she dug into the platter. Ivy blinked, her head swimming as she tried to take this all in. Eating seemed to help her focus though, so Ivy somewhat reluctantly joined in the grilled cheese feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Batman's dead, right?\" Ivy confirmed warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Gone and goner, hasn't been seen since Demon Guy took over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demon guy?\" Ivy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the head demon guy, what's his name...Rashal Gool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Ra's al Ghul?'</i> Ivy thought to herself. She knew him well, even shared some of the same goals too. What was his involvement here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe we didn't ask for his help takin' down Bats sooner!\" Harley giggled. \"No Venom or anythin', just wrapped him up in your vines, take my mallet and...whack!\" Harley mimed swinging her hammer, though her bingo wings swung more then she did at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made a good alliance, then,\" Ivy remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say! He even let you control Gotham city without having to answer to President Lex!\" Harley said. \"No interference or nothin', just you growin' Gaia-sized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy raised an eyebrow. \"Growing...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't buy into this eco thing at first, all \"Mother Earth is big and bountiful so all girls have gotta be in her image\" but uh...I gotta say, this is kinda fun!\" Harley giggled again, slapping the side of her stomach to let it wobble. \"With all this comfy fat I'm like a big stuffed plushie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was too shocked at this point to think much about Harley's interest in her own blubber. Batman was dead, and she won? Not only that but she was in control and the first thing she did...was fatten herself and Harley up? Probably more women too, if what Harley said was true. She did want to be the avatar of Gaia of course, but...was being a lardball really part of that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ivy could ponder more on that front, however...</span></div></div>",

Then, Ivy got a good look at how supersized Selina was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't as fat as Harley or Ivy, but Selina must've tipped the scales at 350+lbs, her bulbous belly was crammed into her skintight catsuit as it looked like it was one meal away from bursting off of Selina's obese body. The side rolls could be seen bunching up, it was honestly like the catsuit was painted on Selina's heaving, sweaty fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, girls...you look good.\" Selina complimented, her face looking rounder with a firm second chin on her pretty face as Harley couldn't help but blush at the compliment. \"Geee, thanks, Fat Cat; you look great, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, I look purrrr-fect.\" Selina purred as Ivy rolled her eyes in annoyance, she was still confused what was going on, but she was now annoyed at Selina's insistance on going all out with the 'feline' quirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see some things never change.\" Ivy snorted and rolled her eyes, folding her fat, flabby arms in dismissive irritation as Selina just pouted in a taunting way to Ivy and responded to that remark with a simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good to see you too, Ivy...listen, I supposed you want to know why I'm here?\" Selina asked, causing Harley to bounce up and down, her fat quaking wildly with even the simplest of movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why're you here, Kitty-Fat?\" Harley gave Selina another nickname that caused Ivy to rudely scoff and give Selina a condescending look up and down before she responded with a snarky. \"Yeah, or did you just come all this way to get a look at a real woman??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy had no idea that the toxins from the plant were causing her to almost embrace her hallucinationary obesity as Ivy started to slowly rub her massive, fat flesh as if to show Selina what she'd never look like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is Selina there?</span></div></div>",

Ivy drew a complete blank, glancing between the two girls and deciding to gamble a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yes, she can be trusted,\" Ivy said, trying to sound like she wasn't frantically improvising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured she wouldn't be after what Lex did, but I wanted to be sure,\" Selina purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait are you two going after Lex?\" Harley said excitedly. \"Ooh, tell me more! I wanna see him get what's coming to him, after what he did to...Mr. J...\" Harley's voice quivered slightly as her eyes teared up slightly, but she repressed the sudden emotion with another sandwich stuffed whole into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, once Ivy takes her medicine Luthor won't know what hit 'em,\" Selina smirked. The super-sized burglar pulled what Ivy just realized was a back rucksack off her shoulder and opened it up. Glass tubes clanked together inside, and an unearthly green-blue color shined onto the underside of Catwoman's flabby breasts. \"Couple shots of these and you'll be powerful enough to take over the entire country with your green, and every mind inside of it too,\" Catwoman said, pulling out one of the vials. For the first time since this mess started, Ivy found herself intrigued by this opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is al Ghul okay with this?\" Ivy found herself saying. \"He has enough trouble dealing with Vandal Savage over in Eastern Europe, he might not want us starting a war with Lex Luthor.\" Ivy blinked, surprised at the words coming out of her mouth. Did she just say something that the version of her in this timeline knew? Or...something that she knew? Ugh, this was confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What he doesn't know won't hurt him,\" Selina pointed out. \"And besides, if this works Luthor won't be able to do a thing about it.\" This did make sense, Ivy thought to herself. In the end Lex was only in such a position of power because he was a useful asset in the takeover of the planet, he wouldn't mind if someone more equitable to his views were in Lex's place. Someone like Poison Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, between teasing Selena about her size and knowing all this information from an alternate universe, this was getting weird. Unless...this was always the real world? Funny, she had a distant memory of a warehouse, and a flower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does this stuff do?\" Harley asked, looking over the vial curiously. \"Gives you super strength or somethin? Or is it like Plant-Gro stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina gave an appropriately cat-like grin. \"Why don't you try some for yourself, Harl? It might...suit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Pam, there's plenty extra, and I can always steal more of this stuff from Bane's labs,\" Selina reassured Ivy as Harley squealed in delight and popped the top off a vial. Ivy blinked, feeling a little numb. Bane...warehouse...flower...was...was that even real? Did anything like that happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's questioning of her own reality took a backseat to ongoing events however as Harley quaffed the vial of chemicals in a few gulps, briefly pausing before dropping the delicate glassware in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech, it's icky!\" Harley told the girls. \"I can't believe I....oh....oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jester's cheeks flushed as Harley's mouth fell open in shock. Ivy wondered if she'd been poisoned by the chemical before her cheeks suddenly started to swell before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel....really weird...\" Harley gulped, her double chin widening and sinking lower on her face, a third growing just beneath it. Reaching up to feel her face, she watched in amazement as her fingers thickened before her eyes, the fat spreading down her wrists, swallowing her elbows and stretching the sleeves of her t-shirt. She barely had time to comprehend her ham-like arms before her belly suddenly wobbled and started to swell, sinking towards her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy and Selina took two heavy steps backwards as Harley kneaded her growing gut, feeling the fat collect beneath her fingers. The sound of rending fabric filled the air as the sides of her shirt split open, then a rubber snap was heard and Harley's voluminous panties fell to the ground, torn neatly in two. Harley yelped and covered her rear end with her hands, though she needn't have bothered since her gut hung low enough to cover anything inappropriate. Her billowing thighs were starting to tear rips and holes in her knee-high socks, and even the floor seemed to creak underneath her. At long last though, the growing seemed to slow down and desist, punctuated by a tremendously loud belch from the Jester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whoa...\" Harley said, her voice throaty and thick. \"I'm...huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's even bigger then you now, Ivy,\" Selina quipped at Ivy, and the plant lady felt, of all things, a twinge of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so big and plush!\" Harley giggled, taking a cautious step forward and nearly losing her balance. \"Woof, it's hard to move with all of this. Why didn't you say anything Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never asked,\" Ivy pointed out as Harley kept attempting to walk, taking a few waddling steps at a time and inadvertently revealing her shelf of a rear end to the other girls, as well as the huge tear in her shirt. \"Well, these are the right ones, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you that you could trust me,\" Selina said with a wink, lifting up a pair of vials in her hands. \"Now...you read to take over the world, Red?\" Judging by the hungry expression on Selina's face, Ivy figured that the cat burglar had an ulterior motive besides helping her take over the States. Ivy thought for a moment on this, without so much as a sliver of her old memories coming through, before deciding...</span></div></div>",

If Selina tried anything, then Ivy would make her suffer the same fate as Batman, or anyone else who got in her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for you two to see what real power is\" Ivy boasted, a smug smirk on her fat, beautiful face as the ruler of Gotham decided that she wanted more, she wanted to rule the entire world; to take it back to the days of plant life reigning supreme, with Ivy as it's obese, all mighty Goddess. Ivy's fat fingers managed to unscrew the top of the vial before she simply opened her maw as wide as she could and poured the entire thing into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chemicals took effect almost instantly as Ivy groaned and moaned in a feeling of surprising discomfort and pain, she clutched onto her massive belly and shook violently. She tried to block out the pain, which was getting more and more noticeable as Ivy started to grow even more, her belly ballooning up to the point where it slammed onto the floor, Ivy's fat face got another chin of fat that covered her neck as Ivy was hurtling towards immobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red?? Are you OK!?\" Harley called out with genuine concern in her voice as Ivy's transformation was complete, letting out a massive, building shaking belch that nearly caused both Harley and Catwoman to lose their balance and fall on their fat asses; Ivy just sat there, breathing heavily as it seemed like she wouldn't be moving anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *huff*...better than OK...I'm invincible!\" Ivy grunted out, her neck fat giving her a deeper, throatier voice, even more so than Harley, the serum was already messing with Ivy's head, inflating her ego, which was already massive and now it gave Ivy a borderline God Complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did it work, do you feel more powerful?\" Selina asked with a smirk on her fat face, which caused Ivy to smirk back at her as she struggled to get her breath back and simply snapped her fat, sausage like fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that one gesture, several vines burst through the windows, with the building itself being covered in vines and other plants; Catwoman and Harley looked on it genuine shock as a throne made of plants started to form around Ivy's immobile body; despite Ivy's even more titanic body, the throne was able to hold her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy just sat there, smirking with pride and arrogance as she casually, flippantly responded to Selina \"Does that answer your question, Selina?\" Ivy slouched back, massaging her planet sized belly that weighed Ivy down and would've rendered her unable to move, but her new control over plants solved that problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy honestly felt like she could conquer the world, she didn't know if it was real or a hallucination, but the power she was feeling was intoxicating, but things got more interesting when the hallucination jumped forward yet again; but to what point?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Something had been bothering Ivy since Selina had showed up, something that stuck in the back of her head like an unpleasant memory. She may have been thrown a bit by that strange dream she had about being a thin, common criminal, but her thoughts were coming back to her more clearly now, and there was one major red flag. Poison Ivy may be the size of an elephant, but under that blubber she was still Poison Ivy, and Poison Ivy...well, she could count the number of people she'd be willing to work with on one hand. Harley, Swamp Thing, Ra's apparently, maybe Floronic Man on a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut never, <i>never</i>, Selina Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had a long history together, and far too much of that involved Catwoman betraying her or her allies and flipping over to Batman's side, or whichever vigilante was in town that day. The woman was, appropriately enough, as indecisive as an ill-tempered housecat, and Ivy would not have trusted her to deliver a sandwich, much less a chemical that would let her take over the world from under the nose of one of the smartest men left in the world. This meant one of two things, really. The first, treason, Ivy ruled out right away. Selina was always on the winning side, and judging by that belly she wasn't too broken up about being part of Ivy's new vision for womankind, or whatever Harley had mentioned. That of course, meant option two; Ivy wanted this stuff for another reason, one that Selina wasn't in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Selina said expectently. \"Let's get this-YEOUCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy jumped as Selina recoiled, slapping a hand onto the back of her neck. Slowly, Catwoman turned to face a vine floating delicately down from the ceiling, its beautiful purple petals hiding a potent sedative in its barbs. Ivy knew this because she immediately became aware that she was the one who sent it. Selina turned back to glare at Ivy with fire in her eyes, even as her face began to droop and sag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you...backstabbing...bi....ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Selena. This is for your own good,\" Ivy found herself saying, retrieving one of the vials from the satchel Catwoman brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...I can...barely...\" Selina mumbled, only to be cut off by Ivy dumping the vial into her mouth, her senses too muted to do anything but obediently swallow. \"Don't wanna...hic....be a blob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't knock it until ya tried it,\" Harley giggled as Selina's body began to shudder. Catwoman's face, like Harley's, immediately started to swell, her chins doubling and widening out, but the rest seemed slower, somehow. Ivy wondered if it was working or not when the sound of straining leather became audible, followed by gaps and tears forming up and down Selina's tight leather outfit. She desperately tried to contain herself, covering the gaps with hands that were filling out her gloves until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Shriip!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge tear opened up right in the front and a creamy plush belly erupted from her outfit, pouring over her waist. Catwoman yelped and tried to grab at it but it quickly grew past her reach and towards the ground, and she was left whimpering as the same thing happened behind her, her plush rear end bursting out the back as her thighs tore apart her leggings like banana peels. With a final snap as her fat neck popped her collar off, Selina's growth subsided, leaving her the same size as Ivy and Harley, give or take, with her decency just barely preserved by the shreds of her outfit still sitting on her shoulders and the incredibly tight undergarments she had underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you...do to me?\" Selina mewled pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made you into a real woman,\" Ivy cooed, running a delicate hand under Selina's thick chins, pleased that her plan had gone well, a plan that was only now coming back to her. The whole idea of overthrowing Lex was a farce, a false flag designed to root out traitors, since Lex had long ago been brainwashed with the help of Mad Hatter's mind manipulation tech to willingly perform Ra's Al Ghul's bidding. Catwoman had proved to be too mercurial to be trusted, and Ra's had ordered Ivy to ensure she wouldn't turn traitor again and work with some of the Bat Family rumored to still be active in Gotham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy hadn't wanted to kill her though. Sure she didn't trust Selina, but on a good day she did rather like her, and the cat's free-wheeling attitude was something that the plant-powered supervillain found oddly endearing in spite of herself. So she decided to kill two birds with one stone, acquiring the means to grow into Gaia's proper guardian and putting a leash on the cat, a leash in the form of an obscene amount of body fat, but a leash nonetheless. It was actually the same plan she made for Harley, and would have gone through with it if the Jester wasn't so eager to grow in Mother Earth's image already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to finish your transformation!\" Ivy declared, clapping Selina on her meaty shoulder. \"Harley, let's get to our room.\" Ivy turned to see Harley's enormous read end and the clown bent over the bag full of the chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley?\" Ivy asked again, feeling a touch suspicious about her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph...yeah?\" Harley huffed, turning around and revealing...</span></div></div>",

Seeing a pod spring up to snatch the prize, Harley threw herself at the bag, smashing the flower underneath her belly with a room-shaking bang and a sickening squelch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, no!\" Ivy pleaded. \"You can't...I need...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's all about you, ain't it?\" Harley snapped, slowly getting to her feet with bag in hand. \"It's always about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was so shocked by the sudden venom Harley was spitting at her that she didn't react to try and snatch the vials back, instead simply staring in disbelief. \"Harley...what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since we beat Bats, you've always been puttin' on airs, making yourself out like a big fat queen on your throne, making me your big fat court jester!\" Harley practically growled, reaching into the satchel and taking out one of the vials of formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...H-harley...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we had somethin', Red,\" Harley continued, her face falling. \"I thought we was friends, maybe even more then friends, but all you've cared about is sitting around all fat an' happy, treating me like some lackey.\" She made a sound that could have been a small sob before popping off the cap of the formula and taking it in one swallow, dropping it and reaching for a second. Ivy's eyes widened with shock and she tried to step forward and stop her, but her wobbling, weak gait left her practically frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you think that's okay to treat your friends that way, I'm gonna see how YOU like it!\" Harley said before guzzling down another vial of formula, picking up two with the other hand. Ivy could hardly believe what she was seeing, like a surreal nightmare playing out in real time in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody's gonna boss me around anymore!\" Harley declared between great mouthfuls of the formula. \"Not you...<i>gulp</i>....not Mistah J...<i>ulp</i>....not Rashagool...<i>blorp</i>...not NO ONE!\" At long last, the bag lay empty at her feet, Harley wiping the last remaining drops of the formula from her lips before she doubled over in pain. \"Ooooh...hehe...you're gonna need a crane to move me around!\" Harley taunted as her body started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrane...nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's eyes widened with shock as she realized what was happening. Crane's fear toxin! She could feel it now, overriding her senses, keeping her in this surreal dreamscape. Reaching out with her green empathy, she could feel something different about it too; a natural ingredient, maybe to increase its potency. If she could reach out and take control of the formula using that sliver of biological matter, she might be able to seize control of the illusion and break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ivy returned to the scene, a plan formulating in her head, she looked up just in time to see Harley's massive apron of a gut start to grow anew. With one final snap, what was left of her t-shirt popped off, exposing her jiggling breasts as they swelled beyond capacity for any bra sized for humans, leaving her in just the stockings rolling down her thunderous thighs. The illusion commanded Ivy to lumber backwards in fear, and she did so as Harley took great, ponderous steps toward her, her rapid growth outpacing her elephantine footsteps. Instead of recoiling in pain, the jumbo-sized Jester giggled, her tone growing deeper as her face widened and her chins deepened, swelling together into a mass of neck fat between her bloated jowls. Ivy stumbled backwards, squeezing through the double-wide doors back to her lounge, and Harley's overflowing love-handles shattered the doorframe as she barged right on through, unleashing a seismic belch that felt like it did as much damage as her destruction of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the moment where Ivy should have been scared for her life, rendered helpless by the scenario playing out in her head, she was instead triumphant. She found the biological component in the toxin, worming her way into the compound like a parasitic invader. The skies seemed to darken and the room shivered as the vision began to bend to her will. She'd be free soon, but first?</span></div></div>",

Even if Harley's words had genuinely hit home, Ivy wondered if the real Harley felt the same? Ivy knew that she needed to make it up to her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right as Harley was going to put her planet sized asscheeks to good use, squashing Ivy like a particularly large bug, Ivy's eyes widened as she felt a stinging and painful sensation as, finally, she was getting pulled out of the dreamscape. She could even hear Harley's voice, but it was not only faint, but it wasn't as deep or heavy as this monstrous Harley that loomed before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly,  as quick as a flash, Ivy's eyes shot open, looking up, she saw Harley Quinn...the real Harley Quinn from their botched heist, as she stood over Ivy with a concerned look on her face; \"Yo! Red, god, I'm glad you're up, you've been out for hours, I was gettin' worried!\" Harley cooed as Ivy realised that Harley had taken her back to their hide-out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that flower really knocked you for six, huh?\" Ivy looked around as she breathed a sigh of relief, she was her regular self again as the normally restrained and composed villainess got a wide, beaming smile, almost Harley Quinn esque as she jumped up and threw her arms around Harley in a huge hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Harl'! I'm so glad to see you, I mean, you wouldn't believe what I've seen.\" Ivy started to ramble in a way that was oddly similar to Harley, even catching the blonde jester off guard, who was still being hugged tightly by Ivy. However, Ivy couldn't help but feel that there was a part of it that she liked, the idea of her and Harley being the Queens of Gotham was really appealing to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what surprised the green fingered young woman the most was that, deep down, there was a part that enjoyed the obese size that she was in the dream, it gave her a sense of power and, Ivy'd be lying if she didn't think that she and Harley looked good with the fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, now that Ivy is back in the real world, how does she celebrate being out of that hallucination? Does she yearn for the size that she was in the illusion, or does she just want to let Harley know how much Ivy appreciates her by taking her out for a meal?</span></div></div>",

You won't BELIEVE what I just heard 'bout Condiment King and...Pam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley stopped halfway back from her trounce back from the ladies' room, her battered smartphone hanging limply in one hand as her friend froze, midway through devouring her greasy cheeseburger. Ivy, nonplussed, kept chewing, ketchup and mustard stains dripping down her chin from her sloppy eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what happened to Condiment *huurk*-\" Ivy's eyes widened as she clapped a hand over her mouth, her stomach threatening to expel the contents of her lunch in protest as she, somehow, turned greener. Harley's eyes traveled down to the table where her own unfinished burger was sitting across from two empty plates that Ivy quickly, and pointlessly, attempted to shove off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red...did you seriously order a THIRD burger?\" Harley asked. When she got a guilty whimper from her plantlike pal, she stomped over and wrenched the burger from her hands. Ivy let out a yelp and tried to take it back, but was stopped by a second wave of nausea. \"No, you've had enough Pam!\" Harley said sternly, tossing the burger onto her own side and sliding back into the booth to finish her own meal. There was a painfully awkward silence as the patrons of Zero Hour stopped watching the commotion and returned to their own business, bringing back the usual ambience of the room as Ivy sat there, watching Harley in shameful silence before slumping down in her seat, cradling the taut sphere of a belly poking out from underneath her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, in every sense of the word, a painfully inadequate reminder of what she lost. Now that it was over, she recognized the illusion from the other day as an illusion, one of Crane's more inane experiments most likely, but she still remembered how it felt. The warm plushness coating her arms, wreathing her neck, hugging her thighs. The heavy weight to her footsteps, her gait rocking the foundations and the furnishings. The sheer SIZE.. Thinking back on it, it was an intoxicating feeling, even if it turned against her at the end. It made the real world Ivy feel like she just recovered from a plague; she felt so bony, so fragile, like a strong breeze could come along and whisk her away. And by her old standards, she was overweight! But now, merely being overweight wasn't enough for her. She wanted to be big. She wanted to be huge. She wanted to be enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't even the most shocking thing to come out of this little revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about me getting...overexcited,\" Ivy said after finally mulling over her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, totes understandable,\" Harley said with a smile. \"I get your excited, but you gotta take it slow, build up to it. You'll lose those calories if ya puke up your lunch afterwards. Just stick with two, and if you still feel hungry then we'll talk about going for three, mkay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...yeah, turns out that after Pamela confessed her newfound desire for 'bigness', not only was Harley totally cool with it, but she happened to know a bit about gaining herself and was willing to go along with her on the journey, per say. Sure the jester had been a little evasive as to <i>how</i> she knew this (\"It was a crazy idea of Mr. J's from way back when\" was literally the only explanation she got), but so long as Ivy got bigger, Quinn could get gaining tips from Trigon for all she cared. And she did feel bigger, if you counted 'bloated' as a big feeling, and Ivy knew that after the bloating would come the plushness she loved so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enough to make her feel just a little peckish as she reached to sneak some fries into her overstuffed gut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Ivy craved that feeling of enormity she experienced in that bizarre illusion, it just wasn't enough to convince her to cheat on her gains. She told herself that it would upset Harley if she drugged her, or it'd be more fun to get to that size the classic way, or even that it'd be too risky and she could do something bad to herself. All of that may have been correct, but the truth was that Pam just didn't want to put the work into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam didn't notice because of her being so focused on size, but as she and her appetite got bigger, so did her laziness. Besides some successful repeats of the ATM smash and grabs, Ivy really hadn't done much outside of tending to her plants, sleeping, and eating. Her old criminal ways just didn't have the same appeal to her as stuffing burgers into her mouth for an hour or two. Even the ever excitable Harley was starting to slow down and complain about the work that went into keeping the pair cash-solvent, even going so far as to suggest Ivy breed some plant people to do all the robberies for them, knowing that the promise of more time spent eating would get Ivy to actually get off her slowly growing butt to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe she would, Ivy considered. She had plenty of time; Batman was off hunting down Bane after the warehouse incident, the Legion of Doom pulled away a lot of the heavy hitters in Gotham, and the worst the city saw in the past six months was Kite Man knocking over a jewelry store. Things were well on track, Ivy convinced herself. Why complicate things with a silly chemical? Her desire to be huge would be enough to drive her on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, it was. As a cool spring turned into a balmy summer, Pamela Isley blossomed like she never blossomed before. Alternating between glutting herself and sleeping it off before the next chance to go to town on another buffet, the supervillain's odd appetite started turning some heads. Some people thought it was part of some scheme, an unorthodox way to boost her plant powers. Others thought she may have been going through a rough patch and had turned to comfort food to fill the void. Still others were just relieved that she was content with gorging herself rather then sending a massive carnivorous plant to gorge on their brand new Lexcorp hybrid vehicle they <i>just</i> put the down payment on. And as Ivy raced towards her first milestone, she practically relished in the conversation surrounding her weight, the whispered comments at Zero Hour, even the trashy tabloid stories that popped up every now and then. They'd REALLY have something to gossip on soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first milestone came on a balmy late summer morning. Sprawled out on her bed, Ivy woke to the sizzle of a saucepan somewhere beyond her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey wakey!\" Harley trilled from the kitchen. \"Time for breakfaaaaast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'comin,\" Ivy mumbled, rolling to her feet as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes. She let out a soft moan as she felt her belly plop heavily down into her lap. It had been the first part of her to feel that familiar sensation of heaviness, and after last night's burger buffet, it felt particularly huge today. Peeling off her greasy t-shirt, leaving her in just the usual leafy bikini top and bottoms, Pamela went into the corner of the room, where she had set up a small \"gaining lab\" to mark her progress. It wasn't much, just a chart and a pair of mirrors meeting in the corner surrounding a high tolerance bathroom scale. With halted breath, she stepped onto the scale, planting her bare feet back enough so that she could just barely see over the curve of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...three...THREE! Three hundred and five!\" Ivy clapped her hands together excitedly. Finally, after so many months, she'd reached the first goalpost. Sure it was a drop of water in the bucket that she wanted to be, but it was monumental nonetheless, officially becoming a big and beautiful fat girl. Not chubby, not curvy, just out and out FAT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlushed with excitement, Ivy took her sweet time getting dressed, enjoying all the curves and rolls of her body in the process. Much to her delight, she seemed to gain all over and stay fairly balanced size-wize. She was pleased to find her breasts had become big and heavy F cups, still perky but sitting atop a great big belly that stayed round and heavy no matter how much food was stuffed inside it these days. Luckily she could still waddle around without tipping over, thanks to the nice thick thighs that she couldn't pull her jeans up over. She happily tossed the old clothes aside, taking out a new pair of shorts 40 inches around at the waist that fit quite snugly over her thunder thighs and a butt that would spill over into the next seat. She matched it with a black t-shirt adorned with a green heart, a gift from Harley that had been far too large months ago but now just barely fit her, pinching her  dough arms at the sleeves and riding up to show a hint of belly. Ivy struck a pose, admiring her body in the mirror, but let out a small gasp as the button on her shorts suddenly pinged off, hitting the mirror with a sharp snap. The big plant lady couldn't help but laugh, her fully formed double chin hinting at a third when she moved her head just the right way, before she caught the scents flowing through the house from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawn like a woman possessed, Ivy waddled out of her room, not even changing out of the broken shorts or putting on anything else besides the T-Shirt, and caught sight of the table adorned with a truly monumental breakfast feast. Bacon, eggs, sausage, waffles, pancakes, french toast, and with buckets of butter and syrup to go with it. Ivy's mouth watered; she could practically FEEL herself growing fatter just by being near this spread. And to think, Harley used to be a bad cook!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe definitely got better though, and as Ivy went to thank Harley for such a wonderful job on breakfast, she became aware of how Harley had changed as well, going from the skinny girl who helped her realize a dream to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe she was too focused on her own bulk and obesity to really notice how big Harley had been getting, but, if anything, Harley didn't look that much smaller than Ivy. Ivy noticed Harley's weight stick around her lower-half, as opposed to Ivy's, which focused around her massive, orb of a belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's legs were like tree trunks, or maybe steel girders was more appropriate, her gut, while not on the same level as Ivy's own massive planet of a gut, it was still overhanging and in danger of knocking Ivy's breakfast off the table, her face was round and she had a second chin on her face and that eclipsed her presumably thick neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was busy engorging herself, but she couldn't help but notice that Harley had also been wolfing down a huge feast, the gargantuan, green gluttonous goddess noticed the empty plates that had been piled high and were ready to be washed. Ivy couldn't help but feel a bit of jealousy hit her, as far as she was concerned, that was food that belonged to her! She need that food to be as fat as she was in her hallucination; she needed that more than Harley did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I notice that you were eating a bit there.\" Ivy choked out, her mouth full of food as her voice, thanks to her massive bulk, sounded quite a bit deeper and huskier than before. She tried to hide a slight glare of jealousy as she looked at Harley, she couldn't help but think that all the bulk that Harley had on her frame, it should belong on Ivy's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese Ivy knew that it was wrong to be jealous of her best friend for eating, and Ivy couldn't help but admit that Harley looked amazing with her new girth, her body was a thing of beauty, almost of the level of Ivy's herself. Slowly, but surely, the jealousy and spite became replaced by a feeling of genuine pride for Harley's weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Red\" Harley's own deeper, heavier voice called out, her jowls jiggling with every word that came from the Jumbo Jester's mouth; she noticed Ivy not eating her massive feast as ravenously as Harley was expecting. Ivy took a deep breath and then decided to say something about Harley's new bulk as both jealousy and pride were battling it out to be the first thing that Ivy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ivy say about Harley's new, entrancing bulk?</span></div></div>",

Watching Harley bite her lip and avert her eyes, the Eco-friendly villain heaved herself out of the chair and sauntered over to Harley's side, leaning in close and placing a hand on her shoulder. She could practically FEEL the heat of attraction coming off the jester as she tried to look away. \"Harl, your size is nothing to be ashamed of. You're utterly <i>ravishing</i> like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'fat...\" Harley squeaked out, trying not to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know what? That just means there's more of you to love.\" Ivy finished by planting a delicate kiss on Harley's chubby cheek, eliciting a delighted squee. With a knowing smile, Pamela picked up a pastry and pressed it towards the clown's mouth. \"Now...eat up. You're a <i>growing</i> girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them giggled, then Harley took a handful of bacon (tofu bacon of course) and shoved it into Ivy's mouth forcefully enough that she automatically chewed and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We <i>both</i> are, Red,\" Harley said with a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Harley and Ivy began to expand their waistlines with renewed vigor, the world kept turning. Soon the heat waves were a distant memory and the leaves in Gotham Central Park began to fall from the trees, hinting at a cold winter to come. The Legion had, of course, been soundly defeated, and soon the usual suspects were beginning to trickle back into Gotham, followed of course by Batman himself. For better or for worse, the good and evil of Gotham were slowly getting back to business, and with a team-up between the Riddler and Two-Face taking up headlines, the conspicuous absence of the green-skinned Eco-terrorist and the Clown's main squeeze remained largely under-reported, and even then only to gossip about their strange activities in the summer, and the unusually large food orders being delivered to a certain address in Gotham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last one came not from the tabloids but from the Calculator's information network on the Unternet. It was the only hint at where Poison Ivy may have been holed up since she went off the radar the last few months, which was pretty inconvenient when you were trying to breed an invasive species of carnivorous plant to seed Themyscira with and while the two villains who arrived in Gotham well past sunset were both doctors of some intellect themselves, their botany knowledge didn't hold a candle to Poison Ivy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey, good lookin',\" slurred a drunkard stumbling out of an alleyway as the two women walked by, the shorter of the two hidden underneath a hoodie. \"Got 'ny dough? Ahm thirsty, need a dhrink...\" The drunkard grinned as the shorter lady stopped to look at him, only to turn pale as his bloodshot eyes were met by catlike slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look...\" the woman purred. \"...a <i>{meal</i>.\" She opened her mouth to bare her fangs and the drunk let out a panicked warble and dashed back into the alley. The catlike woman almost darted after him before her companion grabbed her by the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat the locals Barb, you don't know where they've been,\" the taller woman reminded her forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't <i>really</i> going to eat him,\" mewled Barbara Ann Minerva, better known as the Cheetah, as she adjusted her hoodie to reveal the black cheetah patterns across her fuzzy face. \"...not all of him anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing we need is Batman to catch us sneaking around his town,\" the other woman pointed out. \"For once could you TRY to keep a low profile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can keep a lower profile then you Dory,\" Cheetah said playfully, sticking out her tongue. Doris Zuel, significantly shorter then her usual hundreds of feet tall as Giganta, rolled her eyes. In fairness, she may have had a point, since her size-changing jumpsuit in black and orange did stand out a fair bit, even at her usual six foot one. Still, the two rogues made their way towards the address they purchased from Calculator without too much trouble from the locals despite their appearance, the tidy unassuming apartment block turned into a home and a base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad place to hole up,\" Cheetah considered. \"I'd have expected it to be covered with plants or something,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pamela, are you in there?\" Giganta called, knocking hard on the door. \"It's Dr. Zuel, I've been trying to find you for weeks!\" There was a shuffling sound from behind the door, the sound of several latches opening up before it slid open to reveal...</span></div></div>",

But she was still determined to be so much more massive than she already was; but the fact that she was getting closer and closer to her goal was showing, considering the grin on her gorgeous, round and fat face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge belly was jutting out at such a level that it was pretty much squashing up against both Cheetah and Giganta as it heaved with every noticeably heavy breath that Ivy took, her new girth was what she was wanting; but it was also taking a toll on her ability to do the simplest of tasks without being wheezing and out of breath. However, Ivy believed these to be well worth it if she could feel the feeling of being so morbidly obese and heavy, she was wearing a black t-shirt that barely fit her and was looking more like a crop top due to how much her monstrous belly was forcing it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also wore some of the biggest pair of jeans that looked like they were practically painted on, as those jeans covered her gargantuan globes of ass flesh that left two huge imprints whenever Ivy sat down and, appropriately for the plant obsessed piglet, her legs were like two huge tree trunks, which both fought for space and left Ivy waddling around as her massive legs scrapped together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam?!\" both Cheetah and Giganta called out in unison, both of their jaws practically hitting the floor at the newly obese Ivy as Ivy flashed an arrogant smirk, showing her second chin as if she was proud of her new girth; her voice was noticeably huskier and deeper due to her new neck fat, but Ivy found that it made her sound even hotter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right, girls...enjoying the view?\" Ivy smirked teasingly as her entire bulk was filling the wide door-frame of her hideout, like a solar eclipse of pure fat and blubber, Cheetah and Giganta were both completely caught off guard by the immense Ivy, but they managed to stammer out the reason for why they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we've been trying to find you\" Giganta started, trying not to be caught staring at the sheer fat covered green goddess that was Poison Ivy, she could feel the heaviness of Ivy's globular gut squash up against them and it was really distracting her, but she pressed on, no matter how invasive the Immense Ivy was to their personal space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's talk inside.\" Ivy suddenly cut her off, turning around and waddling into her unassuming domain as both Cheetah and Giganta caught the view of her jean covered, planet sized ass-cheeks wobbling like two orbs of jelly caught in an earthquake, Ivy's entire obese body was hynotising to them, as they tried to avert their eyes from the fat assed redhead as she lumbered into her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know what we want, Pamela!\" Cheetah called out in frustration at how coy Ivy was being, she wasn't the best with her people skills and she couldn't help imagine that this new, obese Ivy tasted good due to the sheer amount of heavy, quaking fat that was layering the beautiful eco-terrorist. Ivy just turned on her heel, back to Cheetah as she cockily and almost seductively waddled over, placing her fat, sausage like fingers on Cheetah's feline features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you're so cute, kitty kat.\" Ivy teased, almost daring for Cheetah to do something and things weren't helped when Cheetah was already about to get her claws out and start devouring the morbidly obese Ivy, but, before she could, something happened that caught both Cheetah and Giganta off guard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a brief moment, Giganta and Cheetah wondered if they were the only ones coming when they saw the massive banquet table set up in the room beyond the entrance. It certainly made them feel welcome; Cheetah found her attention drawn to the pile of German sausages coiled up like a tiny mountain, and while Giganta wasn't so easily distracted, she caught the whiff of homemade banana bread that briefly tempted her. Instead, Giganta took note of how green the room was, and not because of the paint. This was definitely where Ivy had been hiding long term; vines crawled up the walls, hiding the water damage with vibrant greens and floral patterns. Artificial sunlight shone through a canopy of leaves, turning what would have been a stuffy Gotham blockhouse into a comfortable indoor grove. Nimble vines even crawled up the side of the banquet table, helping to ferry different varieties of food across the table for those seated at it. The two didn't know this at the time, but Ivy's deep desire to fatten herself up had unconsciously influenced the plant life under her control, turning her home into a feeder's paradise perfect for fattening up anyone to tremendous size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that had been a double-edged sword since the Green influenced her back, and skewed her priorities towards feeding others instead of herself. And there had only been one person around to receive Ivy's generous treatment. Cheetah's eyes dilated at the even more succulent mass of meat across the way, and Giganta nearly choked when she realized what got her catlike companion so riled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-HARLEY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" huffed the mass of fat from the other side of the table. \"Barb! Dory! I didn't know....huff...ya were in town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rogues could do nothing but stare blankly, or hungrily, at the utterly unrecognizable whale that was once the infamous ditz of a clown Harley Quinn. The slender face that once adorned wanted posters was squished between two bulging cheeks and a broad chin, all sitting atop a ring of neck fat that could have served as a passable bib. A nightshirt that should have been tossed several sizes ago was squeezed around her broad shoulders, leading to hefty arms that swallowed up her elbows and made a cuff of fat around her chubby hands, both of which gently rubbed the absolute barrel of a belly that pushed her a few feet away from the table while the vines carried food to her eager maw, past the floppy breasts the size of watermelons flopping to either side of her belly. Giganta craned her neck and saw the backs of not one, not two, but <i>three</i> chairs over her meaty shoulders, holding up her immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Cheetah said in hushed tones. \"Harley, you're so....delectable!\" The enormous jester giggled, sending a wave of movement through her flabby body. The cat villainess couldn't help herself and approached Harley, trying not to drool as she saw Harley's barrel sized thighs with knee-high striped socks desperately tugged upwards towards a dent that may have been her knee at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me this is some bizzare eco-terrorist thing, Ivy,\" Giganta said to Poison Ivy as the plant villainess munched down on a pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's bizzarre?\" Ivy said coolly. \"I'm just...taking GOOD care of my friends...\" They wouldn't understand, Ivy thought to herself. That feeling, that sense of pleasure and power that came from enormity. Words couldn't describe how such a thing felt to mere mortals. If she wanted to share the experience, well...she'd show them exactly how big and powerful it'd make them feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, forget I even asked,\" Giganta conceded, throwing her hands up in the air. \"We're not here to ogle or judge-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself,\" Cheetah mumbled as she gently stroked Harley's meaty arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-we just need your help for a bioweapon against the Amazons. Something of a virulent plant strain to eat them all, and it's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley chose that moment to let out a massive belch that thoroughly derailed the conversation. Doris would have been annoyed, but instead, she had a bit of an epiphany. What if, instead of killing the Amazons, the bioweapon merely...incapacitated them? Kept them tied up for a long time? Looking at what Ivy was doing to Harley...maybe that'd be a much smarter idea to take care of Wonder Woman and her friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you like to work your magic here on some Amazons?\" Giganta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my attention,\" Ivy said coolly.</span></div></div>",

She massaged her massive stomach and felt her breathing quickening as she started to casually play with her own fat as she kept eating with gusto, her plants acting as waiters and bringing the food to their 'mother'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, however, didn't seem to realise why Cheetah was taking such an interest in her and just thought that it was a feline thing, Harley was so fat that she made Ivy look borderline 'plump' (which was an insult as far as Ivy was concerned) but part of Ivy felt a desire to be the size of Harley; but the selfish feelings melted away as Ivy continued to watch as the planet sized blonde patted and cooed over Cheetah like she was a house cat and not a dangerous super-villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here kitty, kitty.\" Harley giggled out, the slightest movement sending her fat into a fit of wild wobbles and, with each wobble of her monstrously obese body, Cheetah felt her mouth water as everything was telling her to just start gorging on this feast of fat; but she glanced over to Ivy, who was clearly ready to start using her plants to have Cheetah's head mounted on their wall as a trophy if the Wonder Woman villain ever harmed a hair on Harley's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Ivy's obesity had hindered her mobility, she didn't need that to be dangerous, she could've had her plants destroy Cheetah without Ivy even needing to heave her huge ass from her enlarged seat; Ivy however was starting to get distracted by eating, she just couldn't help herself and, even though she tried to keep focused on keeping an eye on Harley; Ivy's gluttonous need to get fatter and fatter was starting to take over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be the perfect chance for Cheetah to make her move as she felt Harley's quaking body against her own, Cheetah was starting to lose it, she <i>needed</i> to start tucking in on this Huge Harley buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...</span></div></div>",

While the Immense Ivy was in the middle of feasting on her steak and was starting to seem like in a gluttonous haze, getting tunnel vision as she felt herself getting more and more of that glorious fat that Ivy loved so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Cheetah hadn't counted on the plants, they weren't just Ivy's waiters and there to bring the rotund redhead even more food, they acted like cameras or guard dogs, there to not only protect Ivy, but protect people she cared about and that was pretty much only Harley (maybe Selina at a stretch.) so the plants noticed that Cheetah was looking more ravenous, almost as ravenous as the Jumbo Jester herself. Harley was busy rubbing her fat fingers across Cheetah as if she was a house cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's huge stomach was swinging right in front of Cheetah, the belly hang swaying almost hypnotically as Cheetah just couldn't resist her urges anymore, she was going to feast on this huge buffet of fat that Harley's heavy, quaking body would have provided her; as Barbara went in for the attack, she was suddenly tripped up by a big vine, that caught both Harley and Cheetah off guard. Cheetah was sent kissing the ground before she was dragged by her legs and held upside down in front of a glaring Ivy; this wasn't the usually confident, arrogant or smug Ivy, this was a one that was genuinely enraged as her fat, gorgeous face was glaring right at Cheetah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't really think that my babies wouldn't see what you were doing, house cat?\" Ivy's obesity meant that her powers over the plants had increased, it was no longer as easy to break their grip; it was a compensation for Ivy's lack of mobility and Ivy thought that the trade off was more than worth it, moving was so overrated whereas her new power meant that she never had to move a muscle to be treated like the Colossal Queen that she believed she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doin', Barb?!\" Harley called out, struggling to catch her breath, not only because of her insane fat levels, but because of how shocked she was that Cheetah was about to chow down on her; Ivy's plants were currently consoling Harley with belly rubs and such as Ivy's scowl of rage turned into one of pure contempt; normally, she would've just thrown this pathetic creature out of her door, she wasn't worth killing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ivy wasn't going to let this ingrate think that she could just expect Ivy's help with her and Giganta's evil scheme only to try and feast on Ivy's best (and only) friend. \"Time for a goodnight kiss\" Ivy said with a look of distain as she leaned forward, about to give Cheetah a Kiss of Death; but, before she had the chance to kill Barbara in cold blood, the gargantuan goddess of the green was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who stopped Ivy from killing Cheetah?</span></div></div>",

The immobile redhead looked over and saw that, not only was there Batman's cowl, but there was Wonder Woman's tiara, The Flash's mask, Green Arrow's quiver and, the one that shocked her the most...the Superman symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did those get there??\" Ivy again barked out as the fearful young man stammered out \"That was from your conquest of the Justice League, your highness, after you disposed of Batman, you overthrew President Luthor and wiped out the entire Justice League on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy suddenly felt an urge, an urge that she could get used to this, she ran everything, she was now the ruler of the world and there was nobody to stop her, Ivy was becoming more comfortable in the fantasy land that the flower's toxin had created for her; she wasn't even sure if this was too far off from the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy smiled, though with the flabbiness of her face it was hard to notice. Acclimatizing to the changes taking place around her, the room became more familiar; overgrown with plant life and gnarled vines to render the old structure unrecognizable beneath the foliage. She didn't have a prayer of turning around to see where she was sitting, but she recognized the feeling of a moss and leaf throne underneath her enormous rear end. She actually wondered what she was doing surrounded by so many male thralls considering her previous views, but upon a second look, she noticed the glazed look in their eyes and the vines crawling up their necks. Reduced to mindless thralls, as is their proper place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, those can be added to my collection,\" Ivy said thickly to the minion. \"But I'll be taking the...urgh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to lift her arm to get the ring on instinct before realizing that would be impossible. Even if she could have moved close enough to pick it up, her arm felt like it had a trash bag full of water hanging off of it with no muscle to speak of. Gasping at the sudden exertion, she dropped her arm onto her belly with a heavy flop, panting and sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...silly me...I forgot,\" Ivy huffed, letting out a heavy-sounding chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An understandable mistake, ma'am,\" the thrall holding the rings said brightly and vacantly. One of the vines making up her throne extended outward with a mere thought from the immobile plant woman, curling around the Orange ring and bringing it up to its master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you and I were meant to be together, hm?\" Ivy playfully said to the ring as lifted her hand slightly, letting the vine place the ring on her. \"An entire Lantern corp's power, at my fingertips!\" Ivy winced as the ring bumped against said fingertip and went no further; her fingers being much too thick and heavy to wear it normally. The arcane device hummed softly however and grew in size within seconds, easily sliding onto her sausage-width finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Pamela Isley of Earth,\"</span> an otherworldly voice said from somewhere inside her head. <span class=\"corange\">\"You want it all.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine,\" Ivy said breathlessly, her eyes glowing orange. A tingling sensation spread across her body, from her hands all the way to her feet, the decorative leaves adorning her wrists and ankles turning a fall-like orange-green, her green coloration darkening, her red hair brightening to red-orange, and her eyes altering to orange-colored irises. Power coursing through her, she felt herself raising off of her throne and for the first time in months standing on her own two feet, her cankles drooping over them as her belly brushed the mossy ground. She struggled to take a step forward still, but only because of her sheer size and not because of any weakness or lack of muscle. Laughing gleefully, Ivy floated into the air with the grace of a blue whale, the plant life lining the walls glowing with life as she indulged in her new powers, looking down on her obedient thralls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for?\" Ivy demanded. \"Food! Go!\" Her minions scurried off as Ivy landed again, just in time to feel the rumble of heavy footsteps approaching, and saw a massive round stomach walk into room before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food?\" Harley Quinn said thickly, her voice booming even in this vine covered royal chamber. Ivy found herself stunned into silence at the sight of the Jester towering over her, dressed in what appeared to be a bikini that matched her harlequinn outfit's color scheme. Her piggy eyes sunken into her puffy cheeks that fused into a huge second chin that swallowed the others into one big mass of neck fat, sitting atop her basketball-sized breasts, while her elbows had long ago sunken into the silky masses of arm fat that swallowed them, and while her huge double-belly drooped low enough to cover them, her knees had been swallowed by her enormous thighs, thicker then trees, that draped over her puffy feet below. Adding in the flowing rolls of back-fat and the utterly immense shelf of a rear end hanging behind her and it was a miracle Harley could even still walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...was about to have some food, Harl,\" Ivy said, still trying to take in the woman standing in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaay, food!\" Harley cheered, bouncing on her heels and causing the whole chamber to shake. \"Ooh, and you have ring too! Wish I could have ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy smiled, shaking her head as Harley looked at her own hands, a dull look behind her eyes. She'd been a little slow ever since Ivy had made the jester into her right-hand lady, pumping her up with Venom to make sure she could still walk and serve as her muscle, at the expense of Harley's intellect. She didn't seem to mind as long as she was well-fed, and Ivy suspected she liked being so big, standing several feet taller then most people, with a lot of muscle hiding in her bloated arms and hands and feet the size of manhole covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thoughts regarding Harley quickly flew to the back of her mind as the doors opened and a procession of her thralls entered, bearing a feast of desserts and sweets that could serve dozens, if not hundreds. Harley squealed and thundered towards a massive tiered cake, tearing off chunks to shove into her greedy mouth. Ivy chuckled lightly as she created a plantlike tendril of orange light, wrapping around a container of chocolate sauce in a ten gallon drum. She was about to pour the whole thing into her mouth when a crash came from overhead, the plants reeling from the shower of glass. Harley looked up stupidly, her mouth full of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy narrowed her eyes, recognizing the intruder at once; a loathsome superheroine who had long resisted her rule and had dared to impede on her claims as the greediest, most gluttonous woman in the universe, nearly rivaling her in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Ivy shouted, her eyes glowing with orange power. \"How DARE you intrude on my sanctum...</span></div></div>",

Glaring in frustration, Ivy was about to get involved; she wanted to put her new powers to the test as she called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley!...Let the Queen have some fun.\" Ivy called off Harley as Ivy's eyes glowed, she had a malicious, almost psychopathic smile on her fat face as she was ready to put her new powers to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

In any other situation, Ivy would have been dead to rights, a fist with the force of a cannon blast slamming into her cheek before she could even blink, but Supergirl found her blow intercepted as a thorny vine constructed from orange light shot from the ring on Ivy's bloated finger. She missed the spiky tendril by inches, shattering it with a powerful blow before two more joined it, darting back and forth to knock her from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is almost too easy...\" Ivy huffed, lifting her ring hand a couple inches as she popped donuts into her mouth with the other, smacking her lips to taunt the Kryptonian fighting off her constructs. She lifted a second donut to her mouth when she felt a powerful tug on her hand; Supergirl had used her distraction and grabbed the tentacles all at once, and while Ivy was well over a ton at this point she could still be moved easily by someone with her strength. Ivy let out a yell as her massive rear end slid off the leaf surface off her throne, landing on the ground with a colossal <i>boom</i> and knocking the food out of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ivy cried as she watched her donut bounce a few inches away, well out of the reach of her bloated fingers. \"You.......*braaaaaaaaaaap*.....you skinny little brat!\" Her eyes practically ignited orange as a massive construct burst forth from the ring, vines flowing outward from her hand as a great massive flower bulb grew and swelled. Supergirl raised her fist, ready to fight as the bulb grew to the size of a small car and blossomed, not into a beautiful flower but into a gaping maw of teeth and thorns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tropidorian Carnivore Vine...of course...\" Supergirl said to herself as two more burst from Ivy's ring, nearly filling what was left of the room with the vicious plantlike monsters. Undeterred, she flew into battle, liberally using her heat vision and fists for some aggressive weeding while Ivy unsteadily got up, propped up by helpful plant life until she was standing on her on two feet again, with the help of her stomach drooping onto the ground. As she watched Supergirl get eaten by one of the carnivore vines only to burst free and go on the attack, she got a rather sinister idea, waving her hand to create more energy tendrils, lifting her up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl meanwhile was nearing the end of her rope, bruised and battered by the vicious plants, but spurned on by spite and a desire for justice she kept going, punching the last of the vines to death as she struggled to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got any...more?\" she demanded, her voice cracking from the strain. \"I can do this...all night. Where are you, Poison Ivy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Supergirl's turn to respond to an impossibly sudden attack, and she was not nearly as successful with her countering. Frankly you wouldn't be either if you looked up and saw a mass of green flesh coming at you at high speed. The Kryptonian let out a terrified, confused sound as Poison Ivy smashed down on top of her, squashing her underneath what had to literally be a ton of ass and landing with a tremendous bang that could have been heard from Metropolis. She shimmied back and forth to make sure her full weight was applied, jiggling even more as Harley waddled over to help her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another Kryptonian dealt with,\" Ivy chuckled, looking at the Supergirl-shaped hole in the floor that was less then a third the size of her keister. \"I say this calls for another victory feast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral floors down, however, the pile of rebar and plywood stirred, and a battered, bleeding Supergirl extracted herself, shaking loose the dirt caked to her hair. She felt a pang of shame at her failure, blinking back tears as she limped away from the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Kal,\" she whispered quietly. \"I wish I could do more, but...she's too strong...too fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, almost as if by fate, Supergirl picked up a low bubbling sound with her superhearing. Following the noise, she turned a corner to face a large metal tank, filled with a thick green liquid sloshing around. Tilting her head, she used her super-vision to examine the molecular structure of the substance, not quite recognizing it outside of a similarity to Venom. switching to X-ray vision, she traced the piping connected to the tank, leading upstairs then away from Ivy's throne room to a little side area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley's room, it's gotta be,\" the Kryptonian reasoned, remembering the immense harlequin she squared off with earlier. Had she been dosed with some weird version of Venom, to make her stronger and fatter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she had an idea. A very stupid idea but if it could help her beat Ivy and avenge her cousin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that Ivy would be too busy gloating to hear her rip the tank off the wall, Supergirl lifted the nozzle of the tank to her lips...</span></div></div>",

Her already ample belly let out a huge churn as Supergirl felt sick, she tore the nozzle from her lips and blasted out a huge, thunderous belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"BWAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRPPPP!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the belch was so powerful that it caused the room to shake, Kara breathed heavily as she groaned and gurgled, staggering like she was drunk as she placed one of her meaty hands onto the wall as she clutched her gargantuan gut and tried to ignore the pain that she was feeling. Kara clenched her eyes shut and felt the super serum work on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was painful like she couldn't describe as she gritted her teeth and felt her obese body wobble like jelly in an earthquake, but her gut was now even bigger than usual, she felt her already tree trunk like thighs get even larger as Kara felt even more powerful. She staggered to the door, lumbering and breathing heavily thanks to her new size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't really think of the consequences of what she just did, she bulldozed herself through the extremely narrow hallways as she looked like she outweighed Harley by at least 200lbs. Sweat was forming on Kara's face as she squeezed herself down to find Ivy. She heard Ivy's piggish noises getting louder as she came to the set of double doors that were covered in vines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"IVY!!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl bellowed as she used her new strength and her battering ram of a belly to smash her way through the doors, sending the heavy doors flying like projectiles as she saw the obese Orange Lantern that was Poison Ivy. She was lazily sitting on her throne as there was enough discarded food tins to feed a whole city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was so caught off guard by Supergirl that she nearly choked on the massive steak she was chomping on, however, the size of the Supersized Supergirl didn't stop her from choking and forcing the steak down. The smug and supersized Ivy just lazily leaned back and massaged her planet like belly without a care in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph...what's up? Well, I have to admit, you've never looked better, you finally look like what a real woman should look like.\" Ivy even blew Supergirl a coy kiss, which caused the venom enhanced Supergirl to snarl as she was about to lay into the immobile tyrant who had slaughtered anyone in her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...</span></div></div>",

The first thing she noticed was that there were some dead plants on the kitchen table.\" Ivy would never let a plant die something must be very wrong\". Thought Harley, the next thing she noticed was how many fast food wrappers and pizza boxes  were laying about the place not just in the kitchen but all over the apartment. Harley had a hunch she had figured out what had happened but was hoping she was wrong. She made her way down the hall where Ivy's room was and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       There was Ivy, she was turned around so Harley couldn't see anything but her backside and boy was it a backside. Ivy's butt was huge it had easily doubled in side and she now had a decent amount of back fat. \"Red\"? Ivy turned around giving Harley a good look at the easily over 250 pound Ivy. Her bra could barely contain her huge breasts which threatened to break loose any second. Her arms and legs were very pudgy and jiggled with every step, but none of her other assets compared to her belly which was ginormous. The jiggly paunch mesmerized Harley as she walked forward. \"Harley! So good to see you\" said Ivy as she wrapped her arms around Harley. Harley felt Pamela's boobs press against hers and her giant stomach swallowing her own. \"Jesus Red, you've gotten kinda fat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"I know\" said Ivy\" and I'm loving it!\". \"Excuse me?\" \"I love being fat!\" \"Why? How could you love being this massive? Asked Harley. \"Well a few weeks ago I was out eating and I realized my uniform was really tight around my stomach\". Ivy said as she dug into another pizza box. \"so I went home and began to examine myself. I realized how chubby I was, love handles, bigger boobs, no thigh gap, a butt that jiggled an obscene amount, and a slight double chin. At first I was going to do something about it but instead I just ordered a pizza. I've let it get to this point and honestly I'm enjoying it\" just then the girls heard a RIIIIIIIIIIIP!!! Ivy turned around to see her but had ripped a hole right through the middle of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Red this isn't healthy!\" Remarked Harley. \"Soon you'll be to big to move!\" \"Don't knock it til you try it.\" Ivy said. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Asked Harley as Ivy looked at her she couldn't help but think there was something arousing about being that big.<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

She hadn't found any truly good places to hit, and thusly was sitting on a pile of priceless gems and other trinkets. So all she had really done for the past 5 weeks was sit on her ass and eat. For obvious reasons, she got quite the potbelly, which was her current problem with getting her suit on. \"Come..on! Why *huff* won't you... *huff* FIT!\" Selina yelled as she, as if by miracle, got the zipper over her stomach. Before she could celebrate, she hit her second roadblock, her boobs. Already well endowed, Selina had the top of her catsuit already enlarged. Given her flabbier form however, she once more struggled for a good 3 or so minutes to get it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting her wardrobe malfunctions settled, Catwoman ascended to the top of her apartment in Gotham City. Readying herself for her next target, an old gold evaluating shop just closing, she caught whiff of the most intoxicating food she'd ever smelled. Looking around, Selina spotted a car driving away from a blacked-out bakery, presumably taking some of the goods home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if completely forgetting her original goal, Selina ran across the rooftops to get herself some of those baked goods. At least, if she were thin as she were 5 weeks ago. She slowly jogged, if that, across the rooftops, abandoning them halfway and taking the fire escape down to the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 30 minutes later, Selina finally managed to make it into the bakery, known as East Gotham Cakes and Other Goods, and slipped in after lockpicking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Selina was greeted by the greatest assortment of pastries she had ever seen. Getting right down to work, she dug right in to a box of cupcakes, savoring every delicous bite of frosting. After that, she went after the choclate cake in front of her. Not even bothering with a plate, forks or the like, she shoveled handful after handful of cake with one hand, the other rubbing her distended belly that was straining on the fabric of her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Selina sat licking her fingers for any remnants of her feast. \"So *urp* good. Now how will I get some more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by luck, Selina saw a poster hanging out front. Help wanted, it read, taste tester needed. Licking her lips at the prospect of getting paid to eat this, Selina grabbed a box of cupcakes and returned to her apartment, excited for the next day.</span></div></div>",

What the hell, she thought, plenty of women are wearing skimpier outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile riding the bus to the bakery, Selina got her fair share of looks as she sat down, no doubt due to her larger form. Ignoring them, she looked out the window for the rest of the ride. Finally arriving at the East Gotham bakery, she walked inside, hips swaying, hoping to fall back on what sex appeal she still had. The interview was nothing special, age, experience, why she wanted the job, etc. Not even five minutes  after the interview had started, the man interviewing Selina knew this was the best he'd get and hired her on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling confident with her success, Selina rewarded herself, getting a two-scoop ice cream cone on her way back to the bus stop. She didn't start her new job until Tuesday, she still had four days until then. The bus soon arrived as she hopped aboard, mind abuzz with her options. Snacking on a bag of chips as she flipped through the channels, Selina found little interest in current events. That is, until the Gotham Museum Egyptian Exhibit's advert came on.  What stirred Selina's interest the most, was the featured statue of Bast, goddess of cats. It was more work, which was always good, and who knows, maybe she'll burn off some of her flab with a good ol' fashioned heist.</span></div></div>",

Instead, she hung onto  the edge for dear life and shimmyed herself to the fire escape, where she took a few minutes to catch her breath. Realizing how obviously out of shape she was, Selina reached into her back pocket, and pulled out her grappling hook, knowing she'd never climb the museum on her own. Climbing down to the streets, Catwoman silently rushed past the darkened Gotham streets to the museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the lock on the backdoor, Selina crept her way ever so quietly up the stairs to the rooftop. Seeing her goal in sight, the museum's uppermost part, she readied her hook. Throwing it well and landing it, she began to climb.

She then spoke to Batman in a seductive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Fat Cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat put her arms behind her head, pushing out her round chubby belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman was clearly taken by surprise by this as a faint blush overtook his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, F-Fat Cat.... Uh...... You're still stealing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat chuckled sensually at Batman's newfound nervousness as he swung her hips sexually walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Batman, you don't think I'm sexy anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat rubbed her hands all the way down her chubby body as she did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or..... You think I'm sexier now than I've ever been... That's it, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat could see where Batman's eyes were going as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm so much sexier with this big, round, soft, chubby belly, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat reached Batman and, standing opposite him, drew his hands to her belly. Batman began rubbing her belly in a general circular motion and, as Bruce continued to rub Selina's exposed belly, she decided to..</span></div></div>",

Why I am not surprised?\", Circe said looking down on me from her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, killing Wonder Woman isn't an easy thing to do\", I shot back in defense of myself. I knew I failed, I always did. I've been trying to kill Diana for years, yet always seem to come up short. But I really didn't need some wizard bitch rubbing it in. My sore muscles and possibly broken bones were enough of a reminder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly. Yet I figured you'd find a way with your freedom on the line. Guess you really are as inept as they say\", she rebutted with her signature condescension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who you calling inept Harry Potter!? Last time I checked, you couldn't kill Wonder Woman either. And what the hell do you mean by 'with my freedom on the line'\", I snarled out through gritted teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calling you inept, Cheetah!\", she stood up from her chair, walking down the steps to face me head on. I never realized just how tall she was, especially in heels. I was eye to eye with her breasts, as they sat mere millimeters from my nose. She looked down on me from the high ground and I couldn't help but feel small. \"And true, I haven't beaten Diana yet, but I've never been humiliated by her like you are on a constant basis. I'm not a loser like you Minerva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to lose control, growling at every critical work that shot from her purple-painted lips. When she called me a loser, I snapped and sprang at her, claws and teeth ready to tear her to shreds. Yet before I could touch her, I was caught in a field of purple magic, frozen in place like a statue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only weak minds are inflamed by insults Barbara. And you are by far the weakest I've ever know; and I've been around for a long time\", I could feel my blood boiling, unable to respond in my current state. \"But you needn't worry about that for much longer. My new job for you doesn't require much brain power\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released me from my lunging position and I feel to the floor beneath her. \"New job? You must be out your bloody mind if you think I'll work for you again.\", I said as I pulled myself up, feeling as if all the pains from my fight with Diana had been amplified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm afraid you don't have much of a choice. Remember the magic contract I had you sign? I would break you out of Belle Reve and you would kill Wonder Woman for me. Then I would grant you your freedom. I held up my end of the bargain. But you're still short on payment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then I'll kill Wonder Woman. I just need time to recover and I'll try again\", I said dismissively as started making my way to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Barbara, you don't get to try again. This was a one-time offer, which you would have known if you actually read the contract. You really are a ditz, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You send me back to Belle Reve? See if I care.\", I kept walking until I reached the door at the far end of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. You see, I'm not going to send you back to prison. What would be the fun in that?\", she said with a twisted smile as two axes dropped in front of the door to block my exit. The two large minotaur statues turn out to be real monsters. They looked down at me and I was forced to back away. \"The contract states that if you are unsuccessful in your attempt to kill Diana, which I assumed you would be, your custody turns over from Belle Reve to me. And considering you still have 36 consecutive life sentences to serve, I now own you; forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm your slave now?\", I said with shove and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wanted another slave, I could make one. Being a magical dictator of an island of monsters is lonely work. I recently read somewhere that having a companion can do wonders for the psyche. So I decided to get a pet. And you, Kitty Kat, are purrfect for the role\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I am! If you think I'm gonna roll over and be your little plaything, you've got another thing coming witch\", I said with as much fury as I could muster. I started to charge at her, but I was instantly frozen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad kitty. It's important for you to know you don't have much choice in the matter. However, I promise I will make your stay comfortable. Most people would kill to be pampered by a goddess for the rest of eternity. But it seems you may need some convincing\", and with the wave of her hand, a magical collar strapped itself around my neck. Once it fastened, I experienced the worst pain of my life. It felt like I was being choked, shocked, and squashed all at once. The pain was indescribable as I shouted out and crumbled to the floor. Yet with another wave of her hand, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, did that hurt?\", she said with mock sympathy. \"I hope so. This spell was designed to keep slaves in place. Any time you act out, disobey, or do anything unbefitting of a royal pet; you get to feel that pain again for a random amount of time. Could last a second, an hour, for five years. However long it takes for you to get in line. Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to respond, but all that came out was a defeated meow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, another side effect of the spell is the loss of speech. I tweaked it change your words with cat sounds. A stroke of genius if I may say. Now get down on your hands and knees. Cats don't stand up, especially not dumb cheetahs like yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled out of my heap and stood on my hands and knees. I had never felt so humiliated in my life. But I had to do what she said. The pain of disobeying was far too great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the rest of your life Kitty Kat\"</span></div></div>",

Circe just froze me and activated the collar every single time with her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when I thought that my humiliation couldn't get any worse Circe spoke the words that wold haunt me for the rest of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freezing you with magic whenever you try to is nice, but it seems that even with the help of my magic I can't keep my eyes on you 24/7... so we'll just have to make it next to impossible for you to escape no matter how hard you try.\" She spoke this with an evil smile and waved her hand around me. At first I thought she was gonna conjure up a leash or a giant cat carrier... but instead large amounts of meat were served on equally large dishes around me, these meats ranged from conventional beef, chicken, turkey, mutton, and pork, to exotic meats such as duck, and bison. There were even various helpings of seafood just as large in portion and diverse in variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheetahs are carnivores right?\" Circe mocked me in her condescending tone. \"You must be starving my little kitten. You know how pampered pets get when they're over fed.\" I knew instantly what she had in mind, needless to say I wasn't exactly thrilled by this my figure was going to be ruined. Forgetting that she used a spell to suppress my speech. All that came out was a \"Meow\" when I opened my mouth a very large steak was shoved into my mouth felt like it as an 8 ounce one that was extremely thick but oddly easy to chew, after swallowing it Circe gave me an ultimatum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not cruel enough to rob my not so little kitten the freedom to choose what she is fed. So what's it gonna be fish or regular meat? Just bat your paw at the one you wish to be fed with. Choose neither and I will feed you both until I'm forced to use my magic to prevent you from exploding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no alternative I played her sick little game, my one saving grace was that \"mind control\" was not listed in her magical abilities.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr. Satanna, an insane animal themed surgeon supervillain, was a bit put out and not just from being in a body cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving sworn herself to avenge her temporary disarming by Power Girl, the good or rather Evil Doctor, had put a great deal of time, money and energy into getting a hold of some kryptonite to defeat her nemesis once and for all. Unfortunately, this led only to the discovery that the dimensional displaced Kryptonian was totally immune to this universe's kryptonite, which had led to another humiliating defeat and eight months of jail. Another half a year had passed before Satanna could get her hands on some out of universe alien space rock, which was difficult to find even on the blackest of black markets. Maybe she should have asked more questions, specifically why the kryptonite was red instead of the familiar green and what exactly it was supposed to do, but anger had clouded her judgement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuilding the red rock into a laser cannon and then robbing a bank in Power Girl's home town of New York had been the perfect way to get the blonde bombshell in her sights. A burst of red energy had slammed into the flying brick of a heroine and for a bare second Satanna had exulted in the thought that Power Girl would be crippled by pain and weakened, perhaps permanently reduced to a pathetic human pining for her powers. Instead she'd had the gun ripped out of her hands and dashed against the wall, shattering the priceless kryptonite, and then been knocked through the wall by a still very much super powered PG. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Satanna thought as the EMTs wheeled her into the ambulance, it had to have been done something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So doc, what's the damage?' Karen asked, the tall, tan, muscular and busty blonde perched atop a medical exam table in the Justice Society's HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, tests show that the Red Kryptonite was from Earth 2, meaning that it had to have had an effect on you, I'm just having trouble figuring it out,' replied Dr. Midnight, blinded crimefighter and medical genius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, I don't like thinking about home much, but it could do some weird stuff there, give you new powers, shrink you to the size of a pea, de-age you,' Power Girl shivered at the last one as she floated effortlessly off the table, 'still the flight seems to work and given you couldn't draw blood I've got the durability still and I can still hear everything, use the X-ray vision, freeze breath and everything else.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All true, but it could have a delayed effect,' Dr. Midnight replied thoughtfully, 'I'd take it easy for the next few days at least, don't say fly out over the ocean in case your powers suddenly cut out. In a week we'll do a test of your powers to see if anything's changed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thanks for the tip, I'll be sure not to do anything too strenuous,' Karen said with a wink, both knowing she'd leap into danger at a moments notice powers or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren felt hungry as she shot out of the JLA headquarters, did a quick aerial lap to spy out any serious crimes and finding none swung smoothly into her apartment where she ordered a pizza. Hunger wasn't unusual for her, the Kryptonian's powers and energy might come from the yellow sun but her stomach still gurgled after a few hours of being empty. And her tummy gurgled a lot, often downing a half dozen brats at a regular lunch or a couple large pizzas for dinner. She was a very large woman, 6'1 in stocking feet and a hundred eighty pounds soaking wet, but not as big as her appetite should have suggested. In truth she didn't deserve her statusque appearance, bar the superhuman exertions she often did, given the amount of calories, grease and saturated fat she consumed every day. But her supercharged metabolism meant her arms and shoulders bulged with tightly defined muscle, her abs were completely ripped and her long legs and full rear end looked like she did a hundred squats every morning. Her flawless bronzed skin actually did glow at a low level when she utilized her powers, all her totally straight teeth were completely white and her perfect bangs were never disheveled. Indeed, the only excess weight was in Karen's massive mammaries, a pair of pert, perfect Fs that absorbed every stray calorie her body didn't decide to just burn off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that's how it usually went, but from now on things were going to be increasingly different. Had Karen known that as she padded to her ringing door wearing only a tight white tee and booty shorts she wouldn't have touched anything but salad ever again, but she was too painfully hungry to even consider that the red kryptonite might have set her metabolism from super powered to super size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Keep the change,' PG told the delivery boy as she handed him a twenty, seizing the two pizza and breadstick boxes from his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, its thirty five,' the teen answered, tearing his eyes off the practically see through T shirt and the large nipples poking up through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Since when has a large and bread been more than twelve?' Karen demanded, moving her hand to her hip and making her boobs bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Since you ordered two large meatlovers with stuffed crust and double extra cheese, cheezy bread, iced desert bread and a two liter of mountain dew,' the boy answered struggling to make eye contact and hide his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh, I don't remember that...but it sounds right,' the ravenously hungry woman said as she turned around to fetch her wallet, 'and don't look at my ass when I walk away.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she'd fetched another twenty and a five, Karen was too hungry to think about how the kid's eyes had been riveted to her curvy caboose. Instead she practically slammed the door in his face and started eating, using super speed to lay out the feast atop her counter. Each slice of greasy, meaty, extra cheesy pizza had eight hundred kilocalories in it and she devored sixteen of them as fast as she could chew, barely stopping to breathe. Sauce splashed across her white tee and grease got on her lips, but she could only think about the sweet taste of soda to release the saltiness of the meat. Twisting off the cap she chugged the entire two liters in a few seconds flat, before following it up with devouring the cheesy bread and its cinnamon sugar coated friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA meal that would have been unhealthy for four people to share had just entered Karen's stomach, nearly twenty thousand calories or eight pounds of fat once digested and distributed. Her stomach, wash board flat and capable of reflecting missile fire, bulged outwards so far she looked several months pregnant. It was a big meal even for Kara, who did oft make a pig of herself, but while it usually filled her to capacity, today she felt a curious sense of unfulfillment. She wanted something sweet...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blare of her 6 am alarm awoke Karen from her very deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleary blue eyes opened and she pawed out blindly for the button, finding it just as she noticed her hand was sticky. Sitting up with a grunt, the Kryptonian noticed most of her body was in fact sticky. She was wearing the white T from the night before, but its cotton surface was covered in pink stains, as were her hands and as she licked her lips face. Only that her tongue tasted strawberry prevented her from fully panicking, but she was more than a bit alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh, is this what being hung over feels like?' the super heroine asked herself, dragging herself out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMornings were often difficult for someone who spent all night crime fighting, mentally if not physically. But this morning Kara truly felt like shit, it was a real effort to pull herself from between the cozy sheets and get up. She'd no memory of last night beyond the first bite of pizza, yet it was clear as she glimpsed the tower of empty ice cream cartons and pizza boxes that her initial gorge hadn't been enough for her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Might have overdone it just a bit...,' she admitted gingerly, stepping into the bathroom, 'Okay, maybe a bit more than that...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at the super heroine in the mirror was a wreck. Her eyes were bleary and her normally clear face was greasy looking in a way that threatened acme, while there were ice cream stains around her lips and cheeks. Further stains covered her night shirt and panties, clearly showing she'd chowed down with out any decorum the last night at all. Her stomach was sore and tender to the touch, stuffed with food it bulged outwards noticeably to the point that there were red lines on her lower abdomen from her snug shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo most of 21st century America, thick wasted and triple chinned as it was, being a bit bloated wasn't anything unusual, especially after a feast that could bench a professional athlete for a season through the fat content alone. But to PG this was a first, no matter how much she'd eaten her stomach had stayed flat as a board and hard as a rock. Now it wasn't just sore, but notably sticking out from the food it was digesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jeez Kara,' the busty blonde said to herself, 'you're lucky you've got your super metabolism or else you'd have to worry about getting fat...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off in mid sentence, scanning herself with an exacting and merciless eye. X-ray vision meant she'd no need to disrobe but she did so anyway, casting aside the booty shorts and t in a flash of super speed. Power Girl twisted and flexed, going into poses to show herself from every angle: she stretched out her belly, stuck out her booty and jiggled her breasts. From her calves to her neck she ran her fingers over her body, non to gentle caresses and pinches everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit, shit, shit,' the head of StarCorp swore to herself, clearly unpleased by what she saw and felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her life Karen had been as fit as a fiddle. Her belly flat, her limbs slim and firm, her huge breasts high and her butt taught as a drum. She'd been voted as the hottest superheroine alive more than once and while she didn't like being fapped over, it could have been worse. Now, she'd admit that she still had a body that most women would envy, but there were some changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off she'd clearly lost a good deal of muscle tone. Her abs weren't visible anymore and wouldn't be even without the bulge, indeed the bulge might be a new feature. Her shredded calves and rock hard thighs had lost much of their muscular contours, instead of the legs of a sprinter or power runner they looked like those of an athlete who had spent the off season at the buffet table instead of in the weight room. There was a slight layer of fat over the usually fit limbs and her thighs had started to bulge a bit at the tops. Nor had her ripped arms been spared. PG had long ago come to like her bulging biceps and cut triceps, but they no longer naturally bulged. Even when flexing they were clearly smaller and softer, nor did she like the look of the soft deposit of fat under her forearm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bigger change was her ass. Gone were the pert, perfect, badly under appreciated cheeks of a hyper fit woman, one who did lunges like they were second nature. Overnight they'd gotten softer, lower, flabbier, resembling the ass of a woman who ate like a pig with no thought of her figure. She could indeed pinch an inch all over her rear end and felt it jiggle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thanked Rao that her tits seem unaffected. An odd thought perhaps, but the blonde bombshell didn't want them getting any bigger if she could help it. She cupped the heavy F cups, glad to see at least one thing unchanged, then before her eyes they bulged out. Fat rapidly accumulated in her chest, the already giant Fs going to full on Gs. Her aereola's stretched out, the nipples lost a bit of their upright point, thin stretch marks appeared at their corners and with horror she felt her rack sag just a bit, gravity pulling them straight down. Just as they did, a painful spasm of hunger struck her belly, strong as a punch by Bizarro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, oh hell no!' the Kryptonian gasped, horrified at seeing her figure bulge before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned, pressing her legs for a jump that would launch her into flight. She'd dash into some clothes, and jet out of her apartment and back to the Society's headquarters. Or that was the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the familiar rush of flight, Kara felt only the pull of gravity. She flat on her stomach, the cold bathroom floor driving the wind from her and sending an unfamiliar jolt of pain through her naked body. She groaned, pushing herself up and surprised by the amount of effort that took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No flight, ugh, no strength, uff,' she said, resting her hands on her slightly wider hips, 'and no powers. Not a good day. I've gotta get some help.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emergency' was the text that Atlee got from her friend Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slender, sporty girl would do anything for her friend/mentor and padded off the rest of her shift to another waitress. The dark haired earth controller didn't really need the job anyway and helping out the woman who had introduced her to earth was way more important to her. Changing quick and pulling out a stone from the earth to stand on she jetted over to Kara's apartment, leaving the rock on the roof and letting herself in with a spare key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'PG? You alright?' Atlee asked, alert for danger as she entered the apartment, which was normal save for a tower of empty pizza boxes and ice cream dishes, 'where are you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In the bed room,' came a cry, 'sorry...I ...I didn't hear you come in.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not hear me come in?' Atlee asked to herself, aware her friend could hear a mouse sneeze a state over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Terra opened up the bedroom door, her jaw falling open as she did so to see a naked, out of shape Kara trying to force her chubby breasts into a too small bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she'd met her, Kara had been fit, fantastically fit despite eating so much shit that Terra had had to take up aerobics to keep her own figure in hand after their weekly pizza nights. Now it seemed all of Power Girl's fatty chickens had come home to roost and in only a few days! Gone were her chiseled cheek bones and sharp jaw, the heart shaped face now rounded and puffy. Her bare arms jiggled and wobbled instead of rippling with muscle, looking like they were more accustomed to lifting donuts than oil derricks. Ripped abs had disappeared beneath a new starter belly, the beginnings of a spare tire around her once tight waist. Her high, pert butt had gotten lumpy and low, the rear of an office worker instead of a super heroine. Her long, firm legs had lost most of their shapeliness and gotten some stretch marks on her newly rubbing thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest of all was how Karen's gravity defying rack had grown even larger, clearly at least a cup size by how it oozed over her F cup bra. PG let out a not very powerful squeek as she saw her friend ever and fell down onto her bed gracelessly, the bra popping off with a snap of overloading clasps as she did. Pulling the still warm garment from her face, Atlee glimpsed her friends once firm tits sagging down before two soft hands covered the stretched aereolas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kara...what happened to you?' Atlee stammered, trying to ignore how monstrously horny her naked, out of shape friend was making her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I...don't know,' the Kryptonian moaned, 'I got hit with some red earth 2 kryptonite yesterday, then ate like a pig, now I've put on forty pounds, lost most of my muscle tone and all of my powers. What the hell am I going to do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Atlee took a hold of her friend, silently marveling at how soft she was, 'Its alright, we'll fix it, we'll go to...'</span></div></div>",

The sun had risen a few short hours ago, but only now had the intrepid reporter for<i> the Daily Planet</i> begun to rise out of bed. She stepped into a pair of slippers and made her way to the kitchen. Standing over the oven was her husband, Clark Kent, dressed in a blue T-shirt and khakis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Lois,\" he greeted her cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin',\" she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast's almost ready. Just need a few more minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois nodded, still groggy. She shuffled over to the counter and poured herself a cup of coffee. It had been a long night at work, and unlike her husband, the light of the sun was not enough to assuage her need for sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're home early,\" she said. Lois sat down at the breakfast table. \"What's the occasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark hovered over to Lois with a plate stacked high with pancakes. He set the plate down in front of her and kissed her on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought you'd enjoy a Kent-style breakfast.\" Clark smiled. \"It also helped that I wanted you to have a happy Valentine's Day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois almost on her coffee. Clark's face twisted with concern, but Lois raised a hand to stop him from trying to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what today is?\" Lois asked, dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't forget, did you?\" Clark teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, of course I didn't,\" Lois began, which earned her a quizzical look from Clark. \"... Maybe a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark smiled sympathetically. \"Well, you've been pretty swamped with work, lately. All those op-ed pieces on the election...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, tell me about it. I haven't been able to leave the office in weeks. Just as soon as I finish one piece about one candidate saying something sexist, another candidate shows up and says something racist. It's ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark reached over and gave her a hug. \"I know. I can hear them right now. It's not much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I finally got time off. The primaries were killer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I've had to carry you home from the office for three nights straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think what matters,\" Clark said, \"is that you get something to eat and ignore politics for today.\" He grabbed a knife and fork from the drawer and handed them to Lois. \"Don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois looked at the plate of pancakes before her. They looked delicious\u2014fluffy and streaming, with drizzled in syrup and with a dollop of whipped cream on top\u2014and Lois could not wait to dig in. Seeing Clark's pancake breakfast in front of her was enough to wake her from her reverie and make her stomach grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Lois agreed, and tucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark chuckled. \"Someone's hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an understatement. She hadn't had a proper meal in a week\u2014just a cup of coffee in the morning and a couple of snacks in between. Lois was starving, and she had every intention of licking the platter clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the back of her mind, Lois knew that her poor eating habits had taken a toll on her figure. Her lower calorie intake had meant that her body would store more calories than it would use, and when she did eat, she would have a tendency to overeat. The result was that Lois had put on a bit of weight over the past few weeks. It wasn't very noticeable in her flannel pajamas and one of Clark's old Superman shirts, but Lois could tell that her belly was much softer than it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it did little to keep her from devouring the large plate of pancakes Clark had made for her. A plate that might've been a bit <i>too</i> large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...\" Lois moaned. She leaned back in her chair and cradled her belly, which had bloated up a bit from having 10 pancakes stuffed into her stomach. \"That was heavenly.\" She craned her neck towards her husband. \"But now I feel bad about not getting you anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark beamed. \"Just the fact that you liked my cooking is enough for me,\" he said earnestly. Suddenly, his face turned grim. \"There's trouble in Suicide Slum,\" he said.

When Clark still hadn't returned, she made her way to the couch and turned on the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Metallo seems to have gotten the upper hand on Super--This just in, it looks like John Henry Irons, AKA Steel, has just entered the fray,\" Jimmy Olsen, news anchor, reported. Lois's fears were assuaged now that she knew Clark had some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's Superman. Of course he's fine,</i> she reassured herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to the report a bit longer, Lois switched off the TV. By now, her belly was far less bloated. It was still larger than it had been before the primaries began, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get this under control,\" she mused to herself, patting the tiny bulge. She made her way to the bathroom, pulled out the scale, and stepped on. </span></div></div>",

If an assignment was engrossing enough, she'd end up gaining or losing a few pounds, depending on how active it required her to be.

The top she picked out-\u2014a powder-blue T-shirt\u2014fit well enough (even if it was a bit tight and rode up her belly a little), but the first few pairs of pants she tried on were too tight to button. Sighing, Lois dug deeper into her closet and pulled out a pair of black leggings\u2014her fat pants.

He brought his hands forward to reveal an orchid and a 5-pound box of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Valentine's Day, Lois,\" Clark said, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois couldn't help but smile in return.

And while staying sedentary on the couch and watching Netflix shows may not be the most conducive way to burn calories, Lois would remind herself that she was on holiday and would worry about that \"later,\" opening another bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was, of course, that Lois's belly grew.

He hadn't known why he'd never thought of something like this before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManta had tried many things against Aquaman. But truly, it always boiled down to trying to kill the monarch and destroy Atlantis. But he'd been too straightforward and too simplistic. So Manta had gone for a more...insidious and subtle approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd become aware of the Trench, a branch of Atlanteans who were far different than the norm. Savage, primal and predatory, the Trench required to eat twenty to thirty times their own weight to survive. Their hunger drove them to eat just about anything they could get their webbed hands on, even going as far to attack on the surface world just to get enough to food to sate them. That had interested him and with painstaking effort, Manta had tracked some of them down and captured one. He'd then taken the creature to several geneticists that owed him a few favors. He had them use the captured Trench to create a customized mutagen.  Anything that was subjected to it would develop an intense need to feed, much like the Trench but even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManta's first thought was to infect Aquaman himself but he decided against it. Too easy. He wanted Aquaman to truly suffer. Turning him into a crazed creature devouring everything in sight was simply not enough. Instead, he targeted the king's wife, Mera. The reasoning was simple: with Mera becoming a creature of ravenous hunger he'd ultimately for Aquaman's hand, making him choose between the safety of his kingdom or his wife. The ravenous hunger that would claw at Mera would force her to feed and would thus have to be sated constantly. Naturally, he'd expect Aquaman to try and find a cure but that situation would quickly become unsustainable as Mera would require more and more and Atlantis would have to devote many resources just keep her contained and satisfied as they searched for a cure. Given Mera's own highly destructive capabilities, should she go on a hunger induced rampage, she'd would utterly devastate the undersea kingdom and maybe even the surface world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManta gave a dark chuckle. Aquaman would be forced to watch as his wife devolved into a hungry, unstable predator. Now, Manta didn't know exactly how much the situation would escalate or what Aquaman would do in the end, but he was confident that the sea king would be forced into some sort of unwinnable situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne he did know, was that he'd have fun watching it all play out. He'd already tagged Mera with mutagen some time ago while she was alone and a small ways away from Atlantis. It should be taking effect any time now...</span></div></div>",

No \"Wonder Woman gained 50,000 pounds in one day\" stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Nudity is allowed, but try and keep it tasteful. No sex though, it just brings about bad things and bad writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Profanity is also allowed, but keep it in moderation. Wonder Woman doesn't swear like a sailor in the comics, and she shouldn't here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Stick to the comic book versions of the characters. The DCAU and Teen Titans were both great, but I think we've all seen enough WG Fiction about the both of them for one life time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Write your characters in character.
