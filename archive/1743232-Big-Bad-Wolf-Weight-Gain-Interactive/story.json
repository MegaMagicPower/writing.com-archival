Unless of course a big fat wolf was taking advantage of your exceptional hunting skills to lounge around and eat all day. lacking the size to fend him off, the big brown mooch seems to be a permanent problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sorry did I say mooch? (sorry, forgot who this was really about...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last several months the wolf had been living off the foxes meager meals, first taking advantage of his kindness by feigning a twisted ankle, then just muscling in on any meals he saw fit to eat (ALL of them). Eventually the fox just caught his dinner, then several more small animals to bring back to the lazy brown wolf who was taking up his entire den, SOMETHING had to give. so the fox spent the whole day looking, searching for anything that could help rid him of his \"parasite\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen he happened upon the solution, off in a far corner of the sunny woods, hidden from most of the other woodland residents. \"Thats IT! I'll take him to the...\"</span></div></div>",

He had been there before, though it was a long time ago, before the wolf had started blocking off his meals. He grinned. This would be perfect! If the fox took the wolf to the sheep farm, he wouldn't have to make any more meals for him. There were enough sheep in there to feed a dragon, or something larger! And, if the wolf stuck around, maybe the farmer would catch him! Chuckling softly, the fox started his plan. The next morning, as he was talking, as regular, to the strict wolf, he mentioned the place. The wolf's ears perked up.<br>\r\n   \"A Sheep Farm you say. Hmm... Where is this place?\" He asked, looking extremely hungry. After the fox had told him, the wolf insisted that they go there. The wolf hadn't eaten for a few days, so he was starving.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fox rubbed his paws together gleefully as he plotted in his mind. During his nightly search for enough food to feed himself and his gluttonous wolf \"friend\" he'd found a large storage shed. He stealthily snuck around the premises to assess the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wooden storage shed was larger than the few he'd come across and stood a fair distance away from a similarly large house. Whoever lived here was clearly of good means. He circled around the shed and found that while the front door had a heavy lock on it, there were many smallish windows on the walls of the shed. The fox quietly put his front paws up on the window and peered inside. There was a single lantern hanging from the ceiling illuminating a massive stockpile of foods covering all four walls of the the shed. Covered in sausages and dried meats and ribs and bacon, smoked ham, not to mention overflowing barrels of apples and potatoes and other fruits and vegetables (not that the fox was a fan of those, but waste not want not). Also barrels of wine and water and huge metal jugs of milk. There was more food than the little fox could even comprehend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inspected the window, and while it was closed, it didn't appear to actually be latched. He carefully wiggled a tiny claw under the window and quietly pried it open. The fox couldn't believe his luck! He dimly wondered why none of the other woodland animals knew about this place, but quickly forgot about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox was entranced and salivating at the sights and smells of the huge bounty set before him, but he had to snap out of it and think of how best to take advantage of the situation. Always in the back of his mind he associated food with his mooching wolf pal, who would always bully the poor fox if he even so much as thought that he had food. All he knew was he had to find a way to turn this situation into a way to get rid of the wolf forever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fox spent several following nights returning to the shed to get a feel for how best to lay his plans. Every night he returned, the windows were never latched. He had also never seen anyone go out there at night. But every time he returned there was more and more food there, so clearly someone was taking care of the place. He felt reasonably safe returning there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso during this time, he was decidedly unproductive for his wolf friend. Every day the wolf would come by and boisterously demand food and every time the fox claimed he had none. As the days went by, the wolf got hungrier and hungrier, and more and more desperate. The fox knew the wolf would soon be ready for his plan. This had the unfortunate side effect that the large overbearing wolf got angrier and angrier though, and the fox didn't believe he could handle much more abuse. This would be the day he set his plot into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, you damn lazy fox!\" the wolf shouted in his usual gruff voice. The fox yawned innocently and blinked awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good morning Wolf, what a pleasure to see you. What brings you here this fine morning?\" The fox batted his eyes at the wolf, trying to look as innocent as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well why I'm here, Fox! For four whole days you haven't gotten a lick of food for us and I think it's high time you started pulling your weight around here!\" The wolf crossed his arms and glared down at the tiny fox. Fox tried very hard not to roll his eyes at his friends understanding of their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's funny you should mention it my dear friend because I happened to have found the mother-load of all feasts in a storage shed out on the edge of the woods.\" The fox struggled to say it as sweetly as possible without letting a hint of malice soak through. Wolf was already drooling before Fox could finish his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, well, you know how dangerous it can be getting involved with civilized folk and uhh...\" The wolf trailed off, he clearly had thoughts of food dancing through his head. His eyes were glazed and unfocused as his stomach gave out a deep growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry my dear friend.\" Fox said as he walked over and patted his friend's soft gut. \"We'll simply sneak in and out like the wind. And besides, you're a big tough guy who can protect us from any danger, right?\" Wolf eventually snapped out of his food soaked reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'm the biggest and strongest bastard in the whole damn woods and don't you forget it!\" Wolf bopped Fox on the head pretty hard. Fox started to snarl, but decided to take it in stride and bide his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just come here tonight and I'll lead you out to the shed and we'll have ourselves a grand old dinner.\" Fox smiled up at his friend convincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, old pal. I'll stuff myself 'til I explode!\" Wolf slapped Fox on the back hard enough to make him stumble as he practically danced his way out of Fox's den. Fox halfheartedly waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you tonight you gluttonous old fool.\"</span></div></div>",

Wolf clearly looked excited and could hardly stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you ready yet you damn lazy fox! Don't you do anything other than sleep all day!?\" Wolf yelled gruffly at the entrance to Fox's den. Fox stepped out of his home and tried hard to hide his scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prompt as usual, my dear Wolf.\" Fox's sarcasm was completely lost on the wolf.  Wolf merely stared at him and fidgeted nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we going or what? I'm practically starving to death.\" Wolf growled. Fox just sighed and led him out towards the promised farm shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and insult filled journey, Fox and Wolf eventually arrived at the shed just as night fell. Just as every night before the shed appeared abandoned and the windows unlocked. Wolf excitedly jumped from foot to foot as he waited for Fox to pry open the window, a nervous and hungry ball of energy. Fox barely had time to slip through the window before the heavy wolf practically tackled his way into the shed, his sides brushing against the window frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf stood in awe at the bounteous feast set before him and even Fox himself had trouble controlling himself. Eventually they both snapped to their senses and leaped on the nearest delicacy. Fox started to daintily devour a smoked ham with much elation. Wolf on the other hand was gulping down a rope of sausage without hardly chewing. Fox looked over and wondered how the wolf didn't choke as he swallowed large lengths of sausage almost whole. Fox could almost see Wolf's stomach expand as he gorged and Fox quietly smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox wasn't even half way through his ham before Wolf slammed down the last in that line of sausages. Wolf then pulled down a rack of ribs almost as tall as Fox and started savagely tearing into it as though it were a fresh kill. By this point Wolf was taking on a subtle but noticeably round appearance. Wolf was always a bit soft, but underneath a layer of fat Fox could see Wolf's belly subtly growing outward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox swallowed down the last chunk of ham just as Wolf was finishing off his ribs. \"I told you it'd be good, right?\" said Fox. Wolf only panted and nodded, now clearly sporting a pot belly. Fox looked down at his own gut too and noticed it was poking out several inches. Fox was always on the skinny side, especially after Wolf started stealing most of his food, so his growth was a bit more noticeable. Fox absentmindedly rubbed his gut as Wolf pulled down a roast turkey and started tearing huge chunks off and swallowing them whole. Fox looked around and pulled himself out a packet of smoked bacon. He never really got to enjoy the flavor of cooked food. Wolf didn't seem to be taking the time to notice anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf tore of the last hunk of meat from his bird and let out a quiet belch. By now his gut hung almost halfway to the floor and was looking decidedly round. He was starting to look decidedly winded and starting to feel full. He panted for a moment and looked around before pulling out tray of pork chops and started chewing on them. Fox chomped down on the last bit of delicious bacon and took time to appreciate it's rich greasy flavor. He looked over at the wolf and noticed he'd started to slow down to a less manic pace. Fox rubbed his taut swollen gut that now stuck out like he swallowed a football. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox slyly crept over to the window and leapt back out of it. It was decidedly harder to make the jump with his swollen gut, but he still made it out fairly easily. He looked around and noticed no one around and it had now progressed into deep darkness outside. He figured they'd been there about an hour, maybe two. The night was young yet. He leaped back inside and as he landed let out a small burp, his gut not quite appreciative of his acrobatics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck were you doing out there?\" Wolf asked between large bites of pork chop. he'd already managed to polish off four of them and there were still four more remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making sure no one has taken notice of us my dear friend. Now eat up while the eating's good.\" Fox smiled. Wolf seemed to nod slightly as he drifted back to finishing off his pork chops. Fox poked around a little until he noticed another string of sausages. Unlike the wolf though, he took the time to eat them slowly as he watched the wolf stuff his gut ever more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf had slowed down considerably as he slowly plowed through the last of the pork chops. By now Wolf had taken on a decidedly stuffed appearance. His stomach hung down like a large brown furred bowling ball. He had the looked like a very pregnant wolf about to drop a litter of 20 pups. His normally saggy skin was starting to get pulled tight over his swollen gut. As he swallowed the last hunk of dense pork he sat back on his butt and started rubbing his well stuffed belly. It's taut round surface stuck out almost to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Fox, I know this food is great and all but I'm feeling pretty full. Maybe we should  go home for now and come back tomorrow.\" Wolf said. His tongue was lolling out of his mouth as he panted, to full to take deep breaths. Fox swallowed the last of the sausage in his hand and waddled over to the wolf. He eyed the wolf's belly up and down and squeezed and rubbed it as though to test it's fullness. Wolf was too stuffed to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Wolf? I think...</span></div></div>",

Surely we'll be locked out then, right? I'm sure you could fit at least a little more in there.\" Fox softly rubbed the wolf's gut as he spoke reassuringly in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf panted and nodded. \"I suppose you're right, I could go at least a little longer.\" Fox nodded also and stuck a sausage in the wolf's mouth. As wolf slowly chewed on it, Fox pulled out a huge plump roast goose and laid it in front of Wolf. Wolf sighed and dutifully tore into the bird. Fox smiled deviously to himself as he went back to the rest of his sausages and sat down. By now Wolf had slowed down to a more normal pace and Fox and Wolf glutted themselves quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox once again decided this was a good time to test his escape rout. He swallowed the last of his sausage and stood up. He had quite a bit harder time standing up because by this point he was starting to feel pretty stuffed himself. His taut round gut looked like someone had inflated a balloon inside him. He looked back at his belly and noticed it stuck out quite a bit to the sides and hung easily halfway to the ground. He waddled over to the window and jumped up too it but his gut got stuck on the windowsill and he had to pull himself over. He landed outside with a hard thump and sat panting to himself for a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *pant* believe I'm *pant* about done.\" Fox looked around and noticed there was still no sign of anyone around. It was by this point quite dark outside. Fox waited around a bit to enjoy the cool outside air after the hot stuffiness inside the shed. He gathered himself up again and leapt up to the window. Once again his stomach got in the way of a graceful jump and he frantically pulled himself inside, landing hard on his ass again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf was still sitting in front of a now meatless pile of goose bones. His eyes were half closed and he was panting shallowly. His gut had expanded quite a surprising amount and now stuck out noticeably past his knees. Wolf was gingerly rubbing his bulging gut all over and softly moaning to himself when he heard the fox land back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So *pant* what's it look like *groan* out there now?\" Wolf asked over the loud gurgles coming from his well stretched stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still all clear. *pant* We should be good for a while yet.\" Fox said quietly. Wolf half nodded and closed his eyes as he slowly fell backwards and landed on his back with a deep thud. His titanic gut jiggled and wobbled a bit from the impact as wolf laid on the ground with his arms and legs spread eagle. His round belly stuck up almost two feet in the air. It was about as wide too, a big round ovoid of brown fur with a white patch going down the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Fox, *groan* I think I'm really full this time.\" Wolf said with half lidded eyes. Fox stood up and eyed Wolf's belly suspiciously. He walked over and put his pawns upon it and started to squeeze and rub it again. Wolf, only managed to make a weak groan. Sure enough Wolf's pelt was stretched tight over his mammoth sized gut. Fox mused to himself that he could probably curl up and fit inside Wolf's belly. Fox marveled somewhat as to how his belly sharply curved outward, going from below Wolf's relatively slim chest into a huge round testament to nature's propensity for gluttony. Fox circled around Wolf, poking and prodding his belly as he gave out slight groans of protest. Wolf followed Fox with his eyes but could barely find the stamina to lift his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Wolf? I think...</span></div></div>",

He put his ear to the wolf's belly and he could just barely hear the gurgle of liquid entering his gut over the low groans of digestion. Although his stomach didn't grow much larger, it did get much denser as alcohol filled every empty nook in cranny in the wolf's overstuffed gut.

It came on subtly at first but soon enough the wolf started to feel giddy and light headed.

He was becoming numb to the previously overwhelming sense of fullness too, even as his stomach was stretched ever more dangerously full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds became distant and muddled. His eyes drifted upward and he saw the fox standing by his head. He was grinning from ear to ear and rubbing his paws together.

But his plan went south when the owners decided to... go south for vacation time. Meaning that this whole plan was down the drain. So in order to get rid of Wolf, Fox had to think of a new plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if they're not here, then we can stay and help ourselves to some more grub.\" Wolf said feeling peckish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the food he just ate the other night, Wolf still wanted to eat. This then gave Fox a new idea. It may not be as good idea as his first one, but it could work. If Wolf like to stuff himself so much, then all he need to do was give him that. Stuff him to immobility, so he could never follow Fox again. It was a small plan, but it could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. How about we....\" Fox said.</span></div></div>",

I dunno, she's wearing a red hood so we can call her little red riding hood. Hey! if you wanted character depth and history, you should go read a story that doesn't involve the copious overeating of predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as I said the girls name is not important, what is important is the fact that she's alone, and theres someone watching her as she skipped along the path with her basket overflowing with with high calorie goodies. the calm wind blew through the green tree tops and carried various leaves and debris over the dirt path, little red hood giggled as it blew the hair into her face. This same wisp of wind carried her scent to the very sensitive nose of someone quietly watching her. sliding through the trees beside the path, a quiet threat crept just a few paces behind the behooded girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlinking in a bit closer the Ebony white wolf sniffed slowly and quietly at the trace scent of the girl and her goodies. A slick tongue licked the drool off the wolf's long, fanged muzzle. He grinned at the small clearing full of flowers coming up on the path, and quickly worked out a plan...</span></div></div>",

In the wild, it was rare to get any cooked goods, especially not pastries\u2026 so he didn\u2019t want to waste this opportunity! With seemingly no sense of morals, he just hid in the nearby bushes, waiting for the little girl to pass so he can steal those sweet-smelling pastries right out of her hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came close\u2026 he leaped forward with incredible speed, standing up straight before her! She let out a little squeal, covering her mouth, startled. \u201cA-a wolf?\u201d She stuttered, immediately taking in the sight of the massive figure before her. Eventually, her eyes settle on\u2026 his midriff. \u201cOh my, what a big tummy you have\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the better to-\u201d He was about to proudly say his classic line\u2026 only to pause, his eyes opening. \u201cWait!\u201d He looked down with an embarrassed blush, trying to squish his belly down with his paws! It\u2019s not THAT big! It\u2019s just\u2026 well, he has been eating a lot recently\u2026 perhaps it\u2019s gotten a little round\u2026 b-but he\u2019s not fat or anything! \u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s rude to just comment on someone\u2019s weight like that? I should gobble you up for that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled at the little girl, trying to intimidate her\u2026 but she wasn\u2019t even looking up at him! Instead, her eyes were locked on his belly\u2026 and before he knew it, she was moving forward to wrap her little arms around it, happily giving it a hug! \u201cH-hey! What are you doing? Stop that!\u201d He stuttered, his cheeks red with embarrassment as the young girl cuddled up with his big, soft, warm round tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so grumpy? I\u2019m just giving your tummy a hug! It\u2019s so super soft!\u201d She smiled. Meanwhile, the wolf was just a hair\u2019s breadth away from swallowing this annoying little girl in one gulp! Then we\u2019ll see if she likes his belly so much. His intentions were indicated by his loudly rumbling stomach\u2026 but that just seemed to make her giggle. \u201cOh, you must be so hungry, too! Why don\u2019t you have all these sweets?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, looking up at him, resting her chin on his gut as she kept hugging it. Realizing she was serious, the wolf paused, all of his anger deflating. \u201cWait\u2026 what?\u201d He said, his eyes widening a bit as he looked down at the basket she\u2019d been carrying. \u201cYou\u2019re just\u2026 giving me all this food\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm! Think of it as a gift!\u201d She smiled, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf suddenly felt\u2026 a little overwhelmed. Nobody\u2019s ever really treated him this nicely\u2026 \u201cUh\u2026 wow. Nobody\u2019s ever given me a gift befor- mph!\u201d Before he knew it, she had shoved a cupcake into his mouth, and he\u2019d swallowed it whole on reflex! He fell flat on his butt, and couldn\u2019t resist as the girl climbed ontop of his belly somewhat to stuff more pastries right into his gullet, force feeding him by surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat up, Mr Wolf! You\u2019re gonna need a lot of muffins to fill that tummy up!\u201d She giggled as she shoved pastries down the wolf man\u2019s throat. He would resist, but\u2026 these pastries were just the most delicious thing he\u2019d ever tasted! Even tastier than children! He cooed, relaxing immediately at the flavor of all of these pastries disappearing past his lips, delighting him with flavors of all kinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026 ooh\u2026\u201d Soon, he already felt full\u2026 but she just kept feeding him and feeding him, making him feel fuller and fuller! Before he knew it, his belly really was getting just as big and round as she imagined it as, growing into a big, round ball of pudge and fluff as she stuffed as much food as possible in there! Eventually, though, all the pastries was packed away into his big, round gut, and he let out a sigh, his tongue hanging out as he breathed. \u201cAh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go! Wasn\u2019t that just scrumptious?\u201d She smiled, seeming to have had a lot of fun feeding the wolf man all of that food! She slid down, and started to rub that gurgling, digesting tummy all over with her hands, feeling just how squishy it was as all of the food inside sloshed around audibly as she pressed down in various spots with her hands.\u201cI think a nice belly rub should help it go down, hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026 you\u2019re a weird kid\u2026\u201d The wolf panted, strangely content with this whole deal. \u201cBut\u2026 thank you\u2026\u201d He was planning on just stealing the pastries, but for some reason, he was content with how this worked out, too. Especially since it seemed the girl had more ideas in mind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are you still hungry, Mr. Wolfy?\" The little girl asked innocently as she continued to massage the big bad wolf's fluffy paunch. The wolfman let out a satisfied burp as Riding Hood's little hands soothed his sore organ and shifted around the air inside. \"My grandma has lots of goodies for you at her house if you want.\" She had just come back from her grandmother's house, and she was sure the elderly women would be willing to give out more treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big bad wolf gave out a whine of pleasure as his big tummy glorped and sloshed with the sweet stuff. He didn't think he had ever been so well fed in his life! He was so full...but at the same time, he was never one to turn down the prospect of free food. \"Buh...that be great of ya, kiddo...\" He took a deep breath and slowly got back to his feet, his distended stomach audibly bouncing and heaving in front of the little girl, still rubbing it eagerly. \"Lead the way...\" He rolled out in a food-induced daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, alright!\" The little girl gave the wolf's stomach one last tight squeeze, before turning around to skip merrily along the path back to her grandmother's house. She began to hum a little tune, as the wolf stomped behind her as he cradled his heaving stomach. That had to have been one of the best meals he had ever had in his life. If he had eaten the girl, he would have been placated just as well...but, he would not know the whereabouts of where those sweets had come from. He never realized that not thinking gut first would get his gut more to eat~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wold eventually make it to a little house nestled deep into the forest. From the outside, it looked rather serene and traditional, built from some white cedar and whitewashed bricks. Stout windows were placed along the rectangular structure, letting in light and giving the inside a good view of the nice garden the grandmother had. After the little girl had opened up the garden gate so her new friend could come through, he was immediately assaulted with the intense smell of baked goods and candied sweets emanating from the home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrage of good scents on his muzzle elicited a gurgle of hunger from his stomach. The Big Bad Wolf blushed as the little girl he followed and threatened to eat giggled and rested her head on the growling ball of flab. \"Naw, you really are hungry! Don't worry, Wolfy, Gramma loves to cook food for people!\". The white and black wolf went red under his fur. How could he had let himself be talked down like this?! He was big, he was bad, he was...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sucker for a good belly rub, apparently. He didn't want to, but the moment Red Riding Hood touched his stomach again, he let out a happy whine. He couldn't help it, it felt so good! He was almost disappointed to have her leave him to skip up to the door, leaving him to follow her as she rang on the bell. After a few moments, the door opened to reveal a kindly looking old women dressed up in a cooking apron. \"Why, if it isn't Red!\" She smiled, giving the girl a pinch on the cheek. \"What are you doing back so soon? I just sent you off with a basket of treats, don't tell me you ate them already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" The little girl shook her head in enthusiasm. She pointed back to the big Wolfman climbing up the stairs of her porch, making him freeze up on the spot. \"I gave them all to Mr. Wolfy here! But he's still super hungry, do you have any more for him?\". The elderly women gave the nervous canine a knowing smirk, which made him feel...uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm sure I can scrounge up a few treats for your new friend!\" The sweet old lady smiled, pushing Red Riding Hood into her home gently. \"Do you mind if you give us a moment, dear? Gramma would like a little word with...Mr. Wolfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" The little girl smiled, eagerly hopping inside to play with her grandmother's collection of toys in the nursery. The old women smiled as she disappeared into the house, only for her to turn around to face the wolf with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hello there, ma'am.\" The Big Bad Wolf put up a smile as he made his way toward the grandmother, trying to be polite for once. \"It's good to meet-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap, Wolfman.\" The old women made the Wolf stop in his tracks as she spoke. \"Don't think I don't know how this story goes out for a second, hear me? I'm gonna make the educated guess that you were looking for more than just baked goods on that path...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf tried to put up an intimidating front, but it fades a soon as it came under the icy gaze of the experienced women. Defeated, he relented. \"...right\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So, here you are, outside of my house in the forest, where no one would hear me scream if a big, bad wolf would gobble me and my Red up whole.\" The not so kindly old women went on, making the dog in front of her cowering under her speech. \"How do I know you're not going to give in to your more...animal instincts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I don't wanna eat you...\" The Big Bad Wolf sniveled rather pathetically. \"I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want Grandma's baked goods in your tummy and my granddaughter to rub it and use it as a pillow.\" The old women smiled, taking a step towards the black and white wolf. Without warning, she took out a chocolate chip cookie from out of her apron pocket and pooped it into his mouth the flavor melting onto his tastebuds in heaven. \"I figured. But I'm not taking in a stray dog, you hear me? My house, my rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn any regular day, the Big Bad Wolf would let out a terrifying roar and gobble up the old grandmother for disrespecting him like that. But, under threat of not getting to have any more of those delicious, amazing baked goods or have his tummy rubbed...he just nodded sadly, knowing fully well how low he had sunk. This was all so embarrassing. The old women smiled more like when she did with her Red and raised her hand to give the big wolf a rub behind the ears, making him whine. \"Good boy. Wipe your feet on that mat when you come in.\" With that, the grandmother walked back into her house, leaving the black and white dog to follow her in.</span></div></div>",

Licking the remnants of the honey from his lips, the grizzly brown wolf took a moment to shake all the flower from his fur before stepping menacingly towards the kids. \u201cRawr...\u201d he swiped jokingly at the air in front of him, and all the fat little goats scrambled, waddling to whatever hiding place they could reach the fastest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The wolf grinned, looking around at the goats trying to squeeze under the couch, or into an over-sized flower pot, all too round to fit into their hiding places. still grinning he leaned his head back, he straightened the collar on his flannel shirt and tied a handkerchief as a bib. \u201cDinner is served...\u201d He said, licking his lips and pushing out on his suspenders, the elastic bands snapped back against the flannel and he stepped into the cabin, kicking the door shut behind him. He took a moment to look around again, trying to decide where to begin, when a crunching noise from the kitchen caught his full attention.</span></div></div>",

He was reaching for another cookie, when his gaze followed a set of worn denim pants up to a toothy grin. \u201cCookie?\u201d he handed it up towards the wolf, who grabbed the fat little goat by the scruff of his neck and with a *pop* pulled him out of the cookie jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The wolf\u2019s tail wagged at the considerable heft of the squat little goat. There was little hesitation as he wrapped his drooling, sneering lips around the plump little goat. there were muffled shouts coming from the wolf's throat as as the fat goats cheeks entered the wolves. The big brown canine pressed the goats fat bottom onto the counter and pressed down, forcing the kid further in. The wolf\u2019s eyes narrowed and he reached around that tubby belly to grab the goats legs, lifted his head and the goat straight up, and forced him in. all the buttons on the flannel shirt popped and the fat little goat hit his belly like a boulder.</span></div></div>",

Pulling it open the next goat, much fatter than the one in his gut, fell out with a resounding thud which shook the plates and glasses in their cupboards. The little goat also dragged a lot of food out with him, trying to shield himself with a chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The large brown canine smiled at this, Allowing his own prodigious belly to drop, he grabbed the chicken and sneered at the little horned butterball. Taking a menacing step forward he popped the large roasted bird in his maw, and swallowed it down. A heavy gut, covered in a luxurious cream colored fur, bulged out to hit the little goat in the forehead. The goat fell backwards, giving him full view of the lupine monster as he licked his razor sharp teeth and patted his belly with pride. A moment of gloating later, he dipped low and grabbed the plumped kid by his ankle. Rising up he found the kid was heavier than he appeared, so he switched hands and used the counter for leverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fighting gravity every inch from the floor to well above his head, the wolf was thankful it would be on his side on the journey down. At some point the fat little goat manage to grab what appeared to be a birthday cake, and was holding it between himself and the wolf. Of course this meant only one thing, the cake entered the wolf\u2019s jaws, followed by the fattened goat holding it, and the goat only worked to force the cake down to their final destination. the wolf\u2019s jaw did it\u2019s job as expected, opening wider, wider, wider. \u201cUh oh...\u201d the wolf thought, the obese little kids gut had found the widest aperture of the wolf\u2019s jaws, and now it appeared he was stuck. the air in his lungs thinning the wolf started to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Stumbling out of the kitchen and into the living room he was looking for something to help dislodge the little goat, seeing the fireplace poker he stumbled clumsily to grab it. all the while the goat in his maw was busy squirming and trying to get free, just as the wolf was in grasping distance the goat kicked both feet, causing the wolf to fall backwards. Panic hit the wolf as he watched his iron salvation fall away, he stumbled back and fell into the couch. Sitting momentarily the wolf\u2019s life flashed before his eyes, and suddenly with a creek, the couches legs nailed themselves into  the floor. The impact was more than enough, the heavy weight of the goat forced itself down and with a pop, dislocated the wolf's jaw, two paws with gravities assistance finished the job.</span></div></div>",

He wouldn\u2019t have believed it possible, but this \u201clittle\u201d goat was even fatter than the last. grabbing by both ankles this time, the wolf dragged the goat over his squirming belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    the squirming and shivering goat suddenly grew very still as he was lifted, with a grunt from the wolf, into the air above the amoral canines gaping maw. \u201cNOOOO*hnhnhhnhn*OOOOO*hnhnhnhn*OOOOO...\u201d the big fed wolf smirked as he raised and lowered the goat in and out of his mouth, smiling at the drastic change in pitch. \u201c...OOO*hnhnhnhn*\u201d he pulled the tender morsel further in, allowing his dislocated jaw to stretch around it\u2019s own food stuffed gut. this time things went a lot smoother as the bulk of the fat little goat passed his lips and entered his throat, leaving two hooves hanging out of his mouth. At this point his head leveled with a shifting sound, he eyed a cabinet door not even close to shutting, being pulled in again and again, only to open once more.
