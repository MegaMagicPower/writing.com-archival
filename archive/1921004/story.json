            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The auditorium held at least 250, not that I looked up the fire code occupancy, or anything. It was based on memory. In high school, I'd organized a kids \"meet your future\" expo in which every elementary level class from Alma, their teachers, and a portion of our senior class filling seats and stage. That accomplishment was only three... no, four years ago, and no one remembered it but me. Age twenty-two and still in the Colorado town I grew up in. On any other day my own drama would be bugging me, but not today. Today, I had brought someone famous to our mountain town. I felt like an overly excitable, girly teen again, since he was already letting me call him \"Tommo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI liked to think I knew how he'd be received, but unpredictable things happen in people from higher elevations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor me, already, the room felt unsettled, and not in a joyous anticipatory way.  It really felt like we had too many people in this room. When had I started being claustrophobic? I was wondering if I could go backstage and lodge myself in a stage door without setting off an exit alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reached the top of the short flight leading to the wings of the raised stage, I swung a quick left. I bounced off the body of the security chief, Blaine, a tall Australian in a black muscle shirt. He was at least a foot taller than me. I had noticed this when <i>Tommo</i> had first arrived, stepping from the car and moving behind his one-man security detail to enter the auditorium stage door. I'd been at a short distance then, but now I was sure my face had smooshed into Blaine's left pect, below a muscled shoulder as big as my head. Before the recoil could push me hard onto my butt, his arm shot out, trying to cradle my lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another two hands latched around my right forearm. With a sure grip, and a quick tug, I was righted by the guy embracing my arm. Simultaneously, the male mountain I'd just crashed into spoke, as well as the man with a grip on me with whom I was now eye-to-eye and nearly nose-to-nose with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA genuine grin lit up the face of my guest star, Louis Tomlinson. He said to me, \"Oh, hello gorgeous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi little shieler!\" I barely registered Blaine's outcry. \"Sorry -- there ya go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely when we'd Skyped I'd noticed the flecks of gold in Louis' green-hazel eyes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis turned to Blaine and said, \"Good save!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you really caught her though, Mate,\" Blaine replied. I saw Louis go straight-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis said, \"Good thing she's no football. We'd only been able to use our feet to score.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine thought about this a beat. \"Or our heads!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis busted up laughing and nearly took me down to the floor with him as he doubled-over in the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaine, go sit by the stage door, you are dangerous!\" Louis said with a mocking frown. \"I will help Miss Cartenell with whatever had her barreling back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we were standing alone together in a more normal stance. Louis spoke first, \"Were you looking for me, luv?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to seriously think about what I had been doing prior to the unexpected collision. Louis' mention of the stage door brought back my initial intention, but now, I seemed to be less in need of escape. I also wasn't sure I wanted to go near Blaine anytime soon. But what to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to the stage door...to, um, make sure it was secure. There's a lot more girls in this town than I've ever seen, or somethin'!\" In American football, this line would be equivalent to a quarter-ending punt. I fumed nervously in my own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" Louis wheedled. \"Checking on my safety from... what? Twelve-year olds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He was being sassy, right?</i> I questioned this loudly in my head. In the early days of 1D fame, Louis Tomlinson was known for sass. \"Um sure, although I'd think you should watch out for the forty-year-olds too, Mr. Charm-their-pants-off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I never....\" He reacted with mock horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled sincerely and said, \"I doubt it's always conscious.\" And realized I was ardently flirting. I checked myself -- the skin of my cheek felt hot. I wondered if I was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at me a long moment, then made a quick succession of checking the time on his phone, scanning the available space around us, and sidling up close. Finally he chose to reply, \"I'll judge charming as I find it,\" he said. That's when I noticed his big green hazel eyes were keenly locked on my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis pressed his whole left arm across my upper chest, firmly guiding my right shoulder with his open left hand. He swiftly slid me with him, far right, until we were hidden among the folds of a curtain section along the back wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missy, when I'm consciously charming,\" his voice breathy upon using my first name, and then he turned the words directly to my nearest ear, \"I guarantee, it <u>is</u> better.\" He hesitated, even breaths still tickling across my neck and ear. Then he said it: \"You alright with a snog in the dark with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being so blatant with the action of pulling me aside, he was still asking permission? I nodded without reservation -- indeed I was charmed -- and although I tried to also say \"yes,\" the attempt was swallowed up in the immediacy of his kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe touch of his lips on mine was searing, and I lost all thoughts recently relating to my own mildly elevated temperature, nervousness or appearance. I took the moment in fully through my wide open eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis wasn't holding me at all. In fact, he was holding both of his own hands up and away, in an almost surrender signal. Instead of raising concern, it allowed me to make whatever move I chose, and I realized no guy had ever given me the power to make a decisive move like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snaked both of my arms past his armpits and let my hands reach the back of his head. His eyelids closed, he looked so relaxed already. My fingers played at the softest tufts of his smooth brown hair arcing around his ears. I couldn't resist the urge to change the game slightly, and tantalize by stroking the outer curve and lobe of each ear. Then, I massaged his scalp lightly, lovingly, with fingertips and nails grazing. He opened his eyes a bit and his mouth hung open, slack, until he shifted his neck a quarter turn, then he closed his eyes once again, and his mouth curved into a full smile. I wondered, would his next reaction be a purr...or a pounce?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe readily continued melting with the attention. <i>So, a purr</i>, I determined. His arms slowly dropped and took up a relaxed embrace at my waist and hips. When he slid his hands back across each hip, I decided maybe I would be the one to pounce. I allowed one of my arms to smartly take position, and, now, one hand was still in his hair and one was on his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you,\" he broke connection with about half his mouth to hiss out those words; still so close that his words vibrated on my parted lips. But the moment was broken ever so slightly. \"You still need me to meet-n-greet whatever throng of townsfolk you have out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that's true.\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, let's lighten this tea party up,\" he indicated, \"or everyone's going to notice how really tight my pants are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was old enough not to be shocked, yet still naive enough, around all that implied, to let in easily. I didn't want to cause him discomfort or public embarrassment. Inside I already felt that this was all my unanticipated friend with benefits face-to face action was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis looked at me a bit sideways. Then he winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started this off strong,\" Louis tilted his gaze the opposite direction to catch my full attention, then continued. \"Forgive me for getting swept up by a damsel in distress. How about you close up this kiss, so I'm a better judge of what'll come later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm. Later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI studied him in the moment, just a little vulnerable -- noticing how dilated his pupils were in the low light. I let him gaze awhile, while I did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to find a place for my hands. Somewhere less reactive, but still a strong positioning. A message for later. I curled my fingertips through the bracers where they clung at the front of his pants. Uncertain of how securely they fastened, I slipped the other bunch of fingertips into the edge of the pants' right front pocket for better leverage. I made a short tug there, much like the one he used to right me earlier. I didn't have to lean into Louis now, my lips leading, my eyes moving shut. I saw his head tilt in acceptance and his eyes shut closed just before mine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Missy first loosened her grip on the front pocket of Louis' trousers as she heard several heavy footsteps moving in their direction. She wasn't ending this encounter in a fluster, Louis had asked for an indication of her desire to proceed later. A moment longer, keeping it close and in the shadows, gave her the confidence to peel slowly and without regret from their heated kiss. Louis kept a dropped hand nearly touching hers, while shifting heavy bangs from his face with his other. Missy stepped sideways and placed herself next to Louis,and his head turned as he kept his gaze on her. She slipped a pen and small notepad from her coat pocket, and bent her head down a bit to write in the near dark. She hoped it would all look natural to the approaching observer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine was recognizable when he stopped a couple feet from them. Louis smiled and waved in a jaunty but dismissive way, which it appeared Blaine was expecting. Missy checked the time on her phone, and realized the interruption wasn't just curiosity but brought on by actual attention to the scheduled time to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's all we can go over -- it's time to start this interview!\" Missy stated. \"You know your way around the stage well enough,\" Missy mentally punted again.\"I'll be sure the local news cam is ready first, then I'll call you to enter from stage right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stage right, yes,\" Louis said. \"No messing that up -- see you under the hot lights in a minute or two, Miss--\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing several last-minute checks needed to be made, Missy Cartenell was at the front of the auditorium stage very quickly, leaving behind the playful Louis, wondering to herself what was going to happen on stage after what they'd just felt. Everything was ready, she confirmed with a few quick nods to professionals near the front of the room. The energy of others in the room was only just now becoming apparent to her again. People were politely seated but talking loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Alma residents,\" Missy tested out her mic. She caught the eye of the stage-left camera man, and suddenly felt a great wave of relief that she had interviewed so many people in town during her broadcast internship, because this was feeling like a graduation for her. Being recorded for posterity, interviewing, not just a ski enthusiast, but someone known the world over for his talent and association with the One Direction phenomenon created on the British X Factor talent competition in 2010. She felt ready for anything, the energy was high, and she finally realized, the stakes were not, and she had nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Along with the opportunity to let some of our neighbors from the Miner's Knoll Ski Resort remind us what a thrill it is to live in Alma,\" Missy plugged, \"It is my great pleasure to  welcome any out-of-towners at the start of our ski season. I had to think of some way to bring a varied crowd out today, and I hope that my special guest will delight you.\" Missy placed herself in one of two tall chairs stage left, and simultaneously visually confirmed that Louis stood in the wings stage right before she introduced him to the assembled crowd. \"Here he is ladies and gents, a little bit older and a little bit wiser, always the charmer...you know him from One Direction...Mr. Louis Tomlinson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike clicking a light switch on, Louis strode out from the curtained wings with a beaming smile, and all attention on the audience. Although a few older teens hung to the edge of the raised stage, looking up appreciatively, there wasn't any flood of young high-pitched squealing, but Louis did look further out, and saw that a few ladies and one guy, similar in age to Louis, still showed the dedication of holding up handmade signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved you since I was 15, Lou -- never thought you'd make it to my town,\" declared one. Two others were his own name boldly presented with endearing devotion and a matching theme of stripes. The fourth was decorated with silver Christmas tree tinsel all around, and was difficult to read, as furiously as it was being wagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy coaxed him to his seat, and Louis obediently sat, continuing to wave until the noise had settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy started exactly as she'd planned her interview to start, \"It's still <i>like that</i> most anywhere you go, isn't it, Louis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, yes, a few ladies still pining, a lad or two, plenty of offers to get a drink at a club, not so many marriage proposals from eleven-year olds anymore, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith him finishing with the word, <i>afraid</i>, Missy asked her next question: \"Were you afraid when One Direction announced that the 2016 tour dates were the final days of 1D?\" A small chorus of boos came from the back of the auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis got an even bigger smile on his face, tried to play with his response, but sounded nervous in making it, \"Oh, they dinna like you asking that one!\" Louis continued, \"I honestly cannot say I was afraid, it was sad, but all of it such a massively wonderful experience. How could I be afraid in the world after the boys and I had the opportunity to see so much of it? To see how much we are the same across borders and other boundaries. Same dreams. Same troubles.\" He paused, a slight discomfort lingering within him from the sincerity he'd just loosed. \"I just wish everyone could feel a few moments of fame at the level I did for a solid seven years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis posed a question, \"Missy, are you the star in these parts? Being the one-person news team here,\" Louis smiled shyly as he tried to take over the interview and coax the audience into his game. He said softly into the mic, and looking only at her, \"You are, aren't you?\" Missy blushed, but only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy ran with it anyway, ego leading: \"Am I the big star here, folks?\" A mixture of clapping and a whistle or two rose up from the crowd. But Missy raised both hands up and pointed directly over to Louis, and the crowd complied and clapped louder. \"No. I didn't think so.\" Missy threw Tommo an apologetic sideways glance. \"Will you sing something for us, Louis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis was ready to do what he was asked, yet immediately, his heartbeat increased as he thought how much he wanted Liam to start out any song. \"Yes,\" he quietly answered. He promptly strode to center stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked out one of Ed Sheeran's catchy, faster paced songs from the songwriter's most current album, from three years back, rather than a 1D bit. Ed and he had an appreciation mutually for one-man acoustic accomplishment. Three and a half minutes of internal conflict given voice to provide performance pleasure. The muscles in his neck tensed and relaxed at every emotional pitch and valley, and when he reached the final words of the song, he felt the intended emotion, but was able to keep it from choking the vocal. It wasn't until he'd brought the mic down to his side and stepped back to Missy's interview area, that he noticed the sensation of a few hot tears racing to his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy was standing and clapping, having to put her mic down anyway, to keep from jostling it with her applause, she moved forward in one big step and embraced him tightly. The auditorium became like a real concert crowd and held up cameras and continued the clapping Missy had stopped to give him the warm appreciation he deserved.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the moment, the plans were only words and numbers on an itinerary that Louis Tomlinson remembered lay out in plain sight on the hotel suite desk. The afternoon felt like it would last as long as some of the slopes outside the window were steep. A boyish thought of snow angels teased him as the snow outside drifted deeper and deeper, but having given his driver and the security some free-time, he knew staying committed to the room a while longer was the expectation. There was a load of loneliness he admitted silently to himself in this moment. It only saddened him because he knew he shouldn't feel lonely when he'd just made love, and was making eyes with another wonderful lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy shifted under the sheets and smirked at Louis, saying,\"I can barely think, the way you're looking at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Devotion is very distracting, I agree.\" Louis slowly arched his shoulders and stretched his neck from his seated position. \"Or maybe, distraction is very devotional? Which do you think we've been doing?\" He dipped his head down to pillow level and tried to touch his nose to hers, but overshot a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tired?\" Missy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really immensely tired, I hope it's just the altitude here and not something I've caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy smiled gently, \"Is that an accomplishment? I've tired you out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit defeat! The females of the world are the superior model. Only, I can't stop my brain, so I won't actually sleep. So...\" he picked up the guitar that Missy had carried up. It was a tricky way to have the staff not really notice that she had come upstairs but not gone. It was what Harry Styles had named \"the roadie ploy,\" and Louis still employed it from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis watched as Missy shifted to a stomach and elbows vantage point on the bed, the woman had to have grown up in these temperatures to show any interest in his amateur guitar playing in preference to staying under the covers. Louis threw a little smile of regret her way. He picked the strings deliberate and slow, and changed chords only a couple of times. \"I think I learned <i>Little Things</i> an' that's about it. Even so, it was just those few recognizable start up notes -- not the change at the chorus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you didn't spend more time when traveling on tour to learn.\" Missy urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The management really didn't want us to. Niall was the exception, but he already had about five years of guitar lessons on any of us. We had professional backup. They wanted us to be equally bad dancers, you know? -- we practiced that bad dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy ignored his self-torment, bringing up another point, \"And Liam Payne, he really advanced with his natural singing range to be the solo artist he became -- but you always knew he had that in him, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So true. How'd you guess at that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, dear Lou, would struggle at a poker table -- you have a transparent way of showing admiration.\" stated Missy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis gave a little cough. \"Thought my jealousy only came out that clearly for others to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admiration is the other side of that coin, wouldn't you say, sir? All I can say in witness is I never saw you direct any jealous looks Liam's way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just surprising to hear it, because you're the first person to bring it up -- at least since 2010. Because when we were on X Factor there was no question my mate Liam smashed his audition.\" Louis grinned as he said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great to hear that spark in your voice, like it all happened yesterday,\" Missy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We said it in interview after interview, the day we were formed as One Direction was the best day of our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill pride. Louis went completely silent for about ten seconds and he turned his face from Missy toward the sunny window. Missy rolled a little to catch his eye and try to ascertain his mood. Several tears ran fast down the visible cheek. Missy edged to the side of the bed and latched her arms around his neck. He didn't want to take comfort in the bed so he let them both slump off the edge of the mattress to the floor. She hadn't let go, so Louis could only toss his head back quickly and further to one side in an attempt to break the swift flow of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy did what she could, \"Oh! Shush -- shhh. What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High altitude, maybe?\" he offered without a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cheeky liar</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah high altitude breaks people up all the time, and did I mention it's harder to bake a cake?\" Missy nudged and released him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I wanted some dainty cakes with tea.\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy began to feel very selfish -- she could see without his saying anything further or directly, that he was at least homesick. Maybe unusual for a man in his mid-twenties, but he'd sacrificed much of his youthful days being part of an empire. \"Being Louis Tomlinson of One Direction has been hard, I imagine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard, blessed hard, crazy fun, mad...Still makes me smile on a daily basis.\" Louis knew his own truth and spoke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still brings tears at a moment's notice?\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Missy knew what she was doing but still didn't know if it was on the right grounds. \"When we Skyped, I shared my majoring in Public Relations, but my minor was in Psychology -- I probably didn't say that. As public as your life has been in the run of 1D, I can only guess at what is coming up for you. But I am willing to be a true and professional confidant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Louis whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK, you don't have to...I understand....\" Missy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I mean I dunno if I need you to go all professional shrink on me. I'm happy just to have your ear.\" Louis turned and gave her a thumbs-up kind of smile. He reached out tentatively to her face with his fingers. \"Your ear and maybe...this part of your neck near your ear,\" Moving into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a sucker for distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your attention, man, BUT  right now I sense you're deflecting some pain and want to use sex to muffle it. Please let's talk first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Louis was not sure he could do this right, like Missy was suggesting. \"What a selfless person you are, <i>Missy Mia</i>, <i>Signorina Missy</i>, my Miss Missy,\" each time punctuating his words with a kiss. \"Here I am, throwing myself at you, and you worry about my pain? It doesn't feel like the time and place for the long talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn getting to what he wanted, at least when it was physical, Louis Tomlinson stepped easily from a valley of uncertainty to stand confidently, and draw on the kind of power he felt when performing. He felt it start in his feet as he rose from the ground, the muscles in his calves and thighs ready. He shot to a standing, wide stance and threw his shoulders back. If he were a dancer in a Michael Jackson video, his arms would stretch wide as well, and lightening would strike in the background as he transformed further. Despite his mind wandering in that way, he was well-mannered to not slip into the fantasy unaccompanied. Louis reached his arm out at a sharp angle and directly intended to haul Missy from the floor as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy saw through the theatrics, and was not sure what she should do. Walk out? Play along? Which was the healthier solution -- maybe neither choice was ideal? She extended her hand, but tried to monitor how exuberant she'd let herself get. She barely helped, her socks sliding more than either expected, but he hauled her up quite handily anyway. Missy started to converse with logic, her first word giving her away, \"Perhaps...\" and Louis just stared her down as he pulled all of her close in a Tango-worthy grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stubbly shadow along his jawline, and the tougher more established hairs at his chin, raked along her cheek. His lips searched just below her ear, and he exhaled hot breath across it as he moved there. The word he mouthed was \"No,\" but its focus proclaimed <i>\"Yes!\"</i> for both of them. Missy had already spent the early afternoon sequestered in Louis' hotel prison, and their first try had been heavy on use of the shower, followed by furious penetration. It was a bit needy and mechanical. This was looking already to be promising a more involved and desired approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved along, stepping forward and grinding into Louis hips, interestingly having the lead. It only took a few steps to be blocked by the bed, but Louis simply wasn't allowing her to topple him onto the bed surface. So, first she kneeled her right leg on the edge of the bed. With his firm grip around her waist still, she was able to reach back and peel the sock from her left foot, then gained a purchase with that foot's toes at the top of Louis right calf muscle, and forced herself upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis caught his breath, as the move was tantalizing and acrobatic -- managed in such a way that he still kept his stance instead of faltering to the bed. Missy had to bend over his now upturned head just a bit, to blow air kisses down onto his hair, forehead and across his ear, but it also set her breasts in his face. \"Mmmm, foreplay it is!\" And Louis took hold of a nipple between his lips and stroked repeatedly with his tongue. As soon as Missy shifted in delight and made her own first sound of \"Ahhhhh!\" Louis sucked and sucked hard on that same boob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy was smiling, and looking up and across the room more than anything. She wished there was a mirrored wall -- wondering how he looked holding her vaulted like this. She was instead simply facing the doorway and bathroom to the suite. Then she realized there was a knock at the door, a loud, banging knock that was accompanied by a happy voice calling out Louis' name.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He hadn't let the crowd-pleasing people-person dissolve under the forces of celebrity, but he had made some definitive choices. He was an inked man -- he sometimes thought of his band mates as \"linked\" by the ink.\" And in an almost supernatural way, that old feeling was under his skin.

The driven, practical side of me was raging in a dark recess of my mind -- <i>YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING!</i> But I'd be damned, if at age twenty-two, I let the sensible side of me shut down a kiss. Even if this kiss was essentially a challenge; I thought it a fine opening to what could become a great deal more. To break down some barriers and be his interviewer was the practical plan. Getting intimately involved I had not expected, but was willing to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois Lane wouldn't brush off Superman, right? And although that was a fictional basis for rationalization, I began to giggle as I parted lips with Louis -- he looked so much more like a Clark Kent, here and now than the uber man the entertainment world liked to portray him as. He had a suit on even, and yet I was the one to notice his red bracers on under the fine jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that giggle, Louis said, \"even if it does shake my confidence some....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to know right now, but I promise to tell you later,\" I offered, too embarrassed myself to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" he said quickly. \"Later it shall be.\" He shook his bangs a bit, and cuffed my left shoulder like we'd just made a successful play in a soccer match. Now my confidence was somewhat shaken. He must have seen confusion cross my face, because he tilted forward and placed a warm kiss on my right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peck was very close to my ear, and in that same moment a sharp crackle of static and my stage manager's voice came through my wireless earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missy!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several years earlier, I was contracted to work with a musical group, serving in a capacity many probably do not think happens. I was providing group therapy for the band's members. It was a little bit heartbreaking, knowing the vulnerabilities of the individuals making up this band of brothers. The pressure to perform and outperform. Everything that had come to them in their first year of celebrity, and year upon year after. Most presumed that celebrity factor in their young lives was the root problem, but it took little time to see the truth. No matter how grounded they each spoke of being -- it was fear of the \"after,\" discovering who each really was yet to be -- that haunted. Now that after time had an actual start date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the beginning of their fourth year, not long after Zayn Malik officially got engaged to his girlfriend, Perrie Edwards, I was asked to become part of the crew attending to the lot of them. I met up with the official entourage while 1D finished up their 2013 Take Me Home Tour in Australia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam was the natural leader while they were working. When I first formally asked to hold group sessions for their well-being, Liam encouraged a couple of them that were reluctant. So, I was initially surprised that he stayed quite reserved in the first meeting. Soon, I came to see how willing he was to hold back and see to the care of the others before himself. He observed with trustworthy eyes, and rarely spoke over anyone else's statements. In these small ways, he showed a father-like quality, even though he was not the oldest among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, nearly four years later, I was glad, very glad to have this solitary time with him at my own healing arts studio in the mountains of Mescalero, New Mexico. He sought me out. And now, I was admiring the profile of this man while he entrusted me to work with him under hypnosis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiding, always hiding...\" the words were soft-spoken but clear, and I nodded my head in understanding even though my client could not see the gesture. My attentive mannerisms were as much a part of me as counselor, as I imagine the easy smile and helpful gleam in Liam's eyes were indicators to his mates and his fans of his genuineness. I knew more about the private successes and fears of this young man than most. That was a neat trick given how public his late teen and adult life had become as a member of One Direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very honest, Liam. I want you to separate any anxiety you may have attached to the word \"hiding.\" Very intelligent and resourceful people know how to use hiding to their best advantage.\" I jot down a note of reference in my journal. This is old ground we're covering, and I wanted Liam to feel strong and confident when he came out of the hypnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam, picture yourself in a place you command. Some place powerfully beautiful, a place you may feel naturally exposed, but still fully protected.\" Liam began to speak, as if starting an explanation. \"Hmmm -- Just picture it for yourself, hon. No one needs to know where Superman's fortress of solitude is....\" I said quickly, to deflect his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw the slightest curve of a smile, probably from my words targeting his geekiness, and knew it was time to direct him back to full consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Liam, master of all you see, it is time to journey back, let's do the counting back and then we'll debrief a bit if you like. Once we're face-to-face, you can catch me up on your current happenings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
