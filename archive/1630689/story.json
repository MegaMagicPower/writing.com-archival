I really enjoyed living my life until now. I thought about how cool it would be to life another life somewhere else. But then I felt something like a lightning going through my body and I heard a strage voice saying: \"You've been ordered into another dimension. From now on you can choose your life by sleeping.\" When I came back to senses I stood right in front of my house door. \"Creepy\", I thought when I went up to my room.

You stood up carefully, and spotting a full-length mirror, you cautiously walked over to it. There, staring back at you, was a petite, young woman, with very long chestnut hair. As you hefted your breasts, you found it interesting that they felt larger than they looked on the outside. Perhaps the bra and the dress you were wearing held them back? Then you allowed a hand to go under your skirt. It was wonderful to feel a real pussy there! This could be fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped yourself for now. There will be plenty of time to explore your body more later. You looked around, and it was a bit confusing. The room, indeed, the house, was not the one you used to live in. This room was very different. Then something caught your eye. Pictures! As you moved closer, you became concerned. There were pictures of you there, but not alone. In every picture, there was a guy next to you! Worse, one of them was a wedding picture! There you stood, or the girl you now were, in a wedding dress, and a guy in a tux towering over you! You looked at your left hand, and to your dismay, there was a wedding ring! You were married!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard something downstairs, and as quietly as you could, you worked your way down the hall, then down the stairs. You could see a man sitting in what you knew was your living room, and you knew his name was Ed, and that he was your husband!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw you and said, \"Emily! .....\"</span></div></div>",

You had been married for nearly a year now and this woman couldn't be happier. Good job, good husband and this body was youthful. He opened her wallet and saw that she was only 23. Her job was an executive assistant at a top company: a quick search suggested that she was earning about 75000 dollars a year.

Now get in there and make me something to eat!\" Then he added, \"And bring me a beer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories flood your mind. Ed was so nice, such a gentleman... while you were dating. Your mother tried to warn you, but it was no use, you were in love. And even as you were shaking off the shock, you realized that you really did love Ed, even now. You were twenty, and Ed was twenty-five. You had married six months ago, and almost from the start, even on the honeymoon, you began to realize that Ed now regarded you more as his property, not an equal partner. Something inside of you made you rush to get him a beer. As you gave it to him, you felt very small, weak, and vulnerable before this huge male!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you knew where things were, and how to cook. At least, cook as well as a wife of six months can cook. As soon as it was ready, you went into Ed, \"It is ready honey. Would you like to come to the table, or should I bring your meal in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked at the game on TV, \"Shit. Those pussies don't know how to play! I might as well come to the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ed was seated, you served him his meal. You sat there quietly, hoping he would like it. He ate like a pig, but didn't complain. You didn't have time to eat much before Ed pushed the plate away and stood up. He grinned, and you felt a shiver go up your spine as something inside of you knew what was coming. \"Not bad girl. But now I am ready for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to move or avoid his grasp as he roughly pulled you to him. The part of you that was a male was appalled and wanted to pull away, but the frightened girl named Emily knew better, and even though her, well, your, mind was occupied with thoughts of all the work you had to do. Putting away leftovers, dishes, wash, cleaning, there was no question that Ed would not understand. When he wanted your body, he wanted it when he wanted it, and right now, he wanted it! You found yourself returning his kiss, trying to enjoy what foreplay Ed would give you, and hoping that you would get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Ed broke the kiss and picked you up like a feather! He carried you upstairs, and as soon as he put you down, you hurried to undress for him! It was humiliating, but he would literally tear your clothes off if he had to. Ed pulled down his pants and pushed you onto the bed, where you quickly spread you legs for him! You wanted to cry and throw up as you felt his cock penetrate your pussy, but part of you did enjoy it. Of course, just as you began to feel some real pleasure, you felt Ed begin to cum and pump his hot seed inside of you. Damn! Don't you get something good in this life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled out of you, there was a part of your mind that hoped that you would get pregnant this time, or soon. Surely Ed would love you more if he knew you were having his child. Right? You knew that you had to lay there, letting Ed's cum leak from your pussy, because you knew he liked looking at you as he dressed again. Then, without so much as a thank you for either sex or supper, he just turned and left the bedroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to cry, but the woman you had become had worn that option out already. The was beaten, defeated, numb. You couldn't believe that you had just accepted that this was to be your life! You didn't know how, but something was going to change around here! You would find a way to change Ed's view of you!</span></div></div>",

You looked your glasses and went to open the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fresh wind blew inside your room playing with your long brunet hair. It was a great Sunday morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see your room while remembering that strange dream of yours and giggled to yourself. Being a guy had always been a fantasy of yours, but that dream was so real that just by remembering made you felt a little weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed deeply and let it go. You was a girl and there was no way for you to fulfill such a fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked to your closet and changed from your pink pajama to your usual jeans and t-shirt complimented by a pair of snickers. You have always been a little tomboy, but with the time not even your plain wardrobe could hide that you was growing as a good looking girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst part came just after you got down to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Ash.

You jump into your bed again, but you just couldn't return to sleep again. However you stood laying there looking at the emptiness of the ceiling remembering clearly the dream: You were a girl, were you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was awkward, remembering the feeling of being a girl when you have always been a boy. But the weirdest part came from the feeling of have always been a girl. You know who you are, but just now the doubt of not knowing which one of the two were real born inside you. Were you de dream? Or was? Both? Or any?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a headache. It was so complex to think about such a setting that after you don't know how much time, you decided to just let it be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was saturday and you didn't have plans so you decided to try to access your second life again and try to enjoy that Ashley's girl point of view.</span></div></div>",

So you just change the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you having a date today?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stupid,\" She stated a little mad, \"he called me this morning and told me something came up. And while I was coming here I found he was playing soccer! Can you imagine? He planted me for that stupid game!\" She said dramatically jumping to hug you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there,\" you tried to comfort her, \"And I bet you made a scene after you found out, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed you back. \"It wasn't a scene!

You didn't want to go out, but looking at Karen and thinking about your dream, it was the best choice by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing of the mall that you actually like was the arcade, but this visit wasn't a real pass time visit to the mall but a method to cheer up Karen. You were still confused, how did you two became friends? After all, she was the completely opposite of you... just like Kat. And when a voice called you both you remembered: Jenny was the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Jenny called you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny!\" Karen jumped to greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen,\" You just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets go!\" Jenny told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was interesting how you three look in group.

So where were you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a morning training session.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was part of the basketball team and with the beginning of the season so near it wasn't so surprising that the team were training even on Sundays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did you scape?\" You asked curious and thankful that she had done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" She began hesitating of gossiping, but she finally told you. \"It seems that the couch has a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dragon Lady on a date!?\" You laughed. \"That's unexpected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny giggled with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

You sighed again and began taking off your t-shirt and jeans. You sighed at the look of the yellow dress, it wasn't the first time you use a dress, but for some reason you had never got used to it. And just then you look at your reflection at the mirror and something awkward, subtle, but awkward born inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were curious about your body...</span></div></div>",

You knew yourself but it felt as if it was the first time you noticed yourself. Your body was young and smooth, there were little curves that pointed since then to a really good shaped body on the future. You noticed your white but cute underwear and pressed your little breasts with your hands. You sighed. Was that what means to become a woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to take the dress again just to notice the sight of your friends looking at you amused. You got mad and pushed them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got into the yellow dress as fast as possible and got out to finish with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?!\" You said with an angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look cute.\" Told you Jenny making you blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should use something like that more often.\" Karen smiled you turning you even more embarrassed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of that.\" You said turning around running into the dresser to return to your normal clothe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few more until you all finally got out of the store.

You stood up, and, through blurry eyes from sleep you stared into the mirror across the room. You saw yourself, an angel in her prime age 500 years old, her wings almost fully grown, naked as all angels are. Today was an exciting day: It was the first of your flying lessons. Looking into the mirror as you twisted your waist length hair  into a braid that would fit nicely between your wings, you recalled the dream you had been having. So many things in that dream had been foreign to you: from the strange garments covering your body, to the strange thing between your legs, but in the dream, you had seen it as normal. After finishing braiding your hair, you prayed for an hour, and then walked through the cloud wall. For some reason, as you walked through the angel city, you felt a strange feeling, like you were being watched by everyone else on the street, judged for how you looked, but you knew this was impossible: Angels didn't have any concept of jealousy. Where were these dark emotions coming from? Taking a  mental note to pray later for guidance on what you should do about it, you sped up, not wishing to be late for your first flying lesson.   </span></div></div>",

Your probably a G cup tho you might be bigger. And you see your nipples which big, soft and pink and are now hard. You checked out your hight and you shrunk an  entire foot and now your 5,2 feet. You then check your waist and stomach and it was hairless and smooth and you were skinny. Then you looked at your hips and butt. You had really wide  hip to perfectly match your really big breast so you have a perfect beautiful hourglass figure. And your butt was also really big too. \u201cMan I\u2019m just getting the best body today\u201d and then you see you very slim arm and legs. All your muscles were gone. Then you felt the empty space in your Crouch and you looked and see your shaved, cleaned, pale, and virgin vagina. \u201cSo this is what it feels to be a virgin girl\u201d and then you look at your face and you see beautiful yet very cute girl with bright blue eyes and long  platinum blonde hair. You also find out the you don\u2019t have any earrings and your ears have never been  pierced . You let out a sigh of relief. And you hear your cute and gentle voice. You then check your birthday and it\u2019s still tomorrow and you\u2019ll be turning 16. You  decide to continue inspecting your room. It\u2019s  basically the same only with the mirror you guess you must be a tomboy in this life. You look at all your clothes and all you find is mini skirts, yoga pants and very revealing see through tank top. And you see that you don\u2019t have any bras or panties. So are  actually happy  especially for the bra ,you wanted your breasts to be free. You don\u2019t know why you have all these revealing clothes. But  you\u2019re going to be late so you put on the tank top (people can see your nipples through it) and  they barely contain your breasts. And  you put on the mini skirt and you  bend over to pick something up and you see in the mirror that your butt is now on full display. But you decided  you\u2019re going to have to do with it and it  could be fun . And  you finally go  downstairs . And you eat breakfast and  quickly say goodbye to your mother. You then  run to the bus stop and both of your boobs  pops out of your tank top but you  don\u2019t realize it. You then see your best friend since you were little James.  What relationship do you have with him in this life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I didn't know what was going on. When I woke up and looked around, this clearly looked like a girl's room! I saw posters of guys and boy bands. I saw a vanity with makeup! Stuffed animals were on shelve and on my bed. My bed cover was a pink flower pattern. I sat up, wondering if I was a girl! My hands went over my body. I didn't have breasts, and my cock was still there! Okay? But I was dressed in a pink nightie and wearing white panties. When I got up, I saw myself in the mirror but dressed in girl's clothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, my bedroom door opened! I was in shock! There was no way of hiding me standing here in girl clothing! My mom stuck her head in! \"Oh good! I am glad to see that you are up Emma!\" She stepped in, \"I know that Matt is picking you up at 2, but I need your help before you leave. Get dressed and come down stairs so we can have some breakfast and get started!\" Then she left the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stunned! Not only did she see nothing wrong with me, she thought that I was a girl! Or did she? Maybe boys wear girl clothing in this world? Well, either way, I guessed that I would find out in time. For now, I needed to get ready. When I went into the bathroom, I didn't care about what others thought I was, I peed standing up!  I showered using girly shampoo that made my hair smell pretty. When I was all done in the bathroom, I headed back to my room. I realized that I didn't have a comb, so I had to use a hair brush. I looked at the makeup a long time. It seemed to be mine of course, but did I really want to wear it? And if I didn't, would I stand out? Be considered odd? I decided to compromise and wear some, but not much. The funny thing was, I seemed to know what to do, even though I never wore makeup before in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed was different. Of course, all of the clothes were girl's clothing, and to my dismay, a majority of what would cover my lower half seemed to be skirts and dresses. I wasn't ready for that though, even if it was normal in this world, so I picked out some jeans and a top. The jean's were definitely girl cut, and the top was pink, but they seemed to be the least girly things I now owned! I did run into one issue in particular though. When getting some underwear, which of course were all panties, I saw that I had a large selection of bras! I hesitated a long time, but the fact that there were so many told me that it must be something I normally wore every day. I didn't like it, but I opted not to take chances, and with less trouble than I expected, I put one on. The fact that it was easy for me to do, like the makeup, somewhat confirmed that I was right. I normally did wear bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went down stairs, and as soon as we finished breakfast, my mom said, \"Okay honey. You take care of the dishes, and when you are done, clean the upstairs bathroom. You should be done in plenty of time to make yourself pretty for Matt before he comes. I hope it is a good movie that you go to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake myself pretty for a guy!?!? Did I have a boyfriend in this world? Not really being a girl, that could make things awkward for me, of course, again, unless it was normal in this world. This was so confusing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, I did what I considered my 'girl chores', and then took another shower. Cleaning the toilet was yucky! Yucky? Where did that come from? I cleaned up, and brushed my short hair, and for some reason, I went all out with the makeup. If I were taking a girl to the movies, I would expect her to look nice, so I braced myself and picked out a nice skirt and top. Nothing fancy, but much more feminine than I would have liked. I had just finished when the doorbell rang, and sure enough, my mom called up the step that Matt was there. I didn't even know who this guy was yet. For that matter, I didn't know if I was his girlfriend or if this was our first date! Well, there was only one way to find out, I went down the steps.</span></div></div>",

He was as big and strong looking in this world as he was in the one that I came from! And I couldn't help noticing that he had a slight bulge in his crotch, so it didn't seem like he was a girl dressed as a guy. And he was tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess my hesitation came off as shyness because my mom stepped in, \"Now, you understand the rules? She needs to be back by 9pm. No excuses for being late, or the two of you won't have a second date. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little funny to see Matt the bully being put in place by my mom! He answered, \"Yes ma'am.\" A bit sheepishly. Then he looked at me with a smile, \"You look great Emma! Are you ready to go?\" He held out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this was too weird! But I didn't have much choice until I had a better idea of where this life was taking me. I hesitated, then took his hand, \"Ready!\" I tried to sound like I was happy about it. He walked me to a local restaurant, holding my hand the whole time. Something felt like it was changing in me the whole time I was in contact with Matt, but I couldn't figure out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the restaurant, I saw my reflection in the one window and got a bit of a shock. What I saw was....</span></div></div>",

It only took a small glance to see that my chest was more puffy than before! Not really breasts yet. More like a young girl who was just starting to get them, but it was also more than any normal male would have, and more than I had this morning! Now I was really glad that I had worn a bra!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other things too. Here I was with Matt, a guy who I should be hating right now, but I didn't. In fact, I liked his attention, and, well, I was enjoying being with him. Not that he wasn't picking on me, I found that he had a great sense of humor! Before the food came, and after, he seemed to really like holding my hand, and I didn't mind. However, I did notice that the changes in me seemed to happen a little faster when I was in physical contact with him. The feelings didn't go away when he didn't though. By the time we were done eating, I noticed two things. I could now feel the weight of my breasts, which were now undeniable. Also, I felt a tickle on my neck, and sure enough, When I saw my reflection in another window, I could see that my hair had grown much longer than it had been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enjoyed the time with Matt, but now I was getting scared as we walked toward the theater. I was scared because of the thought of what was happening to me, and also because I knew what I would be doing with a girl in the theater on a date, and it wasn't watching the movie! Matt bought our tickets, and I almost thought that Matt seemed as nervous as I felt. Sure enough, Matt led the way to the back row. He only held my hand until the lights went low, an the moment that I was dreading was fast approaching. He let go of my had and put an arm around my shoulder. Soon, he was pulling me close. I knew what he wanted, but I was still a male where it counted. How could I kiss 'another' guy. There was another part of me though. A part that liked what I was feeling. A part that wanted to kiss Matt! What to do!?!?</span></div></div>",

I can't speed in a limousine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Jake? you thought to yourself. Why was your neighbor acting as though you were rich and he served you? Then you remembered what the voice had said. This must be your second life! In this dimension, you were rich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping out of bed with joy, you find your closet filled with the latest fashions. Throwing on the coolest clothes you have ever seen, you run downstairs and find the dining room. Even though you have never been here before, you know exactly how the mansion is set up. Finishing a full-course meal as quickly as a bowl of cereal due to your excitement, you rush out to the limo and your neighbor-turned-servant drives you to the University for your first class. </span></div></div>",

But then I light turns on, in seconds you take in this rooms muted, and faded colors, the walls were a cream tone that matched bedding of a queen sides bed next to your own. The lamp even has faded likes on it. For a second you aren't sure, but the hand working the lamp looks wrinkly and thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact in the queen-sized bed she's a small old woman in a nightgown and hat, her elderly husband, with hair both Gary and missing slowly sits up. <br>\r\n\"Huh? What's wrong dear?\" He asks his wife. <br>\r\n\"Sorry just checking on Jakey. Are you alright sweetheart?\" She asks as she comes out of bed and comes towards you. Confused, all you mutter out is \"okay...\" But she dosen't seem to take your word for it. She pulls back your blankets and you see you are wearing nothing but an old boy's nightgown with strips. She lifts it up though and even your surpised to see yourself wearing a cloth diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this world you are the youngest, if only, son of some very old parents.
